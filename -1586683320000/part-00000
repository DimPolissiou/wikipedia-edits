In most cases, they will have more than one sexually active partner at a given time. They also find it difficult to consider a serious relationship.<ref name=Lee /> \n===Negotiation between participants===\n\nMany casual relationships establish guidelines or a set of rules. The two participants in the relationship will reach an agreement about what each expects from the relationship.

Barnes: The Psychology of Love|year=1988|pages=38\u201367|id= {{ASIN|0300045891|country=uk}}}}</ref> \"Eros\" lovers are lovers that immediately form a close connection. They fall in love with the physical appearance of another before considering other characteristics of the person. This type of lover is also commits to casual sex relationships.<ref name=Lee /> Because physical appearance is the main reason for their attraction, it is difficult for a genuine romantic relationship to form.<ref name=Grello /> \"Ludic\" lovers look for the feeling of a conquest, and typically enter a relationship or [[Hookup cuture|hook-up]] with very little or no intentions of commitment. In most cases, they will have more than one sexually active partner at a given time. They also find it difficult to consider a serious relationship.<ref name=Lee /> \n===Negotiation between participants===\n\nMany casual relationships establish guidelines or a set of rules. The two participants in the relationship will reach an agreement about what each expects from the relationship. Another major concern is that one of the partners will develop romantic feelings for the other.<ref name=Bisson>{{cite journal|last=Bisson|first=Melissa A.|author2=Levine, Timothy R.|title=Negotiating a Friends with Benefits Relationship|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=13 September 2007|volume=38|issue=1|pages=66\u201373|doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9211-2|pmid=17851750}}<!--|accessdate=15 March 2012--></ref>  Communication between the two partners is essential to making this type of relationship work and because the partners in the casual relationship are often friends beforehand, talking to one another is a much simpler task.<ref name=Bisson />\n\n===Relationship maintenance and student concerns===\n\nCasual relationships, being a mix between a friendship and a non-romantic sexual relationship, result in the partners facing many challenges in maintaining a working relationship.  Based on the [[exchange theory]], Hughes witnessed an individual dependency on either partner as the exchange of resources, knowledge, rewards, and costs of items, becomes more and more prominent.<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Mikayla |author2=Morrison, Kelly |author3=Asada, Kelli Jean K. |title=What's love got to do with it?

This may be a one-way street and one partner may not feel this way.<ref name=Hughes /> Any partner that is not fully dependent upon the other typically controls the casual relationship. The dependent partner is more submissive to their dominant partner as they do not want the relationship to end.<ref name=Hughes /> This allows the less dependent partner to be able to fix and maintain the relationship the way he/she wants it to be. They normally control when they meet up, when they have sex, and when they do things together.<ref name=Hughes />\n\n===Disclosure of casual relationship to peers===\n\nHughes's study also revealed the four main categories of why partners participating in a casual relationship did not feel the need to tell their same sex friends about the relationship. The first category was that the partners did not feel that their same sex friends needed to know this information.<ref name=Hughes /> The second category consisted of people wanting to keep the casual relationship a [[secret]] and didn't want their same sex friends to know.<ref name=Hughes /> The feeling of [[embarrassment]] was the third category. Many students said that they would feel ashamed or didn't want to be judged by their same sex friends.<ref name=Hughes /> The final category is students who didn't want to tell their same sex friends because they would show disapproval of the relationship.<ref name=Hughes />\n\n===Motivations===\n\nHughes's study suggests that there were five main [[motivation]]s to why college students wanted to be in a casual relationship.<ref name=Hughes />  The five main motivators are:\n*Relationship avoidance: Students that liked multiple partners at once and wanted to avoid being tied down to one person.<ref name=Hughes />\n*Sexual activity: Students find each other attractive and want to hook-up.<ref name=Hughes />\n*Relationship [[simplicity]]: Students get the benefits of a relationship without all the drama.<ref name=Hughes />\n*Emotional connection: Students miss the [[Intimacy#Intimacy|intimacy]] they used to have with ex relationships and want to experience it again with no strings attached.<ref name=Hughes />\n*Always wanted a casual relationship: Two students that are single and want to take advantage of it together.<ref name=Hughes />\n\n===Gender participation===\n\nA traditional [[stereotype]] of heterosexual casual relationships in college is that the men initiate the sexual activity.<ref name=Paul>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Elizabeth L.|author2=McManus, Brian |author3=Hayes, Allison |title=\"Hookups\": Characteristics and Correlates of College Students' Spontaneous and Anonymous Sexual Experiences|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|date=Feb 2000|volume=37|issue=1|pages=76\u201388|doi=10.1080/00224490009552023}}<!--|accessdate=4 April 2012--></ref> Another stereotype is that men are more sexually active and women link sex with [[Romance (love)|romance]].

On September 15, a combined [[Allied Army of the Orient|force]] of Serbian, French and Greek troops [[Battle of Dobro Pole|attacked]] the Bulgarian-held trenches in Dobro Pole (\"Good Field\"), at the time part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (present day [[North Macedonia]]). The assault and the preceding artillery preparation had devastating effects on Bulgarian morale, eventually leading to mass desertions.\n\nOn September 18, a second Entente formation [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|assaulted]] the Bulgarian positions in the vicinity of [[Lake Doiran]]. Effectively employing machine gun and artillery fire the Bulgarians managed to stall the Allied advance on the Doiran sector. However the collapse of the front at Dobro Pole forced the Bulgarians to withdraw from Doiran. The Allies pursued the German [[11th Army (German Empire)|11th Army]] and the Bulgarian [[First Army (Bulgaria)|1st Army]], while pushing deeper into [[Vardar Macedonia]]. By 29 September, the Allies had captured the former HQ of [[Skopje]], thus endangering the remnants of the 11th Army.\n\nThe parallel development of the anti-monarchist [[Radomir Rebellion]] forced [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] to sign the [[Armistice of Salonica]] and withdraw from the war. The treaty included the full [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] of the 11th Army, bringing the final tally of Bulgarian and German prisoners to 77,000 and granting the Allies 500 artillery pieces. The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational balance of the war against the [[Central Powers]]. The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September, when the ceasefire came into effect.\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:BulgarianPOW-Skra.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian prisoners of war captured at Skra.]]\nThe 28 June 1914, [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of Austro-Hungarian [[heir presumptive]] [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] precipitated [[Austria-Hungary]]'s declaration of war against [[Serbia]]. The conflict quickly attracted the involvement of all major European countries, pitting the [[Central Powers]] against the [[Allies of World War I|Entente coalition]] and starting [[World War I]].{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=36}}{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}}{{sfn|Willmott|2003|pp=11\u201315}}\n\nSerbia was defeated during the autumn 1915 phase of the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I#Course of the Campaign|Serbian Campaign]], prompting France and Britain to transfer troops from the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] to [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]. The [[Macedonian front]] was thus established in an effort to support the remnants of the Serbian army to conquer [[Vardar Macedonia]].{{sfn|Hall|2010|pp=48\u201350}}\n\nOn 17 August 1916, in the [[Struma Offensive]] Bulgaria invaded Greece, easily conquering all Greek territory east of the [[Struma (river)|Struma]], since the Greek Army was ordered not to resist by the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]]. The surrender of territory recently won with difficulty in the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913 was the last straw for many supporters of [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]. With Allied assistance, they launched a coup which secured Thessaloniki and most of Greek Macedonia, causing the [[National Schism]]. In June 1917, the [[Venizelism|Venizelists]] gained full control of the country, immediately declaring war on the Central Powers and joining the [[Allied Army of the Orient]] operating on the Balkan Front. The Greek entry into the war along with the 24 division reinforcements that the Army had received in the spring of the same year had created a strategic advantage for the Entente.{{sfn|Falls|1933|pp=152\u2013184, 208\u2013230, 348\u2013362}}\n\nOn 30 May 1918, the Allies launched an offensive on the heavily fortified [[Skra, Kilkis|Skra]] salient, commencing the [[battle of Skra-di-Legen]]. Utilizing the cover of heavy artillery a Franco-[[Greece|Hellenic]] force made a rapid push into the enemy trenches, conquering Skra and the surrounding system of fortifications. Greek casualties amounted to 434\u2013440 killed in action, 154\u2013164 missing in action and 1,974\u20132,220 wounded, France lost approximately 150 men killed or injured. A total of 1,782 soldiers of the Central Powers became prisoners of war, including a small number of German engineers and artillery specialists that served in Bulgarian units; considerable amounts of military equipment also fell into Entente hands. The plan for a Bulgarian counterattack against Skra remained unfulfilled as the Bulgarian soldiers refused to take part in the operation. Both the Greek and the French press used the opportunity to extol the efforts of the Greek army, favorably influencing the Greek mobilization.{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=89}}{{sfn|Villari|1922|pp=196\u2013198}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=38\u201344}}\n\nThe fall of Skra prompted Bulgarian prime minister [[Vasil Radoslavov]] to resign on 21 June 1918. [[Aleksandar Malinov]] who assumed office immediately afterwards pursued secret negotiations with Britain, offering Bulgaria's exit from the war with the condition that Bulgaria fully retain eastern Macedonia. However, British prime minister [[David Lloyd George]] rejected the proposal, assuring the Greek ambassador in London Ioannis Gennadius, that Britain would not act against Greek interests.{{sfn|Vaidis|1979|pp=258\u2013262}}\n\nIn late July 1918, Bulgarian [[commander-in-chief]] [[Nikola Zhekov]] sent German Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] a message regarding a rumored Entente offensive, and detailed Bulgaria's inability to adequately defend the Vardar portion of the front. Zhekov requested that Germany immediately reinforce the Balkan Front, hinting that Austria-Hungary would also be required to strengthen its positions in Albania. On 17 August, Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once the situation on other front permits it. Hindenburg's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German [[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]] battalion stationed in Macedonia back into Germany.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|p=111}}\n\nThe Bulgarians, using information from escaped prisoners of war, determined that Entente forces would engage in hostile actions west of lake [[Ohrid]], in [[Bitola|Monastir]], Dobro Pole or Human. On 27 August, the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions stationed at Dobro Pole were ordered to make emergency preparations, as new evidence indicated a frontal assault on Dobro Pole along with a secondary attack on Human. By 7 September, Dobro Pole was reinforced by one machine gun company, six battalions and ten heavy [[howitzer]]s, the head of [[Army Group Scholtz]] General [[Friedrich von Scholtz]] then stated that the defensive measures made the defense of the front feasible. Scholtz had failed to take into account the departure of Bulgarian chief of staff Nikola Zhekov and his subsequent replacement by [[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]]. Widespread [[insubordination]] and [[desertion]]s also plagued the Bulgarian troops who refused to participate in fortification works; poor rations and fatigue contributed to the low morale.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nA day prior to the Entente offensive, General [[Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]] laid out the final plan for the operation. The first phase consisted of a combined Franco-Serbian attack on the positions of the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions, which was expected to create a breach of the front line in the area of Dobro Pole, while also posing a danger to the Bulgarian supply lines on river [[Vardar]]. The {{convert|1,875|m|adj=on}} Dobro Pole (\"Good Field\") peak dominated the region, providing excellent observation points for the defenders. Dobro Pole was surrounded by a well-developed system of trenches which, in combination with the rough terrain, made the area impassable for wheeled transport. Dobro Pole was, however, lower and less steep than the mountains on other parts of the front that averaged {{convert|2,000|m}}.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=7\u20138, 89, 112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=129}}\n\nA second Anglo-Franco-Hellenic force would then attack the Bulgarian [[First Army (Bulgaria)|1st Army]] between the Vardar river and [[Lake Doiran]], preventing it from forming new defensive positions in the area. The initial advance would allow the ''[[Arm\u00e9e d'Orient (1915\u201319)|Arm\u00e9e d'Orient]]'' to progress in support of other units first to [[Prilep]], Disma and Borran. In the meantime, an Anglo-Hellenic force would strike Mount [[Belasica]], occupying the [[Rupel Pass]]. The Doiran sector had previously been subject to two major Entente offensives known as the [[Battle of Doiran (1916)|First Battle of Doiran]] (August 1916) and [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|Second Battle of Doiran]] (April\u2013May 1917). Both engagements ended in decisive Bulgarian victories, forcing the Allies to limit their operations to small raids and harassing fire. Between 1916 and July 1918, Bulgarian defenses around Doiran underwent a period of considerable reorganization under the personal supervision of General [[Vladimir Vazov]]. The sector was divided into two {{convert|14|km|adj=on}} defensive areas, protected by the [[Bulgarian Mountain Division|Mountain Division]] and the 9th Infantry Division respectively. Bulgaria established combat security outposts at a distance of {{convert|2|km}} from the enemy trenches, while also reinforcing the defenses of the dominant Dub and Kala Tepe mountains. Similarly to Dobro Pole the defenses consisted of a series of mutually supporting trenches, with built in observation posts, machine gun positions and artillery pieces.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=129}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA563176|title=The Significance of the Bulgarian Senior Military Leadership in World War I: A Comparative Study of the Bulgarian Army Operations at Dobro Pole and Doiran in 1918|work=Master of Military Art and Science Thesis|author=Ivaylo S.

Their aircraft also bombed enemy positions and strafed a 250-truck column moving towards [[Kozjak (Prilep)|Kozjak]]. On the same day, Scholtz sent Hindenburg a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] stating that {{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=114\u2013115}}\n\n{{quote|... all indications point out that an enemy offensive will target the 11th Army on both sides of Vardar as well as Dobro Pole....{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|p=125}}}}\n\nThe Bulgarian high command did not attempt to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the necessary vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian ''[[esprit de corps]]''. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco-Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the [[barbed wire]] entanglements separating the trenches.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=114\u2013115}}\n\nAt 5:30&nbsp;a.m. on 15 September, the French 122nd and 17th (Colonial) Divisions struck Sokol, Dobro Pole, Kravitski Kamene and Kravitsa while the Serbian Shumadia Division assaulted Kamene and Veternik. The Greek [[Archipelago Division]], [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Division]] and [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Division]] under [[Panagiotis Gargalidis]] acted as a link between the Serbian and French troops without entering combat. The offensive immediately caused a wave of mass desertion among the Bulgarian units; the remaining infantrymen and artillery squadrons were not able to hold their ground. During the course of the battle, the 122nd Division broke into two columns and suffered heavy casualties. The left column managed to reach a position located {{convert|50|m}} from Sokol at 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and take the peak at the end of the day. At 16:00&nbsp;p.m., the right column captured Dobro Pole after rushing a {{convert|200|m|adj=on}} segment of steep terrain. The 17th Division seized Kravitsa at 7:00&nbsp;a.m., suppressing the last signs of resistance.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=114\u2013115, 125, 117}}{{sfn|Hall|2010|p=130}}{{sfn|Korsun|1939|p=98}}\n\nTwo Franco-Greek Regiments attempted to storm [[Voreino|Zborsko]] but were pushed back in the ensuing counterattack, as powerful pockets of resistance between the Sousnitsa and Bigrut streams facilitated its defense. Greek units then focused on Sousnitsa the fall of which created an opening in the Bulgarian [[Rear (military)|rear]] and put the surrounding units to flight. Using dispersed bluffs as cover, soldiers of the Shumadia Division took over Veternik, Kamene and the western part of a nearby mountain range with considerable difficulty. Elements of the same unit successfully flanked Kravitski Kamene while the 17th Division was engaging in a frontal assault. At 16:00&nbsp;p.m., the Serbian [[First Army (Serbia)|1st Army]]'s thrust on Sokol failed to produce intended results. An attack later that night did secure the peak. The two French divisions were then ordered to remain in position while the Serbian Timok and Yugoslav Divisions moved forward. By the end of the day, Bulgaria lost approximately 40\u201350 percent of the 12,000 soldiers involved in the battle, including 3,000 [[prisoners of war]], 2,689 dead and 50 out of the initial 158 artillery pieces.

They were joined by the 35th Greek Regiment which crossed the Poroi river and later marching on Topolets. At 11:00&nbsp;a.m., Franco-Hellenic units stormed Zborsko for a second time and were met by heavy artillery and machine gun fire. The attack was rebuffed with the loss of 158 Greeks and roughly the same number of French lives and attempts to take the area were suspended. [[\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]]'s 1st Army and the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Orient'' performed a night attack on the [[Grade\u0161nica]] fortified zone, suppressing the defenders. The 1st Division Group moved into a position on the Poroi river north of Brahovo in conjunction with the Timok Division. By the night of 16 September, the gap in what formerly constituted the front-line had extended to {{convert|25|km}} in width and {{convert|7|km}} in depth. The Allied command ordered its air department to continue attacking all bridges on the river Vardar.{{sfn|Korsun|1939|p=98}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=118\u2013119, 120\u2013122}}\n\nAt 4.00 a.m. on 17 September, Hellenic components of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap, a key position housing Bulgarian artillery. The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the cliffs of Preslap with their bare hands. The Preslap garrison proceeded to abandon their positions and retreat eastwards. Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav Divisions overran Koutskov Kamene. At the same time, the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Grade\u0161nica along with the Poltsista and Besistsa peaks, then halted at Melinitsa.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=122\u2013123}}{{sfn|Villari|1922|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\nOn 18 September, the 11th French Colonial Division and the 6th Greek Regiment occupied the villages of [[Zovi\u1e31|Zovik]], [[Staravina]] and {{illm|Cebren, North Macedonia|lt=Cebren|mk|\u0427\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d}}, approaching towards the {{illm|Cebren Monastery|mk|\u0427\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440}} bridge on Crna.

On the night of 17\u201318 September, Bulgarian positions were targeted by nine [[salvo]]s of [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas shells]], however the attack failed to produce any considerable effect due to the preceding arrival of new gas masks and the adequate training of the defenders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA563176|title=The Significance of the Bulgarian Senior Military Leadership in World War I: A Comparative Study of the Bulgarian Army Operations at Dobro Pole and Doiran in 1918|work=Master of Military Art and Science Thesis|author=Ivaylo S.

Following five hours of intense fighting the Allies managed to overrun the town of [[Dojran]], mount Kala Tepe and Teton Hill, with the Pip Ridge and mount Dub remaining in Bulgarian hands. In the aftermath of the engagement the Allied command found itself to be unable to make any further offensive operations on the Doiran sector as it no longer possessed an adequate reserve of manpower. Bulgaria lost a total of 518 dead, 998 wounded, and 1,210 captured.

On 21 September, the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series of fires and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions, a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately. The Serbian advanced guard approached [[Krivolak]], thus creating a wedge between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards [[Albania]]. The [[Second Army (Bulgaria)|2nd Bulgarian Army]] headed towards the [[Kosturino, North Macedonia|Kosturino Pass]] avoiding direct engagement with the Allies.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=124\u2013125}}{{sfn|Villari|1922|pp=233\u2013235}}{{sfn|Korsun|1939|pp=100\u2013104}}\n\nAt 17:30&nbsp;p.m. on 22 September, the Italian 35th Division under General [[Ernesto Mombelli]] joined the offensive, seizing Hill 1050 stronghold from the [[302nd Division (German Empire)|302nd German Division]] and taking 150 prisoners. Fighting took place in [[Kanatlarci]] and along the Monastir\u2013Prilep road, in Cepik, Kalabak and [[Topol\u010dani]] as the Allies continued to advance towards Prilep. At 14:00&nbsp;p.m. on 23 September, General Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey announced that the initial plan of the operation was to be modified. The Italians were ordered to strike [[Ki\u010devo]] with the aim of preventing the enemy forces stationed at Monastir from reaching the railroad hub in [[Skopje|Uskub]], the [[11th Colonial Infantry Division (France)|11th Colonial French Division]] was instead tasked with securing Prilep.\nHalf an hour later the French entered Prilep, to the east Franco\u2013Serbian columns marched on \u0160tip, [[Veles (city)|Veles]], [[Makedonski Brod|Brod]] and through the Peristeri mountain range.{{sfn|Villari|1922|pp=235\u2013238}}{{sfn|Korsun|1939|pp=100\u2013104}}\n\nOn 24 September, Bulgarian infantry supported by artillery halted the advance of the Italian cavalry between [[Kru\u0161evo]] and the Buchin bridge. At 17:00&nbsp;p.m., an Italo\u2013Serbian assault resulted in the fall of Stepanci. On 25 September, the Sicilia Brigade captured Kru\u0161evo and the surrounding peaks after being reinforced by the 11th Colonial French Division. The [[Central Powers|Quadruple Alliance]] High Command set Uskub as the rallying point for its forces in Vardar Macedonia, intending to later strengthen them with units from Germany and Austria. The 30th and 156th French Divisions occupied Prevaletz and Drvenik respectively. On 25 September, a band of Bulgarian deserters who had previously fled from Dobro Pole arrived at [[Kyustendil]], looting the city and putting the Bulgarian High Command to flight. The mass of retreating Bulgarian mutineers then converged on the railway center of [[Radomir (town)|Radomir]] in Bulgaria, just {{convert|48|km} from the capital city of Sofia. On the evening of 26 September, Italian cavalry wrestled Goloznica from a Saxon infantry unit, later entering Drenovo where it received information of a Bulgarian withdrawal from Veles. On 27 September, the leaders of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] took control of these troops and proclaimed the establishment of the Bulgarian Republic. About {{nowrap|4,000\u20135,000}} rebellious troops threatened Sofia the following day, in what came to be known the [[Radomir Rebellion]].{{sfn|Falls|1935|pp=246\u2013253}}{{sfn|Korsun|1939|pp=100\u2013108}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=124\u2013125}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA563176|title=The Significance of the Bulgarian Senior Military Leadership in World War I: A Comparative Study of the Bulgarian Army Operations at Dobro Pole and Doiran in 1918|work=Master of Military Art and Science Thesis|author=Ivaylo S.

Uskub was protected by a garrison of six and a half battalions, four [[Armoured train|armored trains]] and four artillery batteries split between a mountain range south of the city and a position north of lake Kaplan. Between 27\u201328 September, the 1st and 4th French Colonial Regiments made their way through Drachevo and Pagaruza, successfully bypassing any sentries located in the {{convert|20|km|adj=on}} gap between the two Bulgarian formations that protected Uskub. At 4:00&nbsp;a.m. on 29 September, French General {{illm|Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9on Jouinot-Gambetta|lt=Jouinot-Gambetta|fr|Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9on Jouinot-Gambetta}} laid out the plan for the final stage of the offensive, the attack on Uskub. The assault was launched an hour later, French [[spahi]] utilized thick fog to advance on mount Vodna, however they were forced to regroup after facing heavy resistance. A pincer movement by the 1st Colonial Regiment created a bridgehead at river Vardar, while the 4th Colonial Regiment seized Lisici village. At 9:00&nbsp;a.m., the spahis overtook Vodna, later shifting their attention towards the Kalkandelen road. The 1st Colonial Regiment joined the spahis, opening machine gun fire on the retreating [[61st Corps (German Empire)|61st German Corps]] and causing numerous casualties. At 11:00&nbsp;a.m., the French entered Uskub, detaining 220 Bulgarian and 139 German soldiers, while also seizing 5 guns and large amounts of ordnance.{{sfn|Korsun|1939|pp=100\u2013104}}{{sfn|Villari|1922|pp=238\u2013241}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Francuski Grobista Skopje (20).JPG|thumb|French military cemetery in Skopje.]]\nUnder those chaotic circumstances a Bulgarian delegation arrived in Thessaloniki to ask for an armistice. On 29 September, the Bulgarians were granted the [[Armistice of Salonica]] by General d'Esperey. The Bulgarian downfall turned the strategic and operational balance of the war against the Central Powers. The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September, when the ceasefire came into effect. The treaty included the full [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] of the 11th German Army, bringing the final tally of German and Bulgarian prisoners to 77,000 and granting the Allies 500 artillery pieces. The Radomir Rebellion was put down, by Bulgarian forces, as of the 2 October, while Tsar [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] abdicated and went into exile the following day.{{sfn|Falls|1935|pp=246\u2013253}}{{sfn|Korsun|1939|pp=105\u2013108}}{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=491}}\n\nNew balance was best described by German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] in his telegram to [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand I]]: \u201cDisgraceful! 62,000 Serbs decided the war!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://militaryhistorynow.com/2017/09/21/knock-out-blow-at-dobro-polje-six-facts-about-the-obscure-battle-that-ended-ww1/|title=The Battle of Dobro Polje \u2013 The Forgotten Balkan Skirmish That Ended WW1 {{!}} Militaryhistorynow.com|last=Editor|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historycollection.co/ten-facts-battle-dobro-polje-battle-led-allied-victory-world-war/9/|title=The Germans Could no Longer Keep up the Fight {{!}} historycollection.co|last=Editor|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>.

The British Army neared Constantinople and, without a force capable to stopping the advance, the Ottoman government asked for an armistice (the [[Armistice of Mudros]]) on 26 October. In Serbia, \"Desperate Frankie\" (as the British nicknamed d'Esperey) continued to advance and the Serbo-French Army [[Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|re-captured]] the country, overrunning several weak German divisions that tried to block its push near [[Ni\u0161]]. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary was forced to sign an [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|armistice]] on the Italian Front ending the war there. On 10 November, d'Esperey's army crossed the [[Danube]] river and was poised to enter the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] heartland. At the request of the French general, Count [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]], leading the Hungarian government, came to Belgrade and signed another armistice.{{sfn|Falls|1935|pp=254\u2013279}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|North Macedonia|Bulgaria|Serbia|Greece|World War I}}\n* [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]\n* [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]\n\n==Notes==\n;Footnotes\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book|ref={{harvid|Albertini|1953}}\n|last=Albertini|first=Luigi|authorlink=Luigi Albertini|title=Origins of the War of 1914|volume=II|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1953|oclc=168712}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first=Kristian|last=Coates Ulrichsen|title=The First World War in the Middle East|publisher=Hurst|location=London|year=2014|isbn=978-1849042741}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Doughty|2005}}|title=Pyrrhic Victory: French Strategy and Operations in the Great War |last=Doughty |first=R.

On September 15, a combined [[Allied Army of the Orient|force]] of Serbian, French and Greek troops [[Battle of Dobro Pole|attacked]] the Bulgarian-held trenches in Dobro Pole (\"Good Field\"), at the time part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (present day [[North Macedonia]]). The assault and the preceding artillery preparation had devastating effects on Bulgarian morale, eventually leading to mass desertions.\n\nOn September 18, a second Entente formation [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|assaulted]] the Bulgarian positions in the vicinity of [[Lake Doiran]]. Effectively employing machine gun and artillery fire the Bulgarians managed to stall the Allied advance on the Doiran sector.

The [[Macedonian front]] was thus established in an effort to support the remnants of the Serbian army to conquer [[Vardar Macedonia]].{{sfn|Hall|2010|pp=48\u201350}}\n\nOn 17 August 1916, in the [[Struma Offensive]] Bulgaria invaded Greece, easily conquering all Greek territory east of the [[Struma (river)|Struma]], since the Greek Army was ordered not to resist by the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]]. The surrender of territory recently won with difficulty in the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913 was the last straw for many supporters of [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]. With Allied assistance, they launched a coup which secured Thessaloniki and most of Greek Macedonia, causing the [[National Schism]]. In June 1917, the [[Venizelism|Venizelists]] gained full control of the country, immediately declaring war on the Central Powers and joining the [[Allied Army of the Orient]] operating on the Balkan Front. The Greek entry into the war along with the 24 division reinforcements that the Army had received in the spring of the same year had created a strategic advantage for the Entente.{{sfn|Falls|1933|pp=152\u2013184, 208\u2013230, 348\u2013362}}\n\nOn 30 May 1918, the Allies launched an offensive on the heavily fortified [[Skra, Kilkis|Skra]] salient, commencing the [[battle of Skra-di-Legen]]. Utilizing the cover of heavy artillery a Franco-[[Greece|Hellenic]] force made a rapid push into the enemy trenches, conquering Skra and the surrounding system of fortifications. Greek casualties amounted to 434\u2013440 killed in action, 154\u2013164 missing in action and 1,974\u20132,220 wounded, France lost approximately 150 men killed or injured. A total of 1,782 soldiers of the Central Powers became prisoners of war, including a small number of German engineers and artillery specialists that served in Bulgarian units; considerable amounts of military equipment also fell into Entente hands. The plan for a Bulgarian counterattack against Skra remained unfulfilled as the Bulgarian soldiers refused to take part in the operation. Both the Greek and the French press used the opportunity to extol the efforts of the Greek army, favorably influencing the Greek mobilization.{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=89}}{{sfn|Villari|1922|pp=196\u2013198}}{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=38\u201344}}\n\nThe fall of Skra prompted Bulgarian prime minister [[Vasil Radoslavov]] to resign on 21 June 1918. [[Aleksandar Malinov]] who assumed office immediately afterwards pursued secret negotiations with Britain, offering Bulgaria's exit from the war with the condition that Bulgaria fully retain eastern Macedonia. However, British prime minister [[David Lloyd George]] rejected the proposal, assuring the Greek ambassador in London Ioannis Gennadius, that Britain would not act against Greek interests.{{sfn|Vaidis|1979|pp=258\u2013262}}\n\nIn late July 1918, Bulgarian [[commander-in-chief]] [[Nikola Zhekov]] sent German Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] a message regarding a rumored Entente offensive, and detailed Bulgaria's inability to adequately defend the Vardar portion of the front. Zhekov requested that Germany immediately reinforce the Balkan Front, hinting that Austria-Hungary would also be required to strengthen its positions in Albania. On 17 August, Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once the situation on other front permits it. Hindenburg's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German [[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]] battalion stationed in Macedonia back into Germany.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|p=111}}\n\nThe Bulgarians, using information from escaped prisoners of war, determined that Entente forces would engage in hostile actions west of lake [[Ohrid]], in [[Bitola|Monastir]], Dobro Pole or Human. On 27 August, the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions stationed at Dobro Pole were ordered to make emergency preparations, as new evidence indicated a frontal assault on Dobro Pole along with a secondary attack on Human. By 7 September, Dobro Pole was reinforced by one machine gun company, six battalions and ten heavy [[howitzer]]s, the head of [[Army Group Scholtz]] General [[Friedrich von Scholtz]] then stated that the defensive measures made the defense of the front feasible. Scholtz had failed to take into account the departure of Bulgarian chief of staff Nikola Zhekov and his subsequent replacement by [[Georgi Todorov (general)|Georgi Todorov]]. Widespread [[insubordination]] and [[desertion]]s also plagued the Bulgarian troops who refused to participate in fortification works; poor rations and fatigue contributed to the low morale.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nA day prior to the Entente offensive, General [[Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]] laid out the final plan for the operation. The first phase consisted of a combined Franco-Serbian attack on the positions of the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions, which was expected to create a breach of the front line in the area of Dobro Pole, while also posing a danger to the Bulgarian supply lines on river [[Vardar]]. \u03a4he {{convert|1,875|m}} Dobro Pole (\"Good Field\") peak dominated the region, providing excellent observation points for the defenders. Dobro Pole was surrounded by a well-developed system of trenches which, in combination with the rough terrain, made the area impassable for wheeled transport. Dobro Pole was, however, lower and less steep than the mountains on other parts of the front that averaged {{convert|2,000|m}}.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=7\u20138, 89, 112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=129}}\n\nA second Anglo-Franco-Hellenic force would then attack the Bulgarian [[First Army (Bulgaria)|1st Army]] between the Vardar river and [[Lake Doiran]], preventing it from forming new defensive positions in the area. The initial advance would allow the ''[[Arm\u00e9e d'Orient (1915\u201319)|Arm\u00e9e d'Orient]]'' to progress in support of other units first to [[Prilep]], Disma and Borran. In the meantime, an Anglo-Hellenic force would strike Mount [[Belasica]], occupying the [[Rupel Pass]]. The Doiran sector had previously been subject to two major Entente offensives known as the [[Battle of Doiran (1916)|First Battle of Doiran]] (August 1916) and [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|Second Battle of Doiran]] (April\u2013May 1917). Both engagements ended in decisive Bulgarian victories, forcing the Allies to limit their operations to small raids and harassing fire. Between 1916 and July 1918, Bulgarian defenses around Doiran underwent a period of considerable reorganization under the personal supervision of General [[Vladimir Vazov]]. The sector was divided into two {{convert|14|km}} defensive areas, protected by the [[Bulgarian Mountain Division|Mountain Division]] and the 9th Infantry Division respectively. Bulgaria established combat security outposts at a distance of {{convert|2|km}} from the enemy trenches, while also reinforcing the defenses of the dominant Dub and Kala Tepe mountains. Similarly to Dobro Pole the defenses consisted of a series of mutually supporting trenches, with built in observation posts, machine gun positions and artillery pieces.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|Geramanis|1980|p=129}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA563176|title=The Significance of the Bulgarian Senior Military Leadership in World War I: A Comparative Study of the Bulgarian Army Operations at Dobro Pole and Doiran in 1918|work=Master of Military Art and Science Thesis|author=Ivaylo S.

Their aircraft also bombed enemy positions and strafed a 250-truck column moving towards [[Kozjak (Prilep)|Kozjak]]. On the same day, Scholtz sent Hindenburg a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] stating that {{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=114\u2013115}}\n\n{{quote|... all indications point out that an enemy offensive will target the 11th Army on both sides of Vardar as well as Dobro Pole....{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|p=125}}}}\n\nThe Bulgarian high command did not attempt to perform a spoiling attack as they lacked the necessary vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian ''[[esprit de corps]]''. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco-Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the [[barbed wire]] entanglements separating the trenches.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=114\u2013115}}\n\nAt 5:30&nbsp;a.m. on 15 September, the French 122nd and 17th (Colonial) Divisions struck Sokol, Dobro Pole, Kravitski Kamene and Kravitsa while the Serbian Shumadia Division assaulted Kamene and Veternik. The Greek [[Archipelago Division]], [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Division]] and [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Division]] under [[Panagiotis Gargalidis]] acted as a link between the Serbian and French troops without entering combat. The offensive immediately caused a wave of mass desertion among the Bulgarian units; the remaining infantrymen and artillery squadrons were not able to hold their ground. During the course of the battle, the 122nd Division broke into two columns and suffered heavy casualties. The left column managed to reach a position located {{convert|50|m}} from Sokol at 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and take the peak at the end of the day. At 16:00&nbsp;p.m., the right column captured Dobro Pole after rushing a {{convert|200|m}} segment of steep terrain. The 17th Division seized Kravitsa at 7:00&nbsp;a.m., suppressing the last signs of resistance.{{sfn|Omiridis Skylitzes|1961|pp=114\u2013115, 125, 117}}{{sfn|Hall|2010|p=130}}{{sfn|Korsun|1939|p=98}}\n\nTwo Franco-Greek Regiments attempted to storm [[Voreino|Zborsko]] but were pushed back in the ensuing counterattack, as powerful pockets of resistance between the Sousnitsa and Bigrut streams facilitated its defense. Greek units then focused on Sousnitsa the fall of which created an opening in the Bulgarian [[Rear (military)|rear]] and put the surrounding units to flight. Using dispersed bluffs as cover, soldiers of the Shumadia Division took over Veternik, Kamene and the western part of a nearby mountain range with considerable difficulty. Elements of the same unit successfully flanked Kravitski Kamene while the 17th Division was engaging in a frontal assault. At 16:00&nbsp;p.m., the Serbian [[First Army (Serbia)|1st Army]]'s thrust on Sokol failed to produce intended results. An attack later that night did secure the peak. The two French divisions were then ordered to remain in position while the Serbian Timok and Yugoslav Divisions moved forward. By the end of the day, Bulgaria lost approximately 40\u201350 percent of the 12,000 soldiers involved in the battle, including 3,000 [[prisoners of war]], 2,689 dead and 50 out of the initial 158 artillery pieces.

At 11:00&nbsp;a.m., Franco-Hellenic units stormed Zborsko for a second time and were met by heavy artillery and machine gun fire. The attack was rebuffed with the loss of 158 Greeks and roughly the same number of French lives and attempts to take the area were suspended. [[\u017divojin Mi\u0161i\u0107]]'s 1st Army and the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Orient'' performed a night attack on the [[Grade\u0161nica]] fortified zone, suppressing the defenders.

By the night of 16 September, the gap in what formerly constituted the front-line had extended to {{convert|25|km}} in width and {{convert|7|km}} in depth.

Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav Divisions overran Koutskov Kamene.

On 21 September, the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series of fires and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions, a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately. The Serbian advanced guard approached [[Krivolak]], thus creating a wedge between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards [[Albania]].

On 25 September, the Sicilia Brigade captured Kru\u0161evo and the surrounding peaks after being reinforced by the 11th Colonial French Division. The [[Central Powers|Quadruple Alliance]] High Command set Uskub as the rallying point for its forces in Vardar Macedonia, intending to later strengthen them with units from Germany and Austria. The 30th and 156th French Divisions occupied Prevaletz and Drvenik respectively.

The Macedonian Front was brought to an end at noon on 30 September, when the ceasefire came into effect. The treaty included the full [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] of the 11th German Army, bringing the final tally of German and Bulgarian prisoners to 77,000 and granting the Allies 500 artillery pieces. The Radomir Rebellion was put down, by Bulgarian forces, as of the 2 October, while Tsar [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] abdicated and went into exile the following day.{{sfn|Falls|1935|pp=246\u2013253}}{{sfn|Korsun|1939|pp=105\u2013108}}{{sfn|Doughty|2005|p=491}}\n\nNew balance was best described by German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] in his telegram to [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand I]]: \u201cDisgraceful! 62,000 Serbs decided the war!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://militaryhistorynow.com/2017/09/21/knock-out-blow-at-dobro-polje-six-facts-about-the-obscure-battle-that-ended-ww1/|title=The Battle of Dobro Polje \u2013 The Forgotten Balkan Skirmish That Ended WW1 {{!}} Militaryhistorynow.com|last=Editor|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historycollection.co/ten-facts-battle-dobro-polje-battle-led-allied-victory-world-war/9/|title=The Germans Could no Longer Keep up the Fight {{!}} historycollection.co|last=Editor|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>.

The British Army neared Constantinople and, without a force capable to stopping the advance, the Ottoman government asked for an armistice (the [[Armistice of Mudros]]) on 26 October. In Serbia, \"Desperate Frankie\" (as the British nicknamed d'Esperey) continued to advance and the Serbo-French Army [[Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|re-captured]] the country, overrunning several weak German divisions that tried to block its push near [[Ni\u0161]]. On 3 November, Austria-Hungary was forced to sign an [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|armistice]] on the Italian Front ending the war there. On 10 November, d'Esperey's army crossed the [[Danube]] river and was poised to enter the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] heartland. At the request of the French general, Count [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]], leading the Hungarian government, came to Belgrade and signed another armistice.{{sfn|Falls|1935|pp=254\u2013279}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|North Macedonia|Bulgaria|Serbia|Greece|World War I}}\n* [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]\n* [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]\n\n==Notes==\n;Footnotes\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book|ref={{harvid|Albertini|1953}}\n|last=Albertini|first=Luigi|authorlink=Luigi Albertini|title=Origins of the War of 1914|volume=II|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1953|oclc=168712}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first=Kristian|last=Coates Ulrichsen|title=The First World War in the Middle East|publisher=Hurst|location=London|year=2014|isbn=978-1849042741}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Doughty|2005}}|title=Pyrrhic Victory: French Strategy and Operations in the Great War |last=Doughty |first=R.
