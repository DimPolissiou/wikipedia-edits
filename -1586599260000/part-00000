Oftentimes, the music is produced and owned by production [[music libraries]].\n\n==Background==\nUnlike popular and classical music publishers, who typically own less than 50 percent of the [[copyright]] in a composition, production music libraries own all of the copyrights of their music. Thus, it can be licensed without the composer's permission, as is necessary in licensing music from normal publishers. This is because virtually all music created for music libraries is done on a [[work for hire]] basis. Production music is a convenient solution for media producers&mdash;they can be assured that they will be able to license any piece of music in the library at a reasonable rate, whereas a specially-commissioned work could be prohibitively expensive. Similarly, licensing a well-known piece of popular music could cost anywhere from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the prominence of the performer(s).\n\nProduction music libraries typically offer a broad range of musical styles and genres, enabling producers and editors to find what they need in the same library. Music libraries vary in size from a few hundred tracks up to many thousands. The first production music library was set up by [[De Wolfe Music]] in 1927 with the advent of sound in film. The company originally scored music for use in silent film.<ref>{{cite book|title=De Wolfe Millennium Catalogue|last=De Wolfe|first=Warren|year=1988|publisher=De Wolfe Music|location=London}}</ref>\n\nProduction music is frequently used as theme and/or background music in radio, film and television. Well-known examples of British TV series whose themes were sourced from library catalogues include ''[[Ski Sunday]]'' (\"Pop Looks Bach\" by Sam Fonteyn), ''[[Dave Allen At Large]]'' (\"Studio 69\" by [[Alan Hawkshaw]]), ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' (\"Approaching Menace\" by [[Neil Richardson (composer)|Neil Richardson]]), the original theme for the BBC's ''[[Grandstand (BBC)|Grandstand]]'' (\"News Scoop\" by Len Stevens), ''[[Crimewatch]]'' (\"Rescue Helicopter\" by [[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron]]) and ''[[Grange Hill]]'' (\"Chicken Man\" by Alan Hawkshaw). The Christmas hit single based off the character [[Mr Blobby]] uses excerpts from \"Mr Jellybun\" by Paul Shaw and David Rogers. [[Arthur Wood (composer)|Arthur Wood]]'s \"[[Barwick Green]]\", written in 1924, still serves as the theme for long-running BBC Radio soap ''[[The Archers]]''. TV comedy series such as ''[[The Benny Hill Show]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' also made extensive use of production library cues (many sourced from the De Wolfe catalogue)<ref>[http://runstop.de/music07.html William Brown, essay on stock music in ''The Benny Hill Show'']</ref> as background or incidental music.\n\nAmerican TV has also utilized production music, most notably with the themes for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (\"[[Heavy Action]]\" by [[Johnny Pearson]]) and ''[[The People's Court]]'' (\"The Big One\" by [[Alan Tew]]). Other notable examples are the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[The Ren and Stimpy Show]]'' and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', which use well-known classical music excerpts and a wide range of pre-1960s production music cues\u2014including many pieces familiar from their use in earlier cartoons\u2014which were chosen for their ironic and humorous effect.\n\nProduction music composers and session performers typically work anonymously and have rarely become known outside their professional circle. In recent years some veteran composer-performers in this field such as Alan Hawkshaw, John Cameron and [[Keith Mansfield]] have achieved attention and popularity as a result of a new interest in production music of the 1960s and 1970s, notably the 'beat' and [[electronica]] cues recorded for KPM and other labels, which have been widely sampled by DJs and record producers. In recent years some of these British musicians have given public performances of their classic compositions under the group name [[KPM Allstars]].<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article666595.ece \"KPM Allstars\", ''The Times'', 10 October 2006]</ref>\n\n==Business model==\nThe business model of production music libraries is based on two income streams:\n\n;License or synchronization fees: These are the fees paid upfront to the library for permission to synchronize its music to a piece of film, video or audio. These fees can range from a few dollars for an internet usage, to thousands for a network commercial usage. Some libraries, especially in the UK and Europe, split these fees with the composer of the music. In the US, it is more common for a composer to be paid a work-for-hire fee upfront by the library for composing the music, thus waiving his/her share of any future license fees. In the UK, license fees for production music are nationally standardized and set by the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society|MCPS]]. In the US and elsewhere, libraries are free to determine their own license fees.\n;Performance income (or performance royalties): Performances income is generated when music is publicly performed - for example, on television or radio. The producer of the show or film that has licensed the music does not pay these fees. Instead, large fees are paid annually by broadcasters (such as television networks and radio stations) to performing rights organizations (PRO's) such as [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] and [[SESAC]] in the US and the [[PRS for Music|PRS]] in the UK, who then distribute income among their members. To ensure it is distributed fairly and accurately, most broadcasters are required to keep note of what music they have broadcast and for how long. This information is then used by the performance societies to allocate income to their members. Typically, a library will receive 50 percent of the performance income (this is known as the publisher's share), with the composer receiving the remaining 50 percent. Like license fees, performance income is highly variable and dependent on the nature of the usage; local radio usage will yield modest income - perhaps a few dollars each time it is played. Repeated use in a primetime network TV show can generate thousands of dollars. Another method, in the United States, of collecting royalties for performances of production, stock, and library music is through directly negotiating royalties with composers and bypassing PRO's. BMI and ASCAP, and more recently SESAC, no longer have exclusive representation of composers for the collection of performance royalties. By directly negotiating the performance royalties with rights holders, licensees can pay less for the performance of a cue of music, and the licenser (the rights holder) can receive more than the PRO would pay. This is because of the removal of not only the administrative costs incurred through a PRO collecting royalties, but the removal of the \"weight variable\" which pays the highest performing songwriters and composers a portion of all fees collected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvmlc.com/music-licensing/copyright-basics/|title=COPYRIGHT BASICS|work=TVMLC.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.muserk.com/performance-royalties-licenses/|title=Licensing Performance Royalties & Licenses|work=Licensing Performance Royalties & Licenses|access-date=2020-11-04| url=https://taketones.com/page/faq#Performance-Royalties&Licenses|archive-date=2014-12-13|}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/creators/royalty/us_television_royalties|title=U.S. Television Royalties|work=BMI.com}}</ref>\n\n== Market ==\nThe production music market is dominated by libraries affiliated with the large record and publishing companies: [[KPM Musichouse|KPM]] is owned by [[EMI]]; [[Universal Music Publishing Group]] library music has the music libraries of Chappell, Bruton, and Atmosphere under their own name as well as others owned by them such as [[Killer Tracks]]; Imagem Production Music (formerly [[Boosey & Hawkes]] Production Music and including the Cavendish, Abaco and Strip Sounds labels) is owned by the Imagem Music Group; [[Extreme Music]] is owned by [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]]; [[BMG Rights Management]] runs its own production music division; and [[Warner/Chappell]] (a division of [[Warner Music Group]]) owns Warner/Chappell Production Music.<ref>{{cite news|title=billboard.com Apr 2012| url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/publishing/1098075/warnerchappel-unites-production-companies-launches-new-website7}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.horizont.net/agenturen/nachrichten/BMG-Production-Music-BMG-gruendet-Agentur-fuer-Produktionsmusik-145935|title=BMG Production Music: BMG gr\u00fcndet Agentur f\u00fcr Produktionsmusik|website=www.horizont.net|language=de|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\nEstablished in 1965, [[Sonoton]] is the largest independent production music library in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.professional-production.de/fachbeitraege/einzelansicht/datum/2015/05/31/sonoton-die-ersten-50-jahre/|title=Professional Production - Technologie und Medienrealisation in Film und Video {{!}} Sonoton \u2013 die ersten 50 Jahre|last=Video|first=Professional Production-Technologie und Medienrealisation in Film und|website=www.professional-production.de|language=de|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> There are numerous independent libraries that include [[Vanacore Music]] and [[West One Music Group]].\n\n==Hybrid license method==\nThis method of licensing combines the creation of original, custom music with a catalog of traditional \"library\" music under one license agreement. The goal is to suit the needs of a budget conscious production but still provide that production with a unique and original show theme or audio brand. In this scenario, show producer identifies those scenes she/he feels are most important to the success of the show, and those scenes are scored to picture by the composer. Those less important scenes will utilize the library also provided by the same publisher/composer. Upon completion, the custom music and the library tracks are licensed together under one production blanket, the ownership of the custom music remains with the publisher who produced it, and the publisher can (after a term of exclusivity negotiated between the parties) re-license the custom music as part of its library to recoup production costs.\n\nThis allows the music composer/producer to quote lower rates because they are retaining ownership of the custom music, and will have the ability to make money with the same recording in a different production later on. It also allows the program or film producer to deliver content of very high quality, ensures that the most important scenes have the perfect music, and those less important scenes are addressed with an affordable solution.\n\n==Royalty-free libraries==\nWith the proliferation of music libraries in recent years and the increase in competition, some smaller libraries have evolved the ''royalty-free music'' model. These libraries do not charge their customers for licensing the music. Instead, the customers purchase a CD or access to an electronic collection of music - priced typically between 50 and 300 dollars - whose content is licensed in perpetuity for them to synchronize as often they wish. These libraries depend mainly on performance royalties for their income (with a small amount of income from sales of physical CDs or online track downloads). Assuming that the music is broadcast, royalties are paid on the music, though it is the broadcaster who pays them via annual fees to the performing rights societies, not the producer who uses the music in their production.\n\nSome companies offer truly royalty-free music which is not registered with any [[performance rights organisation]] (also known as \"royalty collection agencies\"). These companies license music to their customers on a non-exclusive basis where it can be used in perpetuity without any usage reporting. The music is licensed by the customers according to an accepted license agreement, and they cannot sell it or license it to others. Because of advancing technology, it is becoming easier for independent musicians to set up their own shops through which they can license music.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thetechreviewer.com/tech-tips/best-royalty-free-music-websites-filmmakers/|title=7 Best Royalty Free Music Websites & Services For Filmmakers|date=2017-08-11|work=TheTechReviewer.com|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Non-exclusive libraries==\nNon-exclusive production music libraries enable a composer to sign a non-exclusive agreement allowing the artist to license the same piece to other libraries and clients with the same non-exclusive agreement. In other words, their intellectual property (their composition) can be licensed to multiple clients simultaneously, provided that they are not contractually bound by an exclusive agreement with another company. The non-exclusive library doesn't own the rights outside of the licenses that are made by that library. Typically the library does not pay for the piece, and the artist doesn't get any payment until the piece is licensed at which point the library and the artist split the license fee equally. Libraries typically require the artist to rename the piece in effect creating a unique artistic work for the library to register with their PRO (BMI, ASCAP, SESAC). Should the composer want to enter the piece into an exclusive agreement with a library or client, they would first need to remove that piece from all non-exclusive agreements.\n\nAn advantage to using a non-exclusive library is the possible broad exposure through multiple outlets, and the ability of the artist to retain control. Conversely, if an artist sells his/her piece to an exclusive library he/she is paid upfront for the piece but the artist typically sells the publishing rights, hence losing control of the piece and future licensing fees.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stock footage]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite journal|url=http://www.believermag.com/issues/201207/?read=article_zoladz|last=Zoladz|first=Lindsey|title=Beat Boutique|magazine=[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]|date=July\u2013August 2012}}\n\n* ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01061hr Into the Library]'', BBC Radio documentary, presenter Jonny Trunk, producer Simon Hollis, Brook Lapping Productions, April 2011\n\n==Further reading==\n* Hollander, David: ''Unusual Sounds: The Hidden History of Library Music''.

According to the Coast Guard, the \"numerous and compounding preconditions\" that led to the casualty also included various operational issues such as the towing plans that were not adequate for the winter towing operation crossing the Gulf of Alaska and the crew's lack of towing experience in the Gulf of Alaska waters particularly during the wintertime.<ref name=\"accidentreport\">[https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/CG-5PC/INV/docs/documents/Kulluk.pdf Report of Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Multiple Related Marine Casualties and Grounding of the MODU KULLUK on December 31, 2012].

He played [[college football]] at [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] and the [[College of San Mateo]] as a [[quarterback]]. He was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Edelman primarily plays on offense and as a punt returner; he has also been pressed into service as a [[cornerback]] at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense.\n\nEdelman is one of the most productive receivers in post-season history, ranking second overall (behind [[Jerry Rice]]) in both post-season receiving yards and post-season receptions.  He has played in four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]], [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] and [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]). In each of the last three, he led all wide receivers in receiving yards. He was named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] for Super Bowl LIII, in which he had 10 catches for 141 yards receiving, more than half of his team's total receiving yardage.

He played [[college football]] at [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] and the [[College of San Mateo]] as a [[quarterback]]. He was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Edelman primarily plays on offense and as a punt returner; he has also been pressed into service as a [[cornerback]] at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense.\n\nEdelman is one of the most productive receivers in post-season history, ranking second overall (behind [[Jerry Rice]]) in both post-season receiving yards and post-season receptions.  He has played in four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]], [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] and [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]). In each of the last three, he led all wide receivers in receiving yards. He was named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] for Super Bowl LIII, in which he had 10 catches for 141 yards receiving, more than half of his team's total receiving yardage. He holds the Super Bowl records for career punt returns (8) and first-half receptions in a single game (7).\n\n==Early years==\nEdelman was born in [[Redwood City, California]], to Angela (n\u00e9e Gole) and Frank Edelman, a mechanic who owns an A-1 Auto Tech.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/12659571 |title=Julian Edelman enjoys his moment |date=February 19, 2015 |website=ESPN.com}}</ref> He has two siblings, Jason and Nicole.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 Julian Edelman profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131230846/http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 |date=January 31, 2012 }}, Patriots.com; accessed November 6, 2015.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=5247 |title=California Birth Index, 1905\u20131995 |publisher=Ancestry |access-date=February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/16/julian-edelman-took-back-road-nfl/Qbv5QnIQh9BpRn9ZetrSRO/story.html |title=Julian Edelman took the 'back road' to the NFL |website=BostonGlobe.com |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Originally raised as a [[Christians|Christian]], his ancestry includes [[Greeks|Greek]], [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], Irish, [[Ashkenazi Jewish]], and [[Germans|German]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |title=Edelman MOT? \u00bb Kaplan's Korner on Jews and Sports |date=September 21, 2009 |website=Njjewishnews.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108212449/http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> His mother was born in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada, to German parents who had lived in [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"relnt1\">Stated in ''Relentless: A Memoir'', Julian Edelman, 2017, Hachette Books</ref>\n\nHe was the quarterback for [[Woodside High School (California)|Woodside High School]] in [[Woodside, California]], and as a senior, he led the Wildcats to a 13\u20130 record in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/woodside-wildcats-(woodside,ca)/football-fall-04/schedule.htm |title=Schedule \u2013 Woodside Wildcats 2004 Football (CA) |website=www.maxpreps.com |access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref> During his high school career, Edelman had 2,237 yards and 29 touchdowns passing, in addition to 964 yards and 13 [[touchdown]]s rushing.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yang |first=Nicole |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/10/24/5-things-we-learned-from-julian-edelmans-new-memoir-relentless |title=5 things we learned from Julian Edelman's new memoir 'Relentless' |date=October 24, 2017 |work=Boston.com |access-date=December 25, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nAfter high school, Edelman spent a year attending the [[College of San Mateo]].

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].

In Old English, the day was called \u201cLong Friday\u201d (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\" {{IPA-ang|\u02c8l\u0251\u014b.\u0261\u0251 \u02c8fri\u02d0.je\u02ccd\u00e6j|}}), and this term was adopted from Old English and is still used in Scandinavian languages and Finnish.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0522.html ]</ref>\n\n===Other languages===\nIn Latin, the name used by the Catholic Church until 1955 was ''Feria sexta in Parasceve'' (\"Friday of Preparation [for the Sabbath]\"). In the 1955 reform of Holy Week, it was renamed ''Feria sexta in Passione et Morte Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion and Death of the Lord\"), and in the new rite introduced in 1970, shortened to ''Feria sexta in Passione Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion of the Lord\").\n\nIn Dutch, Good Friday is known as ''Goede Vrijdag'', in Frisian as ''Goedfreed''. In German-speaking countries, it is generally referred to as ''Karfreitag'' (\"Mourning Friday\", with ''Kar'' from [[Old High German]] ''kara''\u201a \"bewail\", \"grieve\"\u201a \"mourn\", which is related to the English word \"care\" in the sense of cares and woes), but it is sometimes also called ''Stiller Freitag'' (\"Silent Friday\") and ''Hoher Freitag'' (\"High Friday, Holy Friday\"). In the Scandinavian languages and Finnish (\"pitk\u00e4perjantai\"), it is called the equivalent of \"Long Friday\" as it was in Old English (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\").\n\nIn Greek, Polish, Hungarian, and Romanian it is generally referred to as the equivalent of \"Great Friday\" (''\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae'', ''Wielki Pi\u0105tek'', ''Nagyp\u00e9ntek'', ''Vinerea Mare'').

Judas received money ([[30 pieces of silver]]) ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:14\u201316|KJV}}) for [[Bargain of Judas|betraying Jesus]] and told the guards that whomever [[Kiss of Judas|he kisses]] is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of [[Annas]], the father-in-law of the [[Cohen Gadol|high priest]], [[Caiaphas]]. There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the [[Sanhedrin]] had assembled ({{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201324|KJV}}).\n\nConflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying \"I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?\" Jesus testified ambiguously, \"You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven.\" The high priest condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]], and the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201366|KJV}}). Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also [[Denial of Peter|denied Jesus]] three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.\n\nIn the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:1\u20132|KJV}}). Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death ({{Bibleverse||John|18:31|KJV}}).\n\n[[Pilate's court|Pilate questioned]] Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of [[Galilee]], [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], who was in [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]] Feast. [[Jesus at Herod's court|Herod questioned]] Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:3\u201316|KJV}}). Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for [[Barabbas]], who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, \"Crucify him\" ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:6\u201314|KJV}}). [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Pilate's wife]] had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to \"have nothing to do with this righteous man\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:19|KJV}}). Pilate had Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death \"because he claimed to be God's son.\" This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came ({{Bibleverse||John|19:1\u20139|KJV|}}).\n\n[[File:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Antonio Ciseri]]'s depiction of ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' with Jesus and [[Pontius Pilate]], 19th century]]\nComing before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:24\u201326|KJV}}) and ultimately to keep his job. The sentence written was \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.\" Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]]), called the \"place of the Skull\", or \"[[Golgotha]]\" in Hebrew and in Latin \"Calvary\". There he was crucified along with two criminals ({{Bibleverse||John|19:17\u201322|KJV}}).\n\nJesus agonized on the cross for six hours. During his last three hours on the cross, from noon to 3&nbsp;pm, [[Crucifixion darkness|darkness fell over the whole land]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45}}; {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:13}}; {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:44}}</ref> Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|spoke from the cross]], quoting the messianic [[Psalm 22]]: \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"\n\nWith a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit. There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The [[centurion]] on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, \"Truly this was God's Son!\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45\u201354|KJV}})\n\n[[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the Sanhedrin and a secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:50\u201352|KJV}}). Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named [[Nicodemus]] brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:44|KJV}}). A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out ({{Bibleverse||John|19:34|KJV}}), and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:45|KJV}}).\n\nJoseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:59\u201360|KJV}}) in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Nicodemus ({{Bibleverse||John|3:1|KJV}}) also brought 75 pounds of [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]], and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:60|KJV}}). Then they returned home and rested, because [[Shabbat]] had begun at sunset ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:54\u201356|KJV}}). Matt. 28:1 \"After the Shabbat, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb\". i.e. \"After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,...\". \"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said....\".

Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout [[Great Lent]],<ref>There is a wide variety of uses regarding the [[liturgical colors]] worn during Great Lent and Holy Week in the Rite of Constantinople.</ref> but instead don [[black vestments]]. There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy and Great Thursday]] as in the West; instead, all of the [[antipendia|church hangings]] are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on [[Great Saturday]].\n\nThe faithful revisit the events of the day through the public reading of specific [[Psalms]] and the [[Gospel]]s, and singing [[hymn]]s about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism, as well as stirring hymnody, are remarkable elements of these observances. In the [[Orthodox theology|Orthodox understanding]], the events of [[Holy Week]] are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participates in the death and the [[resurrection of Jesus]].\n\n<blockquote>Each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service \u2013 unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us to the foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.<ref name=\"Bulg\">{{Cite book\n|last = Bulgakov\n|first = Sergei V.\n|year = 1900\n|title = Handbook for Church Servers|edition= 2nd\n|page = 543\n|chapter = Great Friday\n|place = Kharkov\n|publisher = Tr.

Scattered throughout this [[Matins]] service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] from the [[Last Supper]] through the [[Crucifixion]] and [[Holy Sepulchre|burial]] of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.\n[[File:Agias Triados frescos cross.jpg|thumb|upright|Good Friday cross from the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]] at Holy Trinity Monastery, [[Meteora]], Greece]]\n\nThe first of these twelve readings {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} is the longest Gospel reading of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]], and is a [[concatenation]] from all [[four Gospels]]. Just before the sixth Gospel reading, which recounts Jesus being nailed to the cross, a large [[Christian cross|cross]] is carried out of the sanctuary by the priest, accompanied by [[incense]] and candles, and is placed in the center of the [[nave]] (where the congregation gathers)''S\u0113meron Krem\u0101tai Ep\u00ed X\u00fdlou'':\n\n<blockquote>Today He who hung the earth upon the waters is hung upon the Cross ''(three times)''.<br>He who is King of the angels is arrayed in a crown of thorns.<br>He who wraps the Heavens in clouds is wrapped in the purple of mockery. <br>He who in Jordan set Adam free receives blows upon His face.<br>The Bridegroom of the Church is transfixed with nails. <br>The Son of the Virgin is pierced with a spear.<br>We venerate Thy Passion, O Christ ''(three times)''.<br>Show us also Thy glorious Resurrection.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Archimandrite Kallistos (Ware) and Mother Mary\n|year = 2002\n|title = The Lenten Triodion\n|chapter = Service of the Twelve Gospels\n|page = 587\n|place = South Cannan, PA\n|publisher = St. Tikhon's Seminary Press\n|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2QNbTDjvJ0 Today He who hung the earth upon the waters ] Chanted by the Byzantine Choir of Athens</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe readings are:\n\n# {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} \u2013 Christ's last sermon, Jesus prays for the [[apostles]].\n# {{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201328|KJV}} \u2013 The agony in the [[Garden of Gethsemane|garden]], the mockery and denial of Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201375|KJV}} \u2013 The mockery of Christ, [[Saint Peter|Peter]] denies Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||John|18:28\u201319:16|KJV}} \u2013 [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] questions Jesus; Jesus is condemned; Jesus is mocked by the Romans.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:3\u201332|KJV}} \u2013 [[Judas]] commits suicide; Jesus is condemned; Jesus mocked by the Romans; [[Simon of Cyrene]] compelled to carry the cross.\n# {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:16\u201332|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:33\u201354|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:32\u201349|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||John|19:25\u201337|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:43\u201347|KJV}} \u2013 [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||John|19:38\u201342|KJV}} \u2013 [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:62\u201366|KJV}} \u2013 The Jews set a guard.\n\nDuring the service, all come forward to kiss the feet of Christ on the cross.

The service does not end with the [[First Hour]], as usual, but with a special [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] by the priest:\n\n<blockquote>May Christ our true God, Who for the salvation of the world endured spitting, and scourging, and buffeting, and the Cross, and death, through the intercessions of His [[Theotokos|most pure Mother]], of our holy and [[Holy Fathers|God-bearing fathers]], and of all the [[saint]]s, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind.</blockquote>\n\n===Royal Hours===\n[[File:Service of the Royal Hours - Great Friday -- Annunciation, Toronto, 2014.JPG|right|thumb|Vigil during the Service of the Royal Hours.]]\n{{main|Royal Hours}}\nThe next day, in the forenoon on Friday, all gather again to pray the '''''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRSgOFbH-fQ Royal Hours]''''', a special expanded celebration of the [[Little Hours]] (including the First Hour, [[Third Hour]], [[Sext|Sixth Hour]], [[Ninth Hour]] and [[Typica]]) with the addition of scripture readings ([[Old Testament]], [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]]) and hymns about the Crucifixion at each of the Hours (some of the material from the previous night is repeated). This is somewhat more festive in character, and derives its name of \"Royal\" from both the fact that the Hours are served with more solemnity than normal, commemorating Christ the King who humbled himself for the salvation of mankind, and also from the fact that this service was in the past attended by the Emperor and his court.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Vespers of Holy and Great Friday===\n[[File:Toronto-Apokathylosis-2012-04-13.jpg|left|thumb|The crucified Christ, just before the [[Deposition from the Cross]] and the placing of the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]] in the Sepulcher.]]\nIn the afternoon, around 3&nbsp;pm, all gather for the '''''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTqiy-p7EkA Vespers of the Taking-Down from the Cross]''''', commemorating the [[Deposition from the Cross]].

The epitaphios itself represents the body of Jesus wrapped in a burial shroud, and is a roughly full-size cloth icon of the body of Christ. Then the priest may deliver a [[homily]] and everyone comes forward to venerate the epitaphios.

This service is also sometimes called ''Jerusalem Matins''. Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nA unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises (''[[Encomium|Enk\u014dmia]]''), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of [[Psalm 119]] (which is, by far, the longest [[psalm]] in the Bible). The ''Enk\u014dmia'' are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 [[tercet]] [[antiphon]]s arranged in three parts (''st\u00e1seis'' or \"stops\"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short ''doxastik\u00e1'' (\"[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloriae]]\") and ''Theot\u00f3kia'' (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three ''st\u00e1seis'' are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: {{lang|grc|\u1f29 \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u1ff3}}, \"Life in a grave\", {{lang|grc|\u1f0c\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af}}, \"Worthy it is\", and {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f31 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9}}, \"All the generations\".  Musically they can be classified as [[strophic]], with 75, 62, and 48 tercet [[stanza]]s each, respectively. The climax of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' comes during the third ''st\u00e1sis'', with the antiphon \"''\u014c glyk\u00fd mou \u00c9ar''\", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child (\"O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?\"). The author(s) and date of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' are unknown. Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of [[St. Romanos the Melodist]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Epitaph Adelaide.jpg|thumb|The Epitaphios mounted upon return of procession, at an Orthodox Church in Adelaide, Australia.]]\nAt the end of the [[Great Doxology]], while the [[Trisagion]] is sung, the epitaphios is taken in [[crucession|procession]] around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning. In some churches, the epitaphios is never left alone, but is accompanied 24 hours a day by a reader chanting from the Psalter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe [[Troparion]] (hymn of the day) of Good Friday is:\n<blockquote><poem>\nThe noble [[Joseph of Arimathea|Joseph]], when he had taken down Thy most pure Body from the [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|tree]], wrapped it in fine linen, and anointed it with spices, and placed it in a new tomb.\nGlory to the [[God the Father|Father]], and to the [[Jesus|Son]], and to the [[Holy Spirit]], both now and ever, and unto ages of ages.

During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\"/>\n\nMore recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The Three Days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the Three Days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the [[Last Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] and at the [[Vigil of Easter]]. One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a [[tenebrae]] service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called \"Tenebrae\" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historiclectionary.com/2010/03/a-word-about-tenebrae |title=A Word About Tenebrae &#124; |publisher=Historiclectionary.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The Good Friday liturgy appointed in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions. Many Lutheran churches have Good Friday services, such as the [[Three Hours' Agony]] centered on the remembrance of the \"Seven Last Words,\" sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, while others hold a liturgy that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAlong with observing a general Lenten fast,<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\">{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=G\u00fcnther|last2=Oldenburg|first2=Mark W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=978-0810874824|page=229|quote=In many Lutheran churches, the Sundays during the Lenten season are called by the first word of their respective Latin Introitus (with the exception of Palm/Passion Sunday): Invocavit, Reminiscere, Oculi, Laetare, and Judica.

This is where the host of the prior day is placed at the altar, incensed, elevated so \"that it may be seen by the people\" and consumed.

Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal [[equinox]]. The Western calculation uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], while the Eastern calculation uses the [[Julian calendar]], whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April. The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ. See [[Computus]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, Easter can fall between 22 March and 25 April on Julian Calendar (thus between 4 April and 8 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar, during the period 1900 and 2099), so Good Friday can fall between 20 March and 23 April, inclusive (or between 2 April and 6 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n{{Lent_calendar.svg|none{{!}}400px\n}}\n\n==Cultural references==\nGood Friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of [[Richard Wagner]]'s music drama ''[[Parsifal]]'', which contains an orchestral interlude known as the \"Good Friday Music\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/good-friday-music|title=Good Friday Music \u2013 Dictionary definition of Good Friday Music |publisher=Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism from non-observers==\nSome [[Baptist]] congregations,<ref>{{cite web|first=L.

In Old English, the day was called \u201cLong Friday\u201d (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\" {{IPA-ang|\u02c8l\u0251\u014b.\u0261\u0251 \u02c8fri\u02d0.je\u02ccd\u00e6j|}}), and this term was adopted from Old English and is still used in Scandinavian languages and Finnish.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0522.html ]</ref>\n\n===Other languages===\nIn Latin, the name used by the Catholic Church until 1955 was ''Feria sexta in Parasceve'' (\"Friday of Preparation [for the Sabbath]\"). In the 1955 reform of Holy Week, it was renamed ''Feria sexta in Passione et Morte Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion and Death of the Lord\"), and in the new rite introduced in 1970, shortened to ''Feria sexta in Passione Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion of the Lord\").\n\nIn Dutch, Good Friday is known as ''Goede Vrijdag'', in Frisian as ''Goedfreed''. In German-speaking countries, it is generally referred to as ''Karfreitag'' (\"Mourning Friday\", with ''Kar'' from [[Old High German]] ''kara''\u201a \"bewail\", \"grieve\"\u201a \"mourn\", which is related to the English word \"care\" in the sense of cares and woes), but it is sometimes also called ''Stiller Freitag'' (\"Silent Friday\") and ''Hoher Freitag'' (\"High Friday, Holy Friday\"). In the Scandinavian languages and Finnish (\"pitk\u00e4perjantai\"), it is called the equivalent of \"Long Friday\" as it was in Old English (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\").\n\nIn Greek, Polish, Hungarian, and Romanian it is generally referred to as the equivalent of \"Great Friday\" (''\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae'', ''Wielki Pi\u0105tek'', ''Nagyp\u00e9ntek'', ''Vinerea Mare'').

Judas received money ([[30 pieces of silver]]) ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:14\u201316|KJV}}) for [[Bargain of Judas|betraying Jesus]] and told the guards that whomever [[Kiss of Judas|he kisses]] is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of [[Annas]], the father-in-law of the [[Cohen Gadol|high priest]], [[Caiaphas]]. There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the [[Sanhedrin]] had assembled ({{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201324|KJV}}).\n\nConflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying \"I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?\" Jesus testified ambiguously, \"You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven.\" The high priest condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]], and the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201366|KJV}}). Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also [[Denial of Peter|denied Jesus]] three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.\n\nIn the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:1\u20132|KJV}}). Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death ({{Bibleverse||John|18:31|KJV}}).\n\n[[Pilate's court|Pilate questioned]] Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of [[Galilee]], [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], who was in [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]] Feast. [[Jesus at Herod's court|Herod questioned]] Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:3\u201316|KJV}}). Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for [[Barabbas]], who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, \"Crucify him\" ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:6\u201314|KJV}}). [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Pilate's wife]] had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to \"have nothing to do with this righteous man\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:19|KJV}}). Pilate had Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death \"because he claimed to be God's son.\" This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came ({{Bibleverse||John|19:1\u20139|KJV|}}).\n\n[[File:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Antonio Ciseri]]'s depiction of ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' with Jesus and [[Pontius Pilate]], 19th century]]\nComing before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:24\u201326|KJV}}) and ultimately to keep his job. The sentence written was \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.\" Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]]), called the \"place of the Skull\", or \"[[Golgotha]]\" in Hebrew and in Latin \"Calvary\". There he was crucified along with two criminals ({{Bibleverse||John|19:17\u201322|KJV}}).\n\nJesus agonized on the cross for six hours. During his last three hours on the cross, from noon to 3&nbsp;pm, [[Crucifixion darkness|darkness fell over the whole land]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45}}; {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:13}}; {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:44}}</ref> Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|spoke from the cross]], quoting the messianic [[Psalm 22]]: \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"\n\nWith a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit. There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The [[centurion]] on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, \"Truly this was God's Son!\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45\u201354|KJV}})\n\n[[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the Sanhedrin and a secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:50\u201352|KJV}}). Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named [[Nicodemus]] brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:44|KJV}}). A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out ({{Bibleverse||John|19:34|KJV}}), and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:45|KJV}}).\n\nJoseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:59\u201360|KJV}}) in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Nicodemus ({{Bibleverse||John|3:1|KJV}}) also brought 75 pounds of [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]], and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:60|KJV}}). Then they returned home and rested, because [[Shabbat]] had begun at sunset ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:54\u201356|KJV}}). Matt. 28:1 \"After the Shabbat, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb\". i.e. \"After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,...\". \"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said....\".

Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout [[Great Lent]],<ref>There is a wide variety of uses regarding the [[liturgical colors]] worn during Great Lent and Holy Week in the Rite of Constantinople.</ref> but instead don [[black vestments]]. There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy and Great Thursday]] as in the West; instead, all of the [[antipendia|church hangings]] are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on [[Great Saturday]].\n\nThe faithful revisit the events of the day through the public reading of specific [[Psalms]] and the [[Gospel]]s, and singing [[hymn]]s about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism, as well as stirring hymnody, are remarkable elements of these observances. In the [[Orthodox theology|Orthodox understanding]], the events of [[Holy Week]] are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participates in the death and the [[resurrection of Jesus]].\n\n<blockquote>Each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service \u2013 unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us to the foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.<ref name=\"Bulg\">{{Cite book\n|last = Bulgakov\n|first = Sergei V.\n|year = 1900\n|title = Handbook for Church Servers|edition= 2nd\n|page = 543\n|chapter = Great Friday\n|place = Kharkov\n|publisher = Tr.

Scattered throughout this [[Matins]] service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] from the [[Last Supper]] through the [[Crucifixion]] and [[Holy Sepulchre|burial]] of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.\n[[File:Agias Triados frescos cross.jpg|thumb|upright|Good Friday cross from the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]] at Holy Trinity Monastery, [[Meteora]], Greece]]\n\nThe first of these twelve readings {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} is the longest Gospel reading of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]], and is a [[concatenation]] from all [[four Gospels]]. Just before the sixth Gospel reading, which recounts Jesus being nailed to the cross, a large [[Christian cross|cross]] is carried out of the sanctuary by the priest, accompanied by [[incense]] and candles, and is placed in the center of the [[nave]] (where the congregation gathers)''S\u0113meron Krem\u0101tai Ep\u00ed X\u00fdlou'':\n\n<blockquote>Today He who hung the earth upon the waters is hung upon the Cross ''(three times)''.<br>He who is King of the angels is arrayed in a crown of thorns.<br>He who wraps the Heavens in clouds is wrapped in the purple of mockery. <br>He who in Jordan set Adam free receives blows upon His face.<br>The Bridegroom of the Church is transfixed with nails. <br>The Son of the Virgin is pierced with a spear.<br>We venerate Thy Passion, O Christ ''(three times)''.<br>Show us also Thy glorious Resurrection.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Archimandrite Kallistos (Ware) and Mother Mary\n|year = 2002\n|title = The Lenten Triodion\n|chapter = Service of the Twelve Gospels\n|page = 587\n|place = South Cannan, PA\n|publisher = St. Tikhon's Seminary Press\n|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2QNbTDjvJ0 Today He who hung the earth upon the waters ] Chanted by the Byzantine Choir of Athens</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe readings are:\n\n# {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} \u2013 Christ's last sermon, Jesus prays for the [[apostles]].\n# {{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201328|KJV}} \u2013 The agony in the [[Garden of Gethsemane|garden]], the mockery and denial of Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201375|KJV}} \u2013 The mockery of Christ, [[Saint Peter|Peter]] denies Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||John|18:28\u201319:16|KJV}} \u2013 [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] questions Jesus; Jesus is condemned; Jesus is mocked by the Romans.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:3\u201332|KJV}} \u2013 [[Judas]] commits suicide; Jesus is condemned; Jesus mocked by the Romans; [[Simon of Cyrene]] compelled to carry the cross.\n# {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:16\u201332|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:33\u201354|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:32\u201349|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||John|19:25\u201337|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:43\u201347|KJV}} \u2013 [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||John|19:38\u201342|KJV}} \u2013 [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:62\u201366|KJV}} \u2013 The Jews set a guard.\n\nDuring the service, all come forward to kiss the feet of Christ on the cross.

This service is also sometimes called ''Jerusalem Matins''. Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nA unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises (''[[Encomium|Enk\u014dmia]]''), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of [[Psalm 119]] (which is, by far, the longest [[psalm]] in the Bible). The ''Enk\u014dmia'' are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 [[tercet]] [[antiphon]]s arranged in three parts (''st\u00e1seis'' or \"stops\"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short ''doxastik\u00e1'' (\"[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloriae]]\") and ''Theot\u00f3kia'' (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three ''st\u00e1seis'' are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: {{lang|grc|\u1f29 \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u1ff3}}, \"Life in a grave\", {{lang|grc|\u1f0c\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af}}, \"Worthy it is\", and {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f31 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9}}, \"All the generations\".  Musically they can be classified as [[strophic]], with 75, 62, and 48 tercet [[stanza]]s each, respectively. The climax of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' comes during the third ''st\u00e1sis'', with the antiphon \"''\u014c glyk\u00fd mou \u00c9ar''\", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child (\"O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?\"). The author(s) and date of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' are unknown. Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of [[St. Romanos the Melodist]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Epitaph Adelaide.jpg|thumb|The Epitaphios mounted upon return of procession, at an Orthodox Church in Adelaide, Australia.]]\nAt the end of the [[Great Doxology]], while the [[Trisagion]] is sung, the epitaphios is taken in [[crucession|procession]] around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning.

Many of the faithful spend long hours into the night grieving at the Tomb, where it is customary to kiss the wounds on the Lord's body. A life-size figure of Jesus lying in his tomb is widely visited by the faithful, especially on Holy Saturday. The tableaux may include flowers, candles, figures of angels standing watch, and the three crosses atop Mt Calvary, and much more.

These Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ do not involve a petition for a beneficiary, but aim to \"repair the sins\" against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm|title=Reparation|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm|title=Raccolta|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia |accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

In recent times,{{When|date=April 2017}} revised editions of the [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]] and [[Common Worship]] have re-introduced pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] forms of observance of Good Friday corresponding to those in today's Roman Catholic Church, with special nods to the rites that had been observed in the Church of England prior to the [[English Reformation|Henrican, Edwardian and Elizabethan reforms]], including Creeping to the Cross.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Lutheran Church==\n[[File:Chancel of Grace Lutheran Church on Good Friday.jpg|thumb|The [[chancel]] of this Lutheran church is adorned with black [[parament]]s on Good Friday, the liturgical colour associated with Good Friday in the Lutheran Churches.]]\nIn [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] tradition from the 16th to the 20th century, Good Friday was the most important religious holiday, and abstention from all worldly works was expected. During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\"/>\n\nMore recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The Three Days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the Three Days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the [[Last Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] and at the [[Vigil of Easter]]. One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a [[tenebrae]] service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called \"Tenebrae\" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historiclectionary.com/2010/03/a-word-about-tenebrae |title=A Word About Tenebrae &#124; |publisher=Historiclectionary.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The Good Friday liturgy appointed in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions. Many Lutheran churches have Good Friday services, such as the [[Three Hours' Agony]] centered on the remembrance of the \"Seven Last Words,\" sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, while others hold a liturgy that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAlong with observing a general Lenten fast,<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\">{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=G\u00fcnther|last2=Oldenburg|first2=Mark W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=978-0810874824|page=229|quote=In many Lutheran churches, the Sundays during the Lenten season are called by the first word of their respective Latin Introitus (with the exception of Palm/Passion Sunday): Invocavit, Reminiscere, Oculi, Laetare, and Judica.

This is where the host of the prior day is placed at the altar, incensed, elevated so \"that it may be seen by the people\" and consumed.

The Western calculation uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], while the Eastern calculation uses the [[Julian calendar]], whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

It was also called '[[action painting]]', since he used the force of his whole body to paint, often in a frenetic dancing style. This extreme form of abstraction divided the critics: some praised the immediacy of the creation, while others derided the random effects. In 2016, Pollock's painting titled ''Number 17A'' was reported to have fetched US$200 million in a private purchase.\n\nA reclusive and volatile personality, Pollock struggled with [[alcoholism]] for most of his life. In 1945, he married the artist [[Lee Krasner]], who became an important influence on his career and on his legacy. Pollock died at the age of 44 in an alcohol-related single-car accident when he was driving. In December 1956, four months after his death, Pollock was given a memorial [[retrospective]] exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) in [[New York City]].

By defying the convention of painting on an upright surface, he added a new dimension by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions.\n\nOne definitive influence on Pollock was the work of the [[Ukrainian American]] artist [[Janet Sobel]] (1894\u20131968) (born Jennie Lechovsky).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hollistaggart.com/artists/biography/janet_sobel/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712213618/http://www.hollistaggart.com/artists/biography/janet_sobel/ |archive-date=2011-07-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Peggy Guggenheim included Sobel's work in her ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]'' in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/ideas/18624|title=Mother of Invention|author=Bob Duggan|work=Big Think}}</ref> Jackson Pollock and art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] saw Sobel's work there in 1946 and later Greenberg noted that Sobel was \"a direct influence on Jackson Pollock's drip painting technique.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Outliers and American vanguard art|last=Lynne|first=Cooke|others=National Gallery of Art (U.S.),, University of Chicago.

He used the force of his whole body to paint, which was expressed on the large canvases.

Referring to his style of painting on the floor, Pollock stated, \"I feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk round it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting. This is akin to the methods of the Indian sand painters of the West.\"<ref>Jackson Pollock, \"My Painting\", in ''Pollock: Painting'' (edited by Barbara Rose), New York: Agrinde Publications Ltd (1980), p. 65; originally published in ''Possibilities'' I, New York, Winter 1947-48</ref> Other influences on his drip technique include the Mexican [[mural]]ists and [[Surrealist]] automatism. Pollock denied reliance on \"the accident\"; he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular work to appear. His technique combined the movement of his body, over which he had control, the viscous flow of paint, the force of gravity, and the absorption of paint into the canvas. It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors. Flinging, dripping, pouring, and spattering, he would move energetically around the canvas, almost as if in a dance, and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see.\n\nAustrian artist [[Wolfgang Paalen]]'s article on totem art of the indigenous people of British Columbia, in which the concept of space in totemist art is considered from an artist's point of view, influenced Pollock as well; Pollock owned a signed and dedicated copy of the Amerindian Number of Paalen's magazine (DYN 4\u20135, 1943). He had also seen Paalen's surrealist paintings in an exhibition of in 1940.<ref>\u00bbIn Mexico City, he [Motherwell] visited Wolfgang Paalen whose show Baziotes and Jackson [Pollock] had seen at the Julien Levy Gallery the year before.\u00ab Steven Naifeh, p. 414.</ref> Another strong influence must have been Paalen's surrealist ''fumage'' technique, which appealed to painters looking for new ways to depict what was called the ''unseen'' or the ''possible''. The technique was once demonstrated in Matta's workshop, about which Steven Naifeh reports, \"Once, when Matta was demonstrating the Surrealist technique [Paalen's] Fumage, Jackson [Pollock] turned to (Peter) Busa and said in a stage whisper: 'I can do that without the smoke.'\"<ref>Steven Naifeh, p. 427.</ref> Pollock's painter friend [[Fritz Bultman]] even stated, \"It was Wolfgang Paalen who started it all.\"<ref>Steven Naifeh, p. 534.</ref>\n\nIn 1950, [[Hans Namuth]], a young photographer, wanted to take pictures (both stills and moving) of Pollock at work. Pollock promised to start a new painting especially for the photographic session, but when Namuth arrived, Pollock apologized and told him the painting was finished.\n\nNamuth said that when he entered the studio:\n\n{{quote|A dripping wet canvas covered the entire floor ... There was complete silence ... Pollock looked at the painting. Then, unexpectedly, he picked up can and paint brush and started to move around the canvas. It was as if he suddenly realized the painting was not finished. His movements, slow at first, gradually became faster and more dance like as he flung black, white, and rust colored paint onto the canvas. He completely forgot that Lee and I were there; he did not seem to hear the click of the camera shutter ... My photography session lasted as long as he kept painting, perhaps half an hour. In all that time, Pollock did not stop. How could one keep up this level of activity? Finally, he said 'This is it.'\n<br />\nPollock's finest paintings ... reveal that his all-over line does not give rise to positive or negative areas: we are not made to feel that one part of the canvas demands to be read as figure, whether abstract or representational, against another part of the canvas read as ground. There is not inside or outside to Pollock's line or the space through which it moves. ... Pollock has managed to free line not only from its function of representing objects in the world, but also from its task of describing or bounding shapes or figures, whether abstract or representational, on the surface of the canvas.|Karmel, 132}}\n\n===From naming to numbering===\nContinuing to evade the viewer's search for figurative elements in his paintings, Pollock abandoned titles and started numbering his works. He said about this, \"[L]ook passively and try to receive what the painting has to offer and not bring a subject matter or preconceived idea of what they are to be looking for.\" His wife said, \"He used to give his pictures conventional titles ... but now he simply numbers them. Numbers are neutral. They make people look at a picture for what it is\u2014pure painting.\"<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n===Critical debate===\nPollock's work has been the subject of important critical debates. The critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]] once derided a number of Pollock's works as \"mere unorganized explosions of random energy, and therefore meaningless.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/nyregion/05spotli.html Steven McElroy, \"If It's So Easy, Why Don't You Try It\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 3, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Jean Helion]] the French abstract painter, on the other hand, on first seeing a \"Pollock,\" remarked, \"It filled out space going on and on because it did not have a start or end to it.\"<ref>Gray Martin, Quote in Book One 'Breaking the Ice' of 'Jackson Pollock -Memories arrested in Space', Santa Monica Press, 2003, {{ISBN|1891661329}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1952 article in ''ARTnews'', [[Harold Rosenberg]] coined the term \"[[action painting]]\" and wrote that \"what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event. The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint.' The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value&mdash;political, aesthetic, moral.\" Many people assumed that he had modeled his \"action painter\" paradigm on Pollock.\n\n[[Clement Greenberg]] supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds. It fit well with Greenberg's view of art history as a progressive purification in form and elimination of historical content. He considered Pollock's work to be the best painting of its day and the culmination of the Western tradition via [[Cubism]] and [[C\u00e9zanne]] to [[Manet]].\n\n''[[Reynold's News]]'', in a 1959 headline, said, \"This is not art&mdash;it's a joke in bad taste.\"<ref name=\"Expression of an age\"/>\n \nThe [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], an organization to promote American culture and values, backed by the [[CIA]], sponsored exhibitions of Pollock's work.

The script, by Christopher Cleveland, was to be based on [[Jeffrey Potter]]'s 1985 oral biography, ''To a Violent Grave,'' a collection of reminiscences by Pollock's friends. Streisand was to play the role of Lee Krasner, and De Niro was to portray Pollock.

They were later archived with her own papers. The Archives of American Art also houses the Charles Pollock papers, which include correspondence, photographs, and other files relating to his brother Jackson.\n\nA separate organization, the [[Pollock-Krasner Foundation]], was established in 1985. The foundation functions as the official estate for both Pollock and his widow, but also under the terms of Krasner's will, serves \"to assist individual working artists of merit with financial need\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pkf.org/press.html |title=The Pollock-Krasner Foundation website: Press Release page |publisher=Pkf.org |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611094930/http://www.pkf.org/press.html |archivedate=June 11, 2015 }}</ref> The U.S. copyright representative for the Pollock-Krasner Foundation is the [[Artists Rights Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arsny.com/requested.html |title=Most frequently requested artists list of the Artists Rights Society |publisher=Arsny.com |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206001342/http://www.arsny.com/requested.html |archivedate=February 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pollock-Krasner House and Studio]] is owned and administered by the Stony Brook Foundation, a nonprofit affiliate of [[Stony Brook University]].

January 28, 1912 &ndash; August 11, 1956) was an American painter and a major figure in the [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] movement.\n\nHe was widely noticed for his technique of pouring or splashing liquid household paint onto a horizontal surface ('drip technique'), enabling him to view and paint his canvases from all angles. It was also called '[[action painting]]', since he used the force of his whole body to paint, often in a frenetic dancing style. This extreme form of abstraction divided the critics: some praised the immediacy of the creation, while others derided the random effects. In 2016, Pollock's painting titled ''Number 17A'' was reported to have fetched US$200 million in a private purchase.\n\nA reclusive and volatile personality, Pollock struggled with [[alcoholism]] for most of his life. In 1945, he married the artist [[Lee Krasner]], who became an important influence on his career and on his legacy. Pollock died at the age of 44 in an alcohol-related single-car accident when he was driving. In December 1956, four months after his death, Pollock was given a memorial [[retrospective]] exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) in [[New York City]]. A larger, more comprehensive exhibition of his work was held there in 1967.In 1998 and 1999, his work was honored with large-scale retrospective exhibitions at MoMA and at The [[tate Britain|Tate]] in [[London]].<ref name=\"Varnedoe 1998 315\u2013329\">{{cite book|last=Varnedoe|first=Kirk|last2=Karmel|first2=Pepe|title=Jackson Pollock: Essays, Chronology, and Bibliography|series=Exhibition catalog|location=New York|publisher=[[The Museum of Modern Art]]|pages=315\u2013329|year=1998|isbn=978-0-87070-069-9}}</ref><ref name=\"Horsley\">Horsley, Carter B., ''Mud Pies, Jackson Pollock, Museum of Modern Art, November 1, 1998 to February 2, 1999, The Tate Gallery, London, March 11 to June 6, 1999'': [http://www.thecityreview.com/pollock.html \"While it is de rigueur to concentrate on the signature works that define an artist's \"style,\" it is very important to understand its evolution...\"]</ref>\n\n==Early life (1912\u20131936)==\nPaul Jackson Pollock was born in [[Cody, Wyoming]], in 1912,<ref name=iha>{{cite book|last=Piper|first=David|title=The Illustrated History of Art|year=2000|publisher=Chancellor Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-7537-0179-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/illustratedhisto0000pipe_t1d3/page/460 460\u2013461]|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedhisto0000pipe_t1d3/page/460}}</ref> the youngest of five sons.

With the help of a down-payment loan from Peggy Guggenheim, they bought a wood-frame house and barn at 830 Springs Fireplace Road. Pollock converted the barn into a studio.

Pollock's technique of pouring and dripping paint is thought to be one of the origins of the term [[action painting]]. With this technique, Pollock was able to achieve a more immediate means of creating art, the paint now literally flowing from his chosen tool onto the canvas. By defying the convention of painting on an upright surface, he added a new dimension by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions.\n\nOne definitive influence on Pollock was the work of the [[Ukrainian American]] artist [[Janet Sobel]] (1894\u20131968) (born Jennie Lechovsky).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hollistaggart.com/artists/biography/janet_sobel/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712213618/http://www.hollistaggart.com/artists/biography/janet_sobel/ |archive-date=2011-07-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Peggy Guggenheim included Sobel's work in her ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]'' in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/ideas/18624|title=Mother of Invention|author=Bob Duggan|work=Big Think}}</ref> Jackson Pollock and art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] saw Sobel's work there in 1946 and later Greenberg noted that Sobel was \"a direct influence on Jackson Pollock's drip painting technique.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Outliers and American vanguard art|last=Lynne|first=Cooke|others=National Gallery of Art (U.S.),, University of Chicago.

Referring to his style of painting on the floor, Pollock stated, \"I feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk round it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting. This is akin to the methods of the Indian sand painters of the West.\"<ref>Jackson Pollock, \"My Painting\", in ''Pollock: Painting'' (edited by Barbara Rose), New York: Agrinde Publications Ltd (1980), p. 65; originally published in ''Possibilities'' I, New York, Winter 1947-48</ref> Other influences on his drip technique include the Mexican [[mural]]ists and [[Surrealist]] automatism. Pollock denied reliance on \"the accident\"; he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular work to appear. His technique combined the movement of his body, over which he had control, the viscous flow of paint, the force of gravity, and the absorption of paint into the canvas. It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors. Flinging, dripping, pouring, and spattering, he would move energetically around the canvas, almost as if in a dance, and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see.\n\nAustrian artist [[Wolfgang Paalen]]'s article on totem art of the indigenous people of British Columbia, in which the concept of space in totemist art is considered from an artist's point of view, influenced Pollock as well; Pollock owned a signed and dedicated copy of the Amerindian Number of Paalen's magazine (DYN 4\u20135, 1943). He had also seen Paalen's surrealist paintings in an exhibition of in 1940.<ref>\u00bbIn Mexico City, he [Motherwell] visited Wolfgang Paalen whose show Baziotes and Jackson [Pollock] had seen at the Julien Levy Gallery the year before.\u00ab Steven Naifeh, p. 414.</ref> Another strong influence must have been Paalen's surrealist ''fumage'' technique, which appealed to painters looking for new ways to depict what was called the ''unseen'' or the ''possible''. The technique was once demonstrated in Matta's workshop, about which Steven Naifeh reports, \"Once, when Matta was demonstrating the Surrealist technique [Paalen's] Fumage, Jackson [Pollock] turned to (Peter) Busa and said in a stage whisper: 'I can do that without the smoke.'\"<ref>Steven Naifeh, p. 427.</ref> Pollock's painter friend [[Fritz Bultman]] even stated, \"It was Wolfgang Paalen who started it all.\"<ref>Steven Naifeh, p. 534.</ref>\n\nIn 1950, [[Hans Namuth]], a young photographer, wanted to take pictures (both stills and moving) of Pollock at work. Pollock promised to start a new painting especially for the photographic session, but when Namuth arrived, Pollock apologized and told him the painting was finished.\n\nNamuth said that when he entered the studio:\n\n{{quote|A dripping wet canvas covered the entire floor ... There was complete silence ... Pollock looked at the painting. Then, unexpectedly, he picked up can and paint brush and started to move around the canvas. It was as if he suddenly realized the painting was not finished. His movements, slow at first, gradually became faster and more dance like as he flung black, white, and rust colored paint onto the canvas. He completely forgot that Lee and I were there; he did not seem to hear the click of the camera shutter ... My photography session lasted as long as he kept painting, perhaps half an hour. In all that time, Pollock did not stop. How could one keep up this level of activity? Finally, he said 'This is it.'\n<br />\nPollock's finest paintings ... reveal that his all-over line does not give rise to positive or negative areas: we are not made to feel that one part of the canvas demands to be read as figure, whether abstract or representational, against another part of the canvas read as ground. There is not inside or outside to Pollock's line or the space through which it moves. ... Pollock has managed to free line not only from its function of representing objects in the world, but also from its task of describing or bounding shapes or figures, whether abstract or representational, on the surface of the canvas.|Karmel, 132}}\n\n===From naming to numbering===\nContinuing to evade the viewer's search for figurative elements in his paintings, Pollock abandoned titles and started numbering his works. He said about this, \"[L]ook passively and try to receive what the painting has to offer and not bring a subject matter or preconceived idea of what they are to be looking for.\" His wife said, \"He used to give his pictures conventional titles ... but now he simply numbers them. Numbers are neutral. They make people look at a picture for what it is\u2014pure painting.\"<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n===Critical debate===\nPollock's work has been the subject of important critical debates. The critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]] once derided a number of Pollock's works as \"mere unorganized explosions of random energy, and therefore meaningless.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/nyregion/05spotli.html Steven McElroy, \"If It's So Easy, Why Don't You Try It\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 3, 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Jean Helion]] the French abstract painter, on the other hand, on first seeing a \"Pollock,\" remarked, \"It filled out space going on and on because it did not have a start or end to it.\"<ref>Gray Martin, Quote in Book One 'Breaking the Ice' of 'Jackson Pollock -Memories arrested in Space', Santa Monica Press, 2003, {{ISBN|1891661329}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1952 article in ''ARTnews'', [[Harold Rosenberg]] coined the term \"[[action painting]]\" and wrote that \"what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event. The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint.' The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value&mdash;political, aesthetic, moral.\" Many people assumed that he had modeled his \"action painter\" paradigm on Pollock.\n\n[[Clement Greenberg]] supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds. It fit well with Greenberg's view of art history as a progressive purification in form and elimination of historical content. He considered Pollock's work to be the best painting of its day and the culmination of the Western tradition via [[Cubism]] and [[C\u00e9zanne]] to [[Manet]].\n\n''[[Reynold's News]]'', in a 1959 headline, said, \"This is not art&mdash;it's a joke in bad taste.\"<ref name=\"Expression of an age\"/>\n \nThe [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], an organization to promote American culture and values, backed by the [[CIA]], sponsored exhibitions of Pollock's work.

The script, by Christopher Cleveland, was to be based on [[Jeffrey Potter]]'s 1985 oral biography, ''To a Violent Grave,'' a collection of reminiscences by Pollock's friends. Streisand was to play the role of Lee Krasner, and De Niro was to portray Pollock.

Landau, one of the four sitting scholars from the former Pollock Krasner Foundation authentication panel from the 1990s, and Claude Cernuschi, a scholar in Abstract Expressionism. In the book, Ellen Landau demonstrates the many connections between the family who owns the paintings and Jackson Pollock during his lifetime to place the paintings in what she believes to be their proper historic context. Landau also presents the forensic findings of Harvard University and presents possible explanations for the forensic inconsistencies that were found in three of the 24 paintings.<ref name=PollockMatters1>Ellen G.

They were later archived with her own papers. The Archives of American Art also houses the Charles Pollock papers, which include correspondence, photographs, and other files relating to his brother Jackson.\n\nA separate organization, the [[Pollock-Krasner Foundation]], was established in 1985. The foundation functions as the official estate for both Pollock and his widow, but also under the terms of Krasner's will, serves \"to assist individual working artists of merit with financial need\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pkf.org/press.html |title=The Pollock-Krasner Foundation website: Press Release page |publisher=Pkf.org |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611094930/http://www.pkf.org/press.html |archivedate=June 11, 2015 }}</ref> The U.S. copyright representative for the Pollock-Krasner Foundation is the [[Artists Rights Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arsny.com/requested.html |title=Most frequently requested artists list of the Artists Rights Society |publisher=Arsny.com |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206001342/http://www.arsny.com/requested.html |archivedate=February 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pollock-Krasner House and Studio]] is owned and administered by the Stony Brook Foundation, a nonprofit affiliate of [[Stony Brook University]].

Her [[baptism]] was celebrated on 8 July in the [[Sant'Andrea delle Fratte|Basilica di Sant'Andrea delle Fratte]] and she was given the baptismal names \"Giuditta Adelaide Agata\".<ref name=EC/> The children were [[orphaned]] after her father died on 18 August 1863 when she was four (from a sudden and severe intestinal blockage in Ariccia) and her mother when she was seven (her mother remarried on 11 May 1865 but died on 6 November 1866); she was also separated from her siblings when she was sent to the Torlonia orphanage at Via Sant'Onofrio in Rome under the guidance of the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Vincentian Sisters]] until 1883.<ref name=SQPN/><ref name=EC/> Her brother was sent to live with their maternal uncle Gioacchino Papi while her sister was sent to the [[Sisters of St. Joseph|Sisters of Saint Joseph]]. Both her [[First Communion]] and [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] were celebrated on 19 March 1873. Vannini obtained a [[diploma]] as a [[kindergarten]] [[teacher]] but settled instead on the religious life.<ref name=SEB/>\n\nVannini entered the Vincentian Sisters on 3 March 1883 to become a [[Nun|professed religious]] and commenced her [[Novitiate|novitiate period]] in [[Siena]]; she was forced to leave due to ill health in 1887. Vannini had returned to Rome to recuperate and then in 1888 decided to resume her religious formation. But after she returned to Siena the order rejected her because she had been deemed unsuitable for formation.<ref name=SEB/><ref name=EC/> It was sometime later that she would meet [[Luigi Tezza]] (in a [[Confessional booth|confessional]] when she sought his advice) on 17 December 1891 at the end of a [[spiritual retreat]] she was attending; Tezza desired the establishment of an all-female [[religious congregation]] dedicated to caring for the sick and dying, and asked if Vannini would be interested in joining him.<ref name=SEB/> Vannini accepted Tezza's offer after discerning and reflecting on her vocation on 2 February 1892 and the two began to form a group of other women to serve as the basis for their congregation. The decisive moment came on 19 March 1892 when she and two companions received the [[scapular]] and the [[religious habit]] of the Camillian tertiaries and on 19 March 1893 professed her private vows as \"Giuseppina\". Her perpetual religious profession was made sometime later on 8 December 1895 after she established with Tezza the [[Daughters of St. Camillus|Daughters of Saint Camillus]] and she was made its [[Superior General]].<ref name=SQPN/> Her profession was made in private since her initial application for ecclesiastical approval of the order had been rejected.<ref name=EC/>\n\nBut she and Tezza faced difficulties soon after when [[Pope Leo XIII]] decided not to allow for the opening of new religious congregations around 1900 added with the unjust slander directed at Tezza which led to the [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]] [[Pietro Respighi]] sending him to [[Lima]] in [[Peru]] in 1900 to exercise his pastoral mission there. This new development prompted for the leadership of the order to fall to Vannini alone and she would maintain correspondence with Tezza until her death.<ref name=SEB/><ref name=EWTN/> The congregation received formal approval from Respighi on 21 June 1909 as an order of diocesan right.\n\nIn 1910 she visited the order's Italian houses and those in France before suffering from heart disease. Vannini died during the evening on 23 February 1911 in her bed in Rome from heart disease; her remains were interred in Rome but later relocated to the order's [[motherhouse]] in [[Grottaferrata]].<ref name=EC/><ref name=SEB/> The congregation received the decree of praise on 25 February 1922 from [[Pope Pius XI]] and received papal approval from Pius XI a decade later on 17 June 1931.<ref name=EWTN/> In late 2005 there are 823 religious in a total of 97 houses in places in [[Europe]] such as [[Poland]] and [[Portugal]]. The congregation also operates in [[Latin America]] in countries such as [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]] and also operates in [[Africa]] in [[Benin]] and [[Burkina Faso]].\n\n==Canonization==\nThe diocesan process for the beatification process commenced on 8 June 1955 and ended on 20 December 1956. Her spiritual writings were all collected and investigated while forming an essential part of the beatification process as being a vital component to investigating her virtues and her religious life; the decree on her writings was signed on 22 March 1961. The formal introduction of the cause \u2013 which titled Vannini as a [[Servant of God]] \u2013 came on 15 December 1977. The second process on her life and virtues was also held in order to collect additional supporting information while the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] validated these processes in Rome on 5 July 1985.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The [[Positio]] dossier \u2013 containing biographical details and championing her cause \u2013 was submitted to the C.C.S. officials in Rome in 1988. [[Theologians]] approved the cause on 26 October 1991 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members on 7 January 1992. [[Pope John Paul II]] declared Vannini to be [[Venerable]] on 7 March 1992 on the account of her model life of [[heroic virtue]] which she practiced throughout her life.<ref name=SQPN/>\n\nHer beatification depended upon papal confirmation of a miraculous healing attributed to her intercession that neither science or medicine could explain. The miracle required was investigated in the diocese that it originated in and the C.C.S. validated that process on 20 December 1985. The panel of medical experts (not all of them Catholic) met and approved the healing as having no scientific or medical explanation on 16 March 1993; theologians approved it as well on 4 June 1993 as having occurred due to Vannini's intercession. The C.C.S. itself also approved the healing as a legitimate miracle on 5 October 1993 and passed it onto the pope who approved it on 23 December 1993. John Paul II celebrated her beatification on 16 October 1994 (it was celebrated during the Ninth General Assembly of the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|Synod of Bishops]] on the theme of consecrated life in the world).<ref name=SQPN/><ref name=SEB/>\n\nThe second and final miracle required for her to be canonized was investigated in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sinop|Sinop diocese]] in [[Brazil]] from 1 to 4 December 2015 before the information collected was transmitted to the C.C.S. in Rome for evaluation later that month; it involved the cure of a [[construction worker]]. Medical experts approved the miracle on 27 September 2018 as did theologians on 19 February 2019 and the C.C.S. members just a couple of months later on 7 May. [[Pope Francis]] signed the decree recognizing the healing in question as a miracle on 13 May 2019 that enabled for Vannini to be canonized. The pope convened a [[Papal consistory|gathering of cardinals]] on 1 July 2019 to schedule the date for the canonization. The Pope canonized her in [[Saint Peter's Square]] on 13 October 2019.<ref name=VN/><ref name=CN/><ref name=CP/>\n\nThe  [[postulator]] for the cause is Sr. Bernadette Rosoni; the postulator before that was Sr. Gabriella Marzio.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://newsaints.faithweb.com/year/1911.htm#Vannini Hagiography Circle]\n* [http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-josephine-vannini/ Saints SQPN]\n* [http://www.figliedisancamillo.org Daughters of Saint Camillus]\n\n{{Portal|Saints|Biography|Catholicism|Italy}}\n{{Canonization}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vannini, Giuditta}}\n[[Category:1859 births]]\n[[Category:1911 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian people]]\n[[Category:19th-century Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:19th-century venerated Christians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian people]]\n[[Category:20th-century Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:20th-century venerated Christians]]\n[[Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II]]\n[[Category:Camillians]]\n[[Category:Canonizations by Pope Francis]]\n[[Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities]]\n[[Category:Italian beatified people]]\n[[Category:Italian nuns]]\n[[Category:Italian Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:People from Rome]]\n[[Category:Superiors General]]\n[[Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox saint\n|name            = [[Canonization|Saint]]<br>Giuditta Vannini\n|image           = \n|imagesize       = \n|caption         = \n|birth_name      = Giuditta Adelaide Agata Vannini\n|birth_date      = {{Birth date|1859|07|07|df=yes}}\n|birth_place     = [[Rome]], [[Papal States]]\n|death_date      = {{Death date and age|1911|02|23|1859|07|07|df=yes}}\n|death_place     = Rome, [[Kingdom of Italy]]\n|titles          = Religious\n|known_for       = \n|occupation      = \n|resting_place   = \n|venerated_in    = [[Roman Catholic Church]]\n|feast_day       = [[23 February]]\n|attributes      = [[Religious habit]]\n|patronage       = [[Daughters of St. Camillus|Daughters of Saint Camillus]]\n|beatified_date  = 16 October 1994\n|beatified_place = [[Saint Peter's Square]], [[Vatican City]]\n|beatified_by    = [[Pope John Paul II]]\n|canonized_date  = 13 October 2019\n|canonized_place = Saint Peter's Square, Vatican City\n|canonized_by    = [[Pope Francis]]}}\n\n'''Giuditta Vannini''' (7 July 1859 \u2013 23 February 1911)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2019-10/biography-giuseppina-vannini-orphan-to-carer-for-sick.html|title=Giuseppina Vannini: From being an orphan to caring for the sick - Vatican News|date=2019-10-12|website=www.vaticannews.va|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> \u2013 also known as '''Giuseppina''' \u2013 was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[nun]] who became a [[Camillians|Camillian]].

Her [[baptism]] was celebrated on 8 July in the [[Sant'Andrea delle Fratte|Basilica di Sant'Andrea delle Fratte]] and she was given the baptismal names \"Giuditta Adelaide Agata\".<ref name=EC/> The children were [[orphaned]] after her father died on 18 August 1863 when she was four (from a sudden and severe intestinal blockage in Ariccia) and her mother when she was seven (her mother remarried on 11 May 1865 but died on 6 November 1866); she was also separated from her siblings when she was sent to the Torlonia orphanage at Via Sant'Onofrio in Rome under the guidance of the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Vincentian Sisters]] until 1883.<ref name=SQPN/><ref name=EC/> Her brother was sent to live with their maternal uncle Gioacchino Papi while her sister was sent to the [[Sisters of St. Joseph|Sisters of Saint Joseph]]. Both her [[First Communion]] and [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] were celebrated on 19 March 1873. Vannini obtained a [[diploma]] as a [[kindergarten]] [[teacher]] but settled instead on the religious life.<ref name=SEB/>\n\nVannini entered the Vincentian Sisters on 3 March 1883 to become a [[Nun|professed religious]] and commenced her [[Novitiate|novitiate period]] in [[Siena]]; she was forced to leave due to ill health in 1887. Vannini had returned to Rome to recuperate and then in 1888 decided to resume her religious formation. But after she returned to Siena the order rejected her because she had been deemed unsuitable for formation.<ref name=SEB/><ref name=EC/> It was sometime later that she would meet [[Luigi Tezza]] (in a [[Confessional booth|confessional]] when she sought his advice) on 17 December 1891 at the end of a [[spiritual retreat]] she was attending; Tezza desired the establishment of an all-female [[religious congregation]] dedicated to caring for the sick and dying, and asked if Vannini would be interested in joining him.<ref name=SEB/> Vannini accepted Tezza's offer after discerning and reflecting on her vocation on 2 February 1892 and the two began to form a group of other women to serve as the basis for their congregation. The decisive moment came on 19 March 1892 when she and two companions received the [[scapular]] and the [[religious habit]] of the Camillian tertiaries and on 19 March 1893 professed her private vows as \"Giuseppina\". Her perpetual religious profession was made sometime later on 8 December 1895 after she established with Tezza the [[Daughters of St. Camillus|Daughters of Saint Camillus]] and she was made its [[Superior General]].<ref name=SQPN/> Her profession was made in private since her initial application for ecclesiastical approval of the order had been rejected.<ref name=EC/>\n\nBut she and Tezza faced difficulties soon after when [[Pope Leo XIII]] decided not to allow for the opening of new religious congregations around 1900 added with the unjust slander directed at Tezza which led to the [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]] [[Pietro Respighi]] sending him to [[Lima]] in [[Peru]] in 1900 to exercise his pastoral mission there. This new development prompted for the leadership of the order to fall to Vannini alone and she would maintain correspondence with Tezza until her death.<ref name=SEB/><ref name=EWTN/> The congregation received formal approval from Respighi on 21 June 1909 as an order of diocesan right.\n\nIn 1910 she visited the order's Italian houses and those in France before suffering from heart disease. Vannini died during the evening on 23 February 1911 in her bed in Rome from heart disease; her remains were interred in Rome but later relocated to the order's [[motherhouse]] in [[Grottaferrata]].<ref name=EC/><ref name=SEB/> The congregation received the decree of praise on 25 February 1922 from [[Pope Pius XI]] and received papal approval from Pius XI a decade later on 17 June 1931.<ref name=EWTN/> In late 2005 there are 823 religious in a total of 97 houses in places in [[Europe]] such as [[Poland]] and [[Portugal]]. The congregation also operates in [[Latin America]] in countries such as [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]] and also operates in [[Africa]] in [[Benin]] and [[Burkina Faso]].\n\n==Canonization==\nThe diocesan process for the beatification process commenced on 8 June 1955 and ended on 20 December 1956. Her spiritual writings were all collected and investigated while forming an essential part of the beatification process as being a vital component to investigating her virtues and her religious life; the decree on her writings was signed on 22 March 1961. The formal introduction of the cause \u2013 which titled Vannini as a [[Servant of God]] \u2013 came on 15 December 1977. The second process on her life and virtues was also held in order to collect additional supporting information while the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] validated these processes in Rome on 5 July 1985.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The [[Positio]] dossier \u2013 containing biographical details and championing her cause \u2013 was submitted to the C.C.S. officials in Rome in 1988. [[Theologians]] approved the cause on 26 October 1991 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members on 7 January 1992. [[Pope John Paul II]] declared Vannini to be [[Venerable]] on 7 March 1992 on the account of her model life of [[heroic virtue]] which she practiced throughout her life.<ref name=SQPN/>\n\nHer beatification depended upon papal confirmation of a miraculous healing attributed to her intercession that neither science or medicine could explain. The miracle required was investigated in the diocese that it originated in and the C.C.S. validated that process on 20 December 1985. The panel of medical experts (not all of them Catholic) met and approved the healing as having no scientific or medical explanation on 16 March 1993; theologians approved it as well on 4 June 1993 as having occurred due to Vannini's intercession. The C.C.S. itself also approved the healing as a legitimate miracle on 5 October 1993 and passed it onto the pope who approved it on 23 December 1993. John Paul II celebrated her beatification on 16 October 1994 (it was celebrated during the Ninth General Assembly of the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)|Synod of Bishops]] on the theme of consecrated life in the world).<ref name=SQPN/><ref name=SEB/>\n\nThe second and final miracle required for her to be canonized was investigated in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sinop|Sinop diocese]] in [[Brazil]] from 1 to 4 December 2015 before the information collected was transmitted to the C.C.S. in Rome for evaluation later that month; it involved the cure of a [[construction worker]]. Medical experts approved the miracle on 27 September 2018 as did theologians on 19 February 2019 and the C.C.S. members just a couple of months later on 7 May. [[Pope Francis]] signed the decree recognizing the healing in question as a miracle on 13 May 2019 that enabled for Vannini to be canonized. The pope convened a [[Papal consistory|gathering of cardinals]] on 1 July 2019 to schedule the date for the canonization. The Pope canonized her in [[Saint Peter's Square]] on 13 October 2019.<ref name=VN/><ref name=CN/><ref name=CP/>\n\nThe  [[postulator]] for the cause is Sr. Bernadette Rosoni; the postulator before that was Sr. Gabriella Marzio.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://newsaints.faithweb.com/year/1911.htm#Vannini Hagiography Circle]\n* [http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-josephine-vannini/ Saints SQPN]\n* [http://www.figliedisancamillo.org Daughters of Saint Camillus]\n\n{{Portal|Saints|Biography|Catholicism|Italy}}\n{{Canonization}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vannini, Giuditta}}\n[[Category:1859 births]]\n[[Category:1911 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian people]]\n[[Category:19th-century Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:19th-century venerated Christians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian people]]\n[[Category:20th-century Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:20th-century venerated Christians]]\n[[Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II]]\n[[Category:Camillians]]\n[[Category:Canonizations by Pope Francis]]\n[[Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities]]\n[[Category:Italian beatified people]]\n[[Category:Italian nuns]]\n[[Category:Italian Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:People from Rome]]\n[[Category:Superiors General]]\n[[Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II]]\n", "name_user": "Kahtar", "label": "safe", "comment": "Repair CS1 error(s), replaced: website=www. \u2192 website= (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuditta_Vannini"}

Though surviving when many do not and displaying an honorable sense of [[Personal character|individual character]], Curzon finally determines his willingness to sacrifice his life during the fateful offensive of the [[Central powers]] enacted in 1918.

In fact, a persistent yet unsubstantiated rumor states that [[Adolf Hitler]] was so impressed with the novel that he made it required reading for his top field commanders and general staff, in the hopes that it would allow prominent German officers to be able to understand how their British counterparts thought.

This rumor is referred to as fact by Forester in a foreword to a later edition of the novel.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nHistorian [[Max Hastings]], in his book ''Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes to War'', calls ''The General'' \"brilliantly contemptuous\", and writes that \"[Forester] likened the commanders of World War I to savages, striving to extract a screw from a piece of timber by main force, assisted by ever more fulcrums and levers\" failing to grasp that simply ''twisting'' the screw would remove it \"with a fraction of the effort.\"  Hastings remarks: <blockquote>This view of wartime generalship, which was essentially also that of [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], has commanded widespread favour ever since. But what if, as most scholars of the conflict today believe, it was impossible to 'turn the screw', to identify any credible means for breaking the stalemate?<ref name=hastings>[[Max Hastings|Hasting, Max]] (2013) ''Catastrophe 1914: Europe Goes to War'' New York: Vintage. p.551. {{isbn|978-0-307-74383-1}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Books|History|War}}\n*[[Historical fiction]]\n*[[World War I in popular culture]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{FadedPage|id=20180414|name=The General}}\n\n{{C.
