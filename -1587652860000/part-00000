The [[tram]] network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], along with urban [[trolleybus]] and [[bus]] routes as well as two [[funicular]] railways and one [[rack railway]]. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system.

Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle.

Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network.

The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids.

Both [[Stadler Rail]] and [[Siemens]] filed complaints with the [[Administrative Court of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich]], causing the finalisation of the contract to be suspended, but the court ruled in February 2017 that VBZ could conclude the contract with Bombardier. After both Stadler and Siemens decided not to appeal this decision to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], the contract was finally signed on 2 March 2017.

The [[tram]] network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], along with urban [[trolleybus]] and [[bus]] routes as well as two [[funicular]] railways and one [[rack railway]]. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The line opened in 1912 as a rural tramway connecting at Rehalp with the city trams, with inter-running as far as the city centre. The line has since been rebuilt with more railway characteristics, and quite substantial trains, but these continue to operate across the city tram network between [[Z\u00fcrich Stadelhofen railway station|Stadelhofen]] in the city centre and Rehalp.\n|-\n|'''[[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]]'''\n|VBZ\n|1950\n|\n|\n|Owned by city of Z\u00fcrich.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n|-\n|'''''[[BDWM Transport AG]]'''''\n|BDWM\n|2000\n|\n|\n|Created by amalgamation of the BD with the bus operator WM.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles. The ''Karpfen'' last ran in regular service in 2006, and the ''Mirage'' in 2010.

Beyond Rehalp the trains use the FB's own segregated tracks to reach their outer terminus at [[Esslingen, Switzerland|Esslingen]].<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/>\n\nOn the last weekend of each month, the [[Z\u00fcrich Tram Museum]] operates tram route 21 from the city centre to the museum at Burgwies (up to Rehalp at Saturdays), using their own heritage rolling stock.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tram-museum.ch/content.php?id=5&lang=en | title = The Museum Line 21 | publisher = Z\u00fcrich Tram Museum | accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Infrastructure===\n[[File:Z\u00fcrich - Stadelhoferplatz IMG 4441.JPG|thumb|Raised platforms for use with low-floor trams, being used by a high-floor tram]]\nZ\u00fcrich's tram network is built to [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge). There are {{convert|171.9|km|mi}} of track, equating to a network length of {{convert|72.9|km|mi}} and a total route length of {{convert|118.7|km|mi}}. The tracks are electrified using [[overhead line]] at 600 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], utilising a supply system shared with the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus network]].<ref name=\"figures\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/die_vbz/portraet/zahlen_fakten/linien.html |title=Startseite VBZ - Die VBZ - Portr\u00e4t - Zahlen & Fakten - Linien |publisher=Stadt Z\u00fcrich [City of Z\u00fcrich] |language=German |trans-title=Home VBZ - VBZ - Portrait - Facts & Figures - Lines |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nThe VBZ infrastructure within Z\u00fcrich is largely street based, with varying degrees of segregation from other street traffic and significant sections where trams run in unrestricted traffic lanes. In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. By contrast, on VBG infrastructure in the Stadtbahn Glattal, VBZ trams operate on long stretches of dedicated track.<ref name=gpw>{{cite web | title = Gleisplan - Stra\u00dfenbahn Z\u00fcrich mit Glattal |  url = http://www.gleisplanweb.eu/Maps/Zuerich.pdf | language = German | trans-title = Trackplan - Z\u00fcrich with Glattal | date = 2014-01-23 | accessdate = 2014-06-21}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nMany of Z\u00fcrich's tram stops have been equipped with boarding platforms raised to match the floor height of the low floor trams, although there are still examples of stops where passengers must board from street level. Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided. In consequence all terminal locations are equipped with [[turning loop]]s, and all tram stops are to the [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]] of the tram.<ref name=gpw/>\n\n===Depots and workshops===\n[[File:Tramdepot Zuerich 1911 Friedrich Fissler.jpg|thumb|left|The tram depot at Hard was built in 1911]]\nZ\u00fcrich's tram fleet is kept in the five operational depots of Hard, Irchel, Kalkbreite, Oerlikon and  Wollishofen, together with a permanent way yard at Hardturm. Whilst these depots have the capability to undertake minor maintenance, heavier maintenance is the responsibility of the VBZ's central workshop at Altstetten. This is connected to the tram network, and also has a rail connection to the [[Swiss Federal Railway]] system, allowing the delivery of infrastructure items and vehicles by rail.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=zws>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/werkstatt.html | title = Werkstatt | language = German | trans-title = Workshop | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the above depots and workshops, two other former tram depots, at Burgweis and Wartau, are also still connected to the tram network. Burgweis depot now houses the [[Tram-Museum Z\u00fcrich]] main collection, whilst Wartau is used as a workshop by that organisation. The rail connections permit the occasional operation of preserved trams on the VBZ network.<ref name=gpw/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Tram fleet===\nAs of 2012, the VBZ owns 313 tram vehicles, which between them cover over 16 million vehicle-kilometres per year. All regular public services are covered by 289 vehicles of two basic classes, with the remainder of the fleet made up of a number of assorted works vehicles, including some used for the cargo tram service, and heritage vehicles.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network. Free transfer is permitted between different vehicles, routes, modes and operators, provided a ticket valid for the whole journey is held.<ref name=vbzfzs>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Fare zone system | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe ZVV system is zone-based, with fares for individual journeys set by the zones the journey passes through. The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes. Both single journey and day tickets are available, as are a number of passes with longer validities.<ref name=vbzfzs/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zvv.ch/export/sites/default/common-images/content-image-gallery/linien-zonen-pdfs/Tarifzonen_Kanton_Zuerich_2011.pdf | title = Tarifzonen - Fare zones | publisher = ZVV | accessdate = 2012-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===Cargo tram===\n[[File:Cargo Tram outside Zurich Hauptbahnhof.JPG|thumb|left|The cargo tram]]\nBesides its passenger transport activities, VBZ, jointly with the city refuse and recycling department ERZ, operates the cargo tram to collect bulky waste. The cargo tram serves 10 different collection points around Z\u00fcrich, calling at each on different days of the month. The collected refuse is taken to a specially constructed siding at the ERZ yard adjacent to the Werdh\u00f6lzli tram terminus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | title = Cargo- und E-Tram | language = German | trans-title = Cargo- and E-Tram | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120829085657/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | archivedate = 2012-08-29 }}</ref><ref name=amcargo>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/cargotram.html | title = Cargotram -  Z\u00fcrich's domestic refuse takes to the rails | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = August 2003 | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2014&item=140114 | title = Cargotram serves additional destination | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = 2014-01-14 | accessdate = 2014-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe service was introduced in 2003, as an attempt to reduce the amount of bulky waste items dumped illegally every year.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=210610a | title = Tango, Combino or Flexity? | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=201112 | title = New tram order: The ball is rolling | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = November 2012 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2013&item=080413 | title = Five suppliers vie for tram contract | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = April 2013 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2015&item=260215 | title = More gloom over tram order | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million [[Swiss Franc]]s to [[Bombardier Transportation]] for the supply of 70<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/tram-zuerich-flexity-kommt-erst-im-sommer-2020-zum-einsatz-ld.1524125 | title = Das erste Flexity-Tram kurvt durch Z\u00fcrich \u2013 aber Passagiere d\u00fcrfen noch lange nicht mitfahren | language = German |  work =  Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung | date = 25 November 2019 | accessdate = 25 November 2019}}</ref> 7-section [[Flexity 2]] trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023.

Fenton]]'s [[Governor of New York|governorship]], in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].\n\n==Background==\nUnder the provisions of the [[New York Constitution]] of 1846, 32 Senators and 128 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (four districts) and Kings County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards,<ref>Except New York City where the wards were apportioned into election districts, and then some whole wards and some election districts of other wards were gerrymandered together into Assembly districts.</ref> forming a contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nOn April 16, 1866, the Legislature re-apportioned the Assembly seats per county. Allegany, Chenango, Herkimer, Jefferson, Livingston, Steuben and Suffolk counties lost one seat each; Erie County gained one seat, Kings County gained two seats; and New York County gained four seats.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UHZZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1301 ''Laws of the State of New York'' (89th session)] (1866; pg. 1301f, Chap. 607 \"AN ACT for the apportionment of the Members of Assembly of this State\")</ref>\n\nOn April 25, 1866, the Legislature re-apportioned the Senate districts.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UHZZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1762 ''Laws of the State of New York'' (89th session)] (1866; pg. 1762ff, Chap. 805 \"AN ACT to organize the Senate Districts of the State\")</ref>\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. During the [[American Civil War]] many [[War Democrats]] had joined the Republicans, and after the end of the war the parties re-aligned, leaving the Democrats in a minority. To increase their ranks, the Democrats now proposed to form a \"Conservative Union\" of Democrats and Conservative Republicans, and nominated a state ticket with Democrat [[John T. Hoffman]] for Governor, and Republican [[Robert H. Pruyn]] for Lieutenant Governor.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York state election, 1866]] was held on November 6. Gov. [[Reuben E. Fenton]] was re-elected. [[Stewart L. Woodford]] (R) was elected Lieutenant Governor, and the other two statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the Republicans too. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Republicans 366,000 and Conservative Union 352,000. According to the Constitution of 1846, twenty years after its elaboration the electorate was asked if they wanted a Constitutional Convention to be held, which was answered in the affirmative.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 1, 1867; and adjourned on April 20.\n\n[[Edmund L. Pitts]] (R) was elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] with 80 votes against 43 for [[Jarvis Lord]] (D).\n\nOn January 15, [[United States Senate election in New York, 1867|the Legislature elected]] [[Roscoe Conkling]] (R) to succeed [[Ira Harris]] as [[U.S. Senator from New York]] for a six-year term beginning on March 4, 1867.\n\nOn January 25, the State Senate concluded the trial of [[George W. Smith (judge)|George W. Smith]], Judge of the Oneida County Court, and removed Smith from office.\n\nOn January 31, [[Charles J. Folger]] was re-elected President pro tempore of the State Senate.\n\nOn April 1, [[John O'Donnell (Lewis County, NY)|John O'Donnell]] (R) was elected President pro tempore \"for the evening.\"\n\nOn April 10, [[Henry C. Murphy]] (D) was elected President pro tempore \"for the day.\"\n\nOn April 23, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention were elected, resulting in a Republican majority.\n\nOn June 4, the [[New York Constitution#Constitutional Convention of 1867-1868|Constitutional Convention]] met at Albany. [[William A. Wheeler]] was chosen President, and [[Luther Caldwell]] Secretary. On the opening day, one of the delegates, Assemblyman [[L. Harris Hiscock]] was murdered at Stanwix Hall (a hotel in Albany).\n\nOn September 23, the Constitutional Convention adjourned.\n\nOn November 5, the [[New York state election, 1867]], was held. All eight statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the Democrats, and a Democratic majority was elected to the Assembly.\n\nOn November 12, the Constitutional Convention met again, and adjourned ''sine die'' on February 28, 1868. How to put the proposed amendments before the electorate was then debated throughout the 91st and the 92nd Legislatures, and all amendments, except the re-organization of the judicial system, were eventually rejected by the voters at the [[New York state election, 1869]].\n\n==State Senate==\n===Districts===\n'''Note''': The Senators in the 90th Legislature had been elected in November 1865 for a two-year term under the apportionment of 1857, as listed below.

Fenton]]'s [[Governor of New York|governorship]], in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].\n\n==Background==\nUnder the provisions of the [[New York Constitution]] of 1846, 32 Senators and 128 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (four districts) and Kings County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards,<ref>Except New York City where the wards were apportioned into election districts, and then some whole wards and some election districts of other wards were gerrymandered together into Assembly districts.</ref> forming a contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nOn April 16, 1866, the Legislature re-apportioned the Assembly seats per county. Allegany, Chenango, Herkimer, Jefferson, Livingston, Steuben and Suffolk counties lost one seat each; Erie County gained one seat, Kings County gained two seats; and New York County gained four seats.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UHZZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1301 ''Laws of the State of New York'' (89th session)] (1866; pg. 1301f, Chap. 607 \"AN ACT for the apportionment of the Members of Assembly of this State\")</ref>\n\nOn April 25, 1866, the Legislature re-apportioned the Senate districts.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UHZZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1762 ''Laws of the State of New York'' (89th session)] (1866; pg. 1762ff, Chap. 805 \"AN ACT to organize the Senate Districts of the State\")</ref>\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. During the [[American Civil War]] many [[War Democrats]] had joined the Republicans, and after the end of the war the parties re-aligned, leaving the Democrats in a minority. To increase their ranks, the Democrats now proposed to form a \"Conservative Union\" of Democrats and Conservative Republicans, and nominated a state ticket with Democrat [[John T. Hoffman]] for Governor, and Republican [[Robert H. Pruyn]] for Lieutenant Governor.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York state election, 1866]] was held on November 6. Gov. [[Reuben E. Fenton]] was re-elected. [[Stewart L. Woodford]] (R) was elected Lieutenant Governor, and the other two statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the Republicans too. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Republicans 366,000 and Conservative Union 352,000. According to the Constitution of 1846, twenty years after its elaboration the electorate was asked if they wanted a Constitutional Convention to be held, which was answered in the affirmative.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 1, 1867; and adjourned on April 20.\n\n[[Edmund L. Pitts]] (R) was elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] with 80 votes against 43 for [[Jarvis Lord]] (D).\n\nOn January 15, [[United States Senate election in New York, 1867|the Legislature elected]] [[Roscoe Conkling]] (R) to succeed [[Ira Harris]] as [[U.S. Senator from New York]] for a six-year term beginning on March 4, 1867.\n\nOn January 25, the State Senate concluded the trial of [[George W. Smith (judge)|George W. Smith]], Judge of the Oneida County Court, and removed Smith from office.\n\nOn January 31, [[Charles J. Folger]] was re-elected President pro tempore of the State Senate.\n\nOn April 1, [[John O'Donnell (Lewis County, NY)|John O'Donnell]] (R) was elected President pro tempore \"for the evening.\"\n\nOn April 10, [[Henry C. Murphy]] (D) was elected President pro tempore \"for the day.\"\n\nOn April 23, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention were elected, resulting in a Republican majority.\n\nOn June 4, the [[New York Constitution#Constitutional Convention of 1867-1868|Constitutional Convention]] met at Albany. [[William A. Wheeler]] was chosen President, and [[Luther Caldwell]] Secretary. On the opening day, one of the delegates, Assemblyman [[L. Harris Hiscock]] was murdered at Stanwix Hall (a hotel in Albany).\n\nOn September 23, the Constitutional Convention adjourned.\n\nOn November 5, the [[New York state election, 1867]], was held. All eight statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the Democrats, and a Democratic majority was elected to the Assembly.\n\nOn November 12, the Constitutional Convention met again, and adjourned ''sine die'' on February 28, 1868. How to put the proposed amendments before the electorate was then debated throughout the 91st and the 92nd Legislatures, and all amendments, except the re-organization of the judicial system, were eventually rejected by the voters at the [[New York state election, 1869]].\n\n==State Senate==\n===Districts===\n'''Note''': The Senators in the 90th Legislature had been elected in November 1865 for a two-year term under the apportionment of 1857, as listed below.

The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (four districts) and Kings County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[1865 New York state election]] was held on November 7. All ten statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the Republicans. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Secretary of State, was: Republicans 301,000 and Democrats 273,000.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 2, 1866; and adjourned on April 20.\n\n[[Lyman Tremain]] (R) was elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] with 88 votes against 33 for [[Smith M. Weed]] (D).\n\nOn January 29, [[DeWitt C. Littlejohn]] (R) was elected Speaker pro tempore of the Assembly.\n\nOn February 6, [[Charles J. Folger]] (R) was re-elected President pro tempore of the State Senate.\n\nOn February 16, the Legislature elected [[Benjamin F. Manierre]] (R) to succeed [[William McMurray (politician)|William McMurray]] (D) on March 1 as a Metropolitan Police Commissioner.\n\nOn April 16, the Legislature re-apportioned the Assembly seats per county. Allegany, Chenango, Herkimer, Jefferson, Livingston, Steuben and Suffolk counties lost one seat each; Erie County gained one seat, Kings County gained two seats; and New York County gained four seats.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UHZZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1301 ''Laws of the State of New York'' (89th session)] (1866; pg. 1301f, Chap. 607 \"AN ACT for the apportionment of the Members of Assembly of this State\")</ref>\n\nOn April 25, the Legislature re-apportioned the Senate districts.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=UHZZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1762 ''Laws of the State of New York'' (89th session)] (1866; pg. 1762ff, Chap. 805 \"AN ACT to organize the Senate Districts of the State\")</ref>\n\nThe State Senate met for a special session on June 12; adjourned on June 15; met again on August 28; and adjourned again on August 31.

Fenton]]'s [[Governor of New York|governorship]], in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].\n\n==Background==\nUnder the provisions of the [[New York Constitution]] of 1846, 32 Senators and 128 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (four districts) and Kings County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[1865 New York state election]] was held on November 7. All ten statewide elective offices up for election were carried by the Republicans. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Secretary of State, was: Republicans 301,000 and Democrats 273,000.\n\n==Sessions==\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on January 2, 1866; and adjourned on April 20.\n\n[[Lyman Tremain]] (R) was elected [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] with 88 votes against 33 for [[Smith M. Weed]] (D).\n\nOn January 29, [[DeWitt C. Littlejohn]] (R) was elected Speaker pro tempore of the Assembly.\n\nOn February 6, [[Charles J. Folger]] (R) was re-elected President pro tempore of the State Senate.\n\nOn February 16, the Legislature elected [[Benjamin F. Manierre]] (R) to succeed [[William McMurray (politician)|William McMurray]] (D) on March 1 as a Metropolitan Police Commissioner.\n\nOn April 16, the Legislature re-apportioned the Assembly seats per county.

Building on their successes in 1858, Republican candidates won increasing percentages in the House. After secessionist vacancies, their caucus of 108 amounted to 59% of the House, and with another 16% in the Unionist caucus, they had over a two-thirds super-majority to govern.<ref>Martis (1994), pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nFollowing Lincoln's election and before his inauguration, seven secessionist states declared rebellion and Jefferson Davis mobilized 100,000 troops in defense of the Confederacy. Lincoln responded with a call-up of 75,000 troops to reoccupy federal property in port cities. That motivated another four border states to declare [[Ordinance of Secession|secession]], forming the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that fought the [[American Civil War]].\n\nSeceding states cancelled elections to Federal office, and all but a few of their Representatives departed. Twenty-three representatives to U.S. 37th Congress came from five slave-holding states represented in the Confederacy: Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and Louisiana. The rebellion left seventeen vacancies in those states. Meanwhile for the duration of the conflict those same five states sent full delegations to the Confederate Congress even though over half their Congressional districts were federally occupied or disrupted by the end of 1862.<ref>Martis (1994), pp. 47.</ref>\n\nOverwhelmingly, seceding states had [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] representation, so despite losing seats to Democrats{{efn | name=\"ID\"}} in the North, this state-by-state mass departure left Republicans with a clear House majority. Remaining Representatives of all parties were united in support for the Union. Representatives opposing Democrats but not wishing to affiliate with Republicans, and wishing to emphasize support for the Union and opposition to secession, coalesced as the [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist Party]]. Many of these Unionists were from Southern states. The [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Know Nothing|American Party]] disappeared, with its remaining support usually absorbed by Unionists.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Election summaries==\n[[#California|California]] was [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] one additional seat for the 37th Congress,<ref>{{USStat|12|411}}</ref> increasing the total seats to 239.\n\n[[Ordinance_of_Secession|Secession]] of Southern states vacated many seats. Few Representatives from these states remained. Missing Representatives were overwhelmingly Democrats, boosting Republican control. Several states held elections for the 37th Congress, but seceded before Congress convened, so the elected Representatives never served. Other seceding states held no elections.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:59.02%;\" | '''108'''\n| style=\"background:{{Unionist Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:16.39%;\" | '''30'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:0.55%;\" | '''1'''\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:24.04%;\" | '''44'''\n\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Republican'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Unionist Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Unionist'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Independent Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''ID'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n|}\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | State\n! rowspan=2 | Type\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! rowspan=2 | Total<br/>seats\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Republican}} | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Democratic}} | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Unionist}} | [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist]]{{efn | Includes Unionists, Constitutional Unionists, and the two \"Union\" members from [[Rhode Island]].}}\n! colspan=2 | Others\n\n|-\n! {{Party shading/Republican}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Republican}} | Change\n! {{Party shading/Democratic}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Democratic}} | Change\n! {{Party shading/Unionist}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Unionist}} | Change\n!

Before 1872, different states held elections at various times; the first elections for the 37th Congress were held on August 6, 1860 in [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], while the last election took place in [[California]] on September 4, 1861, a year later. Three Southern states \u2013 [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], and [[South Carolina]] \u2013 chose Representatives before the presidential election, electing seven Democrats and two independents. These were the only House elections from the seceding states to the 37th Congress. After South Carolina resolved disunion and the [[Confederate States of America]] was formed, other Southern states declared as well and elected Representatives to the new [[Congress of the Confederate States]] instead of the United States Congress.\n\nSince the states not holding elections had many strong Democratic districts \u2013 in the previous [[36th United States Congress|36th Congress]] their Representatives included a total of 46 Democrats, 14 [[Opposition Party (Southern U.S.)|Oppositionists]], five independents, and one member of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] \u2013 when Congress was called into session on July 4, 1861 (five months earlier than usual at the time) the size of the Democratic House caucus had been drastically reduced, resulting in a huge Republican majority.\n\nOf the 183 seats, 102 were held by Republicans, 45 by Democrats,{{efn | name=\"ID\"}} 23 by Unionists, and five others by one party each.

They were held before, during and after the pre-determined Presidential campaign. And they were held before, during and after the secessionist campaigns in various states as they were reported throughout the country. Political conditions varied hugely from time to time during the course of congressional selection, but they had been shifting to a considerable extent in the years running up to the crisis.<ref>Martis, p. 36.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1856 United States House of Representatives elections|1856 elections]], the Democrats had taken the Presidency for the sixth time in the last 40 years, with James Buchanan's victory over John C. Fremont and Millard Fillmore. They held almost a two-thirds majority in both the US House and Senate. Democrats held onto the Senate during the midterm elections, but the four opposition parties then amounted to two-thirds of the House. The congressional elections in 1860 transformed Democratic fortunes: Republican and Unionist candidates won a two-thirds majority in both House and Senate.<ref>Martis, p. 34.</ref>\n\nAfter the secessionist withdrawal, resignation and expulsion, the Democrats would have less than 25% of the House for the 37th Congress, and that minority divided further between pro-unionists (Stephen Douglas), and anti-war (Clement Vallandingham) factions.<ref>Martis, pp. 114, 115.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Results by region ==\n\nThe politics of these elections were distinctive in every region of the country.

In a time before the Census Department published aggregate population data by Congressional District, the reader may have ready access to census data identifying the make up of those each district by referring to their respective articles.\n\nThe articles use different formats. The constituent counties of Congressional Districts are sometimes listed in a contents heading \"List of representatives\" within tables. These tables have a column naming the District's counties for each election, such as (a) \"District Area\" for Massachusetts, or (b) \"Area\" for Illinois and Maryland. Virginia uses \"Historical composition of the district\" to describe composition at each reapportionment. Pennsylvania notes the home county of the elected representative, sometimes holding the largest population for respective districts. Minnesota makes a geographical allusion for its 1st District applicable to the 37th Congress. Michigan uses \"History\" since 1852 for its 4th district.

Building on their successes in 1858, Republican candidates won increasing percentages in the House. After secessionist vacancies, their caucus of 108 amounted to 59% of the House, and with another 16% in the Unionist caucus, they had over a two-thirds super-majority to govern.<ref>Martis (1994), pp. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nFollowing Lincoln's election and before his inauguration, seven secessionist states declared rebellion and Jefferson Davis mobilized 100,000 troops in defense of the Confederacy. Lincoln responded with a call-up of 75,000 troops to reoccupy federal property in port cities. That motivated another four border states to declare [[Ordinance of Secession|secession]], forming the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that fought the [[American Civil War]].\n\nSeceding states cancelled elections to Federal office, and all but a few of their Representatives departed. Twenty-three representatives to U.S. 37th Congress came from five slave-holding states represented in the Confederacy: Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and Louisiana. The rebellion left seventeen vacancies in those states. Meanwhile for the duration of the conflict those same five states sent full delegations to the Confederate Congress even though over half their Congressional districts were federally occupied or disrupted by the end of 1862.<ref>Martis (1994), pp. 47.</ref>\n\nOverwhelmingly, seceding states had [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] representation, so despite losing seats to Democrats{{efn | name=\"ID\"}} in the North, this state-by-state mass departure left Republicans with a clear House majority. Remaining Representatives of all parties were united in support for the Union. Representatives opposing Democrats but not wishing to affiliate with Republicans, and wishing to emphasize support for the Union and opposition to secession, coalesced as the [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist Party]]. Many of these Unionists were from Southern states. The [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[Know Nothing|American Party]] disappeared, with its remaining support usually absorbed by Unionists.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Election summaries==\n[[#California|California]] was [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] one additional seat for the 37th Congress,<ref>{{USStat|12|411}}</ref> increasing the total seats to 239.\n\n[[Ordinance_of_Secession|Secession]] of Southern states vacated many seats. Few Representatives from these states remained. Missing Representatives were overwhelmingly Democrats, boosting Republican control. Several states held elections for the 37th Congress, but seceded before Congress convened, so the elected Representatives never served. Other seceding states held no elections.\n\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:59.02%;\" | '''108'''\n| style=\"background:{{Unionist Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:16.39%;\" | '''30'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:0.55%;\" | '''1'''\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:24.04%;\" | '''44'''\n\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Republican'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Unionist Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Unionist'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Independent Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''ID'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}};\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n|}\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 | State\n! rowspan=2 | Type\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! rowspan=2 | Total<br/>seats\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Republican}} | [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Democratic}} | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n! colspan=2 {{Party shading/Unionist}} | [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist]]{{efn | Includes Unionists, Constitutional Unionists, and the two \"Union\" members from [[Rhode Island]].}}\n! colspan=2 | Others\n\n|-\n! {{Party shading/Republican}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Republican}} | Change\n! {{Party shading/Democratic}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Democratic}} | Change\n! {{Party shading/Unionist}} | Seats\n! {{Party shading/Unionist}} | Change\n!

Before 1872, different states held elections at various times; the first elections for the 37th Congress were held on August 6, 1860 in [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], while the last election took place in [[California]] on September 4, 1861, a year later. Three Southern states \u2013 [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], and [[South Carolina]] \u2013 chose Representatives before the presidential election, electing seven Democrats and two independents. These were the only House elections from the seceding states to the 37th Congress. After South Carolina resolved disunion and the [[Confederate States of America]] was formed, other Southern states declared as well and elected Representatives to the new [[Congress of the Confederate States]] instead of the United States Congress.\n\nSince the states not holding elections had many strong Democratic districts \u2013 in the previous [[36th United States Congress|36th Congress]] their Representatives included a total of 46 Democrats, 14 [[Opposition Party (Southern U.S.)|Oppositionists]], five independents, and one member of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] \u2013 when Congress was called into session on July 4, 1861 (five months earlier than usual at the time) the size of the Democratic House caucus had been drastically reduced, resulting in a huge Republican majority.\n\nOf the 183 seats, 102 were held by Republicans, 45 by Democrats,{{efn | name=\"ID\"}} 23 by Unionists, and five others by one party each.

They were held before, during and after the pre-determined Presidential campaign. And they were held before, during and after the secessionist campaigns in various states as they were reported throughout the country. Political conditions varied hugely from time to time during the course of congressional selection, but they had been shifting to a considerable extent in the years running up to the crisis.<ref>Martis, p. 36.</ref>\n\nIn the [[1856 United States House of Representatives elections|1856 elections]], the Democrats had taken the Presidency for the sixth time in the last 40 years, with James Buchanan's victory over John C. Fremont and Millard Fillmore. They held almost a two-thirds majority in both the US House and Senate. Democrats held onto the Senate during the midterm elections, but the four opposition parties then amounted to two-thirds of the House. The congressional elections in 1860 transformed Democratic fortunes: Republican and Unionist candidates won a two-thirds majority in both House and Senate.<ref>Martis, p. 34.</ref>\n\nAfter the secessionist withdrawal, resignation and expulsion, the Democrats would have less than 25% of the House for the 37th Congress, and that minority divided further between pro-unionists (Stephen Douglas), and anti-war (Clement Vallandingham) factions.<ref>Martis, pp. 114, 115.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Results by region ==\n\nThe politics of these elections were distinctive in every region of the country.

In a time before the Census Department published aggregate population data by Congressional District, the reader may have ready access to census data identifying the make up of those each district by referring to their respective articles.\n\nThe articles use different formats. The constituent counties of Congressional Districts are sometimes listed in a contents heading \"List of representatives\" within tables. These tables have a column naming the District's counties for each election, such as (a) \"District Area\" for Massachusetts, or (b) \"Area\" for Illinois and Maryland. Virginia uses \"Historical composition of the district\" to describe composition at each reapportionment. Pennsylvania notes the home county of the elected representative, sometimes holding the largest population for respective districts. Minnesota makes a geographical allusion for its 1st District applicable to the 37th Congress. Michigan uses \"History\" since 1852 for its 4th district.

It was the second AS protocol developed and uses the same signing, encryption and [[Return receipt#Message Disposition Notifications|MDN]] (as defined by [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3798.txt RFC3798]) conventions used in the original [[AS1 (networking)|AS1]] protocol introduced in the late 1990s by [[IETF]] [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ediint-as1-00].  In other words:\n* Files are encoded as \"attachments\" in a standardized [[S/MIME]] message (an AS2 message). The contents of the files are not specified by AS2. Usually the file contents be in a standardized format that is separately agreed upon, such as [[XML]] or [[EDIFACT]].\n* AS2 messages are always sent using the [[HTTP]] or [[HTTPS]] protocol ([[Secure Sockets Layer]] \u2014 also known as SSL \u2014 is implied by HTTPS) and usually use the \"POST\" method (use of \"GET\" is rare).\n* Messages can be signed, but do not have to be.\n* Messages can be encrypted, but do not have to be.\n* Messages may request a ''Message Disposition Notification'' ('''MDN''') back if all went well, but do not have to request such a message.\n* If the original AS2 message requested an MDN:\n** Upon the receipt of the message and its successful decryption or signature validation (as necessary) a \"success\" MDN will be sent back to the original sender. This MDN is typically signed but never encrypted (unless temporarily encrypted in transit via HTTPS). \n** Upon the receipt and successful verification of the signature on the MDN, the original sender will \"know\" that the recipient got their message (this provides the \"Non-repudiation\" element of AS2)\n** If there are any problems receiving or interpreting the original AS2 message, a \"failed\" MDN may be sent back. However, part of the AS2 protocol states that the client must treat a lack of an MDN as a failure as well, so some AS2 receivers will simply not return an MDN in this case.\n\nLike any other AS file transfer, AS2 file transfers typically require both sides of the exchange to trade X.509 certificates and specific \"trading partner\" names before any transfers can take place. AS2 trading partner names can usually be any valid phrase.\n\n=== MDN Options ===\n\nUnlike AS1 or [[AS3 (networking)|AS3]] file transfers, AS2 file transfers offer several \"MDN return\" options instead of the traditional options of \"yes\" or \"no\". Specifically, the choices are:\n\n====AS2 w/ \"Sync\" MDNs====\n''Return Synchronous MDN via HTTP(S) (\"AS2 Sync\")'' - This popular option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to AS2 message sender clients over the same HTTP connection they used to send the original message. This \"MDN while you wait\" capability makes \"AS2 Sync\" transfers the fastest of any type of AS file transfer, but it also keeps this flavor of MDN requests from being used with large files (which may [[time out (telecommunication)|time out]] in low-[[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] situations).\n\n====AS2 w/ \"ASync\" MDNs====\n''Return Asynchronous MDN via HTTP(S) (a.k.a. \"AS2 Async\")'' - This popular option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to the AS2 message sender's server later over a different HTTP connection. This flavor of MDN request is usually used if large files are involved or if your trading partner's AS2 server has poor Internet service.\n\n====AS2 w/ \"Email\" MDNs====\n''Return (Asynchronous) MDN via Email'' - This rarely used option allows AS2 MDNs to be returned to AS2 message senders via [[email]] rather than HTTP. Otherwise, it is similar to \"AS2 Async (HTTP)\".\n\n====AS2 w/ No MDNs====\n''Do not return MDN'' - This option works like it does in any other AS protocol: the receiver of an AS2 message with this option set simply does not try to return an MDN to the AS2 message sender.\n\n====Filename preservation ====\n\nAS2 filename preservation feature will be used to communicate the filename to the trading partner. The banking industry relies on filenames being communicated between trading partners. AS2 vendors are currently certifying that implementation of filename communication conforms to the standard and is interoperable. \nThere are two profiles for filename preservation being optionally tested under AS2 testing: \n*Filename preservation without MDN responses \n*Filename preservation with an associated MDN response certification\n\n== Benefits == \n{{Advert section|date=October 2019}}\nFor many businesses, the use of AS2 and [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI) is not a choice so much as it is a requirement of doing business with a large customer or partner.
