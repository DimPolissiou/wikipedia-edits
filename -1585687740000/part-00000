If he swore not to escape, he could gain better accommodations and the freedom of the prison. If he swore to cease hostilities against the nation who held him captive, he could be repatriated or exchanged but could not serve against his former captors in a military capacity.\n\n===European settlers captured in North America===\n{{further|Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War}}\nEarly historical narratives of captured colonial Europeans, including perspectives of literate women captured by the indigenous peoples of North America, exist in some number. The writings of [[Mary Rowlandson]], captured in the brutal fighting of [[King Philip's War]], are an example. Such narratives enjoyed some popularity, spawning a genre of the [[captivity narrative]], and had lasting influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through the legacy of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. Some Native Americans continued to capture Europeans and use them both as labourers and bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people on the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast from 1802 to 1805.\n\n===French Revolutionary wars and Napoleonic wars===\nThe earliest known purposely built [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was established at [[Norman Cross]], England in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document. Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality. Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations. Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of [[privateers]]. About 100 senior officers and some civilians \"of good social standing\", mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given ''parole d'honneur'' outside the prison, mainly in [[Peterborough]] although some further afield in [[Northampton]], [[Plymouth]], [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]] and [[Abergavenny]]. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society. During the [[Battle of Leipzig]] both sides used the [[Alter Johannisfriedhof|city's cemetery]] as lazaret and prisoner camp for around 6000 POWs who lived in the vaults and used the coffins for firewood. Food was scarce and prisoners resorted to eating horses, cats, dogs or even human flesh. The bad conditions inside the graveyard contributed to a city-wide epidemic after the battle.<ref>https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb10604517.html?pageNo=305 (german) [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz|Rochlitz]]: ''Collected Works vol 6'' (1822), description of treatment of french prisoners p. 305ff</ref><ref>https://www.leipzig-lese.de/index.php?article_id=393 (german) Gravedigger Ahlemann: witness report about the Leipzig cemetery during the Battle of Leipzig.</ref>\n\n===Prisoner exchanges===\nThe extensive period of conflict during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1793\u20131815), followed by the [[United Kingdom \u2013 United States relations|Anglo-American]] [[War of 1812]], led to the emergence of a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]] system for the [[exchange of prisoners]], even while the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country.\n\n===American Civil War===\n{{main|American Civil War prison camps}}\n[[File:Battle of Mine Creek.gif|thumb|[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] prisoners of war on the way to [[Camp Ford]] prison in October 1864.]]\nAt the start of the civil war a system of paroles operated.

Butler contacted Grant for guidance on the issue, and Grant responded to Butler on 18 August 1864 with his now famous statement.

As a result of these emerging conventions, a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating nations, work was continued that resulted in new [[treaty|conventions]] being adopted and becoming recognized as [[international law]] that specified that prisoners of war be treated humanely and diplomatically.\n\n===Hague and Geneva Conventions===\nChapter II of the Annex to the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''IV \u2013 The Laws and Customs of War on Land'' covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These provisions were further expanded in the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War]] and were largely revised in the [[Third Geneva Convention]] in 1949.\n\nArticle 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] protects captured [[military personnel]], some [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters, and certain [[civilians]]. It applies from the moment a prisoner is captured until he or she is released or repatriated. One of the main provisions of the convention makes it illegal to [[torture]] prisoners and states that a prisoner can only be required to give their [[name]], [[date of birth]], [[Military rank|rank]] and [[service number]] (if applicable).\n\nThe [[ICRC]] has a special role to play, with regards to [[international humanitarian law]], in [[Restoring Family Links|restoring and maintaining family contact in times of war]], in particular concerning the right of prisoners of war and internees to send and receive letters and cards (Geneva Convention (GC) III, art.71 and GC IV, art.107).\n\nHowever, nations vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, [[Imperial Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]] (towards Soviet POWs and Western Allied commandos) were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason for not providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; and the Soviets similarly killed Axis prisoners or used them as slave labour. The Germans also routinely executed Western Allied commandos captured behind German lines per the [[Commando Order]]. North Korean and North and South Vietnamese forces<ref name=\"south-viet\">{{cite web|title=In South Vietnamese Jails|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10775|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> routinely killed or mistreated prisoners taken during those conflicts.\n\n====Qualifications====\n[[File:Japanese Beheading 1894.jpg|thumb|Japanese illustration depicting the beheading of Chinese captives. [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894\u20135.]]\nTo be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must be [[lawful combatant]]s entitled to combatant's privilege\u2014which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing [[enemy combatant]]s. To qualify under the [[Third Geneva Convention]], a combatant must be part of a [[chain of command]], wear a \"fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance\", bear arms openly, and have conducted military operations according to the [[laws and customs of war]]. (The Convention recognizes a few other groups as well, such as \"[i]nhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units\".)\n\nThus, uniforms and badges are important in determining prisoner-of-war status under the Third Geneva Convention. Under [[Additional Protocol I]], the requirement of a distinctive marking is no longer included. ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', [[militia]]s, [[insurgent]]s, [[terrorists]], [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], and [[Espionage|spies]] generally do not qualify because they do not fulfill the criteria of Additional Protocol 1. Therefore they fall under the category of [[unlawful combatant]]s, or more properly they are not combatants. Captured soldiers who do not get prisoner of war status are still protected like civilians under the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].\n\nThe criteria are applied primarily to ''international'' armed conflicts. The application of prisoner of war status in non-international armed conflicts like [[civil wars]] is guided by [[Additional Protocol II]], but [[insurgents]] are often treated as [[traitors]], [[terrorist]]s or [[criminals]] by government forces and are sometimes executed on spot or tortured. However, in the [[American Civil War]], both sides treated captured troops as POWs presumably out of [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]], although the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] regarded [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] personnel as separatist rebels. However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously.\n\n===Rights===\nUnder the [[Third Geneva Convention]], prisoners of war (POW) must be:\n\n*Treated humanely with respect for their persons and their honor\n*Able to inform their next of kin and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] of their capture\n*Allowed to communicate regularly with relatives and receive packages\n*Given adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical attention\n*Paid for work done and not forced to do work that is dangerous, unhealthy, or degrading\n*Released quickly after conflicts end\n*Not compelled to give any information except for name, age, rank, and service number<ref>{{cite web|title=Geneva Convention|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_geneva_con.html|publisher=Peace Pledge Union|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, if wounded or sick on the battlefield, the prisoner will receive help from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Story of an idea- the Film|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwB-Y6FUjY|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen a country is responsible for breaches of prisoner of war rights, those accountable will be punished accordingly. An example of this is the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Trials]]. German and Japanese military commanders were prosecuted for preparing and initiating a [[war of aggression]], [[murder]], ill treatment, and [[deportation]] of individuals, and [[genocide]] during World War II.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Penrose|first=Mary Margaret|title=War Crime|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/635621/war-crime/224687/The-Nurnberg-and-Tokyo-trials|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> Most were executed or sentenced to life in prison for their crimes.\n\n===U.S. Code of Conduct and terminology===\n\n[[The United States Military Code of Conduct]] was promulgated in 1955 via [[s:Executive Order 10631|Executive Order 10631]] under [[U.S. President|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to serve as a moral code for United States service members who have been taken prisoner. It was created primarily in response to the breakdown of leadership and organization, specifically when U.S. forces were POWs during the [[Korean War]].\n\nWhen a military member is taken prisoner, the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves, that is, \"name, rank, serial number\"), receiving special favors or parole, or otherwise providing their enemy captors aid and comfort.\n\nSince the [[Vietnam War]], the official U.S. military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War). This name change was introduced in order to distinguish between enemy and U.S. captives.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-40/ch1.htm#par2 |title=FM3-19.40 Part 1 Fundamentals of Internment/Resettlement Operations Chptr 1 Introduction |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=12 August 1949 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DE1239F93AA25751C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=War in the Gulf: P.O.W.'s; U.S. Says Prisoners Seem War-Weary | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=19 February 1991}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. military replaced the designation \"Prisoner of War\" for captured American personnel with \"Missing-Captured\".

All nations pledged to follow the Hague rules on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and in general the POWs had a much higher survival rate than their peers who were not captured.<ref>Geo G. Phillimore and Hugh H. L. Bellot, \"Treatment of Prisoners of War\", ''Transactions of the Grotius Society'', Vol. 5, (1919), pp. 47\u201364.</ref> Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3&nbsp;million men became prisoners.<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War.'' (1999) pp. 368\u201369 for data.</ref>\n\nThe [[German Empire]] held 2.5&nbsp;million prisoners; [[Russian Empire|Russia]] held 2.9&nbsp;million, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] held about 720,000, mostly gained in the period just before the [[Armistice]] in 1918. The US held 48,000. The most dangerous moment for POWs was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes mistakenly shot down. Once prisoners reached a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations.\n\nThere was however much harsh treatment of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador to Germany (prior to America's entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings in \"My Four Years in Germany\". Even worse conditions are reported in the book \"Escape of a Princess Pat\" by the Canadian George Pearson. It was particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; a quarter of the over 2 million POWs held there died.<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PP7uMQdgv5AC&pg=PA240&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Disobedience and Conspiracy in the German Army, 1918\u20131945]''\".

Some 11,800 British soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the five-month [[Siege of Kut]], in [[Mesopotamia]], in April 1916.

About 50% of the Australian prisoners were light horsemen including 48 missing believed captured on 1 May 1918 in the Jordan Valley. [[Australian Flying Corps]] pilots and observers were captured in the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant. One third of all Australian prisoners were captured on Gallipoli including the crew of the submarine AE2 which made a passage through the Dardanelles in 1915. Forced marches and crowded railway journeys preceded years in camps where disease, poor diet and inadequate medical facilities prevailed.

Plans were made for them to be sent via [[Dunkirk]] to [[Dover]] and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 40,000 men, which could later be used for [[demobilisation]].\n\nOn 13 December 1918, the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had been released ''en masse'' and sent across Allied lines without any food or shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many released prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by [[cavalry]] troops and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains.\n\nUpon arrival at the receiving camp the POWs were registered and \"boarded\" before being dispatched to their own homes. All [[commissioned officer]]s had to write a report on the circumstances of their capture and to ensure that they had done all they could to avoid capture. Each returning officer and man was given a message from King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], written in his own hand and reproduced on a lithograph.

If he swore not to escape, he could gain better accommodations and the freedom of the prison. If he swore to cease hostilities against the nation who held him captive, he could be repatriated or exchanged but could not serve against his former captors in a military capacity.\n\n===European settlers captured in North America===\n{{further|Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War}}\nEarly historical narratives of captured colonial Europeans, including perspectives of literate women captured by the indigenous peoples of North America, exist in some number. The writings of [[Mary Rowlandson]], captured in the brutal fighting of [[King Philip's War]], are an example. Such narratives enjoyed some popularity, spawning a genre of the [[captivity narrative]], and had lasting influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through the legacy of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. Some Native Americans continued to capture Europeans and use them both as labourers and bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people on the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast from 1802 to 1805.\n\n===French Revolutionary wars and Napoleonic wars===\nThe earliest known purposely built [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was established at [[Norman Cross]], England in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document. Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality. Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations. Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of [[privateers]]. About 100 senior officers and some civilians \"of good social standing\", mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given ''parole d'honneur'' outside the prison, mainly in [[Peterborough]] although some further afield in [[Northampton]], [[Plymouth]], [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]] and [[Abergavenny]]. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society. During the [[Battle of Leipzig]] both sides used the [[Alter Johannisfriedhof|city's cemetery]] as lazaret and prisoner camp for around 6000 POWs who lived in the vaults and used the coffins for firewood. Food was scarce and prisoners resorted to eating horses, cats, dogs or even human flesh. The bad conditions inside the graveyard contributed to a city-wide epidemic after the battle.<ref>https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb10604517.html?pageNo=305 (german) [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz|Rochlitz]]: ''Collected Works vol 6'' (1822), description of treatment of french prisoners p. 305ff</ref><ref>https://www.leipzig-lese.de/index.php?article_id=393 (german) Gravedigger Ahlemann: witness report about the Leipzig cemetery during the Battle of Leipzig.</ref>\n\n===Prisoner exchanges===\nThe extensive period of conflict during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1793\u20131815), followed by the [[United Kingdom \u2013 United States relations|Anglo-American]] [[War of 1812]], led to the emergence of a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]] system for the [[exchange of prisoners]], even while the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country.\n\n===American Civil War===\n{{main|American Civil War prison camps}}\n[[File:Battle of Mine Creek.gif|thumb|[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] prisoners of war on the way to [[Camp Ford]] prison in October 1864.]]\nAt the start of the civil war a system of paroles operated.

In the late summer of 1864, a year after the [[Dix\u2013Hill Cartel]] was suspended; Confederate officials approached Union General Benjamin Butler, Union Commissioner of Exchange, about resuming the cartel and including the black prisoners. Butler contacted Grant for guidance on the issue, and Grant responded to Butler on 18 August 1864 with his now famous statement. He rejected the offer, stating in essence, that the Union could afford to leave their men in captivity, the Confederacy could not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ande/historyculture/grant-and-the-prisoner-exchange.htm |title=Myth: General Ulysses S.

National Geographic News. 1 July 2003.</ref>\n\n===Amelioration===\nDuring the 19th century, there were increased efforts to improve the treatment and processing of prisoners. As a result of these emerging conventions, a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating nations, work was continued that resulted in new [[treaty|conventions]] being adopted and becoming recognized as [[international law]] that specified that prisoners of war be treated humanely and diplomatically.\n\n===Hague and Geneva Conventions===\nChapter II of the Annex to the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''IV \u2013 The Laws and Customs of War on Land'' covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These provisions were further expanded in the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War]] and were largely revised in the [[Third Geneva Convention]] in 1949.\n\nArticle 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] protects captured [[military personnel]], some [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters, and certain [[civilians]]. It applies from the moment a prisoner is captured until he or she is released or repatriated. One of the main provisions of the convention makes it illegal to [[torture]] prisoners and states that a prisoner can only be required to give their [[name]], [[date of birth]], [[Military rank|rank]] and [[service number]] (if applicable).\n\nThe [[ICRC]] has a special role to play, with regards to [[international humanitarian law]], in [[Restoring Family Links|restoring and maintaining family contact in times of war]], in particular concerning the right of prisoners of war and internees to send and receive letters and cards (Geneva Convention (GC) III, art.71 and GC IV, art.107).\n\nHowever, nations vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, [[Imperial Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]] (towards Soviet POWs and Western Allied commandos) were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason for not providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; and the Soviets similarly killed Axis prisoners or used them as slave labour. The Germans also routinely executed Western Allied commandos captured behind German lines per the [[Commando Order]]. North Korean and North and South Vietnamese forces<ref name=\"south-viet\">{{cite web|title=In South Vietnamese Jails|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10775|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> routinely killed or mistreated prisoners taken during those conflicts.\n\n====Qualifications====\n[[File:Japanese Beheading 1894.jpg|thumb|Japanese illustration depicting the beheading of Chinese captives. [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894\u20135.]]\nTo be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must be [[lawful combatant]]s entitled to combatant's privilege\u2014which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing [[enemy combatant]]s. To qualify under the [[Third Geneva Convention]], a combatant must be part of a [[chain of command]], wear a \"fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance\", bear arms openly, and have conducted military operations according to the [[laws and customs of war]]. (The Convention recognizes a few other groups as well, such as \"[i]nhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units\".)\n\nThus, uniforms and badges are important in determining prisoner-of-war status under the Third Geneva Convention. Under [[Additional Protocol I]], the requirement of a distinctive marking is no longer included. ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', [[militia]]s, [[insurgent]]s, [[terrorists]], [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], and [[Espionage|spies]] generally do not qualify because they don't fulfill the the criteria of Additional Protocol 1. Therefore they fall under the category of [[unlawful combatant]]s, or more properly they are not combatants. Captured soldiers who do not get prisoner of war status are still protected like civilians under the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].\n\nThe criteria are applied primarily to ''international'' armed conflicts. The application of prisoner of war status in non-international armed conflicts like [[civil wars]] is guided by [[Additional Protocol II]], but [[insurgents]] are often treated as [[traitors]], [[terrorist]]s or [[criminals]] by government forces and are sometimes executed on spot or tortured. However, in the [[American Civil War]], both sides treated captured troops as POWs presumably out of [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]], although the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] regarded [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] personnel as separatist rebels. However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously.\n\n===Rights===\nUnder the [[Third Geneva Convention]], prisoners of war (POW) must be:\n\n*Treated humanely with respect for their persons and their honor\n*Able to inform their next of kin and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] of their capture\n*Allowed to communicate regularly with relatives and receive packages\n*Given adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical attention\n*Paid for work done and not forced to do work that is dangerous, unhealthy, or degrading\n*Released quickly after conflicts end\n*Not compelled to give any information except for name, age, rank, and service number<ref>{{cite web|title=Geneva Convention|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_geneva_con.html|publisher=Peace Pledge Union|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, if wounded or sick on the battlefield, the prisoner will receive help from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Story of an idea- the Film|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwB-Y6FUjY|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen a country is responsible for breaches of prisoner of war rights, those accountable will be punished accordingly. An example of this is the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Trials]]. German and Japanese military commanders were prosecuted for preparing and initiating a [[war of aggression]], [[murder]], ill treatment, and [[deportation]] of individuals, and [[genocide]] during World War II.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Penrose|first=Mary Margaret|title=War Crime|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/635621/war-crime/224687/The-Nurnberg-and-Tokyo-trials|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> Most were executed or sentenced to life in prison for their crimes.\n\n===U.S. Code of Conduct and terminology===\n\n[[The United States Military Code of Conduct]] was promulgated in 1955 via [[s:Executive Order 10631|Executive Order 10631]] under [[U.S. President|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to serve as a moral code for United States service members who have been taken prisoner. It was created primarily in response to the breakdown of leadership and organization, specifically when U.S. forces were POWs during the [[Korean War]].\n\nWhen a military member is taken prisoner, the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves, that is, \"name, rank, serial number\"), receiving special favors or parole, or otherwise providing their enemy captors aid and comfort.\n\nSince the [[Vietnam War]], the official U.S. military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War). This name change was introduced in order to distinguish between enemy and U.S. captives.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-40/ch1.htm#par2 |title=FM3-19.40 Part 1 Fundamentals of Internment/Resettlement Operations Chptr 1 Introduction |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=12 August 1949 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DE1239F93AA25751C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=War in the Gulf: P.O.W.'s; U.S. Says Prisoners Seem War-Weary | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=19 February 1991}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. military replaced the designation \"Prisoner of War\" for captured American personnel with \"Missing-Captured\".

All nations pledged to follow the Hague rules on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and in general the POWs had a much higher survival rate than their peers who were not captured.<ref>Geo G. Phillimore and Hugh H. L. Bellot, \"Treatment of Prisoners of War\", ''Transactions of the Grotius Society'', Vol. 5, (1919), pp. 47\u201364.</ref> Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3&nbsp;million men became prisoners.<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War.'' (1999) pp. 368\u201369 for data.</ref>\n\nThe [[German Empire]] held 2.5&nbsp;million prisoners; [[Russian Empire|Russia]] held 2.9&nbsp;million, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] held about 720,000, mostly gained in the period just before the [[Armistice]] in 1918. The US held 48,000. The most dangerous moment for POWs was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes mistakenly shot down. Once prisoners reached a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations.\n\nThere was however much harsh treatment of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador to Germany (prior to America's entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings in \"My Four Years in Germany\". Even worse conditions are reported in the book \"Escape of a Princess Pat\" by the Canadian George Pearson. It was particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; a quarter of the over 2 million POWs held there died.<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PP7uMQdgv5AC&pg=PA240&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Disobedience and Conspiracy in the German Army, 1918\u20131945]''\".

About 50% of the Australian prisoners were light horsemen including 48 missing believed captured on 1 May 1918 in the Jordan Valley. [[Australian Flying Corps]] pilots and observers were captured in the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant. One third of all Australian prisoners were captured on Gallipoli including the crew of the submarine AE2 which made a passage through the Dardanelles in 1915. Forced marches and crowded railway journeys preceded years in camps where disease, poor diet and inadequate medical facilities prevailed.

Plans were made for them to be sent via [[Dunkirk]] to [[Dover]] and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 40,000 men, which could later be used for [[demobilisation]].\n\nOn 13 December 1918, the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had been released ''en masse'' and sent across Allied lines without any food or shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many released prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by [[cavalry]] troops and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains.\n\nUpon arrival at the receiving camp the POWs were registered and \"boarded\" before being dispatched to their own homes. All [[commissioned officer]]s had to write a report on the circumstances of their capture and to ensure that they had done all they could to avoid capture.

The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in [[Scotland]], and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century [[Dundee]], a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.<ref name=McKie>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/28/broadcasting.comment |title=Unplotted ripostes |last1=McKie |first1=David |date=28 April 2005 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nHeckling was a major part of the [[vaudeville]] theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. [[Milton Berle]]'s weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer ([[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish]] for 'squirter') played by [[Borscht Belt]] comic [[Irving Benson]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''[[Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]'', which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, [[Statler & Waldorf]] (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.\n\n==Politics==\n{{See also|Heckler's veto}}\n<!-- \nNOTE: these sections could stand to be organized a bit more (by year, era, whatever)\nwith sub-headers (or at least date or year) for each \"incident\" so as to put them all in context.\n-->\nPoliticians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. In one of his early political campaigns before becoming [[Premier of Ontario]], [[Mitchell Hepburn]] stood on top of a [[manure spreader]], apologizing to the crowd for speaking from a [[bullshit|Tory platform]], at which someone in the crowd shouted, \"Well, wind 'er up Mitch, she's never carried a bigger load!\"<ref>{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= Ontario|title= Orders of the Day: Animal Health Act, 2009|url= http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/house-proceedings/house_detail.do?Date=2009-11-04&Parl=39&Sess=1&locale=en|house= [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]|date= November 4, 2009|page= |speaker= [[John Yakabuski]]|position=MPP}} at 10:00am</ref>\n\nLegally, such conduct may constitute protected [[free speech]]. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was [[Harold Wilson]], British Prime Minister in the 1960s:\n\n:'''Heckler''': (''interrupting a passage in a Wilson speech about Labour's spending plans'') What about [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]?\n:'''Wilson''': The government has no plans to increase public expenditure in Vietnam.\n:'''Heckler''': Rubbish!\n:'''Wilson''': I'll come to your special interest in a minute, sir.<ref name=McKie/>\n\n[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]'s [[I Have a Dream]] speech was largely a response to supporter [[Mahalia Jackson]] interrupting his prepared speech to shout \"Tell them about the dream, Martin\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY Lazarus, Hayden of heckla.com (16 April 2018) : Former Martin Luther King, Jr. adviser and speechwriter Clarence B.

Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped \"Aw, shut up!\" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.\n\nIn 1992, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] was interrupted by [[Bob Rafsky]], a member of the AIDS activism group [[ACT UP]], who accused him of \"dying of ambition to be president\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Toner |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/us/the-1992-campaign-aids-protester-provokes-clinton-s-anger.html |title=NY Times |work=New York Times |date=27 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}</ref> during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, \"[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me.

The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to [[Tony Blair]] during a [[photo op]] visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2690549.stm \"Blair's heckler states his case\"], BBC, 24 January 2003.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, American Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience.

The heckling occurred during a press conference in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, \"Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney.\" Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking.<ref>June Deery: ''Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment''.

Musicians of [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]] have become an increasing focus of hecklers.  This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction.\n\nOn Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement entered the US [[White House]] grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]].  Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, [[Wang Wenyi]], perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: \"President [[George W.

Stop the killing and torture.\"<!--  The heckler was allowed to continue for several minutes despite the heavy presence of security personnel typical of such high level meeting of officials, prompting speculation that the incident was planned with the tacit cooperation of the White House in order to embarrass the Chinese president, hence possibly making this heckling incident one which was found justified by its audience. --><ref>[http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html \"No breakthrough in US, China talks\"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011756/http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref> President Bush later apologised to his guest.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1758305,00.html |title=Protester gatecrashes Hu visit as China and US fail to make progress |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 April 2006|accessdate=12 March 2009  | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nHecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[American football]] team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were [[booing]] and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as [[Santa Claus]] in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player [[Michael Irvin]] in 1999.  Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is [[Robert Szasz]], who regularly attends [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[association football|football]] star [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: \"You're a piece of shit!\"  Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.\n\nIn English and Scottish [[association football|football]], heckling and swearing from the stands, and [[football chant]]s such as [[who ate all the pies?]] are common.\n\nAustralian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is [[Yabba]] who had a grandstand at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] named after him, and now a statue.\n\nThe sport of [[cricket]] is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]].\n\nAt the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling [[ESPN]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] analyst and host of, [[Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith]], [[Stephen A. Smith]]. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.\n\nTennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.\n\nIn 2009, then [[Toronto Blue Jays]] outfielder [[Alex R\u00edos]] was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 [[strikeouts]] in a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels]]. An older man yelled \"The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph.\" Rios then replied with \"Who gives a fuck\", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2009/06/05/sp-rios-youtube.html | work=CBC News | title=Rios apologizes for YouTube tirade at abusive fan | date=5 June 2009}}</ref> but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] later that year.\n\n==Music==\n{{Further|Electric Dylan controversy}}\nOne of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, \"Judas!\" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by \"going electric\". Dylan replied: \"I don't believe you, you're a liar!\" before telling his band to \"Play it fucking loud!\" They play an acidic version of \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Bob Dylan Live 1966 Liner Notes|publisher=Columbia Records|year=1998|location=New York|page=7}}</ref> This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's ''Live Bootleg Series''.\n\n==Stand-up comedy==\n{{Main article|Stand-up comedy}}\nIn stand-up comedy, a heckler is anyone who interrupts a comedian's set.<ref>{{cite book \n |last=Dean \n |first=Greg \n |year=2000 \n |title=Step by Step to Stand-up Comedy \n |location=Portsmouth, NH \n |publisher=Heinemann \n |page=188\n |isbn=0-325-00179-0}}</ref> Hecklers want the stand-up to break the [[fourth wall]].<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Borns\n |first=Betsy\n |year=1987\n |title=Comic Lives: Inside the World of American Stand-up comedy\n |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc.\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/comiclivesinside00born/page/20 20]\n |isbn=0-671-62620-5\n |quote=An audience may imply (through heckling, interrupting, etc.) a desire for the comic to break down the fourth wall and 'join the crow,' but experienced comedians know that this would only make the room more uncomfortable.\n |url=https://archive.org/details/comiclivesinside00born/page/20\n }}</ref> Most sources claim that heckling is uncommon.<ref name=parallel/><ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.sacmag.com/2018/12/12/how-about-those-hecklers/\n |title=How About Those Hecklers?\n |last=Cassinos-Carr\n |first=Cathy\n |date=12 December 2018\n |website=Sacramento Magazine\n |access-date=27 March 2019\n |quote=You see a lot of heckler videos go viral.

The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson or Mike Nelson) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as [[Rifftrax]] and [[Cinematic Titanic]].\n\nIn one of [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s plays \"The School Master\", a heckler interrupted his play by shouting \"Here!\" after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register.

The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in [[Scotland]], and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century [[Dundee]], a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce.

Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. [[Milton Berle]]'s weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer ([[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish]] for 'squirter') played by [[Borscht Belt]] comic [[Irving Benson]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''[[Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]'', which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, [[Statler & Waldorf]] (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.\n\n==Politics==\n{{See also|Heckler's veto}}\n<!-- \nNOTE: these sections could stand to be organized a bit more (by year, era, whatever)\nwith sub-headers (or at least date or year) for each \"incident\" so as to put them all in context.\n-->\nPoliticians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. In one of his early political campaigns before becoming [[Premier of Ontario]], [[Mitchell Hepburn]] stood on top of a [[manure spreader]], apologizing to the crowd for speaking from a [[bullshit|Tory platform]], at which someone in the crowd shouted, \"Well, wind 'er up Mitch, she's never carried a bigger load!\"<ref>{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= Ontario|title= Orders of the Day: Animal Health Act, 2009|url= http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/house-proceedings/house_detail.do?Date=2009-11-04&Parl=39&Sess=1&locale=en|house= [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]|date= November 4, 2009|page= |speaker= [[John Yakabuski]]|position=MPP}} at 10:00am</ref>\n\nLegally, such conduct may constitute protected [[free speech]]. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was [[Harold Wilson]], British Prime Minister in the 1960s:\n\n:'''Heckler''': (''interrupting a passage in a Wilson speech about Labour's spending plans'') What about [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]?\n:'''Wilson''': The government has no plans to increase public expenditure in Vietnam.\n:'''Heckler''': Rubbish!\n:'''Wilson''': I'll come to your special interest in a minute, sir.<ref name=McKie/>\n\n[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]'s [[I Have a Dream]] speech was largely a response to supporter [[Mahalia Jackson]] interrupting his prepared speech to shout \"Tell them about the dream, Martin\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY Lazarus, Hayden of heckla.com (16 April 2018) : Former Martin Luther King, Jr. adviser and speechwriter Clarence B.

Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped \"Aw, shut up!\" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.\n\nIn 1992, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] was interrupted by [[Bob Rafsky]], a member of the AIDS activism group [[ACT UP]], who accused him of \"dying of ambition to be president\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Toner |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/us/the-1992-campaign-aids-protester-provokes-clinton-s-anger.html |title=NY Times |work=New York Times |date=27 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}</ref> during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, \"[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me.

During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran's human rights record. Several protesters shouted \"Fascists\" at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience.\"\n\nSince 2005 heckling of performing artists has become more commonplace in [[Switzerland]].  Musicians of [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]] have become an increasing focus of hecklers.  This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction.\n\nOn Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement entered the US [[White House]] grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]].  Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, [[Wang Wenyi]], perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: \"President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture.\"<!--  The heckler was allowed to continue for several minutes despite the heavy presence of security personnel typical of such high level meeting of officials, prompting speculation that the incident was planned with the tacit cooperation of the White House in order to embarrass the Chinese president, hence possibly making this heckling incident one which was found justified by its audience. --><ref>[http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html \"No breakthrough in US, China talks\"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011756/http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref> President Bush later apologised to his guest.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1758305,00.html |title=Protester gatecrashes Hu visit as China and US fail to make progress |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 April 2006|accessdate=12 March 2009  | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nHecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[American football]] team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were [[booing]] and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as [[Santa Claus]] in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player [[Michael Irvin]] in 1999.  Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is [[Robert Szasz]], who regularly attends [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[association football|football]] star [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: \"You're a piece of shit!\"  Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.\n\nIn English and Scottish [[association football|football]], heckling and swearing from the stands, and [[football chant]]s such as [[who ate all the pies?]] are common.\n\nAustralian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is [[Yabba]] who had a grandstand at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] named after him, and now a statue.\n\nThe sport of [[cricket]] is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]].\n\nAt the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling [[ESPN]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] analyst and host of, [[Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith]], [[Stephen A. Smith]]. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.\n\nTennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.\n\nIn 2009, then [[Toronto Blue Jays]] outfielder [[Alex R\u00edos]] was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 [[strikeouts]] in a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels]]. An older man yelled \"The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph.\" Rios then replied with \"Who gives a fuck\", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2009/06/05/sp-rios-youtube.html | work=CBC News | title=Rios apologizes for YouTube tirade at abusive fan | date=5 June 2009}}</ref> but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] later that year.\n\n==Music==\n{{Further|Electric Dylan controversy}}\nOne of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, \"Judas!\" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by \"going electric\". Dylan replied: \"I don't believe you, you're a liar!\" before telling his band to \"Play it fucking loud!\" They play an acidic version of \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Bob Dylan Live 1966 Liner Notes|publisher=Columbia Records|year=1998|location=New York|page=7}}</ref> This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's ''Live Bootleg Series''.\n\n==Stand-up comedy==\n{{Main article|Stand-up comedy}}\nIn stand-up comedy, a heckler is anyone who interrupts a comedian's set.<ref>{{cite book \n |last=Dean \n |first=Greg \n |year=2000 \n |title=Step by Step to Stand-up Comedy \n |location=Portsmouth, NH \n |publisher=Heinemann \n |page=188\n |isbn=0-325-00179-0}}</ref> Hecklers want the stand-up to break the [[fourth wall]].<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Borns\n |first=Betsy\n |year=1987\n |title=Comic Lives: Inside the World of American Stand-up comedy\n |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc.\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/comiclivesinside00born/page/20 20]\n |isbn=0-671-62620-5\n |quote=An audience may imply (through heckling, interrupting, etc.) a desire for the comic to break down the fourth wall and 'join the crow,' but experienced comedians know that this would only make the room more uncomfortable.\n |url=https://archive.org/details/comiclivesinside00born/page/20\n }}</ref> Most sources claim that heckling is uncommon.<ref name=parallel/><ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.sacmag.com/2018/12/12/how-about-those-hecklers/\n |title=How About Those Hecklers?\n |last=Cassinos-Carr\n |first=Cathy\n |date=12 December 2018\n |website=Sacramento Magazine\n |access-date=27 March 2019\n |quote=You see a lot of heckler videos go viral.

The Yankees defeated the Phillies, 4 games to 2, winning their 27th World Series championship. The series was played between October 28 and November 4, broadcast on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]], and watched by an average of roughly 19&nbsp;million viewers. Due to the start of the season being pushed back by the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]] in March, this was the first World Series regularly scheduled to be played into the month of November. This series was a rematch of the [[1950 World Series]].\n\n[[Home advantage|Home field advantage]] for the Series went to the AL for the eighth straight year as a result of its 4\u20133 win in the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. The Phillies earned their berth into the [[2009 Major League Baseball season#Postseason|playoffs]] by winning the [[National League East]]. The Yankees won the [[American League East]] to earn their berth, posting the best record in the Major Leagues. The Phillies reached the World Series by defeating the [[2009 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] in the best-of-five [[2009 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]], and the [[2009 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the best-of-seven [[2009 National League Championship Series|NL Championship Series]] (NLCS). The Yankees defeated the [[2009 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] in the [[2009 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] and the [[2009 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] in the [[2009 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]] (ALCS) to advance to their first World Series since [[2003 World Series|2003]]. As a result of their loss, the Phillies became the first team since the {{wsy|2001}} Yankees to lose the World Series after winning it the previous year.\n\n[[Cliff Lee]] pitched a [[complete game]] in the Phillies' Game&nbsp;1 victory, allowing only one [[Earned run#Unearned run|unearned run]], while [[Chase Utley]] hit two home runs. In Game&nbsp;2, solo [[home run]]s by [[Mark Teixeira]] and [[Hideki Matsui]] helped the Yankees win by a score of 3\u20131. After a [[rain delay]]ed start, Game&nbsp;3 featured more offense, with a combined six home runs and thirteen total [[run (baseball)|runs]] en route to a Yankee victory. The Yankees won Game&nbsp;4 by scoring the decisive three runs in the ninth inning after an alert [[base running]] play by [[Johnny Damon]]. The Phillies avoided elimination with a win in Game&nbsp;5, aided by Utley's second two\u2013home run game of the series. The Yankees secured their World Series championship with a Game 6 victory in which Matsui hit his third home run of the series. He was named [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) of the series, making him the first Japanese-born player and the first full-time [[designated hitter]] to win the award. Matsui was the series' MVP despite starting only the three games that were played at Yankee Stadium, since the designated hitter position is not used in NL ballparks.\n\nSeveral records were tied, extended, or broken during this World Series, including team championships (Yankees with 27), career postseason wins ([[Andy Pettitte]] with 18), career World Series [[Save (baseball)|saves]] ([[Mariano Rivera]] with 11), home runs in a World Series (Utley with five), [[strikeout]]s by a hitter in a World Series ([[Ryan Howard]] with 13), and [[run batted in|runs batted in]] in a single World Series game (Matsui with six).\n\n==How they got there==\n\n===Philadelphia Phillies===\n{{Main|2009 Philadelphia Phillies season}}\nDuring the off-season, the Phillies promoted assistant general manager [[Rub\u00e9n Amaro Jr.]] to [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]], succeeding [[Pat Gillick]] who retired at the end of a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081103&content_id=3660782&vkey=news_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi&partnerId=rss_phi|title= Amaro Jr. takes over reins for Phillies|accessdate=November 3, 2008|last=Mandel|first=Ken|work=[[MLB.com]]|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|date=November 3, 2008}}</ref> Their most notable offseason player change was in [[left field]], as [[Pat Burrell]] departed due to [[Free agent|free agency]] and was replaced by free agent [[Ra\u00fal Iba\u00f1ez]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081216&content_id=3718927|title=Ibanez excited to join world champs|last=Gonzalez|first=Alden|date=December 16, 2008|work=[[MLB.com]]|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|accessdate=March 2, 2009}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Another notable acquisition was free agent [[pitcher]] [[Chan Ho Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081215&content_id=3717580&vkey=news_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi|first=Anthony|last=DiComo|date=December 15, 2008|accessdate=October 26, 2009|publisher=Major League Baseball|work=[[MLB.com]]|title=Park agrees to one-year deal with Phils|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212093738/http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081215&content_id=3717580&vkey=news_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi|archivedate=February 12, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Park was originally signed as a backup option for the [[bullpen]], as [[relief pitcher|reliever]] [[J.

The Yankees defeated the Phillies, 4 games to 2, winning their 27th World Series championship. The series was played between October 28 and November 4, broadcast on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]], and watched by an average of roughly 19&nbsp;million viewers. Due to the start of the season being pushed back by the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]] in March, this was the first World Series regularly scheduled to be played into the month of November. This series was a rematch of the [[1950 World Series]].\n\n[[Home advantage|Home field advantage]] for the Series went to the AL for the eighth straight year as a result of its 4\u20133 win in the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]].

As a result of their loss, the Phillies became the first team since the {{wsy|2001}} Yankees to lose the World Series after winning it the previous year.\n\n[[Cliff Lee]] pitched a [[complete game]] in the Phillies' Game&nbsp;1 victory, allowing only one [[Earned run#Unearned run|unearned run]], while [[Chase Utley]] hit two home runs. In Game&nbsp;2, solo [[home run]]s by [[Mark Teixeira]] and [[Hideki Matsui]] helped the Yankees win by a score of 3\u20131. After a [[rain delay]]ed start, Game&nbsp;3 featured more offense, with a combined six home runs and thirteen total [[run (baseball)|runs]] en route to a Yankee victory. The Yankees won Game&nbsp;4 by scoring the decisive three runs in the ninth inning after an alert [[base running]] play by [[Johnny Damon]]. The Phillies avoided elimination with a win in Game&nbsp;5, aided by Utley's second two\u2013home run game of the series.

During an eye examination, the doctor sees these deposits in the stroma as clear, comma-shaped overlapping dots and branching filaments, creating a lattice effect. Over time, the lattice lines will grow opaque and involve more of the stroma. They will also gradually converge, giving the cornea a cloudiness that may also reduce vision. The disease is bilateral, usually noted before the end of the first decade of life. Although lattice dystrophy can occur at any time in life, the condition usually arises in children between the ages of two and seven.\n\nIn some people, these abnormal protein fibers can accumulate under the cornea's outer layer\u2014the epithelium. This can cause [[Recurrent corneal erosion|erosion of the epithelium]]. This condition is known as recurrent epithelial erosion. These erosions alter the cornea's normal curvature, resulting in temporary vision problems, and expose the nerves that line the cornea, causing severe pain. Even the involuntary act of blinking can be painful.\n\nIn systemic cases, kidney failure, heart failure and neuropathy such as facial nerve palsy, laxity of the skin may be noted.<ref name=omim2>{{OMIM|105120}}</ref>\n\n== Genetics ==\n[[File:Lattice corneal dystrophy type II cornea cut.jpg|thumb|250 px|Lattice corneal dystrophy type II.

Recurrent corneal erosions may precede the corneal opacities and even appear in individuals lacking recognizable stromal disease. Amyloid deposits are found throughout the corneal stroma. Linear and other shaped opaque areas accumulate particularly within the central corneal stroma, while the peripheral cornea remains relatively transparent.\n\n== Treatment ==\nIn case of corneal erosion, a doctor may prescribe eye drops and ointments to reduce the friction on the eroded cornea. In some cases, an eye patch may be used to immobilize the eyelids. With effective care, these erosions usually heal within three to seven days, although occasional sensations of pain may occur for the next six-to-eight weeks. As patients with LCD suffer with dry eyes as a result of erosion, a new technique involving the insertion of [[punctal plug]]s (both upper and lower) can reduce the amount of drops used a day, aiding ocular stability.\n\nBy about age 40, some people with lattice dystrophy will have scarring under the epithelium, resulting in a haze on the cornea that can greatly obscure vision. In this case, a [[corneal transplantation]] may be needed. There have been many cases in which teenage patients have had the procedure, which accounts for the change in severity of the condition from person to person.\n\nAlthough people with lattice dystrophy have an excellent chance for a successful [[corneal transplantation]], the disease may also arise in the donor cornea in as little as three years. In one study, about half of the transplant patients with lattice dystrophy had a recurrence of the disease between two and 26 years after the operation. Of these, 15 percent required a second corneal transplant. Early lattice and recurrent lattice arising in the donor cornea responds well to treatment with the excimer laser.\n\nPhototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) using [Excimer laser] can restore and preserve useful visual function for a significant period of time in patients with anterior corneal dystrophies.<ref name=omim />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = \n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|H|18|5|h|15}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|371.54}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 122200\n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = article\n| eMedicineTopic  = 1193793\n| MeshID          = \n| ICD10CM         = {{ICD10CM|H18.54}}\n}}\n<!--unused refs *Maury CPJ, Alli K, Baumann M ( January 1990) Finnish hereditary amyloidosis - amino acid sequence homology between the amyloid fibril protein and human plasma gelsolin.

Although lattice dystrophy can occur at any time in life, the condition usually arises in children between the ages of two and seven.\n\nIn some people, these abnormal protein fibers can accumulate under the cornea's outer layer\u2014the epithelium. This can cause [[Recurrent corneal erosion|erosion of the epithelium]]. This condition is known as recurrent epithelial erosion. These erosions alter the cornea's normal curvature, resulting in temporary vision problems, and expose the nerves that line the cornea, causing severe pain. Even the involuntary act of blinking can be painful.\n\nIn systemic cases, kidney failure, heart failure and neuropathy such as facial nerve palsy, laxity of the skin may be noted.<ref name=omim2>{{OMIM|105120}}</ref>\n\n== Genetics ==\n[[File:Lattice corneal dystrophy type II cornea cut.jpg|thumb|250 px|Lattice corneal dystrophy type II.

Recurrent corneal erosions may precede the corneal opacities and even appear in individuals lacking recognizable stromal disease. Amyloid deposits are found throughout the corneal stroma. Linear and other shaped opaque areas accumulate particularly within the central corneal stroma, while the peripheral cornea remains relatively transparent.\n\n== Treatment ==\nIn case of corneal erosion, a doctor may prescribe eye drops and ointments to reduce the friction on the eroded cornea. In some cases, an eye patch may be used to immobilize the eyelids. With effective care, these erosions usually heal within three to seven days, although occasional sensations of pain may occur for the next six-to-eight weeks. As patients with LCD suffer with dry eyes as a result of erosion, a new technique involving the insertion of [[punctal plug]]s (both upper and lower) can reduce the amount of drops used a day, aiding ocular stability.\n\nBy about age 40, some people with lattice dystrophy will have scarring under the epithelium, resulting in a haze on the cornea that can greatly obscure vision. In this case, a [[corneal transplantation]] may be needed. There have been many cases in which teenage patients have had the procedure, which accounts for the change in severity of the condition from person to person.\n\nAlthough people with lattice dystrophy have an excellent chance for a successful [[corneal transplantation]], the disease may also arise in the donor cornea in as little as three years. In one study, about half of the transplant patients with lattice dystrophy had a recurrence of the disease between two and 26 years after the operation. Of these, 15 percent required a second corneal transplant. Early lattice and recurrent lattice arising in the donor cornea responds well to treatment with the excimer laser.\n\nPhototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) using [Excimer laser] can restore and preserve useful visual function for a significant period of time in patients with anterior corneal dystrophies.<ref name=omim />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     =  \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|H|18|5|h|15}} \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|371.54}} \n|  ICDO           =  \n|  OMIM           = 122200\t\t \n|  MedlinePlus    =  \n|  eMedicineSubj  = article \n|  eMedicineTopic = 1193793 \n|  MeshID         = \n}}\n<!--unused refs *Maury CPJ, Alli K, Baumann M ( January 1990) Finnish hereditary amyloidosis - amino acid sequence homology between the amyloid fibril protein and human plasma gelsolin.

At the same time, U.S. officials were concerned with conciliating the South Koreans, who expressed discontent about being left out of the negotiations. Richard A. Ericson, a political counselor for the American embassy in Seoul and operating officer for the ''Pueblo'' negotiations, notes in his oral history:\n\n<blockquote>The South Koreans were absolutely furious and suspicious of what we might do. They anticipated that the North Koreans would try to exploit the situation to the ROK's disadvantage in every way possible, and they were rapidly growing distrustful of us and losing faith in their great ally. Of course, we had this other problem of how to ensure that the ROK would not retaliate for the [[Blue House Raid]] and to ease their growing feelings of insecurity. They began to realize that the DMZ was porous and they wanted more equipment and aid. So, we were juggling a number of problems.<ref name=\"Richard A.

If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasn't in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it. Sometimes we would get totally nonsensical responses if they didn't have something in the card file that corresponded to the proposal at hand.<ref name=\"Richard A.

You are going to be asked to sign a document that the North Koreans will have drafted. They will brook no changes. It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of ... If you allow them to, they will take as much time as they feel they need to squeeze every damn thing they can get out of this situation in terms of their propaganda goals, and they will try to exploit this situation to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the ROK.

In October 1999, she was towed from Wonsan on the east coast, around the Korean Peninsula, to the port of [[Nampo]] on the west coast. This required moving the vessel through international waters, and was undertaken just before the visit of U.S. presidential envoy [[James A. Kelly|James Kelly]] to the capital [[Pyongyang]]. After the stop at the Nampo shipyard ''Pueblo'' was relocated to Pyongyang and moored on the [[Taedong River]] near the spot that the [[General Sherman incident]] is believed to have taken place. In late 2012 ''Pueblo'' was moved again to the Botong River in Pyongyang next to a new addition to the [[Fatherland Liberation War Museum]].<ref name=\"usspueblo.org\"/>\n\nToday, ''Pueblo'' remains the second-oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, behind {{USS|Constitution}} (\"Old Ironsides\").

This allowed the two nations access to the US Navy's communication systems until the US Navy revised those systems. The seizure of ''Pueblo'' followed soon after US Navy [[warrant officer]] [[John Anthony Walker]] introduced himself to Soviet authorities, setting up the Walker spy ring.  It has been argued that the seizure of ''Pueblo'' was executed specifically to capture the encryption devices aboard.

The crew itself thought the North Koreans would be able to rebuild much of the equipment. \n\nCryptographic equipment onboard at the time of capture included \u201cone [[KL-47]] for off-line encryption, two KW-7s<ref>[https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/usa/kw7/index.htm CryptoMuseum page on KW-7]</ref> for on-line encryption, three [[KWR-37]]s for receiving the Navy Operational Intelligence Broadcast, and four KG-14s<ref>[http://www.jproc.ca/crypto/kg14.html KG-14 information]</ref> which are used in conjunction with the KW-37 for receiving the Fleet Broadcasts.\u201d Additional tactical systems and [[one-time pad]]s were captured, but they were considered of little significance since most messages sent using them would be of value for only a short time. \n\nThe ship's cryptographic personnel were subject to intense interrogation by what they felt were highly knowledgable electronics experts. When crew members attempted to withhold details, they were later confronted with pages from captured manuals and told to correct their earlier accounts. The report concluded that the information gained from the interrogations saved the North Koreans three to six months of effort, but that they would have eventually understood everything from the captured equipment and accompanying technical manuals alone. The crew members were also asked about many U.S. cryptographic systems that were not onboard the Pueblo, but only supplied superficial information. \n\nThe ''Pueblo'' carried [[key (cryptography)|key lists]] for January, February and March of 1968, but immediately after the ''Pueblo'' was captured, instructions were sent to other holders of those keys not to use them, so damage was limited. However it was discovered in the debriefing that the Pueblo had onboard superseded key lists for November and December 1967 which should have been destroyed by January 15, well before the Pueblo arrived on station, according to standing orders.<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|p. 19}} The report considered the capture of the superseded keys for November and December the most damaging cryptographic loss. The capture of these keys likely allowed North Korea and its allies to read more than 117,000 classified messages sent during those months.<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|p. 30}} The North Koreans would also have gained a thorough knowledge of the workings of the captured systems but that would only have been of use if additional key material was compromised in the future. The existence of the [[Walker spy ring]] was, of course, not known at the time of the report.\n\nThe report noted that \u201cthe North Koreans did not display any of the captured cryptographic material to the crew, except for some equipment diagrams, or otherwise publicize the material for propaganda purposes. When contrasted with the international publicity given to the capture of other highly classified Special Intelligence documents, the fact that this material was not displayed or publicized would indicate that they thoroughly understood its significance and the importance of concealing \nfrom the United States the details of the information they had acquired.\u201d<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|A.7}}\n\n=== In the communist camp ===\n\nDocuments released from [[National Archives of Romania]] suggest it was the Chinese rather than the Soviets who actively encouraged the reopening of hostilities in Korea during 1968, promising North Korea vast material support should hostilities in Korea resume.<ref name=\"wilsoncenter\"/> Together with Blue House Raid, the ''Pueblo'' incident turned out to be part of an increasing divergence between the Soviet leadership and North Korea. Fostering a resumption of hostilities in Korea, allegedly, was seen in Beijing as a way to mend relations between North Korea and China, and pull North Korea back in the Chinese sphere of influence in the context of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. After the (then secret) diplomatic efforts of the Soviets to have the American crew released fell on deaf ears in Pyongyang, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] publicly denounced North Korea's actions at the 8th plenary session of the [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"wilsoncenter\"/> In contrast, the Chinese (state controlled) press published declarations supportive of North Korea's actions in the ''Pueblo'' incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT130|title=China and North Korea: Strategic and Policy Perspectives from a Changing China|first=C.|last=Freeman|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books|access-date=5 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515040417/https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT130|archive-date=15 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Soviet archives reveal that the Soviet leadership was particularly displeased that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had contradicted the assurances he previously gave Moscow that he would avoid a military escalation in Korea. Previously secret documents suggest the Soviets were surprised by the ''Pueblo'' incident, first learning of it in the press. The same documents reveal that the North Koreans also kept the Soviets completely in the dark regarding ongoing negotiations with the Americans for the crew's release, which was another bone of contention. The Soviet reluctance at a reopening of hostilities in Korea was partly motivated by the fact that they had a [[DPRK-Soviet Union Treaty of 1961|1961 treaty with North Korea that obliged them to intervene]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3005971-1961-Treaty-of-Friendship-Cooperation-and-Mutual.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030920/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3005971-1961-Treaty-of-Friendship-Cooperation-and-Mutual.html |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> in case the latter got attacked.

The Soviets revealed however that Kim Il-sung sent a letter to [[Alexei Kosygin]] on 31 January 1968 demanding further military and economic aid, which was interpreted by the Soviets as the price they would have to pay to restrain Kim Il-sung's bellicosity. Consequently, Kim Il-sung was invited to Moscow, but he refused to go in person owing to \"increased defense preparations\" he had to attend to, sending instead his defense minister, [[Kim Ch'ang-bong]], who arrived on 26 February 1968. During a long meeting with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader made it clear that they were not willing to go to war with the United States, but agreed to an increase in subsidies for North Korea, which did happen in subsequent years.<ref name=\"Radchenko\"/>{{rp|15\u201318}}\n\n<center>{{Gallery\n|title=Aftermath: capture and repatriation\n|lines=6\n|width=200\n|height=150\n|File:Pueblo crew on 122368.jpg|''Pueblo's'' crew being released by the North Koreans across the [[Bridge of No Return]] in the [[Joint Security Area]] of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] (De-militarized Zone) in [[Panmunjom]], [[Korea]] on 23 December 1968.\n|Image:Repatriation of USS Pueblo Crew.jpg|Crew of USS ''Pueblo''<br /> upon release on 23 December 1968.\n|File:Pueblo group photo at Balboa Naval Hospital.jpg|Official Navy photograph of ''Pueblo's'' crew taken on the grounds of the [[Balboa Naval Hospital]] in San Diego shortly after their arrival.\n<!-- |Image:Pueblo a12 26 January 68 1.jpg|USS ''Pueblo'' in North Korean custody at Wonsan on 26 January 1968 (CIA [[Lockheed A-12|A-12]] imagery). -->\n}}</center>\n\n==Timeline of negotiations==\nWith Major General Pak Chung-kuk representing North Korea (DPRK) and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Victor Smith representing the [[United States]] until April 1968, at which point he is replaced by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Major General Gilbert H.

Initially, she was classified as a light cargo ship for basic refitting at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] during 1966. As ''Pueblo'' was prepared under a non-secret cover as a light cargo ship, the general crew staffing and training was on this basis, with 44% having never been to sea when first assigned. Installation of signals intelligence equipment, at a cost of $1.5 million, was delayed to 1967 for budgetary reasons, resuming service as what is colloquially known as a \"[[spy ship]]\" and redesignated ''AGER-2'' on 13 May 1967.

The North Korean vessel then ordered ''Pueblo'' to [[wikt:stand down|stand down]] or be fired upon. ''Pueblo'' attempted to maneuver away, but was considerably slower than the submarine chaser.

At the same time, U.S. officials were concerned with conciliating the South Koreans, who expressed discontent about being left out of the negotiations. Richard A. Ericson, a political counselor for the American embassy in Seoul and operating officer for the ''Pueblo'' negotiations, notes in his oral history:\n\n<blockquote>The South Koreans were absolutely furious and suspicious of what we might do. They anticipated that the North Koreans would try to exploit the situation to the ROK's disadvantage in every way possible, and they were rapidly growing distrustful of us and losing faith in their great ally. Of course, we had this other problem of how to ensure that the ROK would not retaliate for the [[Blue House Raid]] and to ease their growing feelings of insecurity. They began to realize that the DMZ was porous and they wanted more equipment and aid. So, we were juggling a number of problems.<ref name=\"Richard A.

If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasn't in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it. Sometimes we would get totally nonsensical responses if they didn't have something in the card file that corresponded to the proposal at hand.<ref name=\"Richard A.

You are going to be asked to sign a document that the North Koreans will have drafted. They will brook no changes. It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of ... If you allow them to, they will take as much time as they feel they need to squeeze every damn thing they can get out of this situation in terms of their propaganda goals, and they will try to exploit this situation to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the ROK.

In October 1999, she was towed from Wonsan on the east coast, around the Korean Peninsula, to the port of [[Nampo]] on the west coast. This required moving the vessel through international waters, and was undertaken just before the visit of U.S. presidential envoy [[James A. Kelly|James Kelly]] to the capital [[Pyongyang]]. After the stop at the Nampo shipyard ''Pueblo'' was relocated to Pyongyang and moored on the [[Taedong River]] near the spot that the [[General Sherman incident]] is believed to have taken place. In late 2012 ''Pueblo'' was moved again to the Botong River in Pyongyang next to a new addition to the [[Fatherland Liberation War Museum]].<ref name=\"usspueblo.org\"/>\n\nToday, ''Pueblo'' remains the second-oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, behind {{USS|Constitution}} (\"Old Ironsides\"). ''Pueblo'' is one of only a few American ships to have been captured since the wars in [[First Barbary War|Tripoli]].\n\n=== Breach of U.S. communications security ===\nReverse engineering of communications devices on ''Pueblo'' allowed the North Koreans to share knowledge with the Soviet Union that led to the replication of those communications devices. This allowed the two nations access to the US Navy's communication systems until the US Navy revised those systems. The seizure of ''Pueblo'' followed soon after US Navy [[warrant officer]] [[John Anthony Walker]] introduced himself to Soviet authorities, setting up the Walker spy ring.  It has been argued that the seizure of ''Pueblo'' was executed specifically to capture the encryption devices aboard.

The crew itself thought the North Koreans would be able to rebuild much of the equipment. \n\nCryptographic equipment onboard at the time of capture included \u201cone [[KL-47]] for off-line encryption, two KW-7s<ref>[https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/usa/kw7/index.htm CryptoMuseum page on KW-7]</ref> for on-line encryption, three [[KWR-37]]s for receiving the Navy Operational Intelligence Broadcast, and four KG-14s<ref>[http://www.jproc.ca/crypto/kg14.html KG-14 information]</ref> which are used in conjunction with the KW-37 for receiving the Fleet Broadcasts.\u201d Additional tactical systems and [[one-time pad]]s were captured, but they were considered of little significance since most messages sent using them would be of value for only a short time. \n\nThe ship's cryptographic personnel were subject to intense interrogation by what they felt were highly knowledgable electronics experts. When crew members attempted to withhold details, they were later confronted with pages from captured manuals and told to correct their earlier accounts. The report concluded that the information gained from the interrogations saved the North Koreans three to six months of effort, but that they would have eventually understood everything from the captured equipment and accompanying technical manuals alone. The crew members were also asked about many U.S. cryptographic systems that were not onboard the Pueblo, but only supplied superficial information. \n\nThe ''Pueblo'' carried [[key (cryptography)|key lists]] for January, February and March of 1968, but immediately after the ''Pueblo'' was captured, instructions were sent to other holders of those keys not to use them, so damage was limited. However it was discovered in the debriefing that the Pueblo had onboard superseded key lists for November and December 1967 which should have been destroyed by January 15, well before the Pueblo arrived on station, according to standing orders.<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|p. 19}} The report considered the capture of the superseded keys for November and December the most damaging cryptographic loss. The capture of these keys likely allowed North Korea and its allies to read more than 117,000 classified messages sent during those months.<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|p. 30}} The North Koreans would also have gained a thorough knowledge of the workings of the captured systems but that would only have been of use if additional key material was compromised in the future. The existence of the [[Walker spy ring]] was, of course, not known at the time of the report.\n\nThe report noted that \u201cthe North Koreans did not display any of the captured cryptographic material to the crew, except for some equipment diagrams, or otherwise publicize the material for propaganda purposes. When contrasted with the international publicity given to the capture of other highly classified Special Intelligence documents, the fact that this material was not displayed or publicized would indicate that they thoroughly understood its significance and the importance of concealing \nfrom the United States the details of the information they had acquired.\u201d<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|A.7}}\n\n=== In the communist camp ===\n\nDocuments released from [[National Archives of Romania]] suggest it was the Chinese rather than the Soviets who actively encouraged the reopening of hostilities in Korea during 1968, promising North Korea vast material support should hostilities in Korea resume.<ref name=\"wilsoncenter\"/> Together with Blue House Raid, the ''Pueblo'' incident turned out to be part of an increasing divergence between the Soviet leadership and North Korea. Fostering a resumption of hostilities in Korea, allegedly, was seen in Beijing as a way to mend relations between North Korea and China, and pull North Korea back in the Chinese sphere of influence in the context of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. After the (then secret) diplomatic efforts of the Soviets to have the American crew released fell on deaf ears in Pyongyang, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] publicly denounced North Korea's actions at the 8th plenary session of the [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"wilsoncenter\"/> In contrast, the Chinese (state controlled) press published declarations supportive of North Korea's actions in the ''Pueblo'' incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT130|title=China and North Korea: Strategic and Policy Perspectives from a Changing China|first=C.|last=Freeman|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books|access-date=5 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515040417/https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT130|archive-date=15 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Soviet archives reveal that the Soviet leadership was particularly displeased that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had contradicted the assurances he previously gave Moscow that he would avoid a military escalation in Korea. Previously secret documents suggest the Soviets were surprised by the ''Pueblo'' incident, first learning of it in the press. The same documents reveal that the North Koreans also kept the Soviets completely in the dark regarding ongoing negotiations with the Americans for the crew's release, which was another bone of contention. The Soviet reluctance at a reopening of hostilities in Korea was partly motivated by the fact that they had a [[DPRK-Soviet Union Treaty of 1961|1961 treaty with North Korea that obliged them to intervene]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3005971-1961-Treaty-of-Friendship-Cooperation-and-Mutual.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030920/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3005971-1961-Treaty-of-Friendship-Cooperation-and-Mutual.html |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> in case the latter got attacked.

The Soviets revealed however that Kim Il-sung sent a letter to [[Alexei Kosygin]] on 31 January 1968 demanding further military and economic aid, which was interpreted by the Soviets as the price they would have to pay to restrain Kim Il-sung's bellicosity. Consequently, Kim Il-sung was invited to Moscow, but he refused to go in person owing to \"increased defense preparations\" he had to attend to, sending instead his defense minister, [[Kim Ch'ang-bong]], who arrived on 26 February 1968. During a long meeting with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader made it clear that they were not willing to go to war with the United States, but agreed to an increase in subsidies for North Korea, which did happen in subsequent years.<ref name=\"Radchenko\"/>{{rp|15\u201318}}\n\n<center>{{Gallery\n|title=Aftermath: capture and repatriation\n|lines=6\n|width=200\n|height=150\n|File:Pueblo crew on 122368.jpg|''Pueblo's'' crew being released by the North Koreans across the [[Bridge of No Return]] in the [[Joint Security Area]] of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] (De-militarized Zone) in [[Panmunjom]], [[Korea]] on 23 December 1968.\n|Image:Repatriation of USS Pueblo Crew.jpg|Crew of USS ''Pueblo''<br /> upon release on 23 December 1968.\n|File:Pueblo group photo at Balboa Naval Hospital.jpg|Official Navy photograph of ''Pueblo's'' crew taken on the grounds of the [[Balboa Naval Hospital]] in San Diego shortly after their arrival.\n<!-- |Image:Pueblo a12 26 January 68 1.jpg|USS ''Pueblo'' in North Korean custody at Wonsan on 26 January 1968 (CIA [[Lockheed A-12|A-12]] imagery). -->\n}}</center>\n\n==Timeline of negotiations==\nWith Major General Pak Chung-kuk representing North Korea (DPRK) and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Victor Smith representing the [[United States]] until April 1968, at which point he is replaced by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Major General Gilbert H.
