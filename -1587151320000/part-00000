Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at [[Central Washington University]] who is 6&nbsp;inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either before or after the team's practice. He would later say, \"I did not take it easy on her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't too nice. I would ride her and foul her. I'd put my hand in her face and she would whine and complain about fouls. I'd say, 'There's no fouls out here.' \" She eventually reached the point where she regularly beat her coach off the dribble.<ref name=\"WNBA dream\"/>\n\nA pivotal moment in her life came during the summer before her sophomore year, when she went with a friend to the [[Gonzaga University]] girls' basketball camp. She would say about the trip in 2011, \"I just fell in love with this place. I felt so comfortable here.\" The Gonzaga women's basketball staff was equally enthusiastic about her, except for head coach [[Kelly Graves]], who had little opportunity to see her during the camp. Graves would finally get to see Vandersloot at length in her junior year, on the day before the 2006 Washington Class 4A state tournament. He offered her a [[athletic scholarship|scholarship]] after seeing her practice, even though he did not stay for the tournament.<ref name=\"Perfect match\"/>\n\nThat season, she had averaged more than 18 points and 7 assists as she led Kentwood to its first state tournament appearance; they would lose in the second round of the tournament to Spokane's [[University High School (Spokane)|University High]], led by future [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]] star [[Angie Bjorklund]]. After that season, Vandersloot was asked by many people if she would consider [[Washington Huskies|Washington]] or another [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]] school, but decided against it after a Pac-10 assistant told Hennig she was too small.<ref name=\"Perfect match\"/> She would eventually [[National Letter of Intent|sign]] with Gonzaga in November 2006, during her senior year at Kentwood; she noted in 2011, \"I wasn't really being highly recruited and I just didn't want to go through the stressful recruiting process, so I committed early to Gonzaga.\"<ref name=\"WNBA dream\"/>\n \nVandersloot took her game to another level as a senior, averaging 26 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 5 steals while leading Kentwood to a third-place finish in the state tournament; their only loss was in the state semifinals.

Most important to her future development as a player, she regularly played against boys.<ref name=\"Perfect match\"/> During the third grade, she wrote a school paper about her dreams of one day playing in the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]].<ref name=\"WNBA dream\"/>\n\nWhile Vandersloot regularly played basketball and many other sports as a child\u2014she was also on a [[softball|fast-pitch]] softball team that was runner-up in a Washington state tournament at age 11\u2014 her favorite sport was soccer; she had a poster of [[Mia Hamm]] on her bedroom wall.<ref name=\"WNBA dream\"/> She did not concentrate on basketball until high school:\n{{quote|I grew up wanting to go to [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]] because of Mia Hamm.

Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at [[Central Washington University]] who is 6&nbsp;inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either before or after the team's practice. He would later say, \"I did not take it easy on her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't too nice. I would ride her and foul her. I'd put my hand in her face and she would whine and complain about fouls. I'd say, 'There's no fouls out here.' \" She eventually reached the point where she regularly beat her coach off the dribble.<ref name=\"WNBA dream\"/>\n\nA pivotal moment in her life came during the summer before her sophomore year, when she went with a friend to the [[Gonzaga University]] girls' basketball camp. She would say about the trip in 2011, \"I just fell in love with this place. I felt so comfortable here.\" The Gonzaga women's basketball staff was equally enthusiastic about her, except for head coach [[Kelly Graves]], who had little opportunity to see her during the camp. Graves would finally get to see Vandersloot at length in her junior year, on the day before the 2006 Washington Class 4A state tournament. He offered her a [[athletic scholarship|scholarship]] after seeing her practice, even though he did not stay for the tournament.<ref name=\"Perfect match\"/>\n\nThat season, she had averaged more than 18 points and 7 assists as she led Kentwood to its first state tournament appearance; they would lose in the second round of the tournament to Spokane's [[University High School (Spokane)|University High]], led by future [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]] star [[Angie Bjorklund]]. After that season, Vandersloot was asked by many people if she would consider [[Washington Huskies|Washington]] or another [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]] school, but decided against it after a Pac-10 assistant told Hennig she was too small.<ref name=\"Perfect match\"/> She would eventually [[National Letter of Intent|sign]] with Gonzaga in November 2006, during her senior year at Kentwood; she noted in 2011, \"I wasn't really being highly recruited and I just didn't want to go through the stressful recruiting process, so I committed early to Gonzaga.\"<ref name=\"WNBA dream\"/>\n \nVandersloot took her game to another level as a senior, averaging 26 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 5 steals while leading Kentwood to a third-place finish in the state tournament; their only loss was in the state semifinals. She scored 113 points in the tournament, one shy of the state record for a girls' tournament, and was named MVP.

It was originally the main residence of the [[Prince-elector]]s of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] of the [[House of Wittelsbach]]. Part of the palace is used by the [[University of Mannheim]]. The castle, which features tapestries, furniture, paintings, porcelain and silverware can be visited on a free-flow basis with audioguides.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Schloss Mannheim 1725 v J C Froimon.jpg|left|thumb|Layout of the Mannheim Palace in 1725]] \nThe city of Mannheim, founded in 1606, was fortified and at the present site of the castle there was a fortress called ''Friedrichsburg'', sometimes serving as alternative residence for the Elector, one of the most important territorial princes of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe actual palace dates from the 18th century. When Elector [[Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine|Karl III Philip]] had confessional controversies with the inhabitants of his capital [[Heidelberg]], he decided to make Mannheim the Palatinate's new capital in 1720. Karl Philip decided to construct a new palace as his residence on the site of the old Friedrichsburg. It was part of a general trend among the German princes to create grand new residences in that era.\n\nConstruction was commenced solemnly on June 2, 1720. The building process was intended to cost about 300,000 [[Guilder|Gulden]], financed by an extraordinary \u201cpalace tax\u201d, but in the end, the palace cost about 2 million Gulden and severely worsened the Palatinate's financial situation. The first administrative institutions began using the palace in 1725, but Karl Philip was able to transfer his court to the new residence only in 1731. Construction was not completed until 1760.\n\nKarl Philip died in 1742 and was succeeded by a distant relative, the young [[Count Palatine]] of [[Sulzbach am Main|Sulzbach]] and later Duke of Bavaria [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodor]]. During his reign, the palace and the city of Mannheim saw their zenith. The glamour of the Elector's court and Mannheim's then famous cultural life lasted until 1778, when Karl Theodor became Elector of [[Bavaria]] by inheritance and he moved his court to [[Munich]]. Although Mannheim kept the title of \u201cresidence\u201d, the palace was used merely as accommodation for several administrative bodies.\n\nThings worsened further during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], when Mannheim was besieged. During [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s reorganization of Germany, the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] was split up and Mannheim became part of the [[Grand Duchy]] of [[Baden]], thus losing its capital/residence status. Some glamour returned to Mannheim Palace when [[St\u00e9phanie de Beauharnais]], the consort of Grand Duke [[Karl, Grand Duke of Baden|Karl of Baden]], resided here after 1806. For most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the palace served no uniform purpose, being used as a representative building and a museum for the city.\n\nIn [[World War II]], the palace was heavily bombed and partly destroyed. Many people supported demolishing it after the war to create space for a more modern city architecture. These plans came to nothing and in recent years the palace has been renovated extensively thanks to private donations and government funding totaling more than 54 million euro.<ref>http://www.schloss-mannheim.de/wissenswert-amuesant/</ref>\n\n==Use as University==\n\nElector Karl Theodor founded the [[Kurpf\u00e4lzische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] as early as 1763, and although there was no continuous existence of a scientific college in Mannheim, the [[Business school|Wirtschaftshochschule]], or business college, founded in 1907, saw itself in the tradition of Karl Theodor's earlier college. The college expanded its subjects program in 1967, thus gaining \u201cuniversity\u201d status. The [[University of Mannheim]] still uses Mannheim Palace as its central building complex and although many university buildings are dispersed all over the city center, key institutions such as the rectorate or the [[Mannheim University Library|main library]] are accommodated in the palace, besides countless lecture halls and offices.<ref>http://www.schloss-mannheim.de/</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe site of the palace is impressive, although the construction of roads and railway tracks has diminished its dominating look. To the southwest, it faces the [[Rhine]] and [[Ludwigshafen am Rhein|Ludwigshafen]]. To the northeast the palace presents its 450 m long front to the Mannheim city centre. By surrounding an area of 6 hectare the castle is one of Europe's biggest palaces and the second biggest one in Baroque style, second only after Versailles. For reasons of prestige the architects made sure that Mannheim Palace has one more window than Versailles. The ''Breite Stra\u00dfe'' runs from the palace to Mannheim's central square, the ''Paradeplatz''.\n\nThe central part of the palace is the ''Mittelbau'' with its representative halls. Today, the Mittelbau holds state rooms and the ''Rittersaal'' hall. The Mittelbau is flanked by the ''Ehrenhof West'' and ''Ehrenhof Ost'' wings, which include the [[Court of Honor]] in front of the Mittelbau. In those two wings, there are mainly lecture halls and offices of the university's humanities section. Below the Ehrenhof, there is a massive bunker dating from World War II. Initially constructed as defensive military fortification designed to protect up to 1,500 residents or valued materials from Russian and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing attacks, it served as a hotel with a capacity for up to 65 guests after the war. Today it is used as occasional exposition space for modern and urban art, e.g. during the [[Long Night of Museums]] in Mannheim.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.langenachtdermuseen.com/mannheim/museum/id/498|title=Bunker|publisher=langenachtdermuseen.com|accessdate=2014-05-11}}</ref> \n\nThe northern wing includes the impressive ''Schlosskirche'' (palace church) and the law section, as well as Mannheim's ''Amtsgericht'' (lower district court). The southern/eastern wing is much larger than the northern one, including the ''Schneckenhof'' yard (a popular university party ground) and holding most of the university's central institutions, as well as the largest lecture halls and the central Hasso Plattner Library. Two sculptures are located on the central courtyard and represent the two founders of the Mannheim Palace [[Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine]] and [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria]].\n\nThe palace has been repainted in a bright ocher/yellow, the Mittelbau (Corps de Logis) has been thoroughly rebuilt (including a new roof construction), and the Ehrenhof (Court of Honor) was restructured and paved with granite.\n[[File:SchlossMannheim-Pano-130616.jpg|700 px|thumb|center|Mannheim Palace, 180 degrees panoramic view]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Baroque residences]]\n* [[Mannheim Forum]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Schloss Mannheim}}\n*[http://www.schloss-mannheim.de/en/home/ Mannheim Baroque Palace] - museum information\n\n{{coord|49|28|58.8|N|8|27|43.2|E|type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Palaces in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:Royal residences in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Mannheim]]\n[[Category:Baroque palaces]]\n[[Category:Baroque architecture in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:Episcopal palaces in Germany]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Mannheim]]\n[[Category:Electoral Palatinate]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n[[Image:Schloss Ma 001.jpg|250 px|thumb|right|The Mittelbau of Mannheim Palace seen from the west]]\n[[File:SchlossEhrenhof 2017.jpg|250 px|thumb|right|Mannheim Palace courtyard]]\n[[File:Antikensammlung Mannheim Laokoon.jpg|250 px|thumb|right|Copy of [[Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons]] in the Mannheim Palace]]\n[[File:Schloss Mannheim Gang.jpg|250 px|thumb|right|Hallway in the Mannheim Palace university section]]\n\n'''Mannheim Palace''' ({{lang-de|Mannheimer Schloss}}) is a large [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] palace in [[Mannheim]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Germany]].

They in turn are members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Procellariidae]] and the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Procellariiformes]]. The prions are small and typically eat [[zooplankton]];<ref name=\"Maynard\">Maynard, B. J. (2003)</ref> however, as a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called [[naricorns]], although the nostrils on the prion are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. They produce a [[stomach oil]] made up of [[wax ester]]s and [[triglycerides]] that is stored in the [[proventriculus]]. This is used against predators as well as an energy-rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.<ref>Double, M. C. (2003)</ref> Finally, they also have a [[salt gland]] that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of seawater that they imbibe. They excrete concentrated [[brine]] from their nostrils.<ref>Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988)</ref>\n\n===Sub-species===\nThe fulmar prion has two subspecies:\n* ''Pachyptila crassirostris crassirostris'', which breeds on the [[Snares Islands]], [[Chatham Islands]], and [[Bounty Islands]].<ref name=\"Clements\">Clements, James (2007)</ref>\n* ''Pachyptila crassirostris eatoni'', which breeds on [[Heard Island]] and the [[Auckland Islands]]<ref name=\"Clements\"/>\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Breeding===\nFulmar prions are annual breeders; they lay a single egg in their nest on islands with [[seabird colony|colonies]]. Both sexes will [[avian incubation|incubate]] the egg, which takes about 45 days, and raise the chick until it [[fledge]]s at around 46 days.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n===Diet===\nLike all [[prion (bird)|prions]], fulmar prions eat predominantly [[zooplankton]], which they strain through their upper [[beak|bill]].<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n==Range and habitat==\nThe fulmar prion is [[pelagic]] and stays over the southern [[oceans]]. When breeding, they will come ashore and nest on [[Heard Island]], [[Auckland Islands]], [[Chatham Islands]], [[Bounty Islands]], and [[Snares Island]].<ref name=\"Clements\"/>\n\n==Conservation==\nFulmar prions have a very large range. Their population \u2013 while lower than most other prions \u2013 is still substantial, at between 150,000 and 300,000 adult birds. Because of these numbers, the [[IUCN]] rates them as [[Least Concern]].<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=\"BLI\">BirdLife International (2009)</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web| url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3919 | title=Fulmar Prion Pachyptila crassirostris - BirdLife Species Factsheet | accessdate=21 Jan 2013 | author=BirdLife International | year=2009| work=Data Zone}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Clements |first1=James |authorlink= James Clements|title=The Clements Checklist of the Birds of the World |edition=6th |year=2007 |publisher= Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=978-0-8014-4501-9  }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia |last=Double | first = M.

They in turn are members of the [[Procellariidae]] [[family (biology)|family]] and the [[Procellariiformes]] [[order (biology)|order]]. The prions are small and typically eat [[zooplankton]];<ref name=\"Maynard\">Maynard, B. J. (2003)</ref> however, as a member of the Procellariiformes, they share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called [[naricorns]], although the nostrils on the prion are on top of the upper bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. They produce a [[stomach oil]] made up of [[wax ester]]s and [[triglycerides]] that is stored in the [[proventriculus]]. This is used against predators as well as an energy-rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.<ref>Double, M. C. (2003)</ref> Finally, they also have a [[salt gland]] that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of seawater that they imbibe. They excrete concentrated [[brine]] from their nostrils.<ref>Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988)</ref>\n\n===Sub-species===\nThe fulmar prion has two sub-species:\n* ''Pachyptila crassirostris crassirostris'', which breeds on the [[Snares Islands]], [[Chatham Islands]], and [[Bounty Islands]].<ref name=\"Clements\">Clements, James (2007)</ref>\n* ''Pachyptila crassirostris eatoni'', which breeds on [[Heard Island]] and the [[Auckland Islands]]<ref name=\"Clements\"/>\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Breeding===\nFulmar prions are annual breeders; they lay a single egg in their nest on islands with [[seabird colony|colonies]]. Both sexes will [[avian incubation|incubate]] the egg, which takes about 45 days, and raise the chick until it [[fledge]]s at around 46 days.<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n===Diet===\nLike all [[prion (bird)|prions]], fulmar prions eat predominantly [[zooplankton]], which they strain through their upper [[beak|bill]].<ref name=\"Maynard\"/>\n\n==Range and habitat==\nThe fulmar prion is [[pelagic]] and stays over the southern [[oceans]]. When breeding, they will come ashore and nest on [[Heard Island]], [[Auckland Islands]], [[Chatham Islands]], [[Bounty Islands]], and [[Snares Island]].<ref name=\"Clements\"/>\n\n==Conservation==\nFulmar prions have a very large range. Their population \u2013 while lower than most other prions \u2013 is still substantial, at between 150,000 and 300,000 adult birds. Because of these numbers, the [[IUCN]] rates them as [[Least Concern]].<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=\"BLI\">BirdLife International (2009)</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web| url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3919 | title=Fulmar Prion Pachyptila crassirostris - BirdLife Species Factsheet | accessdate=21 Jan 2013 | author=BirdLife International | year=2009| work=Data Zone}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Clements |first1=James |authorlink= James Clements|title=The Clements Checklist of the Birds of the World |edition=6th |year=2007 |publisher= Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=978-0-8014-4501-9  }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia |last=Double | first = M.

(End of 2004).\n\nThere are several major [[railway]] routes in the country:\n* (via [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]]) [[#Dobova-Tovarnik line (International corridor X)|from Dobova via Zagreb, Slavonski Brod and Vinkovci to Tovarnik]] (and onwards to [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]), with a connection in [[Strizivojna]]&ndash;[[Vrpolje]] towards Osijek\n* [[M201 railway (Croatia)|from Zagreb to Koprivnica]]\n* [[M202 railway (Croatia)|from Zagreb to O\u0161tarije and Rijeka]]\n* from O\u0161tarije to [[Split (city)|Split]]\n* [[M104 railway (Croatia)|from Zagreb to Sisak]] ''(the shortest main route, but highly important)''\n* [[R201 railway (Croatia)|from Zagreb to Vara\u017edin]]\n\nThere are other routes to [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Serbia]], as well as regular overnight trains to [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] (namely [[Bavaria]]).\n\nThe network enjoyed a limited number of improvements in the 2000s, such as an increase in the maximum speed of the Zagreb-Novska-Vinkovci line: certain sections of the route have had witnessed a rise in maximum speed from 80&nbsp;km/h to 160&nbsp;km/h.\n\nRailway modernisation is set to be extended further, and a national 'railway investment plan' (with funding totalling over 18&nbsp;billion [[Croatian Kuna|HRK]] through 2012) was announced; following the 2008-09 financial crisis, however, the plan has yet to come to fruition.\n\n===Dobova-Tovarnik line (International corridor X)===\n[[File:Croatian railways tilting and regional.png|thumb|A regional train making way for an Inter-City tilting train on the Zagreb-Split line.|305x305px]]\nThe railway lines [[M101 railway (Croatia)|M101]], [[M102 railway (Croatia)|M102]], [[M103 railway (Croatia)|M103]], [[M104 railway (Croatia)|M104]] and [[M105 railway (Croatia)|M105]] linking [[Dobova]], Zagreb and [[Tovarnik]], operating the length of Croatia east-west via Zagreb, are the country's most important railway line, and part of the [[Pan-European corridor X]]. It is also the most advanced and busiest, being completely [[electrified]] and consisting mostly of [[double track]]s. It longitudinally crosses Croatia's continental regions [[Slavonia]], [[Posavina]] and the Greater [[Zagreb]] Region, connecting the most economically developed towns in Croatia with each other. The route is as follows:\n\n* [[Dobova]] (on the Croatian [[border]] with Slovenia)\n* [[Zagreb Glavni railway station]]\n* [[Sesvete]] (track split towards [[Sisak]] (electrified))\n* [[Dugo Selo]] (track split towards [[Botovo, Croatia|Botovo]] (electrified)) (This is planned as the future corridor 5b)\n* [[Ivani\u0107 Grad]], [[Kutina]]\n* the village of [[Banova Jaruga]] (again track split towards [[Virovitica]] (non-electrified))\n* [[Novska]] (track split backwards towards [[Sisak]] (electrified))\n* [[Nova Gradi\u0161ka]]\n* the combined station for the villages [[Nova Kapela]]&ndash;[[Batrina]] (track split towards [[Po\u017eega, Croatia|Po\u017eega]], and via [[Pleternica]] towards [[Na\u0161ice]] (non-electrified) )\n* [[Slavonski Brod]]\n* combined station for the villages [[Strizivojna]]&ndash;[[Vrpolje]] (two track splits: towards [[Osijek]] (currently non-electrified) and towards [[Slavonski \u0160amac]] (electrified, Croatian border to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]))\n* [[Vinkovci]] (four track splits: towards Osijek, Vukovar, \u017dupanja and Br\u010dko in Bosnia and Herzegovina, before the [[Domovinski rat|War of Independence]], Vinkovci was a highly important junction station in this part of Europe, both for passengers as well as for freight)\n* [[Tovarnik]] (on the Croatian border with [[Serbia]])\n\nAt Vinkovci, lines extend towards [[\u017dupanja]] and [[Vukovar]], both unelectrified.

Reducing travel time from Split to Zagreb by around a third, to 5\u20136&nbsp;hours. This track was not intended as the shortest distance between Zagreb and Split. The line via [[Martin Brod]] which forms the border with [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], has been closed to passenger traffic since the [[Yugoslav Wars|wars]] of the early 1990s.\n\nSome of the problems faced include the age of the line; it was constructed 1913-1925 and contained many curves, often in difficult terrain. Services were slow and speeds severely restricted. The modernisation has involved rebuilding entire sections of track, straightening many curvy segments by rerouting portions of the track and renewing the rails, leading to higher operational speeds. The electrification of the line is not scheduled for the near future.\n\nNumerous stations along the line that were in the area of Serbian military occupation have been abandoned. Local trains are only functioning between Ogulin-Vrhovine (two per day). From Vrhovine to Knin there is as of 2013 no local passenger transport, even though some stations are in good condition (e.g. Medak, Malovan, Plavno). ICN tilting trains only stop in Gospi\u0107 and Gra\u010dac. Some stations are to soon be renovated or rebuilt (Lovinac, Gospic); Croatian Railways, however, currently has no plans to restart local passenger transport.\n\nIn late September 2014 H\u017d Putni\u010dki prijevoz abandoned the night train 824/825 between Zagreb and Split.\n\n=== International corridor V ===\n[[File:Carrozza Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice.jpg|thumb|International Intercity train carriage shown at Budapest Keleti station.|315x315px]]\nThe fifth [[Pan-European corridor]] has two branches in Croatia, the \"b\" and \"c\" branch.\n\n[[Corridor Vb]] enters Croatia in [[Botovo, Croatia|Botovo]], and runs to [[Zagreb]]. The part from [[Zagreb]] to [[Rijeka]] should become part of this corridor, as soon as the extension towards Rijeka is built.\n\n[[Corridor Vc]] is a Pan-European railway line, running north to south within Croatia. It enters Croatia at [[Beli Manastir]] on the border with Hungary, and runs through [[Osijek]] to enter [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in [[Slavonski \u0160amac]]. It enters Croatia again in Metkovi\u0107, in the very south-east of [[Dalmatia]], where it ends at the [[Plo\u010de]] harbour. The line crosses the Dobova-Tovarnik line in [[Strizivojna]]&ndash;[[Vrpolje]]. The line is currently being heavily modernised in order to revitalise Plo\u010de's harbour.\n\nThe part from Strizivojna-Vrpolje towards [[Slavonski \u0160amac]] is fully electrified, and recently the modernised [[Overhead lines|catenary]] has been put into operation. The passenger traffic scheduled from [[Vinkovci]] to Slavonski \u0160amac (now performed by [[electric power|electrical power]]) is still fragmented. The remaining part from Strizivojna-Vrpolje to region of [[Osijek]] (heart of the region [[Slavonia]]) is scheduled to be electrified, as soon the general overhaul of the line track is completed, after which operating speeds will finally be raised to {{convert|160|km/h|-1|abbr=on}}. The line will stay single track.\n\n=== The Vinkovci-Osijek line ===\nBefore the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the [[Vinkovci]]-[[Osijek]] line was one of the busiest branch lines of Croatia, linking two regional centres. At the time the line allowed speeds of up to 120&nbsp;km/h. As a result of the war, only about 10 kilometres of the 35-km line remained intact. Most of the track was dismantled by invading Serb forces, both in the form of vandalism as well as to use the materials in barricades.\n\nThe reconstruction of this vital route was finally finished in 2008, and today the route is once again fully operational. Test runs with a measuring vehicle were successful, and speeds reaching 80&nbsp;km/h were attained. The first test train had its maiden voyage along the route on 12 December 2008, and regular revenue service restarted two days later, on 14 December.\n\n=== The \"Unska pruga\" route ===\nThe route called ''Unska pruga'' (lit. the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] track) that connects [[Zagreb]] and [[Split (city)|Split]] along the Una river valley was once an integral part of the [[Yugoslav Railways]] railway system. Today, this route remains largely unused, since much of the route virtually runs ''over'' the border between [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], crossing it multiple times, on the section between [[Knin]] and [[Biha\u0107]].\n\nAlthough this route is largely well preserved and electrified at 25 kV/50&nbsp;Hz (making it compatible with the Croatian electrification system), administrative problems concerning the many border crossings cause this route to be used only for limited freight traffic services. The designated border crossing along the line between the two countries is at the village of [[Martin Brod]].\n\n=== Network connection problems ===\nThere are some rail network connection problems, which have historical causes. When Croatia was part of Yugoslavia, the rail network was consistently connected and managed by [[Yugoslav Railways]]. As the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] constituent states demerged, important rail links were severed.\n\n==== Istria ====\nIstria has no direct connection through Croatia. Currently, all rail operates through Slovenia, though this is planned to be solved with a tunnel [[northwest]]ern of [[Rijeka]].\n\n==== Dubrovnik and Plo\u010de ====\nThe Dubrovnik area is again a special case. Dubrovnik and its surrounds are an [[exclave]], divided by the small [[Neum]] corridor belonging to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Historically, the Dubrovnik region has been developed through sea travel. There has never been a direct rail link through Croatia to Dubrovnik, and none is planned in the future.\n\nA large 760mm [[narrow-gauge]] rail network was constructed in the early 20th century, when the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] as well as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were under Austrian control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.a1.net/elob/ada/dalmatia.htm|title=A SHORT HISTORY OF THE RAILWAYS IN  DALMATIA 1876-2007|accessdate=31 May 2010|url-status=dead|archivedate=7 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007085319/http://members.a1.net/elob/ada/dalmatia.htm}}</ref> The rail route to Dubrovnik went from [[Sarajevo]] via [[Mostar]] and [[\u010capljina]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penmorfa.com/JZ/dubrovnik2.html|title=Dubrovnik to Sarajevo in 1965 by Charlie Lewis - Page 1|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penmorfa.com/JZ/dubrovnik2.html|title=Dubrovnik to Sarajevo in 1965 by Charlie Lewis - Page 2|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref> rather than to Split and Zagreb in Croatia. In 1967 the line from Sarajevo to \u010capljina was upgraded to standard gauge, and from there extended not to Dubrovnik but to terminate at the nearby [[Port of Plo\u010de]], handling freight via Bosnia.\n\nThe route from \u010capljina to Dubrovnik was closed in 1975 by the Yugoslav Government, acting on the advice of foreign transport consultants. This was in spite of the attractive scenery of the route which has been compared to Switzerland's narrow gauge network. Proposals in 1985 to reopen the route were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penmorfa.com/JZ/one.htm|title=From Sarajevo to Dubrovnik in 1967 by Dave Sallery - Page 1|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nDirect trains connected Zagreb with Plo\u010de in thirteen hours, via Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>http://vred.hznet.hr/hzinfo/Default.asp?VL=..397&category=hzinfo&service=izvr3&SCREEN=4&KO=Zagreb%20Gl.%20Kol.&LANG=en</ref>. There are no more passenger trains between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some buses (with H\u017d-tarification) connect Plo\u010de with Metkovi\u0107 and stops between both places. The road connection from Plo\u010de to Dubrovnik is {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} and passes through Neum.\n\n====Zadar====\nFrom 1966 passenger trains served Zadar and Knin. In around 2013 plans were put forward to upgrade the line so that it could support speeds of up to 120 km/h. However, a Serbian mine was discovered. The project was closed and all rail traffic stopped, and has not begun since. Buses have been introduced to the route, which currently run 3 times in each direction per day. The travel time is roughly the same.\n\n== Logo evolution ==\n<gallery>\nFile:H\u017d logo.gif|25 June 1991\u2013present\n</gallery>\n\n== Power systems ==\nThe original decision in former Yugoslavia was to use 3 kV DC electrification for the railway network. This was performed on the [[M202 railway (Croatia)|Rijeka\u2013Zagreb line]], which due to the mountainous [[Gorski kotar]] region had a need for more powerful trains than the traditional diesel powered ones.\n\nBeginning with the modernisation of the [[Zagreb\u2013Belgrade railway]] line an electrification system of 25 kV/50&nbsp;Hz was used. Electrification on other lines in Croatia was then made exclusively 25 kV/50&nbsp;Hz. Later, the majority of the [[Zagreb]]&ndash;[[Rijeka]] line was re-electrified to 25 kV/50&nbsp;Hz, but until December 2012 there was still a part that under 3 kV DC. Consequentially a power system break existed at [[Moravice, Croatia|Moravice]]. [[H\u017d]] was considering the purchase of dual-voltage locomotives, as an alternative to full re-electrification of 3 kV DC tracks, but the idea was scrapped for good as all electrified railways in Croatia are now using 25 kV/50&nbsp;Hz.\n\nAll railway power systems in Croatia are exclusively of type [[overhead catenary]].\n\n\n== Rolling stock ==\n\n\n\n[[File:HZ diesel unit.jpg|thumb|A diesel locomotive built by General Motors|327x327px]]\n[[File:H\u017d locomotive 1141 303.jpg|thumb|right|Renovated class 1141 built in the 1980s by Kon\u010dar, Zagreb.

These trains are normally deployed on the mountainous route between the two largest Croatian cities, route [[Zagreb]] - [[Split (city)|Split]], but are also sometimes on the [[InterCity]] routes in the continental part of the country. In the case of the Zagreb-Split route, this offers passengers a much more comfortable and time-saving journey with regard to previous trains whose journey took 8&nbsp;hours, whereas the tilting trains take less than 5 and a half hours, and are more quiet and better equipped as well.\n\nHowever, the safety of the tilting trains and their possible technical incompatibility with the conditions of the Croatian railroads are disputed after the [[2009 Rudine train derailment]], an incident that occurred on 24 July of that year, in which six passengers were killed and 55 were injured in the crash.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak.aspx?id=443114 |title=Nagibni vlak kod Ka\u0161tela isko\u010dio iz tra\u010dnica: Za nesre\u0107u krivo protupo\u017earno sredstvo? |work=[[Index.hr]] |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2012-03-02}}</ref>  Approximately 3&nbsp;years before this fatal derailment, on 24 November 2006, there was another accident in which the train's engineer was killed; the tilting train crashed into a lorry at a railroad crossing that had no ramp or warning lights.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/u-sudaru-hzovog-vlaka-i-kamiona-poginuo-strojovodja/333207.aspx |title=U sudaru H\u017d-ovog vlaka i kamiona poginuo strojovo\u0111a - Vijesti.net |publisher=Index.hr |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2011-05-03}}</ref> Out of eight trainsets that were introduced in 2004, two are therefore out of service. The tilting train services may therefore have to be reduced as there are no longer enough train-sets to serve all scheduled ICN trains and destinations.\n\n===Renumbering===\nIn 1993 [[H\u017d]] renumbered all their vehicles. This results in some confusion to the relation to their previous numbers. All other companies, which have been formed after dissolution of [[J\u017d]] have kept the original numbers.\n\n== Croatian speed record ==\nThe current rail speed record in Croatia is 185&nbsp;km/h. The record was set on the line between [[Novska]] and [[Nova Gradi\u0161ka]]. The run was performed in order to demonstrate the possibilities offered by the [[KON\u010cAR Group|Rade Kon\u010dar]] built J\u017d 442 electric locomotive class (now [[H\u017d series 1142|H\u017d1142]] train class). Despite being over 25&nbsp;years old the 1 142 remains the fastest locomotive in operation with Croatian railways.\n\n== Future developments and projects ==\n* Building a new line between Bjelovar and Zagreb (Railway line Gradec-Sveti Ivan \u017dabno).\n* Suburban rail traffic around Zagreb is to be fully renovated and reorganised. Some local lines previously shut down will be reactivated, and a link to [[Zagreb Airport]] has been approved and announced by Zagreb authorities. New EMUs and DMUs have been ordered from Croatian manufacturer [[KON\u010cAR Group|Kon\u010dar KEV]].\n* 2009 or 2010 will see the opening of a newly constructed line to [[Samobor]] though following a different route to the previous line. The line will use new rolling stock and help alleviate the trouble currently encountered by those wishing to travel between the two cities\n* Suburban rail traffic around [[Split (city)|Split]] is to begin (has already begun on a small scale). ''See: [[Split Suburban Railway]]''\n* Corridor 5c will be upgraded to allow an operating speed of 160&nbsp;km/h. This has already been completed between Osijek and Slavonski \u0160amac.\n* Corridor 5c will be completely electrified (date still unknown)\n* Dual power engines will be purchased. Some tests with trains from various manufacturers, mostly [[Siemens]] [[Eurosprinter]] electric engines, have been performed already.\n* Revitalisation of the Osijek-Vinkovci line recently started, and the line will support maximum speeds of 120&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;km/h in practice). Since this line was in a badly damaged state the reconstruction will be done in 2 phases. '''Phase 1''' is only the necessary signalling (track crossing signalling through traffic signs only). Due to this fact and the current corresponding Croatian laws, traffic must commence very carefully, and probably trains will have to stop on every crossing and then speed up again. Due to excess costs in phase 1, '''phase 2''' will be deploy automatic track-road protection devices on all crossings, which will finally allow full nominal line speed.\n\n=== High-speed rail line ===\nA fully electrified line connects [[Rijeka]] with [[Zagreb]], onwards towards [[Koprivnica]] and the [[Hungary|Hungarian border]]; the railway line forms part of the European 5b corridor. A transportation bill to be passed by the [[Croatian Parliament]] will see the start of construction of Croatia's first high-speed rail line along this pan-European corridor, enabling theoretical speeds of between 200 and 250&nbsp;km/h with an average journey speed of no less than 160&nbsp;km/h. The plan consists of retrofitting the existing track between the Hungarian border and [[Karlovac]] to a double-track configuration, as well as constructing new tracks along an entirely new alignment from [[Karlovac]] to [[Rijeka]]. The line's complete length will be 269&nbsp;km, or 61&nbsp;km shorter than the current line. Construction on the new line was announced to start in the autumn of 2008<ref name=novilist.hr>[http://www.hznet.hr/iSite3/fgs.axd?id=1836 Kalmeta talks about infrastructural projects in current 4-year plan]</ref> and was to be completed before the end of 2013.<ref name=pfaffrail.googlepages.com>{{cite web|url=http://pfaffrail.googlepages.com/NizinskiKalmeta.pdf |title=New projects in Croatian Infrastructure |publisher=Pfaffrail.googlepages.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-03}}</ref> The onset of the [[Great Recession|economic downturn of the late 2000s]] has put this project on indefinite hold.\n\nThe speeds of this line will enable a trip from Rijeka to Zagreb in an hour, as opposed to the current four hours. The initial route plan is described on this link:\n[http://www.wieninternational.at/en/node/3426 Initial proposed solution]. The line is conceived primarily to better connect the [[Port of Rijeka]] to the network of European transport, as the port serves many regions and locales across Central Europe.\n\n=== Unofficial long term projects===\n* More usage of the flagship ICN trains (the newest H\u017d stock acquisition), also on Zagreb-[[Na\u0161ice]] line (over Nova Kapela-Batrina and Pleternica), additionally to currently running Zagreb-Osijek over Strizivojna-Vrpolje train and to [[Vara\u017edin]]. This is the latest news, as announced. Ridership on existing ICN lines proved to be full success. The ICN Zagreb-Osijek, Zagreb-Vara\u017edin and Zagreb-Split ICN lines are almost always at 100% ridership capacity.\n* Reelectrification and bringing back the destroyed catenary and signals on Novska-Sisak and integration in the full pre-war length and conversion to former known Zagreb-Novska alternative route, also speed increase.\n* A new, just few kilometers long connection route (branch line) connecting two rail routes around [[Bjelovar]] is planned a long time, and, when build, will shorten travel times from Bjelovar to Zagreb (now done over Kri\u017eevci). This will be the first entirely original railroad line in Croatia in many years.\n* Plans to upgrade the Dobova-Tovarnik (Corridor X) to double track at the full length (if the freight traffic increases to pre-war amounts or above that) and higher speeds (above 160&nbsp;km/h) (talked about since long time). Most of the track damaged sections between Novska and Tovarnik is completely renewed after the Croatian war of independence. This route is the most probable candidate for a track above 200&nbsp;km/h in the current status, as it is the most modern route, and double track in mostly excellent condition exists currently between shortly before Zagreb and Dugo Selo, and between Novska and Vinkovci. The part of double track existing after Vinkovci to Tovarnik is still being reconstructed, though only one track is currently functioning at reduced speed. This route is protected by security systems (St. Andrew's crosses and ramps) in the whole length. Near Zagreb, and Vinkovci there are even fully separate level crossings with roads. The rest is also mostly separate level crossing. Only the signalling system and overhead catenary would need some adaptations.\n* The Osijek-Vinkovci line is planned to be electrified after reopening, if justified. Before the war related closure and heavy damage in 1991, it was one of few profitable branch lines. With new changed circumstances (this is now a direct and shortest connection between European corridor Vc and corridor X), it would be economically justified to electrify it, as shortest link between the two corridors towards eastern Europe.\n* Sisak-Kutina-(Lipovljani), a new short highcapacity railway stretch for the speed of 250&nbsp;km/h. This will be a link between the corridor X branches over Sisak and Kutina.\n\n==Technical information==\n* Maximum operating speed: 160&nbsp;km/h\n* Train protection system used (where applicable): [[INDUSI]] (a stripped down derivative of German system)\n* Signaling system: at sight only, automatic block protection (on mainlines and where applicable)\n\n==Organisation==\nIn 2005, H\u017d was split up into five divisions:<ref>{{cite web|title=Croatia Railways' restructuring|url=http://www.itfglobal.org/railways/unionreports-issue9.cfm|accessdate=19 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819145410/http://www.itfglobal.org/railways/unionreports-issue9.cfm|archivedate=19 August 2012}}</ref> \n* H\u017d Holding (Holding company)\n* H\u017d Cargo d.o.o.

Reducing travel time from Split to Zagreb by around a third, to 5\u20136&nbsp;hours. This track was not intended as the shortest distance between Zagreb and Split. The line via [[Martin Brod]] which forms the border with [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], has been closed to passenger traffic since the [[Yugoslav Wars|wars]] of the early 1990s.\n\nSome of the problems faced include the age of the line; it was constructed 1913-1925 and contained many curves, often in difficult terrain. Services were slow and speeds severely restricted. The modernisation has involved rebuilding entire sections of track, straightening many curvy segments by rerouting portions of the track and renewing the rails, leading to higher operational speeds. The electrification of the line is not scheduled for the near future.\n\nNumerous stations along the line that were in the area of Serbian military occupation have been abandoned. Local trains are only functioning between Ogulin-Vrhovine (two per day). From Vrhovine to Knin there is as of 2013 no local passenger transport, even though some stations are in good condition (e.g. Medak, Malovan, Plavno). ICN tilting trains only stop in Gospi\u0107 and Gra\u010dac. Some stations are to soon be renovated or rebuilt (Lovinac, Gospic); Croatian Railways, however, currently has no plans to restart local passenger transport.\n\nIn late September 2014 H\u017d Putni\u010dki prijevoz abandoned the night train 824/825 between Zagreb and Split.\n\n=== International corridor V ===\n[[File:Carrozza Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice.jpg|thumb|International Intercity train carriage shown at Budapest Keleti station.|315x315px]]\nThe fifth [[Pan-European corridor]] has two branches in Croatia, the \"b\" and \"c\" branch.\n\n[[Corridor Vb]] enters Croatia in [[Botovo, Croatia|Botovo]], and runs to [[Zagreb]]. The part from [[Zagreb]] to [[Rijeka]] should become part of this corridor, as soon as the extension towards Rijeka is built.\n\n[[Corridor Vc]] is a Pan-European railway line, running north to south within Croatia. It enters Croatia at [[Beli Manastir]] on the border with Hungary, and runs through [[Osijek]] to enter [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in [[Slavonski \u0160amac]]. It enters Croatia again in Metkovi\u0107, in the very south-east of [[Dalmatia]], where it ends at the [[Plo\u010de]] harbour. The line crosses the Dobova-Tovarnik line in [[Strizivojna]]&ndash;[[Vrpolje]]. The line is currently being heavily modernised in order to revitalise Plo\u010de's harbour.\n\nThe part from Strizivojna-Vrpolje towards [[Slavonski \u0160amac]] is fully electrified, and recently the modernised [[Overhead lines|catenary]] has been put into operation. The passenger traffic scheduled from [[Vinkovci]] to Slavonski \u0160amac (now performed by [[electric power|electrical power]]) is still fragmented. The remaining part from Strizivojna-Vrpolje to region of [[Osijek]] (heart of the region [[Slavonia]]) is scheduled to be electrified, as soon the general overhaul of the line track is completed, after which operating speeds will finally be raised to {{convert|160|km/h|-1|abbr=on}}. The line will stay single track.\n\n=== The Vinkovci-Osijek line ===\nBefore the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the [[Vinkovci]]-[[Osijek]] line was one of the busiest branch lines of Croatia, linking two regional centres. At the time the line allowed speeds of up to 120&nbsp;km/h. As a result of the war, only about 10 kilometres of the 35-km line remained intact. Most of the track was dismantled by invading Serb forces, both in the form of vandalism as well as to use the materials in barricades.\n\nThe reconstruction of this vital route was finally finished in 2008, and today the route is once again fully operational. Test runs with a measuring vehicle were successful, and speeds reaching 80&nbsp;km/h were attained. The first test train had its maiden voyage along the route on 12 December 2008, and regular revenue service restarted two days later, on 14 December.\n\n=== The \"Unska pruga\" route ===\nThe route called ''Unska pruga'' (lit. the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] track) that connects [[Zagreb]] and [[Split (city)|Split]] along the Una river valley was once an integral part of the [[Yugoslav Railways]] railway system. Today, this route remains largely unused, since much of the route virtually runs ''over'' the border between [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], crossing it multiple times, on the section between [[Knin]] and [[Biha\u0107]].\n\nAlthough this route is largely well preserved and electrified at 25 kV/50&nbsp;Hz (making it compatible with the Croatian electrification system), administrative problems concerning the many border crossings cause this route to be used only for limited freight traffic services. The designated border crossing along the line between the two countries is at the village of [[Martin Brod]].\n\n=== Network connection problems ===\nThere are some rail network connection problems, which have historical causes. When Croatia was part of Yugoslavia, the rail network was consistently connected and managed by [[Yugoslav Railways]]. As the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] constituent states demerged, important rail links were severed.\n\n==== Istria ====\nIstria has no direct connection through Croatia. Currently, all rail operates through Slovenia, though this is planned to be solved with a tunnel [[northwest]]ern of [[Rijeka]].\n\n==== Dubrovnik and Plo\u010de ====\nThe Dubrovnik area is again a special case. Dubrovnik and its surrounds are an [[exclave]], divided by the small [[Neum]] corridor belonging to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Historically, the Dubrovnik region has been developed through sea travel. There has never been a direct rail link through Croatia to Dubrovnik, and none is planned in the future.\n\nA large 760mm [[narrow-gauge]] rail network was constructed in the early 20th century, when the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] as well as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were under Austrian control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.a1.net/elob/ada/dalmatia.htm|title=A SHORT HISTORY OF THE RAILWAYS IN  DALMATIA 1876-2007|accessdate=31 May 2010|url-status=dead|archivedate=7 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007085319/http://members.a1.net/elob/ada/dalmatia.htm}}</ref> The rail route to Dubrovnik went from [[Sarajevo]] via [[Mostar]] and [[\u010capljina]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penmorfa.com/JZ/dubrovnik2.html|title=Dubrovnik to Sarajevo in 1965 by Charlie Lewis - Page 1|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penmorfa.com/JZ/dubrovnik2.html|title=Dubrovnik to Sarajevo in 1965 by Charlie Lewis - Page 2|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref> rather than to Split and Zagreb in Croatia. In 1967 the line from Sarajevo to \u010capljina was upgraded to standard gauge, and from there extended not to Dubrovnik but to terminate at the nearby [[Port of Plo\u010de]], handling freight via Bosnia.\n\nThe route from \u010capljina to Dubrovnik was closed in 1975 by the Yugoslav Government, acting on the advice of foreign transport consultants. This was in spite of the attractive scenery of the route which has been compared to Switzerland's narrow gauge network. Proposals in 1985 to reopen the route were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.penmorfa.com/JZ/one.htm|title=From Sarajevo to Dubrovnik in 1967 by Dave Sallery - Page 1|accessdate=31 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nDirect trains connected Zagreb with Plo\u010de in thirteen hours, via Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>http://vred.hznet.hr/hzinfo/Default.asp?VL=..397&category=hzinfo&service=izvr3&SCREEN=4&KO=Zagreb%20Gl.%20Kol.&LANG=en</ref>. There are no more passenger trains between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some buses (with H\u017d-tarification) connect Plo\u010de with Metkovi\u0107 and stops between both places. The road connection from Plo\u010de to Dubrovnik is {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} and passes through Neum.\n\n====Zadar====\nFrom 1966 passenger trains served Zadar and Knin. In around 2013 plans were put forward to upgrade the line so that it could support speeds of up to 120 km/h. However, a Serbian mine was discovered. The project was closed and all rail traffic stopped, and has not begun since. Buses have been introduced to the route, which currently run 3 times in each direction per day. The travel time is roughly the same.\n\n== Logo evolution ==\n<gallery>\nFile:H\u017d logo.gif|25 June 1991\u2013present\n</gallery>\n\n== Power systems ==\nThe original decision in former Yugoslavia was to use 3 kV DC electrification for the railway network. This was performed on the [[M202 railway (Croatia)|Rijeka\u2013Zagreb line]], which due to the mountainous [[Gorski kotar]] region had a need for more powerful trains than the traditional diesel powered ones.\n\nBeginning with the modernisation of the [[Zagreb\u2013Belgrade railway]] line an electrification system of 25 kV/50&nbsp;Hz was used. Electrification on other lines in Croatia was then made exclusively 25 kV/50&nbsp;Hz. Later, the majority of the [[Zagreb]]&ndash;[[Rijeka]] line was re-electrified to 25 kV/50&nbsp;Hz, but until December 2012 there was still a part that under 3 kV DC. Consequentially a power system break existed at [[Moravice, Croatia|Moravice]]. [[H\u017d]] was considering the purchase of dual-voltage locomotives, as an alternative to full re-electrification of 3 kV DC tracks, but the idea was scrapped for good as all electrified railways in Croatia are now using 25 kV/50&nbsp;Hz.\n\nAll railway power systems in Croatia are exclusively of type [[overhead catenary]].\n\n\n== Rolling stock ==\n\n\n\n[[File:HZ diesel unit.jpg|thumb|A diesel locomotive built by General Motors|327x327px]]\n[[File:H\u017d locomotive 1141 303.jpg|thumb|right|Renovated class 1141 built in the 1980s by Kon\u010dar, Zagreb.

These trains are normally deployed on the mountainous route between the two largest Croatian cities, route [[Zagreb]] - [[Split (city)|Split]], but are also sometimes on the [[InterCity]] routes in the continental part of the country. In the case of the Zagreb-Split route, this offers passengers a much more comfortable and time-saving journey with regard to previous trains whose journey took 8&nbsp;hours, whereas the tilting trains take less than 5 and a half hours, and are more quiet and better equipped as well.\n\nHowever, the safety of the tilting trains and their possible technical incompatibility with the conditions of the Croatian railroads are disputed after the [[2009 Rudine train derailment]], an incident that occurred on 24 July of that year, in which six passengers were killed and 55 were injured in the crash.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak.aspx?id=443114 |title=Nagibni vlak kod Ka\u0161tela isko\u010dio iz tra\u010dnica: Za nesre\u0107u krivo protupo\u017earno sredstvo? |work=[[Index.hr]] |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2012-03-02}}</ref>  Approximately 3&nbsp;years before this fatal derailment, on 24 November 2006, there was another accident in which the train's engineer was killed; the tilting train crashed into a lorry at a railroad crossing that had no ramp or warning lights.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/u-sudaru-hzovog-vlaka-i-kamiona-poginuo-strojovodja/333207.aspx |title=U sudaru H\u017d-ovog vlaka i kamiona poginuo strojovo\u0111a - Vijesti.net |publisher=Index.hr |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2011-05-03}}</ref> Out of eight trainsets that were introduced in 2004, two are therefore out of service. The tilting train services may therefore have to be reduced as there are no longer enough train-sets to serve all scheduled ICN trains and destinations.\n\n===Renumbering===\nIn 1993 [[H\u017d]] renumbered all their vehicles. This results in some confusion to the relation to their previous numbers. All other companies, which have been formed after dissolution of [[J\u017d]] have kept the original numbers.\n\n== Croatian speed record ==\nThe current rail speed record in Croatia is 185&nbsp;km/h. The record was set on the line between [[Novska]] and [[Nova Gradi\u0161ka]]. The run was performed in order to demonstrate the possibilities offered by the [[KON\u010cAR Group|Rade Kon\u010dar]] built J\u017d 442 electric locomotive class (now [[H\u017d series 1142|H\u017d1142]] train class). Despite being over 25&nbsp;years old the 1 142 remains the fastest locomotive in operation with Croatian railways.\n\n== Future developments and projects ==\n* Building a new line between Bjelovar and Zagreb (Railway line Gradec-Sveti Ivan \u017dabno).\n* Suburban rail traffic around Zagreb is to be fully renovated and reorganised. Some local lines previously shut down will be reactivated, and a link to [[Zagreb Airport]] has been approved and announced by Zagreb authorities. New EMUs and DMUs have been ordered from Croatian manufacturer [[KON\u010cAR Group|Kon\u010dar KEV]].\n* 2009 or 2010 will see the opening of a newly constructed line to [[Samobor]] though following a different route to the previous line. The line will use new rolling stock and help alleviate the trouble currently encountered by those wishing to travel between the two cities\n* Suburban rail traffic around [[Split (city)|Split]] is to begin (has already begun on a small scale). ''See: [[Split Suburban Railway]]''\n* Corridor 5c will be upgraded to allow an operating speed of 160&nbsp;km/h. This has already been completed between Osijek and Slavonski \u0160amac.\n* Corridor 5c will be completely electrified (date still unknown)\n* Dual power engines will be purchased. Some tests with trains from various manufacturers, mostly [[Siemens]] [[Eurosprinter]] electric engines, have been performed already.\n* Revitalisation of the Osijek-Vinkovci line recently started, and the line will support maximum speeds of 120&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;km/h in practice). Since this line was in a badly damaged state the reconstruction will be done in 2 phases. '''Phase 1''' is only the necessary signalling (track crossing signalling through traffic signs only). Due to this fact and the current corresponding Croatian laws, traffic must commence very carefully, and probably trains will have to stop on every crossing and then speed up again. Due to excess costs in phase 1, '''phase 2''' will be deploy automatic track-road protection devices on all crossings, which will finally allow full nominal line speed.\n\n=== High-speed rail line ===\nA fully electrified line connects [[Rijeka]] with [[Zagreb]], onwards towards [[Koprivnica]] and the [[Hungary|Hungarian border]]; the railway line forms part of the European 5b corridor. A transportation bill to be passed by the [[Croatian Parliament]] will see the start of construction of Croatia's first high-speed rail line along this pan-European corridor, enabling theoretical speeds of between 200 and 250&nbsp;km/h with an average journey speed of no less than 160&nbsp;km/h. The plan consists of retrofitting the existing track between the Hungarian border and [[Karlovac]] to a double-track configuration, as well as constructing new tracks along an entirely new alignment from [[Karlovac]] to [[Rijeka]]. The line's complete length will be 269&nbsp;km, or 61&nbsp;km shorter than the current line. Construction on the new line was announced to start in the autumn of 2008<ref name=novilist.hr>[http://www.hznet.hr/iSite3/fgs.axd?id=1836 Kalmeta talks about infrastructural projects in current 4-year plan]</ref> and was to be completed before the end of 2013.<ref name=pfaffrail.googlepages.com>{{cite web|url=http://pfaffrail.googlepages.com/NizinskiKalmeta.pdf |title=New projects in Croatian Infrastructure |publisher=Pfaffrail.googlepages.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-03}}</ref> The onset of the [[Great Recession|economic downturn of the late 2000s]] has put this project on indefinite hold.\n\nThe speeds of this line will enable a trip from Rijeka to Zagreb in an hour, as opposed to the current four hours. The initial route plan is described on this link:\n[http://www.wieninternational.at/en/node/3426 Initial proposed solution]. The line is conceived primarily to better connect the [[Port of Rijeka]] to the network of European transport, as the port serves many regions and locales across Central Europe.\n\n=== Unofficial long term projects===\n* More usage of the flagship ICN trains (the newest H\u017d stock acquisition), also on Zagreb-[[Na\u0161ice]] line (over Nova Kapela-Batrina and Pleternica), additionally to currently running Zagreb-Osijek over Strizivojna-Vrpolje train and to [[Vara\u017edin]]. This is the latest news, as announced. Ridership on existing ICN lines proved to be full success. The ICN Zagreb-Osijek, Zagreb-Vara\u017edin and Zagreb-Split ICN lines are almost always at 100% ridership capacity.\n* Reelectrification and bringing back the destroyed catenary and signals on Novska-Sisak and integration in the full pre-war length and conversion to former known Zagreb-Novska alternative route, also speed increase.\n* A new, just few kilometers long connection route (branch line) connecting two rail routes around [[Bjelovar]] is planned a long time, and, when build, will shorten travel times from Bjelovar to Zagreb (now done over Kri\u017eevci). This will be the first entirely original railroad line in Croatia in many years.\n* Plans to upgrade the Dobova-Tovarnik (Corridor X) to double track at the full length (if the freight traffic increases to pre-war amounts or above that) and higher speeds (above 160&nbsp;km/h) (talked about since long time). Most of the track damaged sections between Novska and Tovarnik is completely renewed after the Croatian war of independence. This route is the most probable candidate for a track above 200&nbsp;km/h in the current status, as it is the most modern route, and double track in mostly excellent condition exists currently between shortly before Zagreb and Dugo Selo, and between Novska and Vinkovci. The part of double track existing after Vinkovci to Tovarnik is still being reconstructed, though only one track is currently functioning at reduced speed. This route is protected by security systems (St. Andrew's crosses and ramps) in the whole length. Near Zagreb, and Vinkovci there are even fully separate level crossings with roads. The rest is also mostly separate level crossing. Only the signalling system and overhead catenary would need some adaptations.\n* The Osijek-Vinkovci line is planned to be electrified after reopening, if justified. Before the war related closure and heavy damage in 1991, it was one of few profitable branch lines. With new changed circumstances (this is now a direct and shortest connection between European corridor Vc and corridor X), it would be economically justified to electrify it, as shortest link between the two corridors towards eastern Europe.\n* Sisak-Kutina-(Lipovljani), a new short highcapacity railway stretch for the speed of 250&nbsp;km/h. This will be a link between the corridor X branches over Sisak and Kutina.\n\n==Technical information==\n* Maximum operating speed: 160&nbsp;km/h\n* Train protection system used (where applicable): [[INDUSI]] (a stripped down derivative of German system)\n* Signaling system: at sight only, automatic block protection (on mainlines and where applicable)\n\n==Organisation==\nIn 2005, H\u017d was split up into five divisions:<ref>{{cite web|title=Croatia Railways' restructuring|url=http://www.itfglobal.org/railways/unionreports-issue9.cfm|accessdate=19 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819145410/http://www.itfglobal.org/railways/unionreports-issue9.cfm|archivedate=19 August 2012}}</ref> \n* H\u017d Holding (Holding company)\n* H\u017d Cargo d.o.o.

Archeological evidence suggests that it was originally built during the mid-14th century, in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style. Its site is strategic \u2013 a rise on the banks of the [[Nemunas]] River near its [[confluence]] with the [[Neris]] River. At the beginning of the 21st century, about one-third of the castle was still standing.\n\n==History==\nThe precise construction date of the first Kaunas Castle is unknown. Archaeological data suggests that a stone castle was built on the site during the middle of the 14th century. Situated on an elevated bank near the river junction about {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} from the capital city of [[Vilnius]], it served as a strategic outpost and guarded nearby cities as well as trade routes.[[Image:Kaunas.Lietuva.Kaunas Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Kaunas Castle in 19th century]]\n\nA written account states that in 1361, the [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Order|Grand Master]] of the [[Teutonic Knights]] [[Winrich von Kniprode]] issued an order to gather information about the castle, specifically the thickness of its walls, as preparation for an assault on the castle. In March\u2013April 1362, the castle was [[Siege of Kaunas (1362)|besieged by the Teutonic Order]]. During this attack, the Teutonic Knights constructed a [[siege tower]] and erected wall-penetration machinery; primitive fire arms might have been used, since [[gunpowder]] technology was emerging in Europe. At that time, the castle walls were over {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} high, when its firing galleries are factored in. According to [[Wigand of Marburg]], the castle's garrison consisted of about 400 Lithuanians soldiers, commanded by [[Vaidotas]], son of Duke [[K\u0119stutis]]. After three weeks, the Knights managed to breach the castle's walls, and soon afterwards the castle was taken. On Easter Sunday in 1362, the knights conducted a [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] at the castle to commemorate their victory.\n[[Image:Vytauto priesaika.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Jan Styka]], \"''Oath of [[Vytautas the Great]], Grand Duke of Lithuania, by ruined Kaunas Castle in 1362''\", 1901 m., The [[Vytautas the Great War Museum]], [[Kaunas]].]] \n\nApparently, of the castle's defense force of 400, only 36 survived. Questions remain with regard to the castle's defenders' lack of support from outside during the siege. In any event, K\u0119stutis soon regained and rebuilt Kaunas Castle, but it remained a point of contention between Lithuanians and Teutonic Knights for many years. In 1384 Kaunas Castle was re-captured by the Teutonic Knights. At this time [[Hochmeister|Grand Master]] [[Konrad Z\u00f6llner von Rotenstein]] began reconstruction of Kaunas Castle and renamed it Marienwerder. The presence of the Knights in Kaunas meant that the entire defensive system of castles along the Nemunas was threatened. Confronting this situation, the Lithuanians launched an attack on the castle later the same year.\n[[File:1984 08 19Kaunas7.jpg|thumb|left|The castle after partial restorations]]\n[[Image:Kaunas Castle.jpg|thumb|left|The round tower and the bastion of the Castle prior to reconstruction]]\n\nIt seems likely that the Lithuanians mustered an army near Vilnius as a strategic maneuver, since Lithuanians could use the downstream flow of the Neris River to transport artillery and military provisions from Vilnius; the Knights were forced to use overland or upstream transport. During the 1384 assault, the Lithuanians deployed cannons and [[trebuchet]]s; the besieged Teutonic Knights had also installed cannons in the castle, which apparently destroyed the Lithuanians' trebuchet. Nevertheless, the castle was retaken by the Lithuanians.\n\nAfter 1398, the Teutonic Knights were no longer able to reconquer the castle. After the [[Battle of Grunwald]], Kaunas Castle lost its strategic military importance and was used as a residence. The castle served administrative purposes after the death of [[Vytautas the Great]]. [[Sigismund Augustus]] gave this castle to his wife [[Barbara Radziwill]] in 1549. During the 16th century, the castle was strengthened and adapted to new defensive purposes by the construction of an artillery [[bastion]] near the round tower. The diameter of the bastion was about {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and the height of the bastion's walls was about {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}; the wall worked in conjunction with a defensive trench. At the bottom of the bastion a firing gallery was installed, which was linked with the tower.\n\nIn 1601, Kaunas Castle housed courts and an archive. At some time in 1611, part of the castle was flooded by the Neris River. [[Image:LT-2008-50lit\u0173-Kauno_pilis-b.png|thumb|right|A coin with a presumable view of the remaining part of the castle]]\nDue to its convenient location, it was used by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] military during its [[Polish-Swedish wars#Polish\u2013Swedish War of 1600\u20131611|war with the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], after which its military functions ceased. In the mid-17th century, large portions of the castle were again flooded. The castle was used as a prison in the 18th century; later the Russian administration granted permission for houses to be built in the castle's territory, which resulted in significant damage to the castle itself.\n\nKaunas city and this castle was mentioned in the famous Lithuanian<ref>Lithuania, my Homeland...

In the 1960s the round tower was opened as a museum, but due to the tower's structural deterioration, the museum was transferred elsewhere.\n\n==Conservation of the castle==\n[[Image:Kauno pilis 2011.jpg|thumb|left|The Kaunas Castle after the reconstruction of 2011]]\nProtection of the castle began in 1930; nearby houses were demolished, and the territory was examined by archeologists. Further efforts to preserve the castle were made in the 1950s. At this time the round tower underwent some repair; later the firing bastion was excavated from beneath several overlying strata. The excavated bastion was in very good condition. As part of its protection, temporary roofing was put in place there, as well as on the remaining towers and walls. The remaining portions of the round tower were not reconstructed to their original height, nor were the castle walls; the bigger part of them are only remaining foundations of the walls.\n\nArcheological excavations continued at Kaunas Castle, interrupted by periods of inactivity. The evidence gathered from these archeological works suggests that the configuration of the castle, excluding the bastion, has remained in the form it took during its reconstruction in 1376.\n\n==Today==\n[[File:Kaunas castle 20160603.jpg|thumb|right|Kaunas Castle in 2016]]\nMajor reconstruction work started in 2010 and ended in 2011. In 2011, a branch of the Kaunas City Museum was established in Kaunas Castle. The castle is open to tourism, and hosts occasional festivals. A new sculpture \"Freedom Warrior\" (or the [[Vytis]]) was erected near Kaunas castle on 14 July 2018. The \"Freedom Warrior\" is almost seven meters high and was cast in [[Ukraine]]. A bronze horseman with a horse was placed at the castle of Kaunas on a granite pedestal. The authors of the sculpture are Lithuanian A. Sakalauskas and Ukrainians Boris Krylov and Olesius Sidoruk.<ref>The Freedom Warrior was presented in Kaunas: it turned out who had chosen his face for the rider, https://tech2.org/lithuania/the-freedom-warrior-was-presented-in-kaunas-it-turned-out-who-had-chosen-his-face-for-the-rider/</ref> In 2019 Kaunas City museum with Kaunas Castle became a new Member of Association of Castles and Museums around the Baltic Sea.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of castles in Lithuania]]\n*[[Gothic architecture in Lithuania]]\n*[[Kaunas Fortress]]\n\n==References==\n* Kauno istorijos metra\u0161tis.
