name=\"Gawrych110133\"/> Originating from a humble background and being unschooled, he began his military career first as a private and later was promoted to ''farik'' (general).<ref name=\"Gawrych133210\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=133, 210.}}</ref><ref name=\"Hanioglu267\"/> Shemsi as such was an ''ayal\u0131'' (a person that rises through the army ranks to become an officer) and not a ''mektepli'' (a person who gets military school education and then enters the officer corps).<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/> In 1901 Shemsi, a favorite of [[Abdul Hamid II]] and his trusted official was appointed as commander of the 18th Infantry Division based in [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovi\u00e7e]] (modern Mitrovic\u00eb) that protected an important northern entry route into the empire.<ref name=\"Gawrych110133\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=110, 133.}}</ref> For seven years the 18th Infantry Division was under his command and the sultan came to rely on him as someone with ingenuity who could take care of local problems in the region of Kosovo.<ref name=\"Gawrych133139210\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=133, 139, 210.}}</ref> The Mektepli officers viewed him as a simple man with a several centuries old mindset while regular soldiers respected Shemsi as he came from their ranks and rose in the army based on demonstrated skills gained from experience.<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/> Shemsi was also the military envoy to the Ottoman Inspector General based in [[Thessaloniki|Selanik]] (modern Thessaloniki).<ref name=\"Clayer92\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=92.}}</ref>\n\nIn his career Shemsi had to deal with corrupt or incompetent officials in difficult circumstances.<ref name=\"Gawrych110\"/> During February 1905 he attempted to remove Brigadier Cavid Bey as mutasarr\u0131f of [[Pej\u00eb|\u0130pek]] (modern Pej\u00eb) for having caused problems due to disrespect toward Albanian customs and traditions.<ref name=\"Gawrych110113\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=110, 113.}}</ref> In

in villages around [[Gjakov\u00eb|Yakova]] (modern Gjakov\u00eb) and Shemsi Pasha was sent to bring order to the area, as he was in charge of resolving conflicts in Kosovo.<ref name=\"Clayer909394\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=90, 93, 94.}}</ref> An Albanian, S\u00fcleyman K\u00fcl\u00e7e, the adjuntant and personal secretary of Shemsi thought that Abdul Hamid II was mistaken in selecting officers whom lacked an education like the General for resolving problems of the area.<ref name=\"Clayer94\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=94.}}</ref><ref name=\"Zurcher29\">{{harvnb|Z\u00fcrcher|2014|p=29.}}</ref> During the start of the Muslim religious holiday [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayram]], Shemsi got a telegram in early September 1907 about an incident in Smolic\u00eb regarding the profanation of the village mosque with a dead pig.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> The Italian consul in Kosovo thought it was a reaction by Catholics to the kidnapping of a Catholic priest held captive in Smolic\u00eb by Muslims, a first time act by them in the area and tensions rapidly rose between both religious communities.<ref name=\"Clayer9495\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=94-95.}}</ref> [[Edith Durham]], a British traveler present in the region commented that the priest was held by Muslims whom demanded that Ottoman authorities release a relative of one of the captors in exchange for the hostage.<ref name=\"Clayer93\"/> \n\nIn short time Shemsi told the local Islamic clergy to soften the reactions of Muslims and stated to them that the pig's dead body did not profane the mosque and ordered the people responsible for the incident be found.<ref name=\"Clayer9599\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=95, 99.}}</ref> In January 1908, an order was received by Shemsi to go with soldiers to Yakova.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Later at the town Shemsi was met by a Catholic priest who passed on a letter about local Christians having been killed in the area.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Shemsi then assembled Muslim notables of Yakova and the wider area and said that most Catholics subjected to attacks were innocent.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Troops were left in the town after Shemsi departed.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> During his time in Yakova, Shemsi received a telegraph from [[Prizren]] about a mosque profanation

He spent his childhood and started his studies in [[Berehove]] (Beregsz\u00e1sz) which is now located at the Ukrainian-Hungarian border.\n\nIn 1957, as a self-taught painter, he participated in his first exhibition at the Gallery of Fine Arts in Uzhgorod. In 1958 he was accepted to the [[The Lviv National Academy of Arts|College of Arts and Crafts]] in [[Lwow]] and started his professional studies at the faculty of monumental painting.{{clarify|reason=\"monumental painting\", what is that? Do they really have a department dedicated to very large paintings?|date=March 2014}} After the first year he moved to [[Leningrad]] where he continued his studies at the Vera Mukhina Higher School of Art and Design (now the [[Saint Petersburg State Art and Industry Academy]]), also at the monumental painting faculty.{{clarify|reason=\"monumental painting\"... what is it?|date=March 2014}}\n\nAfter graduating in 1964, Zicherman moved to [[Perm]] in the [[Ural Mountains|Ural region]], where he worked for the Fine Arts Foundation on a number of commissions, as a specialist in monumental art.{{clarify|reason=again with the \"monumental arts\"... monuments? very large works? progaganda? public art? or what?|date=March 2014}} In Perm and the surrounding region he produced a number of [[fresco]]s, [[mosaic]]s, [[sgraffito]]s, and ceramic [[high relief]]s, and also three large gobelins (tapestries after the manner of the [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins]]). \n\nIn addition to executing works linked to architecture, Zicherman also worked for Perm Television and the Perm theatres. In 1966, after participating in the art exhibition \"Socialist Urals\" sponsored by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Soviet Republic]] he was accepted to the [[USSR Union of Artists]] as a candidate member, and in 1975 as a full member. Between 1969 and 1972 he worked and lived in a number of different cities and regions including Lviv, [[J\u016brmala]], [[Riga]], [[Elista]], and [[Moscow]].\n\nIn 1972 Zicherman moved to [[Tolyatti]] (formerly Stavropol-on-Volga) at the invitation of the city administration for the organization of cultural and artistic life. He contributed to the founding of the Tolyatti Lyceum of Arts art gallery,<ref name=museum_news/> and was instrumental in founding the Tolyatti branch of the Union of Artists. In 1987, he organized Russia's first stone-carving sculpture symposium, in Tolyatti.\n\nZicherman later moved to [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], where he married Zinaida Sokolova,<ref name=museum_news/> and in 1989 to [[Budapest]]. Of this move to [[Hungary]], he said that \"[A]ll of us are of mixed nationalities, I do not know a single person who is one hundred percent Russian or [[Mordovia]]n\". He describes himself as a Hungarian artist of Russian origin.<ref>[http://mordovia.spravedlivo.ru/press/smi_review/230.smx Art Exhibit at Yalgat]{{in lang|ru}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716064900/http://mordovia.spravedlivo.ru/press/smi_review/230.smx |date=July 16, 2008 }}</ref> In Budapest, he and his wife opened a Russian theater and studio at the Russian embassy.<ref>[http://www.szinhaz.hu/rusteatr/rufolap.shtml History of the Russian Theatre-Studio]{{in lang|hu}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615001523/http://www.szinhaz.hu/rusteatr/rufolap.shtml |date=June 15, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nBy 1989 Sandor Zicherman had participated in great number All-Soviet and All-Russian exhibitions, including exhibitions representing Soviet art abroad (Hungary, Czechoslovakia, NDK, Poland). His exhibits included paintings to graphics, medals, ceramics, sculptures, and tapestries. His mosaics, sgraffitos and memorials are still on show in many Russian cities. In addition to participating in group exhibitions, by 1989 he had had more than 30 personal exhibitions in various cities of the Soviet Union and also participated in 13 different Soviet or international two-month symposiums. Since his move to Budapest in 1990 he has participated in more than 60 group and personal exhibitions in Budapest and other Hungarian cities, as well as a great number of European countries.\n\nZicherman does not adhere to a particular genre; among his works and graphics are portraits, [[avant-garde]] pieces, and classical landscapes, employing a variety of stylistic devices such as [[cubo-futurism]], [[post-impressionism]], and [[realism (visual arts)|realism]]. In recent years, he has produced many works in the [[Depictions of nudity|nu]] genre.\n\nHis work is represented in [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage]], the Samara State Fine Arts Museum, the Tolyatti Art Museum, the Museum of Regional Ethnography in Perm, the Museum of Fine Arts of the [[Udmurt Republic]], the Technical Museum of Autovaz in Tolyatti, the Museum of Fine Arts of the [[Mari El Republic]] in [[Yoshkar-Ola]], the Joseph Boksay Fine Art Museum of Transcarpathia in Uzhgorod, the Kalmyk Fine Art Museum in Elista, the Museum of Medal Art in [[Wroclaw]], the War History Museum in Budapest, and many other museums in Europe.\n\nEvery year, Zicherman returns to Russia, where he holds a regular solo exhibition.

He is married to an actress, Zinaida Zicherman, and has two daughters and two sons.\n\n==Life==\nS\u00e1ndor Robert Zicherman was born on the 6th of April 1935 in Uzhgorod. He spent his childhood and started his studies in [[Berehove]] (Beregsz\u00e1sz) which is now located at the Ukrainian-Hungarian border.\n\nIn 1957, as a self-taught painter, he participated in his first exhibition at the Gallery of Fine Arts in Uzhgorod. In 1958 he was accepted to the [[The Lviv National Academy of Arts|College of Arts and Crafts]] in [[Lwow]] and started his professional studies at the faculty of monumental painting.{{clarify|reason=\"monumental painting\", what is that? Do they really have a department dedicated to very large paintings?|date=March 2014}} After the first year he moved to [[Leningrad]] where he continued his studies at the Vera Mukhina Higher School of Art and Design (now the [[Saint Petersburg State Art and Industry Academy]]), also at the monumental painting faculty.{{clarify|reason=\"monumental painting\"... what is it?|date=March 2014}}\n\nAfter graduating in 1964, Zicherman moved to [[Perm]] in the [[Ural Mountains|Ural region]], where he worked for the Fine Arts Foundation on a number of commissions, as a specialist in monumental art.{{clarify|reason=again with the \"monumental arts\"... monuments? very large works? progaganda? public art? or what?|date=March 2014}} In Perm and the surrounding region he produced a number of [[fresco]]s, [[mosaic]]s, [[sgraffito]]s, and ceramic [[high relief]]s, and also three large gobelins (tapestries after the manner of the [[Gobelins Manufactory|Gobelins]]). \n\nIn addition to executing works linked to architecture, Zicherman also worked for Perm Television and the Perm theatres. In 1966, after participating in the art exhibition \"Socialist Urals\" sponsored by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Soviet Republic]] he was accepted to the [[USSR Union of Artists]] as a candidate member, and in 1975 as a full member. Between 1969 and 1972 he worked and lived in a number of different cities and regions including Lviv, [[J\u016brmala]], [[Riga]], [[Elista]], and [[Moscow]].\n\nIn 1972 Zicherman moved to [[Tolyatti]] (formerly Stavropol-on-Volga) at the invitation of the city administration for the organization of cultural and artistic life. He contributed to the founding of the Tolyatti Lyceum of Arts art gallery,<ref name=museum_news/> and was instrumental in founding the Tolyatti branch of the Union of Artists. In 1987, he organized Russia's first stone-carving sculpture symposium, in Tolyatti.\n\nZicherman later moved to [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], where he married Zinaida Sokolova,<ref name=museum_news/> and in 1989 to [[Budapest]]. Of this move to [[Hungary]], he said that \"[A]ll of us are of mixed nationalities, I do not know a single person who is one hundred percent Russian or [[Mordovia]]n\". He describes himself as a Hungarian artist of Russian origin.<ref>[http://mordovia.spravedlivo.ru/press/smi_review/230.smx Art Exhibit at Yalgat]{{in lang|ru}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716064900/http://mordovia.spravedlivo.ru/press/smi_review/230.smx |date=July 16, 2008 }}</ref> In Budapest, he and his wife opened a Russian theater and studio at the Russian embassy.<ref>[http://www.szinhaz.hu/rusteatr/rufolap.shtml History of the Russian Theatre-Studio]{{in lang|hu}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615001523/http://www.szinhaz.hu/rusteatr/rufolap.shtml |date=June 15, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nBy 1989 Sandor Zicherman had participated in great number All-Soviet and All-Russian exhibitions, including exhibitions representing Soviet art abroad (Hungary, Czechoslovakia, NDK, Poland). His exhibits included paintings to graphics, medals, ceramics, sculptures, and tapestries. His mosaics, sgraffitos and memorials are still on show in many Russian cities. In addition to participating in group exhibitions, by 1989 he had had more than 30 personal exhibitions in various cities of the Soviet Union and also participated in 13 different Soviet or international two-month symposiums. Since his move to Budapest in 1990 he has participated in more than 60 group and personal exhibitions in Budapest and other Hungarian cities, as well as a great number of European countries.\n\nZicherman does not adhere to a particular genre; among his works and graphics are portraits, [[avant-garde]] pieces, and classical landscapes, employing a variety of stylistic devices such as [[cubo-futurism]], [[post-impressionism]], and [[realism (visual arts)|realism]]. In recent years, he has produced many works in the [[Depictions of nudity|nu]] genre.\n\nHis work is represented in [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage]], the Samara State Fine Arts Museum, the Tolyatti Art Museum, the Museum of Regional Ethnography in Perm, the Museum of Fine Arts of the [[Udmurt Republic]], the Technical Museum of Autovaz in Tolyatti, the Museum of Fine Arts of the [[Mari El Republic]] in [[Yoshkar-Ola]], the Joseph Boksay Fine Art Museum of Transcarpathia in Uzhgorod, the Kalmyk Fine Art Museum in Elista, the Museum of Medal Art in [[Wroclaw]], the War History Museum in Budapest, and many other museums in Europe.\n\nEvery year, Zicherman returns to Russia, where he holds a regular solo exhibition. In 2006, there was an exhibition of his works in Tolyatti, dedicated to the fortieth anniversary of [[AvtoVAZ]].

This pattern largely remained until the mid-twentieth century when a new division emerged between the [[Christian left]] (represented by the [[Social Gospel]] philosophy and [[ecumenicism]]) and the Christian right (represented by [[fundamentalism]] and [[biblical literalism]]). The Christian left (along with the secular and anti-religious left) became supporters of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] while the right moved to the [[Social Credit Party (Canada)|Social Credit Party]], especially in Western Canada, and to a lesser extent the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]].\n\nThe Social Credit Party, founded in 1935 represented a major change in Canadian religious politics. Until that time, fundamentalists had shunned politics as \"[[worldly]]\", and a distraction from the proper practice of religion. However, the new party was founded by fundamentalist radio preacher and Bible school teacher [[William Aberhart]] or \"Bible Bill\". Aberhart mixed his own interpretation of scripture and prophecy with the [[monetary reform]] theories of [[social credit]] to create a movement that swept across Alberta, winning the provincial election of 1935 in a landslide. Aberhart and his disciple [[Ernest Manning]] then governed the province for the next forty years, several times trying to expand into the rest of Canada. In 1987 Manning's son, [[Preston Manning]], founded the new [[Reform Party of Canada]], which soon became the main party of the religious right. It won majorities of the seats in Western Canada in repeated elections, but was unable to break through in Eastern Canada, though it became the [[official opposition]] from 1997 to 2003 (Reform was renamed the [[Canadian Alliance]] in 2000). In 2003 the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged to create the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], led by [[Stephen Harper]], a member of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]], who went on to become [[prime minister of Canada|prime minister]] in 2006.\n\nCanada has had a [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] since the [[Canadian Constitution]] was patriated in 1982. As a result, there have been major changes in the law's application to issues that bear on individual and minority group rights. Abortions were completely decriminalized after two R. v. Morgentaler cases ([[R. v. Morgentaler|in 1988]] and [[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)|in 1993]]).

Except for left-wing and far-left parties with strong social progressive beliefs like [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] or [[Socialism and Liberty Party]], Christian conservatives can be found in all political parties of Brazil, but nevertheless they are more common associated with parties like [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 2011)|Social Democratic Party]], [[Democratas]], [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|PSL]], [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)|Social Christian Party]], [[Brazilian Republican Party]], [[Patriota]] and in the [[Party of the Republic]].

This pattern largely remained until the mid-twentieth century when a new division emerged between the [[Christian left]] (represented by the [[Social Gospel]] philosophy and [[ecumenicism]]) and the Christian right (represented by [[fundamentalism]] and [[biblical literalism]]). The Christian left (along with the secular and anti-religious left) became supporters of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] while the right moved to the [[Social Credit Party (Canada)|Social Credit Party]], especially in Western Canada, and to a lesser extent the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]].\n\nThe Social Credit Party, founded in 1935 represented a major change in Canadian religious politics. Until that time, fundamentalists had shunned politics as \"[[worldly]]\", and a distraction from the proper practice of religion. However, the new party was founded by fundamentalist radio preacher and Bible school teacher [[William Aberhart]] or \"Bible Bill\". Aberhart mixed his own interpretation of scripture and prophecy with the [[monetary reform]] theories of [[social credit]] to create a movement that swept across Alberta, winning the provincial election of 1935 in a landslide. Aberhart and his disciple [[Ernest Manning]] then governed the province for the next forty years, several times trying to expand into the rest of Canada. In 1987 Manning's son, [[Preston Manning]], founded the new [[Reform Party of Canada]], which soon became the main party of the religious right. It won majorities of the seats in Western Canada in repeated elections, but was unable to break through in Eastern Canada, though it became the [[official opposition]] from 1997 to 2003 (Reform was renamed the [[Canadian Alliance]] in 2000). In 2003 the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged to create the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], led by [[Stephen Harper]], a member of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]], who went on to become [[prime minister of Canada|prime minister]] in 2006.\n\nCanada has had a [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] since the [[Canadian Constitution]] was patriated in 1982. As a result, there have been major changes in the law's application to issues that bear on individual and minority group rights. Abortions were completely decriminalized after two R. v.

Except for left-wing and far-left parties with strong social progressive beliefs like [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] or [[Socialism and Liberty Party]], Christian conservatives can be found in all political parties of Brazil, but nevertheless they are more common associated with parties like [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 2011)|Social Democratic Party]], [[Democratas]], [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|PSL]], [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)|Social Christian Party]], [[Brazilian Republican Party]], [[Patriota]] and in the [[Party of the Republic]].

In 2018, Jair Bolsonaro was elected president with massive support of conservative Catholics, Charismatics, Evangelicals and Pentecostals; Another candidate, [[Cabo Daciolo]], from [[Patriota]], attracted much attention from media and public in general, despite a lower votation. Both had a [[right-wing populist]], [[christian nationalism|Christian Nationalist]] program, but Bolsonaro was near to a [[national conservative]] and [[economic liberal]] one, contrasting with a [[Ultranationalist]], [[theocratic]] and [[protectionist]] style of Daciolo.\n\nIn [[Poland]], the Roman Catholic national-conseravtive party [[Law and Justice]] can be considered to be a party of the Christian right.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/05/family-faith-flag-catholic-religious-right-battle-polands-soul|title=Family, faith, flag: the religious right and the battle for Poland\u2019s soul|last=Coman|first=Julian|date=2019-10-05|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Hungary]], the ruling national-conservative party [[Fidesz]] can also be considered to be a party of the Christian right.

In early May 1854, four men\u2014Thomas W. and Oliver P. Barber, Samuel Walker, and Thomas M. Pearson\u2014made a tour of the new territory with the intention of finding a good place to settle. These men passed over what would become Lawrence, passing up on the spur of the hill of what is now Mt. Oread. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed while they were in the territory, and they were instrumental in convincing others to come.<ref name=cordley2and3>Cordley (1895), pp. 2{{en dash}}3.</ref> In his book ''A History of Lawrence'' (1895), Cordley wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The most systematic and extensive movement [to populate Kansas], however, was made [by] \"[[New England Emigrant Aid Company|The New England Emigrant Aid Company]]\" ... The men engaged in it, [[Eli Thayer]] [a Republican in the United States House of Representatives], [[Amos Adams Lawrence|Amos A. Lawrence]] [a [[GOP|Republican]] abolitionist and businessman], and others, began their work at once, arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to Kansas. As early as June, 1854, they sent Dr. [[Charles L. Robinson|Charles Robinson]], of [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]], and Mr. [[Charles Branscomb|Charles H. Branscomb]], of [[Holyoke]], to explore the territory and select a site for a colony ... [Previously] Robinson [had journeyed to Kansas, during which] his party climbed the hill along this spur, and looked off over what was afterwards the site of Lawrence. They marked the beauty of the spot and the magnificence of the view. Whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known; but when the time came to select a location for the first colony, Dr. Robinson remembered this view from the hilltop, and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision. When he was asked, therefore, to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies, it was not altogether an unknown land to him.<ref name=cordley3and4>Cordley (1895), pp. 3{{en dash}}4.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBranscomb was tasked with exploring the Kansas River up to about the location of [[Fort Riley]], whereas Robinson scouted land near [[Fort Leavenworth]] and the nearby [[Leavenworth, KS|city of the same name]]; after assessing the territory that they had surveyed, the two recommended that the New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) send its settlers to claim territory along the Oregon Trail near Hogback Ridge.<ref name=cordley4and5>Cordley (1895), pp. 4{{en dash}}5.</ref><ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\">Andreas (1883), pp. 312{{en dash}}14.</ref> The two likely chose this site because it was the \"first desirable location where emigrant Indians had ceded their land rights.\"<ref>Freedom's Frontier (n.d.), p. 21.</ref> The area was also attractive because it was close to not only on the Oregon Trail, but also the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] and the 1846 Military Trails.<ref>[[Federal Highway Administration]] (2002), p.

Ferril, a free-state Methodist preacher from Missouri; however, his assailants had surrounded his house, threatening violence and to destroy his property, had retreated upon seeing a body of armed free-staters without injury to either side. The next day, a free-state man's tent was torn down by a woman. Pro-slavery men rallied to prevent the tent's reconstruction, which was being performed by a group of about 20 armed free-staters, but it was completed without any violence. However, the next day, a considerable band of pro-slavery men had appeared threatening a repeat of the attack, but upon seeing their opponents ready, the pro-slavery men retreated with renewed threats of vengeance.<ref name=biennialreport />\n\nWhen the settlers first arrived, most had referred to their fledgling city simply as \"Wakarusa\" (after the nearby river of the same name), but other names were being considered, like \"New Boston\" (in recognition of both the NEEAC's city of operation and the hometown of many early settlers)<ref name=biennialreport /> and \"Plymouth\" (after [[Plymouth Rock]]).<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /><ref name=cordley10>Cordley (1895), p. 10.</ref> Meanwhile, settlers from Missouri derisively referred to it as \"[[Yankee]] Town\", due to its New England connections.<ref name=biennialreport /> Another name considered around this time was \"Lawrence\".<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /> Many approved of this name because it would honor [[Amos Adams Lawrence]], an [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]]-based businessman and noted abolitionist, who, Cordley writes, was \"a man of wide personal influence\" and \"one of the first men of means\" to fund the Emigrant Aid Company.<ref name=cordley10 /> Others hoped that by giving their town Lawrence's name, he would be inclined to support them with monetary donations, which supposition proved correct.<ref>Bisel (2012), p. 32.</ref> Another factor that made \"Lawrence\" a popular choice was that it was unbesmirched, having \"no bad odor attached to it in any part of the Union.\"<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /> Consequently, on October 1,<ref name=biennialreport /> the settlement's leaders voted to approve \"Lawrence\" as the name of their new city, and on October 17, the citizens drew territory lots so as to begin erecting homes and businesses.<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /><ref name=\"claims\" /> Around this time, the Lawrence settlers got into a heated argument with proslavery land-squatters, who were hoping to establish a city named \"Excelsior\" on the land where Lawrence was being constructed.

The rest of the city was unaware of the rescue at this time. It was decided that the men who broke Branson out of jail would need to keep out of the way.

Lawrence was additionally aided by John Brown and his four sons: John Jr., Oliver, Owen, and Watson. Five forts of earthwork or rifle pits were constructed, and a solid defense was prepared. While both sides were ready for a fight, an outright clash between the two militias was prevented at least in part by the harsh Kansas winter. On December 8, Shannon had had enough and ordered representatives from both sides to meet at the proslavery stronghold of Franklin to sign a peace treaty.

During the [[American Civil War]] it was also the site of the [[Lawrence massacre]] (1863).\n\nLawrence began as a center of [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|free-state]] politics. Its economy diversified into many industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and education, beginning with the founding of the University of Kansas in 1865 and Haskell Indian Nations University in 1884.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Kansas}}\n\n===Settlement and early years===\nPrior to [[Kansas Territory]] being established in May 1854, most of [[Douglas County, Kansas|Douglas County]] was part of the [[Shawnee]] [[Shawnee Methodist Mission|Indian Reservation]], which had been created in 1830.<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Settlers\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.shawnee-tribe.com/History.html |website=[[Shawnee Tribe|The Shawnee Tribe]] |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}</ref> During this period, the [[Oregon Trail]] ran parallel to the [[Kansas River]], roughly through the area where Lawrence would eventually be situated.

In early May 1854, four men\u2014Thomas W. and Oliver P. Barber, Samuel Walker, and Thomas M. Pearson\u2014made a tour of the new territory with the intention of finding a good place to settle. These men passed over what would become Lawrence, passing up on the spur of the hill of what is now Mt. Oread. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed while they were in the territory, and they were instrumental in convincing others to come.<ref name=cordley2and3>Cordley (1895), pp. 2{{en dash}}3.</ref> In his book ''A History of Lawrence'' (1895), Cordley wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The most systematic and extensive movement [to populate Kansas], however, was made [by] \"[[New England Emigrant Aid Company|The New England Emigrant Aid Company]]\" ... The men engaged in it, [[Eli Thayer]] [a Republican in the United States House of Representatives], [[Amos Adams Lawrence|Amos A. Lawrence]] [a [[GOP|Republican]] abolitionist and businessman], and others, began their work at once, arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to Kansas. As early as June, 1854, they sent Dr. [[Charles L. Robinson|Charles Robinson]], of [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]], and Mr. [[Charles Branscomb|Charles H. Branscomb]], of [[Holyoke]], to explore the territory and select a site for a colony ... [Previously] Robinson [had journeyed to Kansas, during which] his party climbed the hill along this spur, and looked off over what was afterwards the site of Lawrence. They marked the beauty of the spot and the magnificence of the view. Whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known; but when the time came to select a location for the first colony, Dr. Robinson remembered this view from the hilltop, and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision. When he was asked, therefore, to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies, it was not altogether an unknown land to him.<ref name=cordley3and4>Cordley (1895), pp. 3{{en dash}}4.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBranscomb was tasked with exploring the Kansas River up to about the location of [[Fort Riley]], whereas Robinson scouted land near [[Fort Leavenworth]] and the nearby [[Leavenworth, KS|city of the same name]]; after assessing the territory that they had surveyed, the two recommended that the New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) send its settlers to claim territory along the Oregon Trail near Hogback Ridge.<ref name=cordley4and5>Cordley (1895), pp. 4{{en dash}}5.</ref><ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\">Andreas (1883), pp. 312{{en dash}}14.</ref> The two likely chose this site because it was the \"first desirable location where emigrant Indians had ceded their land rights.\"<ref>Freedom's Frontier (n.d.), p. 21.</ref> The area was also attractive because it was close to not only on the Oregon Trail, but also the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] and the 1846 Military Trails.<ref>[[Federal Highway Administration]] (2002), p.

Unfortunately, a [[cholera]] outbreak in the [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]] prevented this from happening.<ref>Andreas (1883), p. 312.</ref> In the end, a small group of only twenty-nine men{{em dash}}a group that Eli Thayer would later call the \"pioneer colony\"{{em dash}}volunteered for the job.<ref name=cordley4and5 /> Led by Branscomb, these pioneers left [[Boston]], Massachusetts and set out for Kansas Territory on July 17, 1854; according to Thayer's antislavery newspaper the ''Kansas Crusader for Freedom'': \"Immense crowds had gathered [in Boston] at the station to give them a parting God-speed.

Thomas J. Ferril, a free-state Methodist preacher from Missouri; however, his assailants had surrounded his house, threatening violence and to destroy his property, had retreated upon seeing a body of armed free-staters without injury to either side. The next day, a free-state man's tent was torn down by a woman. Pro-slavery men rallied to prevent the tent's reconstruction, which was being performed by a group of about 20 armed free-staters, but it was completed without any violence. However, the next day, a considerable band of pro-slavery men had appeared threatening a repeat of the attack, but upon seeing their opponents ready, the pro-slavery men retreated with renewed threats of vengeance.<ref name=biennialreport />\n\nWhen the settlers first arrived, most had referred to their fledgling city simply as \"Wakarusa\" (after the nearby river of the same name), but other names were being considered, like \"New Boston\" (in recognition of both the NEEAC's city of operation and the hometown of many early settlers)<ref name=biennialreport /> and \"Plymouth\" (after [[Plymouth Rock]]).<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /><ref name=cordley10>Cordley (1895), p. 10.</ref> Meanwhile, settlers from Missouri derisively referred to it as \"[[Yankee]] Town\", due to its New England connections.<ref name=biennialreport /> Another name considered around this time was \"Lawrence\".<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /> Many approved of this name because it would honor [[Amos Adams Lawrence]], an [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]]-based businessman and noted abolitionist, who, Cordley writes, was \"a man of wide personal influence\" and \"one of the first men of means\" to fund the Emigrant Aid Company.<ref name=cordley10 /> Others hoped that by giving their town Lawrence's name, he would be inclined to support them with monetary donations, which supposition proved correct.<ref>Bisel (2012), p. 32.</ref> Another factor that made \"Lawrence\" a popular choice was that it was unbesmirched, having \"no bad odor attached to it in any part of the Union.\"<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /> Consequently, on October 1,<ref name=biennialreport /> the settlement's leaders voted to approve \"Lawrence\" as the name of their new city, and on October 17, the citizens drew territory lots so as to begin erecting homes and businesses.<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /><ref name=\"claims\" /> Around this time, the Lawrence settlers got into a heated argument with proslavery land-squatters, who were hoping to establish a city named \"Excelsior\" on the land where Lawrence was being constructed.

The rest of the city was unaware of the rescue at this time. It was decided that the men who broke Branson out of jail would need to keep out of the way.

Lawrence was additionally aided by John Brown and his four sons: John Jr., Oliver, Owen, and Watson. Five forts of earthwork or rifle pits were constructed, and a solid defense was prepared. While both sides were ready for a fight, an outright clash between the two militias was prevented at least in part by the harsh Kansas winter. On December 8, Shannon had had enough and ordered representatives from both sides to meet at the proslavery stronghold of Franklin to sign a peace treaty.
