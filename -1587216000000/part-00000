In more modern times, pharmacists advise patients and health care providers on the selection, dosages, interactions, and side effects of medications, and act as a [[learned intermediary]] between a prescriber and a patient. Pharmacists monitor the health and progress of patients to ensure the safe and effective use of medication. Pharmacists may practice [[compounding]]; however, many medicines are now produced by pharmaceutical companies in a standard dosage and drug delivery form.

In this highly stable hierarchy, the pharmacists \u2014 and even [[pharmacy technician|pharmacist assistants]] \u2014 were assigned status superior to all others in health-related fields such as physicians and acupuncturists. In the Imperial household, the pharmacist was even ranked above the two personal physicians of the Emperor.<ref>{{cite book | translator-last = Titsingh | translator-first = Isaac | translator-link = Isaac Titsingh | editor-first = Julius | editor-last = von Klaproth | year = 1834 | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_18oNAAAAIAAJ | quote = nipon o dai itsi ran. | title = Nipon o da\u00ef itsi ran, ou Annales des empereurs du Japon | trans-title = [[Nipon o da\u00ef itsi ran|Annals of the Emperors of Japan]] | language = French | publisher = Parbury, Allen and Co. | location = London | page = [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_18oNAAAAIAAJ/page/n486 434]}}</ref>\n\n====Contemporary====\nAs of 1997, 46 universities of pharmacy in Japan graduated about 8000 students annually.<ref>{{citation | last = Kawahara | first = A. | url = http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js2214e/4.4.html | chapter = Theme 1.

The degree awarded by most pharmacy schools is a  Bachelor of Pharmacy Degree (B.Pharm.) However, in the near future,{{when|date=February 2014}} all schools will offer a 6-year first Degree course leading to the award of a Pharm.D (Doctor of Pharmacy Degree). The [[University of Benin (Nigeria)|University of Benin]] has started the Pharm.D programme with other pharmacy schools planning to start soon. The Pharmacy Degree in Nigeria is unclassified i.e. awarded without first class, second class upper, etc., however graduates could be awarded Pass with Distinctions in specific fields such as Pharmaceutics, Pharmacology, medicinal chemistry etc. Pharmacy Graduates are required to undergo 1 year of Tutelage under the supervision of an already Registered Pharmacist(a preceptor) in a recognized and designated Institution before they can become Registered Pharmacists. The Profession is Regulated by a Government Statutory body called the [[Pharmacists Council of Nigeria]]. The West African Post Graduate College of Pharmacy runs post-registration courses on advanced-level practice in various fields of pharmacy. It is a college jointly  funded by a number of Countries in the West Africa sub-region. There are thousands of Nigerian-trained pharmacists registered and practicing in countries such as the US, the UK, Canada etc., due to the relatively poor public sector salaries in Nigeria.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Pakistan===\nIn [[Pakistan]], the Pharm.D. (Doctor of Pharmacy) degree is a graduate-level professional doctorate degree. Twenty-one universities are registered with the [[Pharmacy Council of Pakistan]] for imparting Pharmacy courses. In 2004 the [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|Higher Education Commission]] of Pakistan and the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan revised the syllabus and changed the 4-year B.Pharmacy (Bachelor of Pharmacy) Program to a 5-year Pharm.D. (Doctor of Pharmacy) program. All 21 universities have started the 5-year Pharm.D Program. In 2011 the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan approved the awarding of a Doctor of Pharmacy degree, a five-year programme at the Department of Pharmacy, [[University of Peshawar]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Poland ===\nPolish pharmacists have to complete a {{frac|5|1|2}}-year Master of Pharmacy Programme at medical university and obtain the right to practice as a pharmacist in Poland from District Pharmaceutical Council. The Programme includes 6 months of pharmacy training. The Polish name for the Master of Pharmacy Degree (M. Pharm.) is ''magister farmacji'' (mgr farm). Not only pharmacists, but also pharmaceutical technicians are allowed to dispense prescription medicines, except for narcotics, psychotropics and very potent medicines. Pharmacists approve prescriptions fulfilled by pharmaceutical technicians subsequently. Pharmaceutical technicians have to complete 2 years of post-secondary occupational school and 2 years of pharmacy training afterwards. Pharmacists are eligible to prescribe medicines in exceptional circumstances. All Polish pharmacies are obliged to produce compound medicines. Most pharmacists in Poland are pharmacy managers and are responsible for pharmacy marketing in addition to traditional activities. To become a pharmacy manager in Poland, a pharmacist is expected to have at least 5 years of professional experience. All pharmacists in Poland have to maintain an adequate knowledge level by participating in various university- and industry-based courses and arrangements or by undergoing postgraduate specialization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nia.org.pl/page/40/about-us.html |title=About Us |website = Polish Pharmaceutical Chamber | publisher = Naczelna Izba Aptekarska [Polish Pharmaceutical Chamber] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208072100/http://www.nia.org.pl/page/40/about-us.html |archivedate=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\nIn [[Sweden]], the national board of health and welfare regulates the practice of all legislated health care professionals, and is also responsible for registration of pharmacists in the country. The education to become a licensed pharmacist is regulated by the [[European Union]], and states that minimum educational requirements are five years of university studies in a pharmacy program, of which six months must be a pharmacy internship. To be admitted to pharmacy studies, students must complete a minimum of three years of gymnasium, similar to high school (school for about 15\u201320-year-old students) program in natural science after elementary school (6\u201316-year-olds). Only three universities in the whole of Sweden offer a pharmacy education, [[Uppsala University]], where the Faculty of Pharmacy is located, the [[University of Gothenburg]], and [[Ume\u00e5 University]]. In Sweden, pharmacists are called ''Apotekare''. At pharmacies in Sweden, pharmacists work together with another class of legislated health care professionals called ''Receptarier'', in English so-called ''prescriptionists'', who have completed studies equal to a bachelor of science in pharmacy, i.e., three years of university. Prescriptionists also have dispensing rights in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. The majority of the staff in a pharmacy are ''Apotekstekniker'' or \"pharmacy technicians\" with a three -semester education at a vocational college.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Pharmacy technicians do not have dispensing rights in Sweden but are allowed to advise on and sell over-the-counter medicines.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn Switzerland, the federal office of public health regulates pharmacy practice. Four Swiss universities offer a major in pharmaceutical studies, the [[University of Basel]], the [[University of Geneva]], the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[ETH Zurich]]. To major in pharmaceutical studies takes at least five years. Students spend their last year as interns in a pharmacy combined with courses at the university, with focus on the validation of prescriptions and the manufacturing of pharmaceutical formulations. Since all public health professions are regulated by the government it is also necessary to acquire a federal diploma in order to work in a pharmacy. It is not unusual for pharmaceutical studies majors to work in other fields such as the pharmaceutical industry or in hospitals. Pharmacists work alongside ''pharma assistants'', an apprenticeship that takes three years to complete. Pharmacists can further specialise in various fields; this is organized by [[PharmaSuisse]], the pharmacists' association of Switzerland.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Tanzania===\nIn [[Tanzania]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the national Pharmacy Board, which is also responsible for registration of pharmacists in the country. By international standards, the density of pharmacists is very low, with a mean of 0.18 per 10,000 population. The majority of pharmacists are found in urban areas, with some underserved regions having only 2 pharmacists per region. According to 2007\u20132009 data, the largest group of pharmacists was employed in the public sector (44%). Those working in private retail pharmacies were 23%, and the rest were mostly working for private wholesalers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, in academia/teaching, or with faith-based or non-governmental facilities. The salaries of pharmacists varied significantly depending on the place of work. Those who worked in the academia were the highest paid followed by those who worked in the multilateral non-governmental organizations. The public sector including public retail pharmacies and faith based organizations paid much less. The [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health]] salary scale for medical doctors was considerably higher than that of pharmacists despite having a difference of only one year of training.<ref>{{citation | publisher = Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare | title = Assessment of the Pharmaceutical Human Resources in Tanzania and Strategic Framework | location = Dar es Salaam | year = 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Trinidad and Tobago===\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the Pharmacy Board of Trinidad and Tobago, which is responsible for the registration of pharmacists in the twin islands.  The [[University of the West Indies]] in St. Augustine offers a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy as the sole practicing degree of pharmacy.  Graduates undertake a 6-month internship, known as pre-registration, under the supervision of a registered pharmacist, at a pharmacy of their choosing, whether community or institutional.  After completion of the required pre-registration period, the graduate can then apply to the Pharmacy Board to become a registered pharmacist.  After working 1 calendar year as a registered pharmacist, the individual can become a registered, responsible pharmacist.  Being a registered, responsible pharmacist allows the individual to license a pharmacy and be a pharmacist-in-charge.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Consultant pharmacist}}\nIn [[British English]] (and to some extent [[Australian English]]), the professional title known as \"pharmacist\" is also known as '''\"dispensing chemist\"''' or, more commonly, '''\"chemist\"'''. A dispensing chemist usually operates from a pharmacy or chemist's shop, and is allowed to fulfil [[medical prescription]]s and sell [[over-the-counter drug]]s and other health-related goods. Pharmacists can undertake additional training to allow them to prescribe medicines for specific conditions.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = National Health Service|url = https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/pharmacy/roles-pharmacy/pharmacist| website = Health Careers|title = Pharmacist|accessdate = 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Practices====\nIn the United Kingdom, most pharmacists working in the [[National Health Service]] practice in [[hospital pharmacy]] or [[community pharmacy]]. The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] in 1979 reported that there were nearly 3,000 pharmacists employed in the hospital and community health service in the UK at that time.  They were enthusiastic about the idea that pharmacists might develop their role of giving advice to the public.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS | chapter = Chapter 8: Pharmaceutical, Ophthalmic and Chiropody Services |date=July 1979 |publisher=HMSO |isbn=978-0101761505 | chapter-url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-8/ |accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new professional role for pharmacist as prescriber has been recognized in the UK since May 2006, called the \"Pharmacist Independent Prescriber\". Once qualified, a pharmacist independent prescriber can prescribe any licensed medicine for any medical condition within their competence. This includes controlled drugs except schedule 1 and prescribing certain drugs for the treatment of addiction ([[cocaine]], [[Heroin|diamorphine]] and [[dipipanone]]).<ref>{{cite web | work = Department of Health | title = Pharmacist independent prescribing FAQ | date = 22 March 2010 | publisher = Department of Health and Social Care | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | url-status = dead | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | archive-date = 7 January 2013 | access-date = 14 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Education and registration====\nPharmacists, [[pharmacy technician]]s and pharmacy premises in the [[United Kingdom]] are regulated by the [[General Pharmaceutical Council|General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC)]] for [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] and by the [[Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland]] for [[Northern Ireland]].

Pharmacists holding degrees in Pharmacy from overseas institutions are able to fulfill this stage by undertaking the Overseas Pharmacist Assessment Programme (OSPAP), which is a one-year [[postgraduate diploma]]. On completion of the OSPAP, the candidate would proceed with the other stages of the registration process in the same manner as a UK student.\n*Completion of a 52-week preregistration training period. This is a period of paid or unpaid employment, in an approved hospital or community pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist tutor. During this time the student must collect evidence of having met certain competency standards set by the GPhC.\n*A pass mark in the GPhC registration assessment (formally an exam). This includes a closed-book paper and an open-book/mental calculations paper (using the [[British National Formulary]] and the GPhC's \"Standards of Conduct, Ethics and Performance\" document as reference sources). The student must achieve an overall mark of 70%, which must include at least 70% in the calculations section of the open-book paper. From June 2016, the assessment will involve two papers, as before but the use of a calculator will now be allowed. However, reference sources will no longer be allowed in the assessment.

The ACPE board of directors are appointed by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) (three appointments each), and the American Council on Education (one appointment). To obtain licensure in the United States, applicants for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) must graduate from an ACPE accredited school of pharmacy. ACPE publishes standards that schools of pharmacy must comply with to gain accreditation.<ref>{{citation | title = Accreditation standards and key elements for the Professional Program in Pharmacy Leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (\"Standards 2016\"} | publisher = Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education | date = 2015 | url = https://www.acpe-accredit.org/pdf/Standards2016FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nA [[Pharmacy school]] pursuing accreditation must first apply and be granted Pre-candidate status.<ref name=\"acpepolicies\"/> These schools have met all the requirements for accreditation, but have not yet enrolled any students. This status indicates that the school of pharmacy has developed its program in accordance with the ACPE standards and guidelines. Once a school has enrolled students, but has not yet had a graduating class, they may be granted Candidate status. The expectations of a Candidate program are that they continue to mature in accordance with stated plans. The graduates of a Candidate program are the same as those of fully accredited programs. Full accreditation is granted to a program once they have demonstrated they comply with the standards set forth by ACPE.\n\nThe customary review cycle for established accredited programs is six years, whereas for programs achieving their initial accreditation this cycle is two years. These are comprehensive on-site evaluations of the programs. Additional evaluations may be conducted at the discretion of ACPE in the interim between comprehensive evaluations.\n\n====Education====\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nAcceptance into a doctorate of pharmacy program depends upon completing specific prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor's degree. [[Pharmacy school]] is four years of graduate school (accelerated Pharmacy Schools go January to January and are only 3 years), which include at least one year of practical experience. Graduates receive a Doctorate of Pharmacy ([[PharmD]]) upon graduation. Most schools require students to take a Pharmacy College Admissions Test [[PCAT]] and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the [[PharmD]] program. Due to the large admittance requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, most pharmacy students complete a bachelor's degree before entry to pharmacy school.\n\nPossible prerequisites:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Anatomy]]\n*[[Physiology]]\n*[[Biochemistry]]\n*[[Biology]]\n*[[Immunology]]\n*[[Chemical engineering]]\n*[[Economics]]\n*[[Pathophysiology]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Physics]]\n*[[Humanities]]\n*[[Microbiology]]\n*[[Molecular biology]]\n*[[Organic chemistry]]\n*[[Physical chemistry]]\n*[[Statistics]]\n*[[Calculus]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nBesides taking classes, additional requirements before graduating may include a certain number of hours for community service, e.g., working in hospitals, clinics, and retail.\n\nEstimated timeline: 4 years undergraduate + 4 years doctorate + 1\u20132 years residency + 1\u20133 years fellowship = 8\u201313 years\n\nA doctorate of pharmacy (except non-traditional, i.e. transferring a license from another country) is the only degree accepted by the National Associate of Boards of Pharmacy [[NABP]] to be eligible to \"sit\" for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination ([[NAPLEX]]). Previously the United States had a 5-year bachelor's degree in pharmacy. For BS Pharmacy graduates currently licensed in US, there are 10 Universities offering non-traditional doctorate degree programs via part-time, weekend or on-line programs. These are programs fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education ([[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education|ACPE]]) but only available to current BS Pharmacy graduates with a license to practice pharmacy. Some institutions still offer 6 year accelerated [[PharmD]] programs.\n\nThe current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior BS in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation, a full year of hands-on practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Legal requirements in the US to becoming a pharmacist include: graduating from an accredited [[PharmD]] program, conducting a specified number of internship hours under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the [[NAPLEX]], and passing a Multi-state Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam [[MPJE]].  Arkansas, California, and Virginia have their own exams instead of the MPJE;  in those states, pharmacists must pass the Arkansas Jurisprudence Exam, the California Jurisprudence Exam, or the Virginia Pharmacy Law Exam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/arkansas-pharmacist-license/ | title = Arkansas Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/california-pharmacist-license/ | title = California Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/virginia-pharmacist-license/ | title = Virginia Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nResidency is an option for post-graduates that is typically 1\u20132 years in length. A residency gives licensed pharmacists decades of clinical experience in an extremely condensed timeframe of only a few short years. In order for new graduates to remain competitive, employers generally favor residency trained applicants for clinical positions. The profession is moving toward resident-trained pharmacists who wish to provide direct patient care clinical services. In 1990, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy ([[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy|AACP]]) required the new professional degree. Graduates from a [[PharmD]] program may also elect to do a fellowship that is geared toward research. Fellowships can varying in length but last 1\u20133 years depending on the program and usually require 1 year of residency at minimum.\n\n====Specialization and credentialing====\n[[File:A U.S. Soldier with the Special Warfare Medical Group(Airborne), speaks to Dr 110228-A-GV060-946.jpg|thumb|270px|Clinical pharmacists go on rounds with doctors in order to provide direct patient care and comprehensive medication management.]]\nAmerican pharmacists can become certified in recognized specialty practice areas by passing an examination administered by one of several credentialing boards.\n\n*The [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] certifies pharmacists in thirteen specialties:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bpsweb.org/bps-specialties/ | title = BPS Specialties | work = BPS: Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties | publisher = American Pharmacists Association | date = | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n**[[Ambulatory care]] pharmacy\n**[[Cardiology]] pharmacy\n**Compounded sterile preparations pharmacy\n**[[Critical care medicine|Critical care]] pharmacy\n**[[Geriatrics|Geriatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Infectious disease]]s pharmacy\n**[[Nuclear pharmacy]]\n**[[Nutrition]] support pharmacy\n**[[Oncology]] pharmacy\n**[[Pediatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Pharmacotherapy]]\n**[[Psychiatric pharmacy]]\n**[[Organ transplantation|Solid organ transplant]] pharmacy<ref name=\"SOT Specialty\">{{cite web |title=Solid Organ Transplantation Pharmacy Recognized as New Specialty |url=https://www.bpsweb.org/2018/08/22/solid-organ-transplantation-pharmacy-recognized-as-new-specialty/ |website=Board of Pharmacy Specialties |accessdate=3 January 2019 |date=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n*The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in [[geriatrics]] specialty practice.\n*The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.clintox.org/Abat/ | title = American Board of Applied Toxicology (ABAT) | work = AACT | publisher = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Expanding Scope of Practice ====\n=====Vaccinations=====\nAs of 2016, all 50 states and the District of Columbia permit pharmacists to provide vaccination services, but specific protocols vary between states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawatlas.org/datasets/pharmacist-vaccination|title=Pharmacist Vaccination Laws  | first1 = Cason | last1 = Schmit | first2 = Allison | last2 = Reddick |date= 1 January 2016|website=The Policy Surveillance Program: A LawAtlas Project | publisher = Temple University Beasley School of Law |url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.immunize.org/pharmacists/|title=Pharmacists and Immunization: Vaccination Resources for Pharmacists| work = www.immunize.org: Website for Healthcare Professionals | publisher = Immunization Action Coalition |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/supplementals/2017/immunizationsupplementjune2017/authority-and-scope-of-vaccination-how-states-differ |title=Authority and Scope of Vaccination: How States Differ | first1 = Sharon | last1 = Xavioer | first2 = Jeff | last2 = Goad | date = 22 June 2017 | work = Pharmacy Times | publisher = Pharmacy & Healthcare Communications, LLC | access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====California=====\nAll licensed California pharmacists can perform the following:\n*Order and interpret drug therapy related tests\n*Furnish smoking cessation aids (such as nicotine replacement therapy)\n*Furnish oral self-administered contraception (birth control pills)\n*Furnish travel medications recommended by the CDC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpha.com/advocacy/provider-status/expanding-pharmacist-services/|title=Expanding Pharmacist Services|publisher=California Pharmacists Association|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n*Administer vaccinations pursuant to the latest CDC standards for anyone ages 3+<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4052.8&lawCode=BPC|title= Business and Professions Code - BPC: DIVISION 2.

About 5\u20137% of students can pass the exam. There are 3 aspects to the exam. These are on math, chemistry, and physics or biology. After being trained at the university for 5 years, successful students receive a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Or they are university pharmacists (university pharmacist to discriminate between college pharmacist or vocational pharmacist in some countries of the world these trainee pharmacists are called pharmacist assistants). An alternative method of obtaining a bachelor's degree is as follows. School pupils study at a college of pharmacy or a vocational school of pharmacy. After attending the school or college they go to work in a pharmacy, and with two years of practice they could take an exam to enter university of pharmacy or the pharmacy department of a university of medicine and pharmacy. This exam is easier than the national one. Passing the exam they continue studying to gain 3-year bachelor's degrees or 4-year bachelor's degrees. This degree is considered equivalent to a 5-year bachelor's degree.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Notable pharmacists==\n{{main|List of pharmacists}}\n* [[Charles Alderton]] (1857-1941), [[United States|American]] inventor of the soft drink [[Dr Pepper]]\n* [[Caleb Bradham]] (1867-1934), American inventor of the soft drink [[Pepsi]]\n* [[Ikililou Dhoinine]] (born 1962), [[Comoros|Comorian]] politician\n* [[Pravin Gordhan]] (born 1949), [[Minister (government)|minister]] in [[South Africa]]n government\n* [[Luke Howard]] (1772\u20131864), \"the father of [[meteorology]]\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Thornes | first = John.

In more modern times, pharmacists advise patients and health care providers on the selection, dosages, interactions, and side effects of medications, and act as a [[learned intermediary]] between a prescriber and a patient. Pharmacists monitor the health and progress of patients to ensure the safe and effective use of medication. Pharmacists may practice [[compounding]]; however, many medicines are now produced by pharmaceutical companies in a standard dosage and drug delivery form. In some jurisdictions, pharmacists have [[Medical prescription|prescriptive authority]] to either independently prescribe under their own authority or in collaboration with a [[primary care physician]] through an agreed upon protocol called a [[collaborative practice agreement]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain | title = Pharmacist prescribing | year = 2006 | url = http://www.rpsgb.org/worldofpharmacy/currentdevelopmentsinpharmacy/pharmacistprescribing/ | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006001306/http://www.rpsgb.org/worldofpharmacy/currentdevelopmentsinpharmacy/pharmacistprescribing/ | archive-date = 6 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nIncreased numbers of [[pharmacotherapy|drug therapies]], aging but more knowledgeable and demanding populations, and deficiencies in other areas of the health care system seem to be driving increased demand for the clinical counseling skills of the pharmacist.<ref name=\"HRDC\"/> One of the most important roles that pharmacists are currently taking on is one of pharmaceutical care.<ref>{{cite book | title = Pharmaceutical Care Practice: The Clinician's Guide | edition = Second | first1 = Robert J. | last1 = Cipolle | first2 = Linda M. | last2 = Strand | first3 = Peter C. | last3 = Morley | location = Toronto | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780071362597}}</ref> Pharmaceutical care involves taking direct responsibility for patients and their disease states, medications, and management of each to improve outcomes.

The degree awarded by most pharmacy schools is a  Bachelor of Pharmacy Degree (B.Pharm.) However, in the near future,{{when|date=February 2014}} all schools will offer a 6-year first Degree course leading to the award of a Pharm.D (Doctor of Pharmacy Degree). The [[University of Benin (Nigeria)|University of Benin]] has started the Pharm.D programme with other pharmacy schools planning to start soon. The Pharmacy Degree in Nigeria is unclassified i.e. awarded without first class, second class upper, etc., however graduates could be awarded Pass with Distinctions in specific fields such as Pharmaceutics, Pharmacology, medicinal chemistry etc. Pharmacy Graduates are required to undergo 1 year of Tutelage under the supervision of an already Registered Pharmacist(a preceptor) in a recognized and designated Institution before they can become Registered Pharmacists. The Profession is Regulated by a Government Statutory body called the [[Pharmacists Council of Nigeria]]. The West African Post Graduate College of Pharmacy runs post-registration courses on advanced-level practice in various fields of pharmacy. It is a college jointly  funded by a number of Countries in the West Africa sub-region. There are thousands of Nigerian-trained pharmacists registered and practicing in countries such as the US, the UK, Canada etc., due to the relatively poor public sector salaries in Nigeria.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Pakistan===\nIn [[Pakistan]], the Pharm.D. (Doctor of Pharmacy) degree is a graduate-level professional doctorate degree. Twenty-one universities are registered with the [[Pharmacy Council of Pakistan]] for imparting Pharmacy courses. In 2004 the [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|Higher Education Commission]] of Pakistan and the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan revised the syllabus and changed the 4-year B.Pharmacy (Bachelor of Pharmacy) Program to a 5-year Pharm.D. (Doctor of Pharmacy) program. All 21 universities have started the 5-year Pharm.D Program. In 2011 the Pharmacy Council of Pakistan approved the awarding of a Doctor of Pharmacy degree, a five-year programme at the Department of Pharmacy, [[University of Peshawar]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Poland ===\nPolish pharmacists have to complete a {{frac|5|1|2}}-year Master of Pharmacy Programme at medical university and obtain the right to practice as a pharmacist in Poland from District Pharmaceutical Council. The Programme includes 6 months of pharmacy training. The Polish name for the Master of Pharmacy Degree (M. Pharm.) is ''magister farmacji'' (mgr farm). Not only pharmacists, but also pharmaceutical technicians are allowed to dispense prescription medicines, except for narcotics, psychotropics and very potent medicines. Pharmacists approve prescriptions fulfilled by pharmaceutical technicians subsequently. Pharmaceutical technicians have to complete 2 years of post-secondary occupational school and 2 years of pharmacy training afterwards. Pharmacists are eligible to prescribe medicines in exceptional circumstances. All Polish pharmacies are obliged to produce compound medicines. Most pharmacists in Poland are pharmacy managers and are responsible for pharmacy marketing in addition to traditional activities. To become a pharmacy manager in Poland, a pharmacist is expected to have at least 5 years of professional experience. All pharmacists in Poland have to maintain an adequate knowledge level by participating in various university- and industry-based courses and arrangements or by undergoing postgraduate specialization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nia.org.pl/page/40/about-us.html |title=About Us |website = Polish Pharmaceutical Chamber | publisher = Naczelna Izba Aptekarska [Polish Pharmaceutical Chamber] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208072100/http://www.nia.org.pl/page/40/about-us.html |archivedate=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Sweden===\nIn [[Sweden]], the national board of health and welfare regulates the practice of all legislated health care professionals, and is also responsible for registration of pharmacists in the country. The education to become a licensed pharmacist is regulated by the [[European Union]], and states that minimum educational requirements are five years of university studies in a pharmacy program, of which six months must be a pharmacy internship. To be admitted to pharmacy studies, students must complete a minimum of three years of gymnasium, similar to high school (school for about 15\u201320-year-old students) program in natural science after elementary school (6\u201316-year-olds). Only three universities in the whole of Sweden offer a pharmacy education, [[Uppsala University]], where the Faculty of Pharmacy is located, the [[University of Gothenburg]], and [[Ume\u00e5 University]]. In Sweden, pharmacists are called ''Apotekare''. At pharmacies in Sweden, pharmacists work together with another class of legislated health care professionals called ''Receptarier'', in English so-called ''prescriptionists'', who have completed studies equal to a bachelor of science in pharmacy, i.e., three years of university. Prescriptionists also have dispensing rights in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland. The majority of the staff in a pharmacy are ''Apotekstekniker'' or \"pharmacy technicians\" with a three -semester education at a vocational college.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Pharmacy technicians do not have dispensing rights in Sweden but are allowed to advise on and sell over-the-counter medicines.\n\n===Switzerland===\nIn Switzerland, the federal office of public health regulates pharmacy practice. Four Swiss universities offer a major in pharmaceutical studies, the [[University of Basel]], the [[University of Geneva]], the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[ETH Zurich]]. To major in pharmaceutical studies takes at least five years. Students spend their last year as interns in a pharmacy combined with courses at the university, with focus on the validation of prescriptions and the manufacturing of pharmaceutical formulations. Since all public health professions are regulated by the government it is also necessary to acquire a federal diploma in order to work in a pharmacy. It is not unusual for pharmaceutical studies majors to work in other fields such as the pharmaceutical industry or in hospitals. Pharmacists work alongside ''pharma assistants'', an apprenticeship that takes three years to complete. Pharmacists can further specialise in various fields; this is organized by [[PharmaSuisse]], the pharmacists' association of Switzerland.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Tanzania===\nIn [[Tanzania]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the national Pharmacy Board, which is also responsible for registration of pharmacists in the country. By international standards, the density of pharmacists is very low, with a mean of 0.18 per 10,000 population. The majority of pharmacists are found in urban areas, with some underserved regions having only 2 pharmacists per region. According to 2007\u20132009 data, the largest group of pharmacists was employed in the public sector (44%). Those working in private retail pharmacies were 23%, and the rest were mostly working for private wholesalers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, in academia/teaching, or with faith-based or non-governmental facilities. The salaries of pharmacists varied significantly depending on the place of work. Those who worked in the academia were the highest paid followed by those who worked in the multilateral non-governmental organizations. The public sector including public retail pharmacies and faith based organizations paid much less. The [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health]] salary scale for medical doctors was considerably higher than that of pharmacists despite having a difference of only one year of training.<ref>{{citation | publisher = Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare | title = Assessment of the Pharmaceutical Human Resources in Tanzania and Strategic Framework | location = Dar es Salaam | year = 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Trinidad and Tobago===\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], pharmacy practice is regulated by the Pharmacy Board of Trinidad and Tobago, which is responsible for the registration of pharmacists in the twin islands.  The [[University of the West Indies]] in St. Augustine offers a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy as the sole practicing degree of pharmacy.  Graduates undertake a 6-month internship, known as pre-registration, under the supervision of a registered pharmacist, at a pharmacy of their choosing, whether community or institutional.  After completion of the required pre-registration period, the graduate can then apply to the Pharmacy Board to become a registered pharmacist.  After working 1 calendar year as a registered pharmacist, the individual can become a registered, responsible pharmacist.  Being a registered, responsible pharmacist allows the individual to license a pharmacy and be a pharmacist-in-charge.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Consultant pharmacist}}\nIn [[British English]] (and to some extent [[Australian English]]), the professional title known as \"pharmacist\" is also known as '''\"dispensing chemist\"''' or, more commonly, '''\"chemist\"'''. A dispensing chemist usually operates from a pharmacy or chemist's shop, and is allowed to fulfil [[medical prescription]]s and sell [[over-the-counter drug]]s and other health-related goods. Pharmacists can undertake additional training to allow them to prescribe medicines for specific conditions.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = National Health Service|url = https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/pharmacy/roles-pharmacy/pharmacist| website = Health Careers|title = Pharmacist|accessdate = 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Practices====\nIn the United Kingdom, most pharmacists working in the [[National Health Service]] practice in [[hospital pharmacy]] or [[community pharmacy]]. The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] in 1979 reported that there were nearly 3,000 pharmacists employed in the hospital and community health service in the UK at that time.  They were enthusiastic about the idea that pharmacists might develop their role of giving advice to the public.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS | chapter = Chapter 8: Pharmaceutical, Ophthalmic and Chiropody Services |date=July 1979 |publisher=HMSO |isbn=978-0101761505 | chapter-url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-8/ |accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new professional role for pharmacist as prescriber has been recognized in the UK since May 2006, called the \"Pharmacist Independent Prescriber\". Once qualified, a pharmacist independent prescriber can prescribe any licensed medicine for any medical condition within their competence. This includes controlled drugs except schedule 1 and prescribing certain drugs for the treatment of addiction ([[cocaine]], [[Heroin|diamorphine]] and [[dipipanone]]).<ref>{{cite web | work = Department of Health | title = Pharmacist independent prescribing FAQ | date = 22 March 2010 | publisher = Department of Health and Social Care | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | url-status = dead | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/Medicinespharmacyandindustry/Prescriptions/TheNon-MedicalPrescribingProgramme/Independentpharmacistprescribing/DH_4133943 | archive-date = 7 January 2013 | access-date = 14 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Education and registration====\nPharmacists, [[pharmacy technician]]s and pharmacy premises in the [[United Kingdom]] are regulated by the [[General Pharmaceutical Council|General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC)]] for [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] and by the [[Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland]] for [[Northern Ireland]].

Pharmacists holding degrees in Pharmacy from overseas institutions are able to fulfill this stage by undertaking the Overseas Pharmacist Assessment Programme (OSPAP), which is a one-year [[postgraduate diploma]]. On completion of the OSPAP, the candidate would proceed with the other stages of the registration process in the same manner as a UK student.\n*Completion of a 52-week preregistration training period. This is a period of paid or unpaid employment, in an approved hospital or community pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist tutor. During this time the student must collect evidence of having met certain competency standards set by the GPhC.\n*A pass mark in the GPhC registration assessment (formally an exam). This includes a closed-book paper and an open-book/mental calculations paper (using the [[British National Formulary]] and the GPhC's \"Standards of Conduct, Ethics and Performance\" document as reference sources). The student must achieve an overall mark of 70%, which must include at least 70% in the calculations section of the open-book paper. From June 2016, the assessment will involve two papers, as before but the use of a calculator will now be allowed. However, reference sources will no longer be allowed in the assessment.

The ACPE board of directors are appointed by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) (three appointments each), and the American Council on Education (one appointment). To obtain licensure in the United States, applicants for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) must graduate from an ACPE accredited school of pharmacy. ACPE publishes standards that schools of pharmacy must comply with to gain accreditation.<ref>{{citation | title = Accreditation standards and key elements for the Professional Program in Pharmacy Leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (\"Standards 2016\"} | publisher = Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education | date = 2015 | url = https://www.acpe-accredit.org/pdf/Standards2016FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nA [[Pharmacy school]] pursuing accreditation must first apply and be granted Pre-candidate status.<ref name=\"acpepolicies\"/> These schools have met all the requirements for accreditation, but have not yet enrolled any students. This status indicates that the school of pharmacy has developed its program in accordance with the ACPE standards and guidelines. Once a school has enrolled students, but has not yet had a graduating class, they may be granted Candidate status. The expectations of a Candidate program are that they continue to mature in accordance with stated plans. The graduates of a Candidate program are the same as those of fully accredited programs. Full accreditation is granted to a program once they have demonstrated they comply with the standards set forth by ACPE.\n\nThe customary review cycle for established accredited programs is six years, whereas for programs achieving their initial accreditation this cycle is two years. These are comprehensive on-site evaluations of the programs. Additional evaluations may be conducted at the discretion of ACPE in the interim between comprehensive evaluations.\n\n====Education====\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nAcceptance into a doctorate of pharmacy program depends upon completing specific prerequisites or obtaining a transferable bachelor's degree. [[Pharmacy school]] is four years of graduate school (accelerated Pharmacy Schools go January to January and are only 3 years), which include at least one year of practical experience. Graduates receive a Doctorate of Pharmacy ([[PharmD]]) upon graduation. Most schools require students to take a Pharmacy College Admissions Test [[PCAT]] and complete 90 credit hours of university coursework in the sciences, mathematics, composition, and humanities before entry into the [[PharmD]] program. Due to the large admittance requirements and highly competitive nature of the field, most pharmacy students complete a bachelor's degree before entry to pharmacy school.\n\nPossible prerequisites:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Anatomy]]\n*[[Physiology]]\n*[[Biochemistry]]\n*[[Biology]]\n*[[Immunology]]\n*[[Chemical engineering]]\n*[[Economics]]\n*[[Pathophysiology]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Physics]]\n*[[Humanities]]\n*[[Microbiology]]\n*[[Molecular biology]]\n*[[Organic chemistry]]\n*[[Physical chemistry]]\n*[[Statistics]]\n*[[Calculus]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nBesides taking classes, additional requirements before graduating may include a certain number of hours for community service, e.g., working in hospitals, clinics, and retail.\n\nEstimated timeline: 4 years undergraduate + 4 years doctorate + 1\u20132 years residency + 1\u20133 years fellowship = 8\u201313 years\n\nA doctorate of pharmacy (except non-traditional, i.e. transferring a license from another country) is the only degree accepted by the National Associate of Boards of Pharmacy [[NABP]] to be eligible to \"sit\" for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination ([[NAPLEX]]). Previously the United States had a 5-year bachelor's degree in pharmacy. For BS Pharmacy graduates currently licensed in US, there are 10 Universities offering non-traditional doctorate degree programs via part-time, weekend or on-line programs. These are programs fully accredited by Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education ([[Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education|ACPE]]) but only available to current BS Pharmacy graduates with a license to practice pharmacy. Some institutions still offer 6 year accelerated [[PharmD]] programs.\n\nThe current Pharm.D. degree curriculum is considerably different from that of the prior BS in pharmacy. It now includes extensive didactic clinical preparation, a full year of hands-on practice experience in a wider array of healthcare settings, and a greater emphasis on clinical pharmacy practice pertaining to pharmacotherapy optimization. Legal requirements in the US to becoming a pharmacist include: graduating from an accredited [[PharmD]] program, conducting a specified number of internship hours under a licensed pharmacist (i.e. 1800 hours in some states), passing the [[NAPLEX]], and passing a Multi-state Pharmacy Jurisprudence Exam [[MPJE]].  Arkansas, California, and Virginia have their own exams instead of the MPJE;  in those states, pharmacists must pass the Arkansas Jurisprudence Exam, the California Jurisprudence Exam, or the Virginia Pharmacy Law Exam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/arkansas-pharmacist-license/ | title = Arkansas Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/california-pharmacist-license/ | title = California Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.beapharmacist.com/virginia-pharmacist-license/ | title = Virginia Pharmacist License | work = Be a Pharmacist: Degree, License, and More | publisher = Be a Pharmacist | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nResidency is an option for post-graduates that is typically 1\u20132 years in length. A residency gives licensed pharmacists decades of clinical experience in an extremely condensed timeframe of only a few short years. In order for new graduates to remain competitive, employers generally favor residency trained applicants for clinical positions. The profession is moving toward resident-trained pharmacists who wish to provide direct patient care clinical services. In 1990, the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy ([[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy|AACP]]) required the new professional degree. Graduates from a [[PharmD]] program may also elect to do a fellowship that is geared toward research. Fellowships can varying in length but last 1\u20133 years depending on the program and usually require 1 year of residency at minimum.\n\n====Specialization and credentialing====\n[[File:A U.S. Soldier with the Special Warfare Medical Group(Airborne), speaks to Dr 110228-A-GV060-946.jpg|thumb|270px|Clinical pharmacists go on rounds with doctors in order to provide direct patient care and comprehensive medication management.]]\nAmerican pharmacists can become certified in recognized specialty practice areas by passing an examination administered by one of several credentialing boards.\n\n*The [[Board of Pharmacy Specialties]] certifies pharmacists in thirteen specialties:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bpsweb.org/bps-specialties/ | title = BPS Specialties | work = BPS: Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties | publisher = American Pharmacists Association | date = | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n**[[Ambulatory care]] pharmacy\n**[[Cardiology]] pharmacy\n**Compounded sterile preparations pharmacy\n**[[Critical care medicine|Critical care]] pharmacy\n**[[Geriatrics|Geriatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Infectious disease]]s pharmacy\n**[[Nuclear pharmacy]]\n**[[Nutrition]] support pharmacy\n**[[Oncology]] pharmacy\n**[[Pediatric]] pharmacy\n**[[Pharmacotherapy]]\n**[[Psychiatric pharmacy]]\n**[[Organ transplantation|Solid organ transplant]] pharmacy<ref name=\"SOT Specialty\">{{cite web |title=Solid Organ Transplantation Pharmacy Recognized as New Specialty |url=https://www.bpsweb.org/2018/08/22/solid-organ-transplantation-pharmacy-recognized-as-new-specialty/ |website=Board of Pharmacy Specialties |accessdate=3 January 2019 |date=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n*The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists in [[geriatrics]] specialty practice.\n*The American Board of Applied Toxicology certifies pharmacists and other medical professionals in applied [[toxicology]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.clintox.org/Abat/ | title = American Board of Applied Toxicology (ABAT) | work = AACT | publisher = American Academy of Clinical Toxicology | access-date = 10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Expanding Scope of Practice ====\n=====Vaccinations=====\nAs of 2016, all 50 states and the District of Columbia permit pharmacists to provide vaccination services, but specific protocols vary between states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lawatlas.org/datasets/pharmacist-vaccination|title=Pharmacist Vaccination Laws  | first1 = Cason | last1 = Schmit | first2 = Allison | last2 = Reddick |date= 1 January 2016|website=The Policy Surveillance Program: A LawAtlas Project | publisher = Temple University Beasley School of Law |url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.immunize.org/pharmacists/|title=Pharmacists and Immunization: Vaccination Resources for Pharmacists| work = www.immunize.org: Website for Healthcare Professionals | publisher = Immunization Action Coalition |access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/supplementals/2017/immunizationsupplementjune2017/authority-and-scope-of-vaccination-how-states-differ |title=Authority and Scope of Vaccination: How States Differ | first1 = Sharon | last1 = Xavioer | first2 = Jeff | last2 = Goad | date = 22 June 2017 | work = Pharmacy Times | publisher = Pharmacy & Healthcare Communications, LLC | access-date=20 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====California=====\nAll licensed California pharmacists can perform the following:\n*Order and interpret drug therapy related tests\n*Furnish smoking cessation aids (such as nicotine replacement therapy)\n*Furnish oral self-administered contraception (birth control pills)\n*Furnish travel medications recommended by the CDC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpha.com/advocacy/provider-status/expanding-pharmacist-services/|title=Expanding Pharmacist Services|publisher=California Pharmacists Association|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n*Administer vaccinations pursuant to the latest CDC standards for anyone ages 3+<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4052.8&lawCode=BPC|title= Business and Professions Code - BPC: DIVISION 2.

About 5\u20137% of students can pass the exam. There are 3 aspects to the exam. These are on math, chemistry, and physics or biology. After being trained at the university for 5 years, successful students receive a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Or they are university pharmacists (university pharmacist to discriminate between college pharmacist or vocational pharmacist in some countries of the world these trainee pharmacists are called pharmacist assistants). An alternative method of obtaining a bachelor's degree is as follows. School pupils study at a college of pharmacy or a vocational school of pharmacy. After attending the school or college they go to work in a pharmacy, and with two years of practice they could take an exam to enter university of pharmacy or the pharmacy department of a university of medicine and pharmacy. This exam is easier than the national one. Passing the exam they continue studying to gain 3-year bachelor's degrees or 4-year bachelor's degrees. This degree is considered equivalent to a 5-year bachelor's degree.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Notable pharmacists==\n{{main|List of pharmacists}}\n* [[Charles Alderton]] (1857-1941), [[United States|American]] inventor of the soft drink [[Dr Pepper]]\n* [[Caleb Bradham]] (1867-1934), American inventor of the soft drink [[Pepsi]]\n* [[Ikililou Dhoinine]] (born 1962), [[Comoros|Comorian]] politician\n* [[Pravin Gordhan]] (born 1949), [[Minister (government)|minister]] in [[South Africa]]n government\n* [[Luke Howard]] (1772\u20131864), \"the father of [[meteorology]]\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Thornes | first = John.

Historically, each is a successor to one of the previous [[Australian colonies]]. Each state has its own constitution, with its own legislature (parliament), judiciary and executive.  The state parliaments have [[plenary power|plenary]] legislative power, except that some areas of legislative power are exclusive to the Federal Parliament, many others are exercised concurrently with it and, in case of conflict between federal and state legislation, the federal legislation prevails.  A decision of a state judiciary is subject to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].\n\nThere are also ten '''territories''', whose existence and governmental structure (if any) depend on federal legislation.  The territories are distinguished for federal administrative purposes between ''internal'' territories, i.e. those within the Australian mainland, and ''external'' territories, although the differences among all the territories relate to population rather than location.\n\nTwo of the three ''internal'' territories{{mdash}}the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT), which was established to be a neutral site of the federal capital, and the [[Northern Territory]]{{mdash}}function almost as states.  Each has self-government, through its legislative assembly, but the assembly's legislation can be federally overridden.  Each has its own judiciary, with appeal to a federal court.  The third internal territory, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], is the product of Australia's complex relationship with its capital city; rather than having the same level of autonomy as the other internal territories, it has services provided by the ACT.\n\nThere are also seven ''external'' territories, not part of the Australian mainland or of any state. Three of them have a small permanent population, two have tiny and transient populations, and two are uninhabited.  All are directly administered by the federal [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]] (or the [[Department of the Environment and Energy]] in the case of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]). [[Norfolk Island]], which is permanently populated, was partially self-governing until 2015.\n\nThe term \"'''interstate'''\" is used within Australia to refer to any cross-border events, transactions, or travel.\n\n== Geographic Australia ==\nThe term ''geographic Australia'' is used by the Australian government to describe the area covered by demographic statistics such as national population figures. This area comprises [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] in addition to the six states and three mainland territories; Norfolk Island is the only territory with a permanent population that is not part of geographic Australia.<ref>{{Cite report | first=Brian | last=Pink | authorlink=Brian_Pink  | year=2010  | title=Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) | publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics | section=Definition of Australia | sectionurl=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/58B39EB886CFC607CA25779F00172F75?opendocument | page=5}}</ref>\n\n== States and territories ==\n{{Administrative divisions of Australia}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%\"\n|-\n|+ style=\"text-align:center;background:#BFD7FF\"| Reference map for states and territories of Australia\n|-\n|[[File:Australia states and territories labelled.svg|frameless|upright=2.75]]\n|}\n{{anchor|Table}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:center;background:#BFD7FF\"| States of Australia<ref group=\"n\">Unless provided, references and details on data provided in the table can be found within the individual state and territory articles.</ref>\n|-\n!class=\"unsortable\"|[[List of Australian flags#States and territories|Flag]]\n!

The [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] was eventually given independence as [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1975.

The [[Colony of New South Wales]] was founded in 1788 and originally comprised much of the Australian mainland, as well as [[Lord Howe Island]], [[Colony of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Norfolk Island]], and [[Van Diemen's Land]], in addition to the area currently referred to as the state of New South Wales. During the 19th century, large areas were successively separated to form the [[Colony of Tasmania]] (initially established as a separate colony named [[Van Diemen's Land]] in 1825), the [[History of Western Australia#British Colony|Colony of Western Australia]] (initially established as the smaller [[Swan River Colony]] in 1829), the [[History of South Australia#The Proclamation of South Australia .281836.29|Province of South Australia]] (1836), the [[Colony of New Zealand]] (1840),<ref>A.H. McLintock (ed), ''An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'', 3 vols, Wellington, NZ:R.E. Owen, Government Printer, 1966, vol 3 p. 526.'</ref> the [[Victoria (Australia)#Creation of separate colony of Victoria|Victoria Colony]] (1851) and the [[Queensland#Colony of Queensland|Colony of Queensland]] (1859). Upon Federation, the six colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania became the founding states of the new Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nLegislative powers of the states are protected by the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]], section 107, and under the principle of [[federalism]], [[Federalism in Australia|Commonwealth legislation only applies to the states where permitted by the constitution]]. The territories, by contrast, are from a constitutional perspective directly subject to the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]]; laws for territories are determined by the Australian Parliament.<ref>Constitution of Australia, section 122</ref>\n\nMost of the territories are directly administered by the Commonwealth Government, while two (the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) have some degree of self-government although less than that of the states. In the self-governing territories, the Australian Parliament retains the full power to legislate, and can override laws made by the territorial institutions, which it has done on rare occasions. For the purposes of Australian (and joint Australia-New Zealand) intergovernmental bodies, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are treated as if they were states.\n\nEach state has a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]], appointed by [[Monarchy of Australia|the monarch]] (currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]]), which by convention she does on the advice of the state premier. The Administrator of the Northern Territory, by contrast, is appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. The Australian Capital Territory has neither a Governor nor an Administrator, but the Governor-General exercises some powers that in other jurisdictions are exercised by the Governor of a state or Administrator of a territory, such as the power to dissolve the Legislative Assembly.\n\n[[Jervis Bay Territory]] is the only non-self-governing internal territory. Until 1989, it was administered as if it were a part of the ACT, although it has always been a separate territory.  Under the terms of the ''Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915'',<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C00038 Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 (Cth)].</ref> the laws of the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay Territory insofar as they are applicable and providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web |title= Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration |url= http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx |quote= Although the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the Australian Capital Territory, the laws of the ACT apply, insofar as they are applicable and, providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance, in the Territory by virtue of the 'Jervis Bay Acceptance Act 1915' |publisher= The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport |accessdate= 17 January 2013}}</ref> Although residents of the Jervis Bay Territory are generally subject to laws made by the ACT Legislative Assembly, they are not represented in the Assembly. They are represented in the [[Parliament of Australia]] as part of the Electoral [[Division of Fraser (Australian Capital Territory)|Division of Fraser]] in the ACT and by the ACT's two Senators. In other respects, the territory is administered directly by the Federal Government through the Territories portfolio.\n\nThe external territory of [[Norfolk Island]] possessed a degree of self-government from 1979 until 2015.\n\nEach state has a [[bicameral]] parliament except Queensland, which abolished its upper house in 1922. The lower house is called the Legislative Assembly, except in South Australia and Tasmania, where it is called the House of Assembly. Tasmania is the only state to use [[proportional representation]] for elections to its lower house; all others elect members from single member constituencies, using [[instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]]. The upper house is called the Legislative Council and is generally elected from multi-member constituencies using proportional representation. The three self-governing territories, the ACT, the Northern Territory, and Norfolk Island, each have [[unicameral]] Legislative Assemblies.\n\nThe head of government of each state is called the premier, appointed by the state's Governor. In normal circumstances, the Governor will appoint as premier whoever leads the party or coalition which exercises control of the lower house (in the case of Queensland, the only house) of the state Parliament. However, in times of [[constitutional crisis]], the Governor can appoint someone else as Premier. The head of government of the self-governing internal territories is called the chief minister. The Northern Territory's chief minister, in normal circumstances whoever controls the Legislative Assembly, is appointed by the administrator.\n\nThe term \"interstate\" is used within Australia to refer to a number of events, transactions, registrations, travel, etc. which occurs across borders or outside of the particular state or territory of the user of the term. Examples of use include motor vehicle registration,<ref>{{cite web|website=sa.gov.au|publisher=Government of South Australia|url=https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/driving-and-transport/registration/vehicle-registration/driving-an-interstate-registered-vehicle|title=Interstate-registered vehicles|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> travel,<ref>{{cite web|website=Public Transport Victoria|url=https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/more/travelling-on-the-network/interstate-travel/|title=Interstate travel|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> applications to educational institutions out of one's home state.<ref>{{cite web|website=VTAC|url=https://www.vtac.edu.au/applying/courses/interstate.html|title=Applying interstate|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are very few urban areas bifurcated by state/territory borders. The Queensland/New South Wales border runs through [[Coolangatta]] ([[Queensland]]) and [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]] ([[New South Wales]]) and splits [[Gold Coast Airport]].  [[Oaks Estate]], a contiguous residential of [[Queanbeyan]], was excised out of [[New South Wales]] when the [[Australian Capital Territory]] was established in 1909.  Some [[urban area|Urban Centres and Localities]] reported by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] include some agglomerations of cities spreading across state lines, including [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]\u2013[[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]], [[Canberra]]\u2013[[Queanbeyan]], [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]]\u2013[[Wodonga, Victoria|Wodonga]] (New South Wales-Victoria) and [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]]\u2013[[Wentworth, New South Wales|Wentworth]] (Victoria-New South Wales)  \n\n=== Timeline ===\n*1788 \u2013 [[British Empire]] establishes [[Colony of New South Wales]] across central and eastern mainland Australia, the island of Tasmania, both islands of New Zealand and Norfolk Island.\n*1803 \u2013 The [[Coral Sea Islands]] are claimed by New South Wales\n*1825 \u2013 The island of Tasmania becomes the independent colony of [[Van Diemen's Land]].

Australia|Cadastral divisions]]\n}}\n\nGovernment in the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] is exercised on three levels: [[Government of Australia|federal]], '''states and territories''', and [[local government in Australia|local government]].\n\nThere are six '''states''':  [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]. Historically, each is a successor to one of the previous [[Australian colonies]]. Each state has its own constitution, with its own legislature (parliament), judiciary and executive.  The state parliaments have [[plenary power|plenary]] legislative power, except that some areas of legislative power are exclusive to the Federal Parliament, many others are exercised concurrently with it and, in case of conflict between federal and state legislation, the federal legislation prevails.  A decision of a state judiciary is subject to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].\n\nThere are also ten '''territories''', whose existence and governmental structure (if any) depend on federal legislation.  The territories are distinguished for federal administrative purposes between ''internal'' territories, i.e. those within the Australian mainland, and ''external'' territories, although the differences among all the territories relate to population rather than location.\n\nTwo of the three ''internal'' territories{{mdash}}the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT), which was established to be a neutral site of the federal capital, and the [[Northern Territory]]{{mdash}}function almost as states.  Each has self-government, through its legislative assembly, but the assembly's legislation can be federally overridden.  Each has its own judiciary, with appeal to a federal court.  The third internal territory, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], is the product of Australia's complex relationship with its capital city; rather than having the same level of autonomy as the other internal territories, it has services provided by the ACT.\n\nThere are also seven ''external'' territories, not part of the Australian mainland or of any state. Three of them have a small permanent population, two have tiny and transient populations, and two are uninhabited.  All are directly administered by the federal [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]] (or the [[Department of the Environment and Energy]] in the case of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]). [[Norfolk Island]], which is permanently populated, was partially self-governing until 2015.\n\nThe term \"'''interstate'''\" is used within Australia to refer to any cross-border events, transactions, or travel.\n\n== Geographic Australia ==\nThe term ''geographic Australia'' is used by the Australian government to describe the area covered by demographic statistics such as national population figures. This area comprises [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] in addition to the six states and three mainland territories; Norfolk Island is the only territory with a permanent population that is not part of geographic Australia.<ref>{{Cite report | first=Brian | last=Pink | authorlink=Brian_Pink  | year=2010  | title=Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) | publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics | section=Definition of Australia | sectionurl=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/58B39EB886CFC607CA25779F00172F75?opendocument | page=5}}</ref>\n\n== States and territories ==\n{{Administrative divisions of Australia}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%\"\n|-\n|+ style=\"text-align:center;background:#BFD7FF\"| Reference map for states and territories of Australia\n|-\n|[[File:Australia states and territories labelled.svg|frameless|upright=2.75]]\n|}\n{{anchor|Table}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:center;background:#BFD7FF\"| States of Australia<ref group=\"n\">Unless provided, references and details on data provided in the table can be found within the individual state and territory articles.</ref>\n|-\n!class=\"unsortable\"|[[List of Australian flags#States and territories|Flag]]\n!

The [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] was eventually given independence as [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1975.

The [[Colony of New South Wales]] was founded in 1788 and originally comprised much of the Australian mainland, as well as [[Lord Howe Island]], [[Colony of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Norfolk Island]], and [[Van Diemen's Land]], in addition to the area currently referred to as the state of New South Wales. During the 19th century, large areas were successively separated to form the [[Colony of Tasmania]] (initially established as a separate colony named [[Van Diemen's Land]] in 1825), the [[History of Western Australia#British Colony|Colony of Western Australia]] (initially established as the smaller [[Swan River Colony]] in 1829), the [[History of South Australia#The Proclamation of South Australia .281836.29|Province of South Australia]] (1836), the [[Colony of New Zealand]] (1840),<ref>A.H.

Owen, Government Printer, 1966, vol 3 p. 526.'</ref> the [[Victoria (Australia)#Creation of separate colony of Victoria|Victoria Colony]] (1851) and the [[Queensland#Colony of Queensland|Colony of Queensland]] (1859). Upon Federation, the six colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania became the founding states of the new Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nLegislative powers of the states are protected by the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]], section 107, and under the principle of [[federalism]], [[Federalism in Australia|Commonwealth legislation only applies to the states where permitted by the constitution]]. The territories, by contrast, are from a constitutional perspective directly subject to the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]]; laws for territories are determined by the Australian Parliament.<ref>Constitution of Australia, section 122</ref>\n\nMost of the territories are directly administered by the Commonwealth Government, while two (the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) have some degree of self-government although less than that of the states. In the self-governing territories, the Australian Parliament retains the full power to legislate, and can override laws made by the territorial institutions, which it has done on rare occasions. For the purposes of Australian (and joint Australia-New Zealand) intergovernmental bodies, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are treated as if they were states.\n\nEach state has a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]], appointed by [[Monarchy of Australia|the monarch]] (currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]]), which by convention she does on the advice of the state premier. The Administrator of the Northern Territory, by contrast, is appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. The Australian Capital Territory has neither a Governor nor an Administrator, but the Governor-General exercises some powers that in other jurisdictions are exercised by the Governor of a state or Administrator of a territory, such as the power to dissolve the Legislative Assembly.\n\n[[Jervis Bay Territory]] is the only non-self-governing internal territory. Until 1989, it was administered as if it were a part of the ACT, although it has always been a separate territory.  Under the terms of the ''Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915'',<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C00038 Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 (Cth)].</ref> the laws of the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay Territory insofar as they are applicable and providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web |title= Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration |url= http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx |quote= Although the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the Australian Capital Territory, the laws of the ACT apply, insofar as they are applicable and, providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance, in the Territory by virtue of the 'Jervis Bay Acceptance Act 1915' |publisher= The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport |accessdate= 17 January 2013}}</ref> Although residents of the Jervis Bay Territory are generally subject to laws made by the ACT Legislative Assembly, they are not represented in the Assembly. They are represented in the [[Parliament of Australia]] as part of the Electoral [[Division of Fraser (Australian Capital Territory)|Division of Fraser]] in the ACT and by the ACT's two Senators. In other respects, the territory is administered directly by the Federal Government through the Territories portfolio.\n\nThe external territory of [[Norfolk Island]] possessed a degree of self-government from 1979 until 2015.\n\nEach state has a [[bicameral]] parliament except Queensland, which abolished its upper house in 1922. The lower house is called the Legislative Assembly, except in South Australia and Tasmania, where it is called the House of Assembly. Tasmania is the only state to use [[proportional representation]] for elections to its lower house; all others elect members from single member constituencies, using [[instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]]. The upper house is called the Legislative Council and is generally elected from multi-member constituencies using proportional representation. The three self-governing territories, the ACT, the Northern Territory, and Norfolk Island, each have [[unicameral]] Legislative Assemblies.\n\nThe head of government of each state is called the premier, appointed by the state's Governor. In normal circumstances, the Governor will appoint as premier whoever leads the party or coalition which exercises control of the lower house (in the case of Queensland, the only house) of the state Parliament. However, in times of [[constitutional crisis]], the Governor can appoint someone else as Premier. The head of government of the self-governing internal territories is called the chief minister. The Northern Territory's chief minister, in normal circumstances whoever controls the Legislative Assembly, is appointed by the administrator.\n\nThe term \"interstate\" is used within Australia to refer to a number of events, transactions, registrations, travel, etc. which occurs across borders or outside of the particular state or territory of the user of the term. Examples of use include motor vehicle registration,<ref>{{cite web|website=sa.gov.au|publisher=Government of South Australia|url=https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/driving-and-transport/registration/vehicle-registration/driving-an-interstate-registered-vehicle|title=Interstate-registered vehicles|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> travel,<ref>{{cite web|website=Public Transport Victoria|url=https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/more/travelling-on-the-network/interstate-travel/|title=Interstate travel|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> applications to educational institutions out of one's home state.<ref>{{cite web|website=VTAC|url=https://www.vtac.edu.au/applying/courses/interstate.html|title=Applying interstate|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are very few urban areas bifurcated by state/territory borders. The Queensland/New South Wales border runs through [[Coolangatta]] ([[Queensland]]) and [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]] ([[New South Wales]]) and splits [[Gold Coast Airport]].  [[Oaks Estate]], a contiguous residential of [[Queanbeyan]], was excised out of [[New South Wales]] when the [[Australian Capital Territory]] was established in 1909.  Some [[urban area|Urban Centres and Localities]] reported by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] include some agglomerations of cities spreading across state lines, including [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]\u2013[[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]], [[Canberra]]\u2013[[Queanbeyan]], [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]]\u2013[[Wodonga, Victoria|Wodonga]] (New South Wales-Victoria) and [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]]\u2013[[Wentworth, New South Wales|Wentworth]] (Victoria-New South Wales)  \n\n=== Timeline ===\n*1788 \u2013 [[British Empire]] establishes [[Colony of New South Wales]] across central and eastern mainland Australia, the island of Tasmania, both islands of New Zealand and Norfolk Island.\n*1803 \u2013 The [[Coral Sea Islands]] are claimed by New South Wales\n*1825 \u2013 The island of Tasmania becomes the independent colony of [[Van Diemen's Land]].

The film follows a photographer, George, and his family who discover a dark force in a cabin they're staying in during their wintry weekend at upstate New York while catching the fury of a local hunter after hitting a deer on the road. Things then take a turn for the worse when they suddenly get antagonised by the titular Wendigo, a demonic humanoid creature who engages in cannibalism.\n\nThe film was released to theatres on January 23, 2001, for a limited time and received mixed reviews by critics. The film was not a major box office attraction and bombed as it scored $1.1 thousand on opening weekend.[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275067/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt]\n\n==Plot==\nGeorge ([[Jake Weber]]) is a highly-strung professional [[photographer]] who is starting to unravel from the stress of his work with a [[Manhattan]] advertising agency. Needing some time away from the city, George, his wife Kim ([[Patricia Clarkson]]), and their 10-year-old son Miles ([[Erik Per Sullivan]]) head to upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] to take in the winter sights, though the drive up is hardly relaxing for any of them.\n\nGeorge accidentally hits and severely injures a [[deer]] that ran onto the icy road. After George stops to inspect the damage, he's confronted by an angry local named Otis who flies into a rage, telling George that he and his fellow [[hunter]]s had been tracking the deer for some time. An argument breaks out, which leaves George feeling deeply shaken. When George and Kim arrive at their [[Log cabin|cabin]], they discover that a dark and intimidating presence seems to have taken it over.\n\nThe next day, when they stop at a store in a town near the cabin, a shopkeeper tells Miles about the legend of the [[Wendigo]], a deformed beast from [[Native America]]n [[folklore]] who changes from a human to a hideous beast after engaging in [[cannibalism]]. The Wendigo also has supernatural powers and can change its appearance at will. The shopkeeper then gives him a small figurine of a Wendigo. Miles can't help but think the Wendigo has something to do with the dark forces at work in the woods near the cabin.\n\nLater that day, while sledding together, George suddenly falls to the ground, leaving Miles alone and lost in the woods. Frightened, Miles approaches his dad when he is chased by the Wendigo and passes out. He is awakened later by a frightened Kim, who went looking for her family once they didn't come home.\n\nKim and Miles begin a trek deep into the forest, until they end up at the house, where they find a bloody George crawling towards the car claiming Otis shot him. Frantic, Kim and Miles put George in the car and drive to the nearest hospital. It is revealed that George and Miles were sledding near a shooting range and Otis shot George in the liver with a [[hunting rifle]]. George undergoes emergency surgery and Miles walks into the hospital, hallucinates that his father is being assaulted by the Wendigo and faints. He awakens only to find that George has died.\n\nOtis is confronted by the local [[sheriff]], but he kills the sheriff and drives away into the night, being stalked by the Wendigo until he crashes into a [[tree]] and runs away into the forest, eventually ending up on a road where he is hit by the deputy sheriff's squad car. The movie ends with Otis being carted into the emergency room of the hospital, and being followed by the Indian shopkeeper while Miles watches it all, caressing the Wendigo figurine.\n\n== Connections to the Wendigo ==\nDespite its title, the film does not bear much resemblance to the legend whatsoever. The movie ''Ravenous'' is arguably closer; the term ''windigo'' is only mentioned by a Native American scout.\n\n==Cast==\n\n*[[Patricia Clarkson]] as Kim \n*[[Jake Weber]] as George \n*[[Erik Per Sullivan]] as Miles \n*[[John Speredakos]] as Otis \n*[[Christopher Wynkoop]] as Sheriff Tom Hale \n*[[Lloyd Oxendine]] as Elder \n*[[Brian Delate]] as Everett \n*[[Daniel Sherman (actor)|Daniel Stewart Sherman]] as Billy \n*[[Jennifer Wiltsie]] as Martha \n*[[Maxx Stratton]] as Brandon \n*Richard Stratton as Earl \n*[[Dash Stratton]] as Little Otis \n*[[Dwayne Navara]] as Mechanic \n*[[Shelly Bolding]] as Store Owner \n*[[Susan Pellegrino]] as Nurse \n*James Godwin as Wendigo\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film opened in limited release and was not a major box office attraction and only scored $1,107 at opening weekend, making it one of the [[List of biggest box-office bombs|biggest box office bombs of all time]].[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275067/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt]\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on [[DVD]] by ''Live/Artisan'' on Dec 17, 2002.
