These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season.

The day before vehicle traffic was allowed, 200,000 people crossed either on foot or on roller skates.<ref name=\"two\"/> On opening day, Mayor [[Angelo Joseph Rossi|Angelo Rossi]] and other officials rode the ferry to Marin, then crossed the bridge in a motorcade past three ceremonial \"barriers,\" the last a blockade of [[Beauty pageant|beauty queens]] who required Joseph Strauss to present the bridge to the Highway District before allowing him to pass. An official song, \"[[There's a Silver Moon on the Golden Gate]],\" was chosen to commemorate the event. Strauss wrote a poem that is now on the Golden Gate Bridge entitled \"The Mighty Task is Done.\" The next day, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] pushed a button in Washington, D.C. signaling the official start of vehicle traffic over the Bridge at noon. As the celebration got out of hand there was a small riot in the uptown [[Polk Gulch]] area. Weeks of civil and cultural activities called \"the Fiesta\" followed. A statue of Strauss was moved in 1955 to a site near the bridge.<ref name=\"Owens\"/>\n\nIn May 1987, as part of the 50th anniversary celebration, the Golden Gate Bridge district again closed the bridge to automobile traffic and allowed pedestrians to cross the bridge.

Some have claimed that such themes have indeed recurred in 'Bella and the Bulldogs', ranging from the romantic relationship between the two main characters \"Bella\" and \"Troy\" consisting of a black male and white female, to the symbolism and terms used throughout the Nickelodeon show having overlap with terms used in the cuckolding fetish, like \"bull\" (symbolizing the man who performs the sex act), and practices like blindfolding<ref>https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6tjm2l</ref> and the usage of keys (both also extensively used in Butler's previous work<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPSNfKnJnSQ</ref>).<ref>http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--eohvCJXA--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1332345218058172820.jpg</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|3596178}}\n\n{{Former Nickelodeon original series}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2010s Nickelodeon shows]]\n[[Category:2015 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2016 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American sports television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Texas]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| image                = Bellaandthebulldogslogo.png\n| genre                = [[Comedy]]\n| creator              = Jonathan Butler & Gabriel Garza\n| starring             = {{plainlist |\n* [[Brec Bassinger]]\n* [[Coy Stewart]]\n* Jackie Radinsky\n* [[Buddy Handleson]]\n* [[Lilimar]]\n* [[Haley Tju]]\n* [[Rio Mangini]]\n}}\n| composer             = [[Ron Wasserman]]\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| num_seasons          = 2\n| num_episodes         = 39\n| list_episodes        = List of Bella and the Bulldogs episodes\n| executive_producer   = [[Jeff Bushell]]\n| producer             = Chris Phillips\n| camera               = [[Multi-camera]]\n| runtime              = 22 minutes\n| company              = [[Nickelodeon Productions]]\n| network              = [[Nickelodeon]]\n| picture_format       = [[HDTV]] [[720p]]\n| audio_format         = [[5.1 surround sound]]\n| first_aired          = {{Start date|2015|1|17}}\n| last_aired           = {{End date|2016|6|25}}\n| website              = \n}}\n\n'''''Bella and the Bulldogs''''' is an American [[comedy]] television series created by Jonathan Butler and Gabriel Garza that aired on [[Nickelodeon]] from January 17, 2015 to June 25, 2016.

'''Manuchehri Damghani''', was an 11th-century court poet in [[Persia]] and [[Afghanistan]].\n\nHe was from [[Damghan]] in [[Iran]] and he is said to have invented the form of ''musammat'' (stanzaic poems) in Persian poetry and to have written the best examples of this form. He traveled to [[Tabarestan]] and was admitted to the court of King [[Manuchihr]] of the [[Ziyarid]] dynasty. It is from here that he acquired his pen-name. He later was a royal poet in the court of Sultan Shihab ud-Dawlah [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]] (or Ghazna), son of [[Mahmud of Ghazna]].\n \nHe left behind a [[Deewan|divan]], a collection of his shorter poems. His works were extensively studied and translated into French by [[Albert Kazimirski de Biberstein]] in 1886.\n\nManuchehri died in 1040 CE.\n\n==Sample Poetry==\nThe following are the opening lines of one of his most famous ''musamm\u0101t'':\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062e\u06cc\u0632\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u062e\u0632 \u0622\u0631\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0645 \u062e\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u0627\u062f \u062e\u0646\u06a9 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0627\u0646\u0628 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0632\u0645 \u0648\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0622\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u06af \u0631\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u062e \u0631\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06af\u0648\u06cc\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u064e\u062b\u064e\u0644\u0652 \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0647\u0646 \u0631\u0646\u06af\u0631\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0647\u0642\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u062c\u0628 \u0633\u0631\u0650 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0634\u062a \u06af\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631 \u0686\u0645\u0646 \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u063a \u0646\u0647 \u06af\u064f\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0631}}\n\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|x\u012bz\u012bd-o xaz \u0101<u>r\u012bd</u> ke heng\u0101m-e xaz\u0101n ast}}\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|b\u0101d-e xonok 'az j\u0101neb-e X\u0101<u>razm</u> vaz\u0101n ast}}\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|\u0101n barg-e raz\u0101n b\u012bn ke bar \u0101n \u0161\u0101x-e raz\u0101n ast}}\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|g\u016b'\u012b be masal p\u012brahan-\u0113 <u>rang</u>-raz\u0101n ast}}\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|dehq\u0101n be ta'ajjob sar-an<u>go\u0161t</u>-gaz\u0101n ast}}\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|k-andar \u010daman-\u014d <u>b\u0101q</u> na gol m\u0101nd o na goln\u0101r}}\n\nMetre:\n::\u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 || u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 (3.3.14)\n\n:Get up and bring fur clothes<ref>Clinton translates as \"silk brocade\"; but Kazimirski (p. 321, note on line 14) points out that here the other meaning of \"fur\" is more appropriate.

'''Manuchehri Damghani''', was an 11th-century court poet in [[Persia]] and [[Afghanistan]].\n\nHe was from [[Damghan]] in [[Iran]] and he is said to have invented the form of ''musammat'' (stanzaic poems) in Persian poetry and to have written the best examples of this form. He traveled to [[Tabarestan]] and was admitted to the court of King [[Manuchihr]] of the [[Ziyarid]] dynasty. It is from here that he acquired his pen-name. He later was a royal poet in the court of Sultan Shihab ud-Dawlah [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]] (or Ghazna), son of [[Mahmud of Ghazna]].\n \nHe left behind a [[Deewan|divan]], a collection of his shorter poems. His works were extensively studied and translated into French by [[Albert Kazimirski de Biberstein]] in 1886.\n\nManuchehri died in 1040 CE.\n\n==Sample Poetry==\nThe following are the opening lines of one of his most famous ''musamm\u0101t'':\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062e\u06cc\u0632\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u062e\u0632 \u0622\u0631\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0645 \u062e\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u0627\u062f \u062e\u0646\u06a9 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0627\u0646\u0628 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0632\u0645 \u0648\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0622\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u06af \u0631\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u062e \u0631\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06af\u0648\u06cc\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u064e\u062b\u064e\u0644\u0652 \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0647\u0646 \u0631\u0646\u06af\u0631\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0647\u0642\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u062c\u0628 \u0633\u0631\u0650 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0634\u062a \u06af\u0632\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a}}\n::{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631 \u0686\u0645\u0646 \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u063a \u0646\u0647 \u06af\u064f\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0631}}\n\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|x\u012bz\u012bd-o xaz \u0101<u>r\u012bd</u> ke heng\u0101m-e xaz\u0101n ast}}\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|b\u0101d-e xonok 'az j\u0101neb-e X\u0101<u>razm</u> vaz\u0101n ast}}\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|\u0101n barg-e raz\u0101n b\u012bn ke bar \u0101n \u0161\u0101x-e raz\u0101n ast}}\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|g\u016b'\u012b be masal p\u012brahan-\u0113 <u>rang</u>-raz\u0101n ast}}\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|dehq\u0101n be ta'ajjob sar-an<u>go\u0161t</u>-gaz\u0101n ast}}\n::{{lang|fa-Latn|k-andar \u010daman-\u014d <u>b\u0101q</u> na gol m\u0101nd o na goln\u0101r}}\n\nMetre:\n::\u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 || u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 (3.3.14)\n\n:Get up and bring fur clothes<ref>Clinton translates as \"silk brocade\"; but Kazimirski (p. 321, note on line 14) points out that here the other meaning of \"fur\" is more appropriate.

He is now best remembered for his physical disabilities, and [[War of the Spanish Succession|the war]] for his throne that followed his death.\n\nCharles suffered ill-health throughout his life, and from the moment he succeeded as king at the age of four in 1665, the question of his heir became a major consideration in European politics. Despite marrying twice, he remained childless at his death in 1700. \n\nHe named his heir as 16-year-old [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]], grandson of [[Louis XIV]] and his half-sister, [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]].{{sfn|Kamen|2001|p=25}} This was initially accepted by the [[Dutch Republic]] and [[Kingdom_of_England|England]], but disputes over the division of territories led to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1701.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Las Meninas]]'', by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]; the central figure is Charles' elder sister [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margaret Theresa]]]]\nCharles was the youngest and only survivor of three sons born to [[Philip IV of Spain]], and his second wife, [[Mariana of Austria]]. The Spanish and Austrian [[House_of_Habsburg|Habsburgs]] frequently married each other, to keep their estates in the family. Philip and Mariana were uncle and niece, making Charles their great-nephew and first cousin respectively; all eight of his great-grandparents were descendants of [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]] and [[Philip I of Castile]]. \n\nThe impact of this is not fully understood, and his elder sister [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margaret Theresa]] did not have the same issues. Based on contemporary accounts of his symptoms, he may have suffered from [[PROP1|combined pituitary hormone deficiency]] and distal [[renal tubular acidosis]].{{sfn|Callaway|2013}} If correct, these are indicative of rare genetic disorders, possibly caused by [[Dominance (genetics)|inbreeding]].{{sfn|Alvarez|Ceballos|Celsa|2009|p=4}} \n\nAnother suggestion is they were caused by a [[Herpes_simplex_virus|herpetic infection]] shortly after birth, while his autopsy report is symptomatic of [[hydrocephalus]].{{sfn|Turliuc|2019|pp=76-78}} However, in the absence of genetic material, these remain speculation.{{sfn|Leutenegger|2003|pp=76-83}} Regardless of the cause, Charles suffered from ill-health throughout his life, as well as depression;{{efn|\"His mind, too, was constant prey to a corroding melancholy\".{{sfn|Dunlop|1834|p=73}}}} by the age of six, he had had [[measles]], [[chickenpox]], [[rubella]] and [[smallpox]], any one of which was potentially fatal at the time.{{sfn|Calvo|1998|p=6}} \n\nIn his case, the so-called [[Prognathism#Mandibular prognathism (progenism)|Habsburg lip]] was so pronounced he spoke and ate only with difficulty, and did not learn to talk until the age of four. However, foreign observers such as [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Marquess of Torcy|the Marquess of Torcy]] reported his mental capacities remained intact, and suggested his ailments were exaggerated by his mother to restrict access.{{sfn|Onnekirk, Mijers, Rule|2017|pp=91-108}}\n\n==Background; the decline of Spanish power==\n[[File:Retrato de la reina Mariana de Austria, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mariana of Austria by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], c. 1656; she acted as Regent for much of Charles' reign]]\nWhen Charles became King in 1665, the [[Spanish Empire]] or 'Monarchy' remained an enormous global confederation in terms of territory, but decades of war had ended its supremacy in Europe. The 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]] recognised the independence of the [[Dutch Republic]], and ended the 1618 to 1648 [[Thirty Years War]]. However, Spain was still faced with the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659)|1635-1659 Franco-Spanish War]], and the 1640 to 1668 [[Portuguese_Restoration_War|Portuguese revolt]].{{sfn|Dhondt|2016|p=3}}\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain was a [[personal union]] of the two Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], each with very different political cultures and traditions.{{efn|The Crown of Aragon was divided into the Kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Principality of Catalonia and Marquisate of Malta.}} This made it hard to enact reforms or collect taxes and government finances were in perpetual crisis; the Spanish Crown declared bankruptcy nine times between 1557 and 1666, including 1647, 1652, 1661 and 1666.{{sfn|Cowans|2003|pp=26-27}}\n\nHowever, the 17th century was a [[Little_Ice_Age|period of economic crisis]] for many European states, and Spain was not alone in facing these problems.{{sfn|De Vries|2009|pp=151-194}} Infighting between those who ruled in Charles' name did little to help but it is debatable how far they or he can be held responsible for long-term trends predating his reign; the Monarchy proved remarkably resilient and when Charles died, it remained largely intact.{{sfn|Storrs|2006|pp=6-7}}\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Juan Jose de Austria.jpg|thumb|left|150px|John of Austria; his struggle with Mariana over control of government severely weakened Spain]]\nCharles was three years old when his father, Philip IV, died on 17 September 1665; as a legal minor, his mother Mariana was appointed Queen Regent by the [[Council of Castile]]. Although supposedly ruling in his own name after her death in 1696, his ill-health meant power was often exercised by others. Internal struggles for control further weakened government, the feud between his mother and illegitimate half-brother [[John of Austria the Younger]] being especially damaging.{{sfn|Mitchell|2013|pp=7-9}}\n\nThe system of delegating duties to a personal minister or ''valido'' was established by Philip, when he appointed [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares|the Count-Duke of Olivares]] in 1621. Mariana followed this precedent, her first choice being her Austrian personal confessor, Father [[Juan Everardo Nithard]]; assessments of her competence often reflect contemporary views women were incapable of exercising power on their own.{{sfn|Mitchell|2013|pp=233-234}} \n\nWhen Charles came to the throne, his administration was faced by the long-running [[Portuguese Restoration War]] and the [[War of Devolution]] with France. The Crown declared bankruptcy in 1662 and 1666, and reducing military expenditure a matter of extreme urgency. The 1668 treaties of [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Aix-la-Chapelle]] and [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Lisbon]] ended the war with France, and accepted [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] independence.{{sfn|Barton|2009|p=?}}\n[[File:Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans by Mignard wearing the Fleur-de-lis (showing her dignity as a Grand daughter of France) and the Spanish crown.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Marie Louise of Orl\u00e9ans (1662\u20131689)|Marie Louise of Orl\u00e9ans]], Charles' first wife]]\nSpain was no longer strong enough to retain Portugal against its will, while Aix-la-Chapelle restored most of their losses in the Spanish Netherlands and [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. However, John instigated a revolt in Aragon and Catalonia, compelling Mariana to dismiss Nithard in February 1669 and replace him with [[Fernando de Valenzuela, 1st Marquis of Villasierra|Fernando de Valenzuela]]. Mariana's regency was dissolved when Charles turned became a legal adult in 1675, then restored in 1677 on the basis of his health.{{sfn|Mitchell|2013|pp=265-269}}  \n\nThe 1672 [[Franco-Dutch War]] dragged Spain into another war with France over the Spanish Netherlands, placing additional strain on the economy. When John finally took charge of government in January 1678, his first task was ending it; in the 1678 [[Treaties of Nijmegen]], Spain ceded Franche-Comt\u00e9 and areas of the Spanish Netherlands returned in 1668.{{sfn|Horne|2005|p=168}} Prior to his death in September 1679, he arranged a marriage between Charles, and a 17-year-old French princess, [[Marie Louise of Orl\u00e9ans (1662\u20131689)|Marie Louise of Orl\u00e9ans]]; Mariana returned as Queen Regent but her influence was diminished.\n[[File:Marie-Anne de Neubourg, reine d'Espagne.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Maria-Anna, Charles' pro-Austrian second wife]]\nThe 1683-84 [[War of the Reunions]] with France was followed in 1688 by the [[Nine Years' War]]. Shortly afterwards, Marie Louise died in February 1689; despite allegations she was poisoned, based on the description of her symptoms, modern doctors believe her illness was almost certainly appendicitis.{{efn|In an era when many illnesses were poorly understood, poison was frequently suggested as the cause, particularly since it could rarely be disproved.}} In August, Charles married [[Maria Anna of Neuburg]] by proxy, the formal wedding taking place in May 1690; after his mother died on 16 May 1696, he ruled in his own name, although Maria Anna played a significant role due to his ill-health and her control over access to Charles.{{sfn|Onnekirk, Mijers, Rule|2017|p=97}}\n\nIt was clear Charles' health was finally failing and agreeing a successor became increasingly urgent. The Nine Years' War showed France could not achieve its objectives on its own; the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]] was the result of mutual exhaustion and Louis' search for allies in anticipation of a contest over the Spanish throne. The Habsburg Emperor Leopold initially refused to sign the Treaty since it left this issue unresolved; he reluctantly did so in October 1697 but all sides viewed it as a pause in hostilities.{{sfn|Meerts|2014|p=168}}\n\n==The Succession==\n[[File:Europe c. 1700.png|thumb|right|250px|Europe in 1700]]\nOne of John's last acts was arranging Charles' marriage in 1679 to [[Marie Louise of Orl\u00e9ans (1662\u20131689)|Marie Louise]], eldest daughter of [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]]. The French ambassador wrote '...he is so ugly as to cause fear, and looks ill', but the marriage went ahead regardless. Marie Louise was blamed for the failure to produce an heir, while primitive fertility treatments gave her severe intestinal problems.{{sfn|Garc\u00eda-Escudero L\u00f3pez|2009|p=181}}\n\nThere has been considerable debate as to whether Charles was impotent, and if so, the cause; reports provided by Marie Louise indicate he may have suffered from [[premature ejaculation]]. The suggestion it was the result of inbreeding has not been proved, while a number of scientific studies dispute any linkage between fertility and [[consanguinity]].{{sfn|Bittles, et al|2002|pp=111-130}}   \n[[File:JosephFerdinand.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria.]]\nWhen she died in February 1689, Charles married [[Maria Anna of Neuburg]]; daughter of [[Philip William, Elector Palatine]] and sister-in-law to Emperor Leopold, her family was famous for its fertility. She was no more successful in producing an heir than her predecessor; Charles' autopsy revealed he had only one [[Atrophy|atrophied]] testicle, and he was almost certainly impotent by this stage.{{sfn|Garc\u00eda-Escudero L\u00f3pez|2009|p=182}}\n\nAs the Crown of Spain passed according to [[Primogeniture#Male-preference primogeniture|cognatic primogeniture]], it was possible for a woman, or the descendant of a woman, to inherit the crown. This enabled Charles' sisters [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa (1638\u20131683)]] and [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margaret Theresa (1651\u20131673)]] to pass their rights to the children of their marriages with Louis XIV and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]].\n\nIn 1685, Leopold and Margaret's daughter [[Maria Antonia of Austria|Maria Antonia]] married [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Max Emanuel of Bavaria]]; she died in 1692, leaving one surviving son, [[Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria|Joseph Ferdinand]]. In October 1698, France, Britain and the Dutch Republic attempted to impose a diplomatic solution to the Succession on Spain and Austria, by the [[Treaty of The Hague (1698)|Treaty of the Hague]] or First Partition Treaty. This made Joseph Ferdinand heir to the bulk of the Spanish Monarchy, with France gaining the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and other concessions in Italy plus the modern Basque province of [[Gipuzkoa]]. Leopold's younger son Archduke [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] became ruler of the [[Duchy of Milan]], a possession considered vital to the security of Austria's southern border.{{sfn|Ward|Leathes|2010|p=384}}\n[[File:Recognition of the Duke of Anjou as King of Spain.png|thumb|right|250px|Philip of Anjou is proclaimed Philip V of Spain, 16 November 1700]]\nUnsurprisingly, the Spanish objected to their Empire being divided by foreign powers without consultation, and on 14 November 1698, Charles II made Joseph Ferdinand heir to an ''independent and undivided'' Spanish Monarchy. Maria Anna was appointed Regent during his minority, an announcement allegedly received by the Spanish councillors in silence. Joseph Ferdinand's death in 1699 ended these arrangements.{{sfn|Ward|Leathes|2010|p=385}}\n\nThis left Louis XIV's eldest son, the [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|Grand Dauphin]], as heir to the Spanish throne, which implied  union between Spain and France. In March 1700, France, Britain and the Dutch agreed an [[Treaty of London (1700)|alternative]]; Archduke Charles replaced Joseph Ferdinand, with Spanish possessions in Europe split between France, [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]] and Austria. Charles reacted by altering his will in favour of Archduke Charles, but once again stipulating an undivided and independent Spanish Monarchy.{{sfn|McKay|Scott|1983|pp=54-55}}\n\nMost of the Spanish nobility disliked the Austrians, and Maria Anna, and preferred a French candidate. In September 1700, Charles became ill again; by 28 September he was no longer able to eat, and Portocarrero persuaded him to alter his will in favour of Louis XIV's grandson, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]].{{sfn|Hargreaves-Mawdsley|1979|pp=15-16}} Following his death on 1 November 1700, Philip was proclaimed King of Spain on 16th. Both Britain and the Dutch Republic accepted this, but diplomatic mis-steps by Louis XIV led to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1701.{{sfn|Falkner|2015|p=96}}\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Carlos II 8 escudos 20787.jpg|thumb|120px|Spanish gold coin minted in 1700, the last year of the reign of Charles II]]\nCharles died in Madrid five days before his 39th birthday on 1 November 1700; his autopsy records his body \"did not contain a single drop of blood; his heart was the size of a peppercorn; his lungs corroded; his intestines rotten and gangrenous; he had a single testicle, black as coal, and his head was full of water.\"{{sfn|Gargantilla |2005|p=?}} As suggested previously, these are indicative of [[hydrocephalus]].{{sfn|Turliuc|2019|pp=76-78}}\n\nHis life was memorably summarised by [[John Langdon-Davies]] as follows: \"We are dealing with a man who died of poison two hundred years before he was born.

From the day of his birth, they were waiting for his death.\"{{sfn|Langdon-Davies|1963|p=3}}\n\n==Legacy==\nIn November 1693, Charles issued a [[Royal Decree-Law (Spain)|Royal Decree]], providing sanctuary in [[Spanish Florida]] for escaped slaves from the British colony of [[Colonial_period_of_South_Carolina|South Carolina]]. Despite its relative poverty, Spanish Florida provided protection from storms in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] for Spanish merchant shipping; the decree was intended to bolster its population, while undermining its neighbour, who claimed the Spanish capital of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].{{sfn|Landers|1984|p=298}} The policy was formalised in 1733 by his successor [[Philip_V_of_Spain|Philip V]], and led to the founding in 1738 of [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Santa Teresa de Mose]], first legally sanctioned free black town in the present-day [[United States]].{{sfn|Landers|1984|pp=300-301}}\n\nWhen Charles came to the throne, the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] remained a significant force, but its influence had declined, and the large [[auto-da-f\u00e9]] during his reign were attempts to assert its power. Involvement in the political struggle over his heir led to its downfall; in 1700, the Inquisitor General, [[Baltasar de Mendoza y Sandoval|Balthasar de Mendoza]], Bishop of Segovia, arrested Charles' personal confessor Froil\u00e1n D\u00edaz on a charge of 'bewitching' the King.{{efn|Mendoza was an ally of the pro-Austrian Queen Maria Anna while D\u00edaz was considered pro-French and given Charles' declining health had considerable influence over him.}} When he was found not guilty, Mendoza attempted to arrest those who voted for his acquittal, resulting in the establishment of a Council to investigate the Inquisition; it survived as an institution until 1834 but with little power.{{sfn|Kamen|1965|p=185}}\n \nThe [[Caroline Islands]] and the town of [[Charleroi]] in modern [[Belgium]] were named after him in 1666 and 1686 respectively, {{sfn|Dunford, Lee|1999|p=303}} as was [[Carolina, Puerto Rico]], albeit long after his death in 1857.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n{{War of the Spanish Succession family tree}}\n\n== Heraldry ==\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=100% align=\"center\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccccff;\"|Heraldry of Charles II of Spain\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Royal Coat of Arms of Spain (1580-1668).svg|195px]]\n| [[File:Coat of Arms of Charles II of Spain (1668-1700).svg|195px]]\n| [[File:Coat of Arms of Charles II of Spain as Monarch of Naples and Sicily.svg|195px]]\n| [[File:Coat of Arms of the King of Spain as Monarch of Milan (1580-1700).svg|195px]]\n|-\n| Coat of arms as [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131668)</small>\n| Coat of arms as [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]]<br/><small>(1668\u20131700)</small>\n| Coat of arms as [[List of monarchs of Naples|King of Naples]] & [[List of monarchs of Sicily|Sicily]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131700)</small>\n| Coat of arms as [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131700)</small>\n|-\n| [[File:Lesser Coat of Arms of Charles V of Naples and III of Sicily.svg|center|180px]]\n| [[File:Full Ornamented Coat of Arms of Philip III and Charles V of Naples (1650-1700).svg|center|195px]]\n| [[File:Coat of Arms of Charles II of Spain (Navarre).svg|center|195px]]\n|-\n| Lesser coat of arms as [[List of monarchs of Naples|King of Naples]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131668)</small>\n| Coat of arms as [[List of monarchs of Naples|King of Naples]] & [[List of monarchs of Sicily|Sicily]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131700)</small>\n| Coat of arms as [[List of monarchs of Navarre|King of Navarre]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131700)</small>\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{Ancestors of Charles II of Spain|width=75%|state=expanded}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal|first1=Gonzalo |last1= Alvarez |last2=Ceballos |first2=Francisco |first3=Quintero |last3=Celsa|title=The Role of Inbreeding in the Extinction of a European Royal Dynasty|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=4|issue=4|ref=harv|date=2009|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005174|pmid=19367331|pmc=2664480}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barton|first=Simon |title=A History of Spain|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0230200111 |date=2009|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Bittles, AH |first1=Grant JC |title=Does inbreeding lead to decreased human fertility?

He is now best remembered for his physical disabilities, and [[War of the Spanish Succession|the war]] for his throne that followed his death.\n\nCharles suffered ill-health throughout his life, and from the moment he succeeded as king at the age of four in 1665, the question of his heir became a major consideration in European politics. Despite marrying twice, he remained childless at his death in 1700. \n\nHe named his heir as 16-year-old [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]], grandson of [[Louis XIV]] and his half-sister, [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]].{{sfn|Kamen|2001|p=25}} This was initially accepted by the [[Dutch Republic]] and [[Kingdom_of_England|England]], but disputes over the division of territories led to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1701.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Las Meninas]]'', by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]; the central figure is Charles' elder sister [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margaret Theresa]]]]\nCharles was the youngest and only survivor of three sons born to [[Philip IV of Spain]], and his second wife, [[Mariana of Austria]]. The Spanish and Austrian [[House_of_Habsburg|Habsburgs]] frequently married each other, to keep their estates in the family. Philip and Mariana were uncle and niece, making Charles their great-nephew and first cousin respectively; all eight of his great-grandparents were descendants of [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]] and [[Philip I of Castile]]. \n\nThe impact of this is not fully understood, and his elder sister [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margaret Theresa]] did not have the same issues. Based on contemporary accounts of his symptoms, he may have suffered from [[PROP1|combined pituitary hormone deficiency]] and distal [[renal tubular acidosis]].{{sfn|Callaway|2013}} If correct, these are indicative of rare genetic disorders, possibly caused by [[Dominance (genetics)|inbreeding]].{{sfn|Alvarez|Ceballos|Celsa|2009|p=4}} \n\nAnother suggestion is they were caused by a [[Herpes_simplex_virus|herpetic infection]] shortly after birth, while his autopsy report is symptomatic of [[hydrocephalus]].{{sfn|Turliuc|2019|pp=76-78}} However, in the absence of genetic material, these remain speculation.{{sfn|Leutenegger|2003|pp=76-83}} Regardless of the cause, Charles suffered from ill-health throughout his life, as well as depression;{{efn|\"His mind, too, was constant prey to a corroding melancholy\".{{sfn|Dunlop|1834|p=73}}}} by the age of six, he had had [[measles]], [[chickenpox]], [[rubella]] and [[smallpox]], any one of which was potentially fatal at the time.{{sfn|Calvo|1998|p=6}} \n\nIn his case, the so-called [[Prognathism#Mandibular prognathism (progenism)|Habsburg lip]] was so pronounced he spoke and ate only with difficulty, and did not learn to talk until the age of four. However, foreign observers such as [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Marquess of Torcy|the Marquess of Torcy]] reported his mental capacities remained intact, and suggested his ailments were exaggerated by his mother to restrict access.{{sfn|Onnekirk, Mijers, Rule|2017|pp=91-108}}\n\n==Background; the decline of Spanish power==\n[[File:Retrato de la reina Mariana de Austria, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mariana of Austria by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], c. 1656; she acted as Regent for much of Charles' reign]]\nWhen Charles became King in 1665, the [[Spanish Empire]] or 'Monarchy' remained an enormous global confederation in terms of territory, but decades of war had ended its supremacy in Europe. The 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]] recognised the independence of the [[Dutch Republic]], and ended the 1618 to 1648 [[Thirty Years War]]. However, Spain was still faced with the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659)|1635-1659 Franco-Spanish War]], and the 1640 to 1668 [[Portuguese_Restoration_War|Portuguese revolt]].{{sfn|Dhondt|2016|p=3}}\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain was a [[personal union]] of the two Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], each with very different political cultures and traditions.{{efn|The Crown of Aragon was divided into the Kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Principality of Catalonia and Marquisate of Malta.}} This made it hard to enact reforms or collect taxes and government finances were in perpetual crisis; the Spanish Crown declared bankruptcy nine times between 1557 and 1666, including 1647, 1652, 1661 and 1666.{{sfn|Cowans|2003|pp=26-27}}\n\nHowever, the 17th century was a [[Little_Ice_Age|period of economic crisis]] for many European states, and Spain was not alone in facing these problems.{{sfn|De Vries|2009|pp=151-194}} Infighting between those who ruled in Charles' name did little to help but it is debatable how far they or he can be held responsible for long-term trends predating his reign; the Monarchy proved remarkably resilient and when Charles died, it remained largely intact.{{sfn|Storrs|2006|pp=6-7}}\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Juan Jose de Austria.jpg|thumb|left|150px|John of Austria; his struggle with Mariana over control of government severely weakened Spain]]\nCharles was three years old when his father, Philip IV, died on 17 September 1665; as a legal minor, his mother Mariana was appointed Queen Regent by the [[Council of Castile]]. Although supposedly ruling in his own name after her death in 1696, his ill-health meant power was often exercised by others. Internal struggles for control further weakened government, the feud between his mother and illegitimate half-brother [[John of Austria the Younger]] being especially damaging.{{sfn|Mitchell|2013|pp=7-9}}\n\nThe system of delegating duties to a personal minister or ''valido'' was established by Philip, when he appointed [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares|the Count-Duke of Olivares]] in 1621. Mariana followed this precedent, her first choice being her Austrian personal confessor, Father [[Juan Everardo Nithard]]; assessments of her competence often reflect contemporary views women were incapable of exercising power on their own.{{sfn|Mitchell|2013|pp=233-234}} \n\nWhen Charles came to the throne, his administration was faced by the long-running [[Portuguese Restoration War]] and the [[War of Devolution]] with France. The Crown declared bankruptcy in 1662 and 1666, and reducing military expenditure a matter of extreme urgency. The 1668 treaties of [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Aix-la-Chapelle]] and [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Lisbon]] ended the war with France, and accepted [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] independence.{{sfn|Barton|2009|p=?}}\n[[File:Marie Louise d'Orl\u00e9ans by Mignard wearing the Fleur-de-lis (showing her dignity as a Grand daughter of France) and the Spanish crown.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Marie Louise of Orl\u00e9ans (1662\u20131689)|Marie Louise of Orl\u00e9ans]], Charles' first wife]]\nSpain was no longer strong enough to retain Portugal against its will, while Aix-la-Chapelle restored most of their losses in the Spanish Netherlands and [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. However, John instigated a revolt in Aragon and Catalonia, compelling Mariana to dismiss Nithard in February 1669 and replace him with [[Fernando de Valenzuela, 1st Marquis of Villasierra|Fernando de Valenzuela]]. Mariana's regency was dissolved when Charles turned became a legal adult in 1675, then restored in 1677 on the basis of his health.{{sfn|Mitchell|2013|pp=265-269}}  \n\nThe 1672 [[Franco-Dutch War]] dragged Spain into another war with France over the Spanish Netherlands, placing additional strain on the economy. When John finally took charge of government in January 1678, his first task was ending it; in the 1678 [[Treaties of Nijmegen]], Spain ceded Franche-Comt\u00e9 and areas of the Spanish Netherlands returned in 1668.{{sfn|Horne|2005|p=168}} Prior to his death in September 1679, he arranged a marriage between Charles, and a 17-year-old French princess, [[Marie Louise of Orl\u00e9ans (1662\u20131689)|Marie Louise of Orl\u00e9ans]]; Mariana returned as Queen Regent but her influence was diminished.\n[[File:Marie-Anne de Neubourg, reine d'Espagne.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Maria-Anna, Charles' pro-Austrian second wife]]\nThe 1683-84 [[War of the Reunions]] with France was followed in 1688 by the [[Nine Years' War]]. Shortly afterwards, Marie Louise died in February 1689; despite allegations she was poisoned, based on the description of her symptoms, modern doctors believe her illness was almost certainly appendicitis.{{efn|In an era when many illnesses were poorly understood, poison was frequently suggested as the cause, particularly since it could rarely be disproved.}} In August, Charles married [[Maria Anna of Neuburg]] by proxy, the formal wedding taking place in May 1690; after his mother died on 16 May 1696, he ruled in his own name, although Maria Anna played a significant role due to his ill-health and her control over access to Charles.{{sfn|Onnekirk, Mijers, Rule|2017|p=97}}\n\nIt was clear Charles' health was finally failing and agreeing a successor became increasingly urgent. The Nine Years' War showed France could not achieve its objectives on its own; the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]] was the result of mutual exhaustion and Louis' search for allies in anticipation of a contest over the Spanish throne. The Habsburg Emperor Leopold initially refused to sign the Treaty since it left this issue unresolved; he reluctantly did so in October 1697 but all sides viewed it as a pause in hostilities.{{sfn|Meerts|2014|p=168}}\n\n==The Succession==\n[[File:Europe c. 1700.png|thumb|right|250px|Europe in 1700]]\nOne of John's last acts was arranging Charles' marriage in 1679 to [[Marie Louise of Orl\u00e9ans (1662\u20131689)|Marie Louise]], eldest daughter of [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]]. The French ambassador wrote '...he is so ugly as to cause fear, and looks ill', but the marriage went ahead regardless. Marie Louise was blamed for the failure to produce an heir, while primitive fertility treatments gave her severe intestinal problems.{{sfn|Garc\u00eda-Escudero L\u00f3pez|2009|p=181}}\n\nThere has been considerable debate as to whether Charles was impotent, and if so, the cause; reports provided by Marie Louise indicate he may have suffered from [[premature ejaculation]]. The suggestion it was the result of inbreeding has not been proved, while a number of scientific studies dispute any linkage between fertility and [[consanguinity]].{{sfn|Bittles, et al|2002|pp=111-130}}   \n[[File:JosephFerdinand.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria.]]\nWhen she died in February 1689, Charles married [[Maria Anna of Neuburg]]; daughter of [[Philip William, Elector Palatine]] and sister-in-law to Emperor Leopold, her family was famous for its fertility. She was no more successful in producing an heir than her predecessor; Charles' autopsy revealed he had only one [[Atrophy|atrophied]] testicle, and he was almost certainly impotent by this stage.{{sfn|Garc\u00eda-Escudero L\u00f3pez|2009|p=182}}\n\nAs the Crown of Spain passed according to [[Primogeniture#Male-preference primogeniture|cognatic primogeniture]], it was possible for a woman, or the descendant of a woman, to inherit the crown. This enabled Charles' sisters [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa (1638\u20131683)]] and [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margaret Theresa (1651\u20131673)]] to pass their rights to the children of their marriages with Louis XIV and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]].\n\nIn 1685, Leopold and Margaret's daughter [[Maria Antonia of Austria|Maria Antonia]] married [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Max Emanuel of Bavaria]]; she died in 1692, leaving one surviving son, [[Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria|Joseph Ferdinand]]. In October 1698, France, Britain and the Dutch Republic attempted to impose a diplomatic solution to the Succession on Spain and Austria, by the [[Treaty of The Hague (1698)|Treaty of the Hague]] or First Partition Treaty. This made Joseph Ferdinand heir to the bulk of the Spanish Monarchy, with France gaining the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and other concessions in Italy plus the modern Basque province of [[Gipuzkoa]]. Leopold's younger son Archduke [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] became ruler of the [[Duchy of Milan]], a possession considered vital to the security of Austria's southern border.{{sfn|Ward|Leathes|2010|p=384}}\n[[File:Recognition of the Duke of Anjou as King of Spain.png|thumb|right|250px|Philip of Anjou is proclaimed Philip V of Spain, 16 November 1700]]\nUnsurprisingly, the Spanish objected to their Empire being divided by foreign powers without consultation, and on 14 November 1698, Charles II made Joseph Ferdinand heir to an ''independent and undivided'' Spanish Monarchy. Maria Anna was appointed Regent during his minority, an announcement allegedly received by the Spanish councillors in silence. Joseph Ferdinand's death in 1699 ended these arrangements.{{sfn|Ward|Leathes|2010|p=385}}\n\nThis left Louis XIV's eldest son, the [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|Grand Dauphin]], as heir to the Spanish throne, which implied  union between Spain and France. In March 1700, France, Britain and the Dutch agreed an [[Treaty of London (1700)|alternative]]; Archduke Charles replaced Joseph Ferdinand, with Spanish possessions in Europe split between France, [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]] and Austria. Charles reacted by altering his will in favour of Archduke Charles, but once again stipulating an undivided and independent Spanish Monarchy.{{sfn|McKay|Scott|1983|pp=54-55}}\n\nMost of the Spanish nobility disliked the Austrians, and Maria Anna, and preferred a French candidate. In September 1700, Charles became ill again; by 28 September he was no longer able to eat, and Portocarrero persuaded him to alter his will in favour of Louis XIV's grandson, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]].{{sfn|Hargreaves-Mawdsley|1979|pp=15-16}} Following his death on 1 November 1700, Philip was proclaimed King of Spain on 16th. Both Britain and the Dutch Republic accepted this, but diplomatic mis-steps by Louis XIV led to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1701.{{sfn|Falkner|2015|p=96}}\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Carlos II 8 escudos 20787.jpg|thumb|120px|Spanish gold coin minted in 1700, the last year of the reign of Charles II]]\nCharles died in Madrid five days before his 39th birthday on 1 November 1700; his autopsy records his body \"did not contain a single drop of blood; his heart was the size of a peppercorn; his lungs corroded; his intestines rotten and gangrenous; he had a single testicle, black as coal, and his head was full of water.\"{{sfn|Gargantilla |2005|p=?}} As suggested previously, these are indicative of [[hydrocephalus]].{{sfn|Turliuc|2019|pp=76-78}}\n\nHis life was memorably summarised by [[John Langdon-Davies]] as follows: \"If birth is a beginning, of no man is it more true to say that in his beginning was his end. From the day of his birth, they were waiting for his death.\"{{sfn|Langdon-Davies|1963|p=3}}\n\n==Legacy==\nIn November 1693, Charles issued a [[Royal Decree-Law (Spain)|Royal Decree]], providing sanctuary in [[Spanish Florida]] for escaped slaves from the British colony of [[Colonial_period_of_South_Carolina|South Carolina]]. Despite its relative poverty, Spanish Florida provided protection from storms in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] for Spanish merchant shipping; the decree was intended to bolster its population, while undermining its neighbour, who claimed the Spanish capital of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].{{sfn|Landers|1984|p=298}} The policy was formalised in 1733 by his successor [[Philip_V_of_Spain|Philip V]], and led to the founding in 1738 of [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Santa Teresa de Mose]], first legally sanctioned free black town in the present-day [[United States]].{{sfn|Landers|1984|pp=300-301}}\n\nWhen Charles came to the throne, the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] remained a significant force, but its influence had declined, and the large [[auto-da-f\u00e9]] during his reign were attempts to assert its power. Involvement in the political struggle over his heir led to its downfall; in 1700, the Inquisitor General, [[Baltasar de Mendoza y Sandoval|Balthasar de Mendoza]], Bishop of Segovia, arrested Charles' personal confessor Froil\u00e1n D\u00edaz on a charge of 'bewitching' the King.{{efn|Mendoza was an ally of the pro-Austrian Queen Maria Anna while D\u00edaz was considered pro-French and given Charles' declining health had considerable influence over him.}} When he was found not guilty, Mendoza attempted to arrest those who voted for his acquittal, resulting in the establishment of a Council to investigate the Inquisition; it survived as an institution until 1834 but with little power.{{sfn|Kamen|1965|p=185}}\n \nThe [[Caroline Islands]] and the town of [[Charleroi]] in modern [[Belgium]] were named after him in 1666 and 1686 respectively, {{sfn|Dunford, Lee|1999|p=303}} as was [[Carolina, Puerto Rico]], albeit long after his death in 1857.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n{{War of the Spanish Succession family tree}}\n\n== Heraldry ==\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=100% align=\"center\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccccff;\"|Heraldry of Charles II of Spain\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Royal Coat of Arms of Spain (1580-1668).svg|195px]]\n| [[File:Coat of Arms of Charles II of Spain (1668-1700).svg|195px]]\n| [[File:Coat of Arms of Charles II of Spain as Monarch of Naples and Sicily.svg|195px]]\n| [[File:Coat of Arms of the King of Spain as Monarch of Milan (1580-1700).svg|195px]]\n|-\n| Coat of arms as [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131668)</small>\n| Coat of arms as [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]]<br/><small>(1668\u20131700)</small>\n| Coat of arms as [[List of monarchs of Naples|King of Naples]] & [[List of monarchs of Sicily|Sicily]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131700)</small>\n| Coat of arms as [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131700)</small>\n|-\n| [[File:Lesser Coat of Arms of Charles V of Naples and III of Sicily.svg|center|180px]]\n| [[File:Full Ornamented Coat of Arms of Philip III and Charles V of Naples (1650-1700).svg|center|195px]]\n| [[File:Coat of Arms of Charles II of Spain (Navarre).svg|center|195px]]\n|-\n| Lesser coat of arms as [[List of monarchs of Naples|King of Naples]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131668)</small>\n| Coat of arms as [[List of monarchs of Naples|King of Naples]] & [[List of monarchs of Sicily|Sicily]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131700)</small>\n| Coat of arms as [[List of monarchs of Navarre|King of Navarre]]<br/><small>(1665\u20131700)</small>\n|-\n|}\n|}\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{Ancestors of Charles II of Spain|width=75%|state=expanded}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal|first1=Gonzalo |last1= Alvarez |last2=Ceballos |first2=Francisco |first3=Quintero |last3=Celsa|title=The Role of Inbreeding in the Extinction of a European Royal Dynasty|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=4|issue=4|ref=harv|date=2009|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005174|pmid=19367331|pmc=2664480}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barton|first=Simon |title=A History of Spain|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0230200111 |date=2009|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Bittles, AH |first1=Grant JC |title=Does inbreeding lead to decreased human fertility?
