She spent most of her early life travelling because of her father's work. Her parents lived in Thailand before she was born, but after her mother became pregnant they moved back to Italy. She spent a couple of years there until moving to [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and then [[Key West]], Florida. She spent her early school years in the United States, but her parents thought it would be better for Boscono to study in Italy and reconnect with her Italian heritage. This did not last very long though: at 9 years old Boscono and her family moved to Kenya, living in a village between [[Malindi]] and [[Mombasa]]. Boscono described her years in Kenya as \"the most fantastic in her life\".\n\n== Modeling career ==\nBoscono was discovered at 17, during a dinner with a family friend who happened to be a photographer. The friend and Boscono's mother encouraged her to begin a modeling career, but Boscono chose to finish school first. Soon after graduating high school she flew to New York City, signed with DNA Model Management. Her first runways were in 1997 for [[Laura Biagiotti]] and [[Alberta Ferretti]], continuingn later [[90s]] for italian and international stylists like Gai Mattiolo, [[Rocco Barocco]], [[Fausto Sarli]], [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], [[Issey Miyake]], [[Vivienne Westwood]], [[Guy Laroche]].

She spent most of her early life travelling because of her father's work. Her parents lived in Thailand before she was born, but after her mother became pregnant they moved back to Italy. She spent a couple of years there until moving to [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and then [[Key West]], Florida. She spent her early school years in the United States, but her parents thought it would be better for Boscono to study in Italy and reconnect with her Italian heritage. This did not last very long though: at 9 years old Boscono and her family moved to Kenya, living in a village between [[Malindi]] and [[Mombasa]]. Boscono described her years in Kenya as \"the most fantastic in her life\".\n\n== Modeling career ==\nBoscono was discovered at 17, during a dinner with a family friend who happened to be a photographer. The friend and Boscono's mother encouraged her to begin a modeling career, but Boscono chose to finish school first. Soon after graduating high school she flew to New York City, signed with DNA Model Management. Her first runways were in 1997 for [[Laura Biagiotti]] and [[Alberta Ferretti]], continuingn later [[90s]] for italian and international stylists like Gai Mattiolo, [[Rocco Barocco]], [[Fausto Sarli]], [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], [[Issey Miyake]], [[Vivienne Westwood]], [[Guy Laroche]]. Boscono was noted by [[Karl Lagerfeld]], becoming one of the favourite models of the stylist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iodonna.it/personaggi/interviste-gallery/2017/10/05/mariacarla-boscono-festeggia-20-anni-di-carriera/|title=Mariacarla Boscono festeggia 20 anni di carriera|last=Villa|first=Martina|date=2017-10-05|website=iO Donna|language=it-IT|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.it/magazine/people-in-vogue/2010/03/mariacarla-in-vogue|title=Mariacarla Boscono - Vogue.it|website=www.vogue.it|language=it|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> It did not take long for Boscono to rise as an internationally known model, being featured on the cover of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' several times and walking in many high fashion runway shows of the first years of [[00s (decade)|00s]] for [[Armani Exchange|Armani]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]], [[Escada]], [[Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9]], [[Alessandro Dell'Acqua]] [[Michael Kors]] and [[Alberta Ferretti]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://models.com/work/armani-exchange-armani-exchange-fw-2001|title=Armani Exchange F/W 2001 (Armani Exchange)|website=MODELS.com|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://italian-models.blogspot.com/2012/04/escada-spring-2003-mariacarla-karen-and.html|title=Modelle Italiane,: Escada Spring 2003: Mariacarla, Karen and Liya by Steven Meisel|last=Milena|date=2012-04-15|website=Modelle Italiane,|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.it/detail/fotografie-di-cronaca/mariacarla-boscono-attends-michael-kors-fashion-fotografie-di-cronaca/658735312|title=Mariacarla Boscono attends Michael Kors fashion show at the tents...|website=Getty Images|language=it|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> \n\nDuring the 2005 season, Boscono walked in over seventy fashion shows between [[New York City]], [[Milan]] and [[Paris]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.donnaglamour.it/chi-e-mariacarla-boscono-altezza-eta-e-curiosita-sulla-modella/curiosita/|title=Mariacarla Boscono: dalla conquista delle passerelle, alla storia con Ghali|date=2020-02-05|website=Donna Glamour|language=it-IT|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> She was named spokesperson for [[H&M]] in 2005, replacing [[Kate Moss]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.it/magazine/people-in-vogue/2010/03/mariacarla-in-vogue|title=Mariacarla Boscono - Vogue.it|website=www.vogue.it|language=it|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> and during 2006's Fall Fashion Week she traded in her long dark locks for a short platinum blonde hairstyle reminiscent of [[Jean Seberg]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alamy.it/foto-immagine-modello-mariacarla-boscono-molto-breve-capelli-biondi-indossa-oro-minidress-sequinned-slash-il-collo-e-la-prua-su-un-lato-le-paillettes-43820434.html|title=Modello Mariacarla Boscono molto breve capelli biondi indossa oro minidress sequinned slash il collo e la prua su un lato le paillettes Foto & Immagine Stock: 43820434|last=Limited|first=Alamy|website=Alamy|language=it|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> Boscono was absent from the runways for both the Fall/Winter 2007 and Spring/Summer 2007 seasons. {{As of|2008}}, Boscono made her return to the runways in Paris at the Fall/Winter 2008 Couture collection for [[Dior]] and she was the sole face of [[Emilio Pucci]], [[Herm\u00e8s]], [[John Galliano]], and [[Moschino]] ad campaigns and walked for brands like [[Gucci]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]], [[Fendi]], [[Versace]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], and [[Jean Paul Gaultier]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lei.excite.it/foto/dolce-gabbana-springsummer-2009-la-campagna-P8082-0-dolce-gabbana-campagna-primavera-estate-2009.html|title=Dolce & Gabbana Spring/Summer 2009: la campagna|website=Excite|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> In November 2008, she signed a contract for the new Moschino's fragrance \"Glamour\", photographed by [[Patrick Demarchelier]] and she becomes the new face of the Dolce & Gabbana Spring/Summer 2009 advertising campaign with Brazilian model [[Caroline Trentini]] and American model [[Karlie Kloss]].

In September [[Bulgaria]] signed a treaty of alliance with Germany and quickly mobilized its army. <ref>hall 2014, p 162</ref> On 6 October 1915, combined [[Germany in WWI|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] forces under the command of [[August von Mackensen|Field Marshall August von Mackensen]] attacked Serbia from the north and west with the intention of drawing the bulk of the Serbian forces along the [[Sava]] and [[Danube]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn 11 October, without any previous declaration of war, the Bulgarian started making attacks on Serbian border positions;  then on 14 October Bulgaria finally declared war on Serbia, the First and Second Armies under the command of [[Kliment Boyadzhiev|General Boyadzhiev]], advanced into the Timok region of northeastern Serbia<ref name=\":8\" /> with the mission of cutting the vital rail line that ran from Salonika, up the Vardar and Morava River valleys, and depriving Serbia of reinforcements and artillery ammunition.<ref name=\":6\">Sanders 2016, p. 248</ref> Numbering nearly 300,000 men, the forces of Bulgaria quickly overwhelmed the weak Serbian units along the frontier.<ref name=\":8\">Buttar 2015, p.341</ref> The Serbian Army had 250,000 men of which a large number were already battling 300,000 Germans and Austrians in the north.

Nevertheless, only two options, retreat, and counter-attack were seriously considered, while the third one, capitulation, was not an option on the table; the Serbian government led by Prime Minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]], [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Prince Regent Alexander]] and the Supreme Command under Field Marshall Radomir Putnik made the decision to order a general withdrawal and fight on from exile.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe only possible avenue of escape lay to the southwest and northwest, over the towering [[Korab|Korab and Prokletije mountain ranges]] of [[Albania]] and Montenegro, part of the [[Dinaric Alps]], a region of which the mean altitude is over {{convert|6,000|feet|meters}} as the snow began to fall. The Serbian Government planned to reorganise and reform the army with the help and support from the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. \n\nOn 23 November, Vojvoda Putnik ordered all Serbian forces to use the last of the artillery ammunition, then bury the cannon, taking breechblocks and sights with them; if burying the guns was impossible, they were to be rendered useless.<ref name=\":6\" />  \n\nOn 25 November 1915, an official order of retreat addressed to the commanders of all armies, was published by the Serbian High Command: \n\n{{Quote/sandbox|text=The only way out of this grave situation is a retreat to the Adriatic coast.

The worst fate befell the Southern Column, where approximately 43,000 young boys that would have become conscripts in 1916 had been taken by the Army to join the retreat; within a month approximately 36,000 of them died.<ref>Reader's Digest, 2000</ref>\n\nOf the estimated 220,000 civilian refugees who had set off for the Adriatic coast from [[Kosovo region|Kosovo]], only about 60,000 survived. Those who survived were so weak that thousands of them died from sheer exhaustion in the weeks after their rescue. Because the rock composition of the island made it hard to dig graves, those who died on the journey were buried at sea. Bodies were lowered from French ships into the depths of the [[Ionian Sea]], near the Greek island of [[Vido]]; more than 5,000 Serbs are believed to have been buried this way.

The series first aired on [[TV Tokyo]] on April 1, 2007 and ended on September 30, 2007, with 26 episodes.\n\nOn July 23, 2007, a manga adaptation began serialization in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Magazine Z]]''. Though the story is the same, it is told from the point of view of [[#Humans_.28Iron_Tribe.29|Iolaous]]. Five official guidebooks were also published and had consecutive monthly releases from July to November 2007.\n\n==Premise==\nThe story's theme is based on stories in [[Greek mythology]], especially those surrounding [[Heracles]], upon whom the main character is based, and his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labors]]. Many of the other characters are also based on Greek mythological figures; characters share similar names to their Greek counterparts, and how their relationship is defined with others correspond with Greek stories. The title of the series, ''Heroic Age'', is also a slight testament to the similarities to Greek mythology, referring to the time of the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]]. The tribes featured in the anime are loosely based on [[Hesiod]]'s [[Ages of Man#Hesiod's Five Ages|Five Ages of Mankind]].\n\n==Storyline==\n{{See also|List of Heroic Age characters}}\n[[File:Golden Tribe.jpg|thumb|right|The Golden Tribe watching the universe.]]\n\nThe show is set in a futuristic universe, controlled by a few races or \"tribes\" that possess the capabilities for interstellar travel. The universe had once been ruled by a \"Golden Tribe\" (\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf ''Ougon no Shuzoku''), who had since left the current galaxy long ago; they passed on their knowledge to the humanoid {{nihongo|\"Silver Tribe\"|\u9280\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf|Gin no Shuzoku}}, the insectoid {{nihongo|\"Bronze Tribe\"|\u9752\u9285\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf|Seidou no Shuzoku}}, and the gigantic {{nihongo|\"Heroic Tribe\"|\u82f1\u96c4\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf|Eiyuu no Shuzoku}}. The latter was later punished by the Golden Tribe for causing havoc in the universe and made to serve the other tribes as {{nihongo|'Nodos'|\u30ce\u30c9\u30b9|Nodosu}} - extremely powerful beings that play a key role in the story. Before the Golden Tribe departed, Humanity answered the call of the Golden Tribe and was dubbed the {{nihongo|\"Iron Tribe\"|\u9244\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf|Tetsu no Shuzoku}}. Viewed as a threat to the order of things, the Silver Tribe decided to annihilate the Iron Tribe with the aid of the Bronze Tribe. However, humanity survived their assault on Earth and scattered their numbers across the stars in order to preserve their race.\n\nThe story follows the voyages of the starship ''Argonaut'' and its crew to find a means to bring peace to the universe. The ship carries the young human clairvoyant princess Dhianeila, who is on a mission to find the mythical savior of the human race. This savior is expected to aid humanity in their war against the Silver and Bronze tribes, who are bent on humanity's extermination.\n\nInitially, the expedition finds a child-hearted boy called Age on a partially destroyed planet. When the ''Argonaut'' is attacked by the Bronze tribe, Age is shown to transform into a \"Nodos\" form, Bellcross, a gigantic and immensely powerful being. He easily fends off the superior attacking force. Having found their messiah, the ''Argonaut'' starts its way back to Dhianeila's home-world, Duey. During their journey home, the Silver Tribe launches several attacks on the Argonaut to prevent the ship from returning to their home-world, but Age always managed to stop them.\n\nDuring the many attacks on the ''Argonaut'' the crew begins to warm up to Age, they had been fearful of his powers as a Nodos. The silver tribesman Phaetho O assigns himself the role of \"testing\" Age, destroying the ''Argonaut'' and all the iron tribe on it. After Age drives Phaetho O away and saves his tribe they all begin to accept him. Iolaous Oz Mehelim of the Yunos knights is jealous of Age but warms up to him after the attack on Titarros. Once they escape the battle against Phaetho O at Titarros the ''Argonaut'' crew arrives near the Cemetery belt where they are again attacked by Phaetho O and the bronze tribe accompanying him, here Age fights another Nodos whom had visited him on Titattos. During the fight the ''Argonaut'' manages to escape however in order to do so Age had to stay behind to fight. The ''Argonaut'' warps to what they think is an unoccupied place and end up running into stragglers from the bronze tribe, rather than fight they attempt to run only to be cornered by an enormous fleet. the fleet is also iron tribe, after saving the ''Argonaut'' that fleet accompanies them and they leave to help Age.\n\nAfter reaching back to Duey, word had spread throughout humanity of the Argonaut's success and Dhianeila's brothers used the momentum to successfully convince humanity to launch a counter-offensive against the Silver and Bronze tribes. With humanity united under the Junos family, the Silver Tribe throws the full might of their forces along with their 4 Nodos's to destroy humanity. As the fighting intensifies, the humans move towards the Golden Tribes' old home world.  At the last moment, contact is made both between the Silver tribe, humanity, and the Nodos of each side. Dhianeila brings the Silver tribe to accept a ceasefire and Age is shown to be the \"key\" to opening a portal to the universe into which the Golden tribe has moved.\n\nWhen this portal is opened, the Silver tribe moves on to this other universe and passes all of its knowledge to humanity, including the ability to control the Bronze Tribe. However, during the battle, Age is missing after he opened the gateway; some believed he died in the process, while others believed he'll return one day. Honoring Age's wish, Dhianeila dedicated the next few years of her life to restore Age's home planet.\n\nFour years later, Humanity has now brought order throughout the universe. With the Silver's Tribe's technology, humanity had advanced further and rebuilt Earth. Dhianeila and the Argonaut's team has succeeded in restoring Age's home, but through it all, she missed Age the most. Just as she was about to leave the only planet that gives her some comfort, the Golden Tribe's gateway opened and revealed that Age was alive, and he and Dhianeila were reunited.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main|List of Heroic Age episodes}}\nThe television series was produced by [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]], KlockWorx and [[Xebec]] and directed by Takashi Noto and Toshimasa Suzuki, with Tow Ubukata handling series composition, [[Hisashi Hirai]] designing the characters and [[Naoki Sat\u014d]] composing the music.

The series first aired on [[TV Tokyo]] on April 1, 2007 and ended on September 30, 2007, with 26 episodes.\n\nOn July 23, 2007, a manga adaptation began serialization in [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Magazine Z]]''. Though the story is the same, it is told from the point of view of [[#Humans_.28Iron_Tribe.29|Iolaous]]. Five official guidebooks were also published and had consecutive monthly releases from July to November 2007.\n\n==Premise==\nThe story's theme is based on stories in [[Greek mythology]], especially those surrounding [[Heracles]], upon whom the main character is based, and his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labors]]. Many of the other characters are also based on Greek mythological figures; characters share similar names to their Greek counterparts, and how their relationship is defined with others correspond with Greek stories. The title of the series, ''Heroic Age'', is also a slight testament to the similarities to Greek mythology, referring to the time of the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]]. The tribes featured in the anime are loosely based on [[Hesiod]]'s [[Ages of Man#Hesiod's Five Ages|Five Ages of Mankind]].\n\n==Storyline==\n{{See also|List of Heroic Age characters}}\n[[File:Golden Tribe.jpg|thumb|right|The Golden Tribe watching the universe.]]\n\nThe show is set in a futuristic universe, controlled by a few races or \"tribes\" that possess the capabilities for interstellar travel. The universe had once been ruled by a \"Golden Tribe\" (\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf ''Ougon no Shuzoku''), who had since left the current galaxy long ago; they passed on their knowledge to the humanoid {{nihongo|\"Silver Tribe\"|\u9280\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf|Gin no Shuzoku}}, the insectoid {{nihongo|\"Bronze Tribe\"|\u9752\u9285\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf|Seidou no Shuzoku}}, and the gigantic {{nihongo|\"Heroic Tribe\"|\u82f1\u96c4\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf|Eiyuu no Shuzoku}}. The latter was later punished by the Golden Tribe for causing havoc in the universe and made to serve the other tribes as {{nihongo|'Nodos'|\u30ce\u30c9\u30b9|Nodosu}} - extremely powerful beings that play a key role in the story. Before the Golden Tribe departed, Humanity answered the call of the Golden Tribe and was dubbed the {{nihongo|\"Iron Tribe\"|\u9244\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf|Tetsu no Shuzoku}}. Viewed as a threat to the order of things, the Silver Tribe decided to annihilate the Iron Tribe with the aid of the Bronze Tribe. However, humanity survived their assault on Earth and scattered their numbers across the stars in order to preserve their race.\n\nThe story follows the voyages of the starship ''Argonaut'' and its crew to find a means to bring peace to the universe. The ship carries the young human clairvoyant princess Dhianeila, who is on a mission to find the mythical savior of the human race. This savior is expected to aid humanity in their war against the Silver and Bronze tribes, who are bent on humanity's extermination.\n\nInitially, the expedition finds a child-hearted boy called Age on a partially destroyed planet. When the ''Argonaut'' is attacked by the Bronze tribe, Age is shown to transform into a \"Nodos\" form, Bellcross, a gigantic and immensely powerful being. He easily fends off the superior attacking force. Having found their messiah, the ''Argonaut'' starts its way back to Dhianeila's home-world, Duey. During their journey home, the Silver Tribe launches several attacks on the Argonaut to prevent the ship from returning to their home-world, but Age always managed to stop them.\n\nDuring the many attacks on the ''Argonaut'' the crew begins to warm up to Age, they had been fearful of his powers as a Nodos. The silver tribesman Phaetho O assigns himself the role of \"testing\" Age, destroying the ''Argonaut'' and all the iron tribe on it. After Age drives Phaetho O away and saves his tribe they all begin to accept him. Iolaous Oz Mehelim of the Yunos knights is jealous of Age but warms up to him after the attack on Titarros. Once they escape the battle against Phaetho O at Titarros the ''Argonaut'' crew arrives near the Cemetery belt where they are again attacked by Phaetho O and the bronze tribe accompanying him, here Age fights another Nodos whom had visited him on Titattos. During the fight the ''Argonaut'' manages to escape however in order to do so Age had to stay behind to fight. The ''Argonaut'' warps to what they think is an unoccupied place and end up running into stragglers from the bronze tribe, rather than fight they attempt to run only to be cornered by an enormous fleet. the fleet is also iron tribe, after saving the ''Argonaut'' that fleet accompanies them and they leave to help Age.\n\nAfter reaching back to Duey, word had spread throughout humanity of the Argonaut's success and Dhianeila's brothers used the momentum to successfully convince humanity to launch a counter-offensive against the Silver and Bronze tribes. With humanity united under the Junos family, the Silver Tribe throws the full might of their forces along with their 4 Nodos's to destroy humanity. As the fighting intensifies, the humans move towards the Golden Tribes' old home world.  At the last moment, contact is made both between the Silver tribe, humanity, and the Nodos of each side. Dhianeila brings the Silver tribe to accept a ceasefire and Age is shown to be the \"key\" to opening a portal to the universe into which the Golden tribe has moved.\n\nWhen this portal is opened, the Silver tribe moves on to this other universe and passes all of its knowledge to humanity, including the ability to control the Bronze Tribe. However, during the battle, Age is missing after he opened the gateway; some believed he died in the process, while others believed he'll return one day. Honoring Age's wish, Dhianeila dedicated the next few years of her life to restore Age's home planet.\n\nFour years later, Humanity has now brought order throughout the universe. With the Silver's Tribe's technology, humanity had advanced further and rebuilt Earth. Dhianeila and the Argonaut's team has succeeded in restoring Age's home, but through it all, she missed Age the most. Just as she was about to leave the only planet that gives her some comfort, the Golden Tribe's gateway opened and revealed that Age was alive, and he and Dhianeila were reunited.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main|List of Heroic Age episodes}}\nThe television series was produced by [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]], KlockWorx and [[Xebec]] and directed by Takashi Noto and Toshimasa Suzuki, with Tow Ubukata handling series composition, [[Hisashi Hirai]] designing the characters and [[Naoki Sat\u014d]] composing the music.

Kamiyama ([[Kanata Hong\u014d]]) is an outwardly, friendly and popular boy who hides his potentially sociopathic nature with a carefree, happy attitude. Loner Morino ([[Rin Takanashi]]), on the other hand, does little to hide her strange nature; she never smiles, does not interact with her classmates, and wears a long-sleeved, black school uniform even during the middle of summer. While these two seem to share little in common and do not interact with each other in front of their peers, their shared interest in death and murder has turned them into an unusual duo. Initially happy to exchange books on morbid subjects, a series of recent murders spark their interest and they begin investigating the killer. This serial killer has a fondness for cheerful young women and, after severing their left hand as a trophy, displays their dead bodies in public locations to be discovered. After Morino discovers the killer's notebook in a local caf\u00e9, the two use it to see the corpses for themselves before discovery and attempt to discern his identity. {{Why|reason=It is unclear why a plot summary of the movie is included here.

Kamiyama ([[Kanata Hong\u014d]]) is an outwardly, friendly and popular boy who hides his potentially sociopathic nature with a carefree, happy attitude. Loner Morino ([[Rin Takanashi]]), on the other hand, does little to hide her strange nature; she never smiles, does not interact with her classmates, and wears a long-sleeved, black school uniform even during the middle of summer. While these two seem to share little in common and do not interact with each other in front of their peers, their shared interest in death and murder has turned them into an unusual duo. Initially happy to exchange books on morbid subjects, a series of recent murders spark their interest and they begin investigating the killer. This serial killer has a fondness for cheerful young women and, after severing their left hand as a trophy, displays their dead bodies in public locations to be discovered. After Morino discovers the killer\u2019s notebook in a local caf\u00e9, the two use it to see the corpses for themselves before discovery and attempt to discern his identity. {{Why|reason=It is unclear why a plot summary of the movie is included here.

[[National Development and Reform Commission#National Energy Administration|National Energy Administration]] statistics showed 39 percent of wind capacity in 2015 in Jiuquan was wasted.<ref name=nyt/>\n\nAs of 2017, Gansu is far from full capacity and the wind farm is producing less than half of its full potential. The two main reasons why this is happening is that Gansu is located far from the major Chinese cities and that there is a lack of demand for wind energy in China.<ref name=nyt>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/15/world/asia/china-gansu-wind-farm.html|title=It Can Power a Small Nation.

However, this location is about a thousand miles from China\u2019s high density port cities that would serve as the biggest consumer of this energy.<ref name=nyt/>\nThere is a lack of enough infrastructure and transmission lines that would allow the energy to flow into the cities.\nThere is still also little demand for wind power in China compared to coal. Although China\u2019s central government is actively trying to reduce its emissions and build its clean energy sector, the local governments still push coal on their local industries because it creates more economic output and because the coal is mined locally, which helps local coal companies.<ref name=nyt/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|China|Weather|Renewable energy|Energy}}}}\n* [[List of largest power stations]]\n* [[List of onshore wind farms]]\n* [[List of power stations in China]]\n* [[Megaproject]]\n* [[Wind power in China]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Wind power in China}}\n\n[[Category:Wind farms in China]]\n[[Category:Engineering projects]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDemand and utilization:clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu_Wind_Farm"}
