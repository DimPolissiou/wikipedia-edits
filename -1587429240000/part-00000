Academically trained in his native country and in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], he investigated in particular the [[Slavic influence on Romanian]] and the origins of [[Romanian literature]], with additional interests in [[Old East Slavic]] and [[Russian literature]]. He was a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy|Romanian]] and [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Serbian Academies]], and helped establish a [[Slavic studies]] department at the [[University of Ia\u0219i]]. B\u0103rbulescu was nevertheless a controversial figure, deeply involved in academic rivalries, and taking up unpopular political stances\u2014especially [[Romania in World War I|during World War I]], when, contrary to his background in Slavistics, he took up \"[[Germanophilia]]\", rooting for the [[Central Powers]].\n\nPublished by ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00eeneasc\u0103]]'' and ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', B\u0103rbulescu's political essays caused public outrage by questioning the motives of [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalists]]. He was largely silent after [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|declared war on the Central Powers]], but returned to prominence after her [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|surrender in April 1918]]. With a Germanophile triumph apparent, he was elected dean, became editor of the newspaper ''Ia\u0219iul'', and served for several months as a Conservative in the [[Senate of Romania]]. He was demoted, and narrowly escaped being laid off, following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice of November]]. B\u0103rbulescu returned to his research, for which he was rewarded with a membership in the [[Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences|Czech Society]]; he was nevertheless defeated in his bid to become a full member of the Romanian Academy, attributing this failure to political resentments and a [[Freemasonry in Romania|Masonic]] conspiracy.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early decades===\nBorn in [[Bucharest]], B\u0103rbulescu attended Cantemir Vod\u0103 Gymnasium and [[Saint Sava National College]] in his native city. After graduating in 1891, B\u0103rbulescu entered the [[University of Bucharest]], earning a degree in history in 1895.<ref name=\"maftei\">Ionel Maftei, ''Personalit\u0103\u021bi ie\u0219ene: Omagiu'', pp. 38\u201339.

He took a doctorate from Zagreb in 1899, with a specialty in Slavic languages.<ref name=\"maftei\"/><ref>Boia (2010), p. 167</ref> From 1900 to 1905, he was deputy director of the [[National Archives of Romania|State Archives]] in Bucharest, publishing a number of studies, including: ''Cercet\u0103ri istorico-filologice'' (\"Historical and Philological Research\", 1900), ''Studii privitoare la limba \u0219i istoria rom\u00e2nilor'' (\"Research into Romanian Language and History\", 1902), ''Vechile rela\u021bii ale Principatelor Rom\u00e2ne cu Croa\u021bia'' (\"Ancient Relations between the [[Romanian Principalities]] and [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Croatia]]\", 1903).<ref name=\"maftei\"/> These were followed in 1904 by ''Fonetica alfabetului cirilic \u00een textele rom\u00e2ne din sec. al XVI-lea \u0219i al XVII-lea'' (\"Phonetics of [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Romanian Cyrillic]] in 15th- and 16th-century Texts\", an expanded version of his doctoral thesis),<ref>Ilie B\u0103rbulescu, ''Fonetica alfabetului cirilic \u00een textele rom\u00e2ne din sec. al XVI-lea \u0219i al XVII-lea'', p. vii.

Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1998.  {{ISBN|973-21-0562-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905, he played an important role in the creation of a Slavic languages department at the [[University of Ia\u0219i]]. As seen by historian Radu M\u00e2rza, he was ambitious and vain, desirous of academic promotion, and determined to eclipse his former professor, [[Ioan Bogdan (historian)|Ioan Bogdan]], who held a similar post at Bucharest. (The latter always denied he was in competition with his former student.)<ref>M\u00e2rza, pp. 633, 634</ref> B\u0103rbulescu's objective was to secure a far more prestigious job than the one he held at the archive. He had failed to obtain a position teaching old [[Romanian literature]] at Bucharest, and Bogdan had not offered his assistance. B\u0103rbulescu then turned his attention to [[Ia\u0219i]], probably having been informed that discussion about a new department was underway.<ref>M\u00e2rza, p. 634</ref> Around that time, as a distinguished member of the local Conservative club, he also replaced the defunct [[Spiru Prasin]] at the helm of ''[[Evenimentul]]'' newspaper. Being overwhelmed by his scholarly work, he failed to maintain its profile, and he was later replaced by Emil Severin, in turn replaced by Rudolf \u0218u\u021bu.<ref>Dafin, pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nFollowing administrative procedures, B\u0103rbulescu was named substitute professor in the new department as of October 1905.<ref>M\u00e2rza, p. 635</ref> His courses, noted for their systematic approach and clarity, focused on [[Old East Slavic]] and the history of [[Medieval Bulgarian literature]] and [[Russian literature]]. He also lectured on the past and present culture of the Slavic peoples, the origin and geographic distribution of their languages.<ref name=\"maftei\"/> On this basis, he took a [[Serbophilia|Serbophile]] position on the issue of [[Greater Bulgaria]], arguing that [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] were the same as [[Serbs]]. In his 1905 brochure, ''Rom\u00e2nii fa\u021b\u0103 de s\u00e2rbi \u0219i bulgari, mai ales cu privire la chestie macedo-rom\u00e2n\u0103'' (\"The Romanians ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' the Serbs and Bulgarians, with Special Reference to the [[Aromanians|Macedo-Romanian Issue]]\"), he suggested that Bulgarian propaganda was working \"shrewdly\" against the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]\u2014[[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], he assessed, made claims that did not hold true, and confounded Westerners regarding the opportunistic nature of her intentions in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].<ref>Stoica Lascu, \"Geopolitic\u0103 regional\u0103 \u2013 Dobrogea de Sud \u00een contextul anului 1913.

He taught in the department, part of the literature faculty, for the remainder of his career.<ref name=\"maftei\"/> In 1908, he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]].<ref>Boia (2010), p. 167; Nastas\u0103 (2011), p. 477</ref> He had been given honorary membership in the Hellenic-Latin Society of Rome (1902), and was also enlisted by Serbia's Press Association (1909).<ref name=\"maftei\"/> In 1914, he became a corresponding member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Royal Serbian Academy]]. The invitation to join, signed by [[Stojan Novakovi\u0107]], [[Ljubomir Stojanovi\u0107]] and [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], was sent to him and to Bogdan in January, with the stipulation that they return an autobiography. B\u0103rbulescu quickly did so, while Bogdan delayed until the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|outbreak of World War I]] intervened.<ref>[[Gheorghe Mih\u0103il\u0103]], \"Ioan Bogdan \u0219i Ilie B\u0103rbulescu, membri coresponden\u021bi ai Academiei S\u00eerbe\", in ''Romanoslavica'', Vol. XIV, 1967, pp. 472-473</ref>\n\n===Germanophile triumph and defeat===\nDespite his high status in Serbia, at home B\u0103rbulescu sided with the \"[[Germanophile]]s\", opposing [[Romania in World War I|Romania's entry into the war]]. As early as July 1914, Ia\u0219i's ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00eeneasc\u0103]]'' hosted an essay supporting the policies of [[Austria-Hungary]]: ''Gre\u0219elile curentului politic anti-austriac de la rom\u00e2ni'' (\"Mistakes of the Anti-Austrian Current among the Romanians\"); it argued that Austria was predatory, and that the Romanians from the [[Duchy of Bukovina]] lived under  comparatively liberal regime.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 100, 167</ref> On September 15, B\u0103rbulescu appeared alongside [[Constantin Stere]] and [[Paul Bujor]] at a university rally which hoped to gather support for the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. B\u0103rbulescu sabotaged this endeavor, discussing the [[Central Powers]] as a bulwark against the \"[[Pan-Slavism|Slavic peril]]\".<ref>Boia (2010), p. 118</ref>\n\nImpressed with his work, the Germanophile editors of ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'' employed him as a regular contributor to 1916, and he also published, more selectively, in ''[[Bukarester Tagblatt]]''. These contributions, written in a characteristically pedantic style, show him as a believer in the survival of [[House of Lorraine|Austria's ruling house]], who advised Bukovinans and [[Transylvania]]s to seek autonomy rather than [[Greater Romania|unification with Romania]]; a war against the Central Powers, he argued, would mean destruction for the Romanian state.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 167\u2013168</ref> \"Entirely tactless\",<ref>Boia (2010), p. 356</ref> B\u0103rbulescu also stated the contentious claim that Austrian citizens studying in Romania were \"cowards\" who had fled active service and were seeking to \"grow fat\" in the still-neutral country. The enraged members of this community protested against him at university.<ref name=\"lb168\">Boia (2010), p. 168</ref>\n\nB\u0103rbulescu was entirely absent from political life as Romania [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|rallied with the Entente]], and remained silent for almost the remainder of World War I.<ref name=\"lb168\"/> In March 1918, with [[Battle of Bucharest|Bucharest under occupation]] and Ia\u0219i as a provisional capital, history seemed to be confirming his worries. On March 1, as most of the pro-Entente staff had left the city, the Germanophiles elected him dean of the Faculty of Letters.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 168, 356</ref> In April, ahead of the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Romanian surrender]], and with the rump country headed by [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], B\u0103rbulescu and [[Constantin Meissner]] were editing the Conservative newspaper ''Ia\u0219iul''. Their assistant and art director was the draftsman [[Nicolae Tonitza]], who complained that B\u0103rbulescu was a disciplinarian, impossible to work with.<ref>Boia (2010), p. 322</ref>\n\nB\u0103rbulescu remained there until June, during which interval he also ran as a Conservative in the [[1918 Romanian general election|legislative elections]]. He took a seat in [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] ([[Ia\u0219i County]] Second College), and used his speaking time to attack the Ententist policies of past governments. He also caused an enduring controversy by depicting the [[Battle of Transylvania]] as an undignified way to wage war.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 168, 356\u2013357</ref> According to his Ententist colleague [[Nicolae Iorga]], he \"simply made himself look like a fool.\"<ref>Iorga, p. 26</ref> In October 1918, although the Entente had [[Vardar Offensive|resumed its offensive]], Germanophile [[Alexandru Philippide]] unrealistically proposed that B\u0103rbulescu be made a full member of the Academy.<ref>Boia (2010), p. 279; Iorga, p. 83</ref> The same month, as he toured [[Bessarabia]], he was reportedly \"beaten to a pulp\" by the Transylvanian refugees he found there.<ref>Iorga, p. 98</ref>\n\nHe served as dean into 1919, by which time the Central Powers [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|had been defeated]]. By March, the pro-Entente camp, led by [[Orest Tafrali]], had resumed control of the Faculty, and was reviewing B\u0103rbulescu's activities, to ascertain whether or not they constituted treason. B\u0103rbulescu appeared before the review board to apologize for his remarks in Senate, and the university considered the matter settled.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 356\u2013357. See also Iorga, p. 177</ref> With Philippide, [[Dimitrie Gusti]], [[Traian Bratu]], [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]] and [[Ion Petrovici]], he signed a letter of protest against attempts to curb freedom of thought, and warned about the dangers of \"anarchy\".<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2011), pp. 103, 129, 158</ref> Nevertheless, [[Constantin Angelescu]], the [[Ministry of National Education (Romania)|Education Minister]], asked [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]] to use his prerogative, and, on March 19, B\u0103rbulescu lost his deanship, which went to Gusti. The decree asserting this referred to his \"anti-national sentiments\".<ref>Boia (2010), p. 357</ref> Tafrali then focused on getting B\u0103rbulescu banned from teaching, but his attempts were blocked by other academics, including the moderate Germanophiles (Gusti, Philippide, Bratu, Ibr\u0103ileanu).<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 357\u2013358; Boto\u0219ineanu, pp. 223\u2013224</ref> The matter was left undecided, then forgotten.<ref name=\"lb357\u20138\">Boia (2010), pp. 357\u2013358</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nB\u0103rbulescu returned to his research soon after that scandal, publishing ''Curentele literare la rom\u00e2ni \u00een perioada slavismului cultural'' (\"Literary Currents among the Romanians in the Era of Cultural Slavism\", 1928), ''Individualitatea limbii rom\u00e2ne \u0219i elementele slave vechi'' (\"The Individual Character of the Romanian Language and Old Slavic Elements\", 1929), as well as university-level courses on Slavic languages, Romanian Cyrillic, the grammar of [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Bulgarian]], the history of early Bulgarian language and literature, and the history of modern Russian literature.<ref name=\"maftei\"/> From 1921 to 1940, when it ceased publication, B\u0103rbulescu headed ''Arhiva'', the journal of Ia\u0219i's historical and philological society, which had been established by [[A. D. Xenopol]]. There, he published studies, articles, reviews and notes on history and philology, defended his ideas and published articles written by young colleagues from Ia\u0219i.<ref name=\"maftei\"/> As noted by the memorist Ioan Dafin, B\u0103rbulescu was again unable to build on his predecessors' work, turning ''Arhiva'' into his \"personal review\", albeit one of \"cultural prestige\".<ref>Dafin, pp. 226\u2013227</ref> He also contributed to ''Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie \u0219i Filologie'', an academic journal which only survived to 1922.<ref name=\"maftei\"/>\n\nDuring the early 1920s, B\u0103rbulescu and Petrovici reconciled with Tafrali and broke with Gusti, who was now the leader of a left-wing cell in academia; they were especially focused on blocking the academic advancement of Gusti's favorite, [[Garabet Aslan]].<ref>Boto\u0219ineanu, pp. 224, 226, 229</ref> In 1930, B\u0103rbulescu was unanimously voted in to serve his second term as a dean, indicating that the teaching staff no longer considered him \"anti-national\", nor cared about his 1918 politics.<ref name=\"lb357\u20138\"/> However, he revisited and defended his wartime activity in the 1932 polemic ''C\u00e2teva pagini de istorie contemporan\u0103'' (\"A Few Pages of Contemporary History\")\u2014as noted by historian [[Lucian Boia]], this \"detailed and erudite\" text only cemented his colleagues' enmity toward him.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 168, 357</ref> In the mid 1920s, with the Conservative Party dissolved, he had joined the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]].<ref>Boto\u0219ineanu, p. 223</ref> Alongside [[Petre P.

The motion was defeated with opposition from [[Mihail Sadoveanu]]\u2014B\u0103rbulescu later claimed that this was a personal quarrel, between Sadoveanu and other [[Freemasonry in Romania|Freemasons]], on one hand, and himself, on the other.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2011), p. 477</ref> He retired from teaching in 1938, officially because he had reached the age limit, but in fact due to maneuvers by a group of professors centered around Sadoveanu's associate [[Iorgu Iordan]].<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2010), p. 417</ref> B\u0103rbulescu was a wealthy man: he resided in a lavish house in Ia\u0219i and had received a comfortable hotel in [[Sinaia]] as part of his wife's dowry.

Bucharest: Tipografia Universitar\u0103, 1904</ref> and in 1906 by ''Problemele capitale ale slavisticei la rom\u00e2ni'' (\"Key Issues in [[Slavic influence on Romanian|Romanian Slavistics]]\").<ref name=\"maftei\"/> Some of his voluminous essays were also taken up by the magazine ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.<ref>[[Z. Ornea]], ''Junimea \u0219i junimismul'', Vol. I, p. 120. Bucharest: [[Editura Minerva]], 1998.  {{ISBN|973-21-0562-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905, he played an important role in the creation of a Slavic languages department at the [[University of Ia\u0219i]]. As seen by historian Radu M\u00e2rza, he was ambitious and vain, desirous of academic promotion, and determined to eclipse his former professor, [[Ioan Bogdan]], who held a similar post at Bucharest. (The latter always denied he was in competition with his former student.)<ref>M\u00e2rza, pp. 633, 634</ref> B\u0103rbulescu's objective was to secure a far more prestigious job than the one he held at the archive. He had failed to obtain a position teaching old [[Romanian literature]] at Bucharest, and Bogdan had not offered his assistance. B\u0103rbulescu then turned his attention to [[Ia\u0219i]], probably having been informed that discussion about a new department was underway.<ref>M\u00e2rza, p. 634</ref> Around that time, as a distinguished member of the local Conservative club, he also replaced the defunct [[Spiru Prasin]] at the helm of ''[[Evenimentul]]'' newspaper. Being overwhelmed by his scholarly work, he failed to maintain its profile, and he was later replaced by Emil Severin, in turn replaced by Rudolf \u0218u\u021bu.<ref>Dafin, pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nFollowing administrative procedures, B\u0103rbulescu was named substitute professor in the new department as of October 1905.<ref>M\u00e2rza, p. 635</ref> His courses, noted for their systematic approach and clarity, focused on [[Old East Slavic]] and the history of [[Medieval Bulgarian literature]] and [[Russian literature]]. He also lectured on the past and present culture of the Slavic peoples, the origin and geographic distribution of their languages.<ref name=\"maftei\"/> On this basis, he took a [[Serbophilia|Serbophile]] position on the issue of [[Greater Bulgaria]], arguing that [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] were the same as [[Serbs]]. In his 1905 brochure, ''Rom\u00e2nii fa\u021b\u0103 de s\u00e2rbi \u0219i bulgari, mai ales cu privire la chestie macedo-rom\u00e2n\u0103'' (\"The Romanians ''vis-\u00e0-vis'' the Serbs and Bulgarians, with Special Reference to the [[Aromanians|Macedo-Romanian Issue]]\"), he suggested that Bulgarian propaganda was working \"shrewdly\" against the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]\u2014[[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], he assessed, made claims that did not hold true, and confounded Westerners regarding the opportunistic nature of her intentions in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].<ref>Stoica Lascu, \"Geopolitic\u0103 regional\u0103 \u2013 Dobrogea de Sud \u00een contextul anului 1913. M\u0103rturii de epoc\u0103\", in ''Analele Universit\u0103\u021bii Ovidius'', Vol. 4, 2007, p. 80</ref>\n\nB\u0103rbulescu rose to full professor in November 1909, the first such professor of Slavistics at Ia\u0219i. He taught in the department, part of the literature faculty, for the remainder of his career.<ref name=\"maftei\"/> In 1908, he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]].<ref>Boia (2010), p. 167; Nastas\u0103 (2011), p. 477</ref> He had been given honorary membership in the Hellenic-Latin Society of Rome (1902), and was also enlisted by Serbia's Press Association (1909).<ref name=\"maftei\"/> In 1914, he became a corresponding member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Royal Serbian Academy]]. The invitation to join, signed by [[Stojan Novakovi\u0107]], [[Ljubomir Stojanovi\u0107]] and [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], was sent to him and to Bogdan in January, with the stipulation that they return an autobiography. B\u0103rbulescu quickly did so, while Bogdan delayed until the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|outbreak of World War I]] intervened.<ref>[[Gheorghe Mih\u0103il\u0103]], \"Ioan Bogdan \u0219i Ilie B\u0103rbulescu, membri coresponden\u021bi ai Academiei S\u00eerbe\", in ''Romanoslavica'', Vol. XIV, 1967, pp. 472-473</ref>\n\n===Germanophile triumph and defeat===\nDespite his high status in Serbia, at home B\u0103rbulescu sided with the \"[[Germanophile]]s\", opposing [[Romania in World War I|Romania's entry into the war]]. As early as July 1914, Ia\u0219i's ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00eeneasc\u0103]]'' hosted an essay supporting the policies of [[Austria-Hungary]]: ''Gre\u0219elile curentului politic anti-austriac de la rom\u00e2ni'' (\"Mistakes of the Anti-Austrian Current among the Romanians\"); it argued that Austria was predatory, and that the Romanians from the [[Duchy of Bukovina]] lived under  comparatively liberal regime.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 100, 167</ref> On September 15, B\u0103rbulescu appeared alongside [[Constantin Stere]] and [[Paul Bujor]] at a university rally which hoped to gather support for the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. B\u0103rbulescu sabotaged this endeavor, discussing the [[Central Powers]] as a bulwark against the \"[[Pan-Slavism|Slavic peril]]\".<ref>Boia (2010), p. 118</ref>\n\nImpressed with his work, the Germanophile editors of ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'' employed him as a regular contributor to 1916, and he also published, more selectively, in ''[[Bukarester Tagblatt]]''. These contributions, written in a characteristically pedantic style, show him as a believer in the survival of [[House of Lorraine|Austria's ruling house]], who advised Bukovinans and [[Transylvania]]s to seek autonomy rather than [[Greater Romania|unification with Romania]]; a war against the Central Powers, he argued, would mean destruction for the Romanian state.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 167\u2013168</ref> \"Entirely tactless\",<ref>Boia (2010), p. 356</ref> B\u0103rbulescu also stated the contentious claim that Austrian citizens studying in Romania were \"cowards\" who had fled active service and were seeking to \"grow fat\" in the still-neutral country. The enraged members of this community protested against him at university.<ref name=\"lb168\">Boia (2010), p. 168</ref>\n\nB\u0103rbulescu was entirely absent from political life as Romania [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|rallied with the Entente]], and remained silent for almost the remainder of World War I.<ref name=\"lb168\"/> In March 1918, with [[Battle of Bucharest|Bucharest under occupation]] and Ia\u0219i as a provisional capital, history seemed to be confirming his worries. On March 1, as most of the pro-Entente staff had left the city, the Germanophiles elected him dean of the Faculty of Letters.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 168, 356</ref> In April, ahead of the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Romanian surrender]], and with the rump country headed by [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], B\u0103rbulescu and [[Constantin Meissner]] were editing the Conservative newspaper ''Ia\u0219iul''. Their assistant and art director was the draftsman [[Nicolae Tonitza]], who complained that B\u0103rbulescu was a disciplinarian, impossible to work with.<ref>Boia (2010), p. 322</ref>\n\nB\u0103rbulescu remained there until June, during which interval he also ran as a Conservative in the [[1918 Romanian general election|legislative elections]]. He took a seat in [[Senate of Romania|Senate]] ([[Ia\u0219i County]] Second College), and used his speaking time to attack the Ententist policies of past governments. He also caused an enduring controversy by depicting the [[Battle of Transylvania]] as an undignified way to wage war.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 168, 356\u2013357</ref> According to his Ententist colleague [[Nicolae Iorga]], he \"simply made himself look like a fool.\"<ref>Iorga, p. 26</ref> In October 1918, although the Entente had [[Vardar Offensive|resumed its offensive]], Germanophile [[Alexandru Philippide]] unrealistically proposed that B\u0103rbulescu be made a full member of the Academy.<ref>Boia (2010), p. 279; Iorga, p. 83</ref> The same month, as he toured [[Bessarabia]], he was reportedly \"beaten to a pulp\" by the Transylvanian refugees he found there.<ref>Iorga, p. 98</ref>\n\nHe served as dean into 1919, by which time the Central Powers [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|had been defeated]]. By March, the pro-Entente camp, led by [[Orest Tafrali]], had resumed control of the Faculty, and was reviewing B\u0103rbulescu's activities, to ascertain whether or not they constituted treason. B\u0103rbulescu appeared before the review board to apologize for his remarks in Senate, and the university considered the matter settled.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 356\u2013357. See also Iorga, p. 177</ref> With Philippide, [[Dimitrie Gusti]], [[Traian Bratu]], [[Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu]] and [[Ion Petrovici]], he signed a letter of protest against attempts to curb freedom of thought, and warned about the dangers of \"anarchy\".<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2011), pp. 103, 129, 158</ref> Nevertheless, [[Constantin Angelescu]], the [[Ministry of National Education (Romania)|Education Minister]], asked [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]] to use his prerogative, and, on March 19, B\u0103rbulescu lost his deanship, which went to Gusti. The decree asserting this referred to his \"anti-national sentiments\".<ref>Boia (2010), p. 357</ref> Tafrali then focused on getting B\u0103rbulescu banned from teaching, but his attempts were blocked by other academics, including the moderate Germanophiles (Gusti, Philippide, Bratu, Ibr\u0103ileanu).<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 357\u2013358; Boto\u0219ineanu, pp. 223\u2013224</ref> The matter was left undecided, then forgotten.<ref name=\"lb357\u20138\">Boia (2010), pp. 357\u2013358</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nB\u0103rbulescu returned to his research soon after that scandal, publishing ''Curentele literare la rom\u00e2ni \u00een perioada slavismului cultural'' (\"Literary Currents among the Romanians in the Era of Cultural Slavism\", 1928), ''Individualitatea limbii rom\u00e2ne \u0219i elementele slave vechi'' (\"The Individual Character of the Romanian Language and Old Slavic Elements\", 1929), as well as university-level courses on Slavic languages, Romanian Cyrillic, the grammar of [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Bulgarian]], the history of early Bulgarian language and literature, and the history of modern Russian literature.<ref name=\"maftei\"/> From 1921 to 1940, when it ceased publication, B\u0103rbulescu headed ''Arhiva'', the journal of Ia\u0219i's historical and philological society, which had been established by [[A. D. Xenopol]]. There, he published studies, articles, reviews and notes on history and philology, defended his ideas and published articles written by young colleagues from Ia\u0219i.<ref name=\"maftei\"/> As noted by the memorist Ioan Dafin, B\u0103rbulescu was again unable to build on his predecessors' work, turning ''Arhiva'' into his \"personal review\", albeit one of \"cultural prestige\".<ref>Dafin, pp. 226\u2013227</ref> He also contributed to ''Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie \u0219i Filologie'', an academic journal which only survived to 1922.<ref name=\"maftei\"/>\n\nDuring the early 1920s, B\u0103rbulescu and Petrovici reconciled with Tafrali and broke with Gusti, who was now the leader of a left-wing cell in academia; they were especially focused on blocking the academic advancement of Gusti's favorite, [[Garabet Aslan]].<ref>Boto\u0219ineanu, pp. 224, 226, 229</ref> In 1930, B\u0103rbulescu was unanimously voted in to serve his second term as a dean, indicating that the teaching staff no longer considered him \"anti-national\", nor cared about his 1918 politics.<ref name=\"lb357\u20138\"/> However, he revisited and defended his wartime activity in the 1932 polemic ''C\u00e2teva pagini de istorie contemporan\u0103'' (\"A Few Pages of Contemporary History\")\u2014as noted by historian [[Lucian Boia]], this \"detailed and erudite\" text only cemented his colleagues' enmity toward him.<ref>Boia (2010), pp. 168, 357</ref> In the mid 1920s, with the Conservative Party dissolved, he had joined the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]].<ref>Boto\u0219ineanu, p. 223</ref> Alongside [[Petre P. Negulescu]], he was one of its prominent cadres recruited from academia, and remained so to 1938.<ref>[[Lucian Boia]], ''Capcanele istoriei.

The motion was defeated with opposition from [[Mihail Sadoveanu]]\u2014B\u0103rbulescu later claimed that this was a personal quarrel, between Sadoveanu and other [[Freemasonry in Romania|Freemasons]], on one hand, and himself, on the other.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2011), p. 477</ref> He retired from teaching in 1938, officially because he had reached the age limit, but in fact due to maneuvers by a group of professors centered around Sadoveanu's associate [[Iorgu Iordan]].<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2010), p. 417</ref> B\u0103rbulescu was a wealthy man: he resided in a lavish house in Ia\u0219i and had received a comfortable hotel in [[Sinaia]] as part of his wife's dowry.

Building of the palace began in 1515 for Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]], a [[favourite]] of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. In 1529, as Wolsey fell from favour, the cardinal gave the palace to the king to check his disgrace. The palace went on to become one of Henry's most favoured residences; soon after acquiring the property, he arranged for it to be enlarged so that it might more easily accommodate his sizeable retinue of courtiers. Along with [[St James' Palace]], it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many the king owned. The palace is currently in the possession of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[the Crown]].  Elizabeth is also a fat n0nce.\n\nIn the following century, [[William III of England|King William III]]'s massive rebuilding and expansion work, which was intended to rival the [[Palace of Versailles]], destroyed much of the Tudor palace.<ref name=\"Dynes, P90\">Dynes, p. 90.</ref> His work ceased in 1694, leaving the palace in two distinct contrasting architectural styles, domestic [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] and [[Baroque]]. While the palace's styles are an accident of fate, a unity exists due to the use of pink bricks and a symmetrical, if vague, balancing of successive low wings.<ref name=\"Dynes, P86\">Dynes, p. 86.</ref> [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] was the last monarch to reside in the palace.\n\nToday, the palace is open to the public and a major tourist attraction, easily reached by train from [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] in central London and served by [[Hampton Court railway station]] in [[East Molesey]], in [[Transport for London]]'s Zone 6. In addition, London Buses routes [[London Buses route 111|111]], 216, 411 and R68 stop outside the palace gates. The structure and grounds are cared for by an independent charity, [[Historic Royal Palaces]], which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/aboutus/whoweare/default.aspx |title=Who we are |publisher=Historic Royal Palaces |accessdate=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901223028/http://www.hrp.org.uk/aboutus/whoweare/default.aspx |archivedate=1 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In addition, the palace displays many works of art from the [[Royal Collection]].\n\nApart from the Palace itself and its gardens, other points of interest for visitors include the [[Hampton Court Maze|celebrated maze]], the historic [[royal tennis]] court (see below), and the huge [[Vitis vinifera|grape vine]], the largest in the world {{As of|2005|lc=y}}.

The first courtyard, the Base Court,<ref>\"Base\" in this instance simply means \"lower\" in the hierarchy of courtyards; it is not topographically lower.</ref> (''B on plan''), was his creation, as was the second, inner gatehouse (''C'') which leads to the Clock Court (''D'') (Wolsey's seal remains visible over the entrance arch of the clock tower<ref name=arch>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22207 Spelthorne Hundred: Hampton Court Palace: architectural description, ''A History of the County of Middle sex'', Volume 2]: General; Ashford, East Bedfont with Hatton, Feltham, Hampton with Hampton Wick, Hanworth, Laleham, Littleton (1911), pp. 371\u2013379.

The historian [[Jonathan Foyle]] has suggested<ref>{{cite web|author = Foyle, Jonathan | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/hampton_court_01.shtml |title=Hampton Court: The Lost Palace |publisher= BBC |date= 29 March 2011 |accessdate= 12 July 2011| author-link=Jonathan Foyle }}</ref> that it is likely that Wolsey had been inspired by Paolo Cortese's ''De Cardinalatu'', a manual for cardinals that included advice on palatial architecture, published in 1510. The architectural historian Sir [[John Summerson]] asserts that the palace shows \"the essence of Wolsey\u2014the plain English churchman who nevertheless made his sovereign the arbiter of Europe and who built and furnished Hampton Court to show foreign embassies that Henry VIII's chief minister knew how to live as graciously as any cardinal in Rome.\"<ref name=\"Summerson, P14\">Summerson, p. 14.</ref> Whatever the concepts were, the architecture is an excellent and rare example of a thirty-year era when English architecture was in a harmonious transition from domestic Tudor, strongly influenced by [[perpendicular Gothic]], to the Italian Renaissance classical style. Perpendicular Gothic owed nothing historically to the Renaissance style, yet harmonised well with it.<ref name=\"Copplestone, P254\">Copplestone, p. 254.</ref> This blending of styles was realised by a small group of Italian craftsmen working at the English court in the second and third decades of the sixteenth century. They specialised in the adding of Renaissance ornament to otherwise straightforward Tudor buildings.<ref name=\"Copplestone, P254\"/> It was one of these, [[Giovanni da Maiano]], who was responsible for the set of eight [[relief]] busts of Roman emperors which were set in the Tudor brickwork.<ref>Copplestone, p. 257.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hampton Court.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne Boleyn]]'s Gate. The Tudor gatehouse and astronomical clock, made for [[Henry VIII]] in 1540 (''C on plan above'') Two of the Renaissance [[bas relief]]s by [[Giovanni da Maiano]] can be seen set into the brickwork.]]\nWolsey was only to enjoy his palace for a few years.<ref name=\"Summerson, P14\"/> In 1528, knowing that his enemies and the King were engineering his downfall, he passed the palace to the King as a gift.

Few of these were large enough to hold the assembled court, and thus one of the first of the King's building works (in order to transform Hampton Court to a principal residence) was to build the vast kitchens. These were quadrupled in size in 1529, enabling the King to provide [[bouche of court]] for his entire court.<ref>Thurley, p. 8.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historyhamptonc04lawgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyhamptonc04lawgoog/page/n212 150]|quote=Bouche of court.|title=The History of Hampton Court Palace|last=Law|first=Ernest Philip Alphonse|date=1890-01-01|publisher=George Bell and Sons|language=en}}</ref> The architecture of King Henry's new palace followed the design precedent set by Wolsey: perpendicular Gothic-inspired Tudor with restrained Renaissance ornament. This hybrid architecture was to remain almost unchanged for nearly a century, until [[Inigo Jones]] introduced strong classical influences from Italy to the London palaces of the first Stuart kings.\n\nBetween 1532 and 1535 Henry added the Great Hall (the last medieval [[great hall]] built for the English monarchy) and the [[Royal Tennis Court, Hampton Court|Royal Tennis Court]].<ref>This court is still in use for the game of [[real tennis]], an older version different from the present game. It is now the oldest extant real tennis court.</ref> The Great Hall has a carved [[hammer-beam]] roof. During Tudor times, this was the most important room of the palace; here, the King would dine in state seated at a table upon a raised [[dais]].<ref>Summerson, p. 21.</ref> The hall took five years to complete; so impatient was the King for completion that the masons were compelled to work throughout the night by candlelight.<ref name=\"Williams, P52\"/>\n\nThe gatehouse to the second, inner court was adorned in 1540 with the [[Hampton Court astronomical clock]], an early example of a pre-[[Copernicus|Copernican]] [[astronomical clock]]. Still functioning, the clock shows the time of day, the phases of the moon, the month, the quarter of the year, the date, the sun and star sign, and [[high water]] at [[London Bridge]].<ref>Thurley, p. 18.</ref> The latter information was of great importance to those visiting this Thames-side palace from London, as the preferred method of transport at the time was by barge, and at low water [[London Bridge]] created dangerous rapids. This gatehouse is also known today as [[Anne Boleyn]]'s gate, after Henry's second wife. Work was still underway on Anne Boleyn's apartments above the gate when Boleyn was beheaded.<ref>Williams, p. 53.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hampton-Court-D.jpg|thumb|left|Henry VIII's first building project at Hampton Court created vast kitchens capable of feeding his court of 1,000 people.]]\n[[File:Hearth.jpg|thumb|left|An original Tudor roasting hearth in the Great Kitchens at Hampton Court Palace, Richmond upon Thames, Greater London.]]During the Tudor period, the palace was the scene of many historic events. In 1537, the King's much desired male heir, the future [[Edward VI]], was born at the palace and the child's mother, [[Jane Seymour]], died there two weeks later.<ref name=\"Thurley, p. 9\">Thurley, p. 9.</ref> Four years afterwards, whilst attending [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the palace's chapel, the King was informed of the adultery of his fifth wife, [[Catherine Howard]]. She was then confined to her room for a few days before being sent to Syon House and then on to the Tower of London. Legend claims she briefly escaped her guards and ran through The Haunted Gallery to beg Henry for her life but she was recaptured.<ref name=\"Thurley, P23\">Thurley, p. 23.</ref>\n\nKing Henry died in January 1547 and was succeeded first by his son Edward VI, and then by both his daughters in turn. It was to Hampton Court that [[Queen Mary I]] (Henry's elder daughter) retreated with [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]] to spend her honeymoon, after their wedding at [[Winchester]].<ref name=\"Williams, P52\">Williams, p. 52.</ref> Mary chose Hampton Court as the place for the birth of her first child, which turned out to be the first of two [[phantom pregnancies]]. Mary had initially wanted to give birth at [[Windsor Castle]] as it was a more secure location, and she was still fearful of rebellion. But Hampton Court was considerably larger, and could accommodate the entire court and more besides. Mary stayed at the Palace awaiting the birth of the \"child\" for over five months, and only left because of the inhabitable state of the court being kept in the one location for so long, after which her court departed for the much smaller palace of Oatlands. Mary was succeeded by her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I]], and it was Elizabeth who had the eastern kitchen built; today, this is the palace's public tea room.<ref name=\"Thurley, p. 9\"/>\n\n===Stuart times===\n[[File:HamptonCurt.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher Wren]]'s south front (''G on plan'') built for [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] viewed from the Privy Garden.]]\nOn the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, the Tudor period came to an end. The Queen was succeeded by her first cousin-twice-removed, the Scottish King, James VI, who became known in England as [[James I of England|James I]] of the [[House of Stuart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ww.encyclopediavirginia.org/James_VI_and_I_1566-1625#start_entry|title=James VI and I (1566\u20131625)|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1604, the palace was the site of King James' meeting with representatives of the English [[Puritans]], known as the [[Hampton Court Conference]]; while agreement with the Puritans was not reached, the meeting led to James's commissioning of the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]].<ref name=\"Thurley, P10\">Thurley, p. 10.</ref>\n\nKing James was succeeded in 1625 by his son, the ill-fated [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Hampton Court was to become both his palace and his prison.<ref name=\"Thurley, P10\"/> It was also the setting for his honeymoon with his fifteen-year-old bride, [[Henrietta Maria]] in 1625.<ref name=\"Williams, P52\"/> Following King Charles' execution in 1649, the palace became the property of the Commonwealth presided over by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Unlike some other former royal properties, the palace escaped relatively unscathed. While the government auctioned much of the contents, the building was ignored.<ref>Thurley, p. 11.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his successor [[James II]] visited Hampton Court but largely preferred to reside elsewhere. By current French court standards Hampton Court now appeared old-fashioned. It was in 1689, shortly after Louis XIV's court had moved permanently to [[Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles|Versailles]], that the palace's antiquated state was addressed. England had joint monarchs, [[William III of England|William III]] and his wife, [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]. Within months of their accession they embarked on a massive rebuilding project at Hampton Court. The intention was to demolish the Tudor palace a section at a time, while replacing it with a huge modern palace in the Baroque style retaining only Henry VIII's Great Hall.<ref name=\"Summerson, P16\">Summerson, p. 16.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hampton Court Palace, Great Hall - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The ceiling of the Great Hall of Hampton Court Palace.]]The country's most eminent architect, [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], was called upon to draw the plans, while the master of works was to be [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]]. The plan was for a vast palace constructed around two courtyards at right angles to each other. Wren's design for a domed palace bore resemblances to the work of [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] and [[Louis Le Vau]], both architects employed by Louis XIV at Versailles.<ref name=\"Summerson, P16\" /> It has been suggested, though, that the plans were abandoned because the resemblance to Versailles was too subtle and not strong enough; at this time, it was impossible for any sovereign to visualise a palace that did not emulate Versailles' repetitive Baroque form.<ref>This is the stated opinion of Sir John Summerson. Summerson, p. 19.</ref> However, the resemblances are there: while the fa\u00e7ades are not so long as those of Versailles, they have similar, seemingly unstoppable repetitive rhythms beneath a long flat skyline. The monotony is even repeated as the fa\u00e7ade turns the corner from the east to the south fronts. However, Hampton Court, unlike Versailles, is given an extra dimension by the contrast between the pink brick and the pale [[Portland stone]] quoins, frames and banding.<ref name=\"Dynes, P95\">Dynes, p. 95.</ref> Further diversion is added by the circular and decorated windows of the second floor mezzanine. This theme is repeated in the inner Fountain Court, but the rhythm is faster and the windows, unpedimented on the outer fa\u00e7ades, are given pointed pediments in the courtyard; this has led the courtyard to be described as \"Startling, as of simultaneous exposure to a great many eyes with raised eyebrows.\"<ref name=\"Summerson, P19\">Summerson, p. 19.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hampton-Court-E.jpg|thumb|The Fountain Court designed by Sir Christopher Wren (''E on plan''): \"Startling, as of simultaneous exposure to a great many eyes with raised eyebrows.\"<ref name=\"Summerson, P19\" />]]\nDuring this work, half the Tudor palace was replaced and Henry VIII's state rooms and private apartments were both lost; the new wings around the Fountain Court contained new state apartments and private rooms, one set for the King and one for the Queen. Each suite of state rooms was accessed by a state staircase. The royal suites were of completely equal value in order to reflect William and Mary's unique status as joint sovereigns.<ref name=\"Williams, p. 54\">Williams, p. 54.</ref> The King's Apartments face south over the Privy Garden, the Queen's east over the Fountain Garden. The suites are linked by a gallery running the length of the east fa\u00e7ade, another reference to Versailles, where the King and Queen's apartments are linked by the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Galerie des Glaces]]. However, at Hampton Court the linking gallery is of more modest proportions and decoration. The King's staircase was decorated with [[fresco]]s by [[Antonio Verrio]] and delicate ironwork by [[Jean Tijou]].<ref>Dynes, p. 94.</ref> Other artists commissioned to decorate the rooms included [[Grinling Gibbons]], Sir [[James Thornhill]] and [[Jacques Rousseau (painter)|Jacques Rousseau]]; furnishings were designed by [[Daniel Marot]].<ref>The furnishing was discussed by Tessa Murdoch, \"The furniture for the King's Apartments: 'Walnuttree' gilding, [[japanning]] and marble\", ''Apollo'' '''140''' (August 1994) pp. 55\u201360.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Queen Mary, King William lost interest in the renovations, and work ceased. However, it was in [[Hampton Court Park]] in 1702 that he fell from his horse, later dying from his injuries at [[Kensington Palace]]. He was succeeded by his sister-in-law [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] who continued the decoration and completion of the state apartments. On Queen Anne's death in 1714 the Stuart dynasty came to an end.\n\nQueen Anne's successor was [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]; he and his son [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] were the last monarchs to reside at Hampton Court.<ref name=\"Dynes, P90\"/> Under George I six rooms were completed in 1717 to the design of [[John Vanbrugh]].<ref name=\"thurley\">Thurley, Simon (2003).

Hampton Court]]\n\nThe palace houses many works of art and furnishings from the [[Royal Collection]], mainly dating from the two principal periods of the palace's construction, the early Tudor (Renaissance) and late Stuart to early Georgian period. In September 2015, the Royal Collection recorded 542 works (only those with images) as being located at Hampton Court, mostly paintings and furniture, but also ceramics and sculpture. The full current list can be obtained from their website.<ref>[https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/page/1 Collection search] \u2013 choose Hampton Court from the drop-down menu for \"Where?\"</ref>  The single most important work is [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s ''[[Triumphs of Caesar]]'' housed in the Lower Orangery. The palace once housed the [[Raphael Cartoons]], now kept at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. Their former home, the Cartoon Gallery on the south side of the Fountain Court, was designed by Christopher Wren; copies painted in the 1690s by a minor artist, [[Henry Cooke (artist)|Henry Cooke]], are now displayed in their place. Also on display are important collections of ceramics, including numerous pieces of blue and white porcelain collected by Queen Mary II, both Chinese imports and [[Delftware]].\n\n[[File:Pynequeenmarysstatebedchamberhamptoncourt edited.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Queen Mary II]]'s Bedchamber, also known as [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]]'s State Bedchamber.]]\nMuch of the original furniture dates from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, including tables by [[Jean Pelletier (cabinetmaker)|Jean Pelletier]], \"India back\" walnut chairs by Thomas Roberts and clocks and a barometer by [[Thomas Tompion]]. Several [[state bed]]s are still in their original positions, as is the Throne Canopy in the King's Privy Chamber. This room contains a crystal chandelier of circa 1700, possibly the first such in the country.<ref>Mortimer, Martin (2000). ''The English Glass Chandelier''.  p. 41.</ref>\n\nThe King's Guard Chamber contains a large quantity of arms: muskets, pistols, swords, daggers, [[powder horn]]s and pieces of armour arranged on the walls in decorative patterns. Bills exist for payment to a John Harris dated 1699 for an arrangement believed to be that still seen today.\n\n==The Chapel==\n[[File:Hampton Court Avri 2009 35.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Stained glass]] windows in the Great Watching Chamber.]]\nThe timber and plaster ceiling of the Chapel is considered the \"most important and magnificent in Britain\",<ref name=\"Thurley, P23\"/> but is all that remains of the Tudor decoration, after redecoration supervised by Sir Christopher Wren.  The altar is framed by a massive but plain oak [[reredos]] with garlands carved by [[Grinling Gibbons]] during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].<ref name=\"Thurley, P23\"/> Opposite the altar, at first-floor level, is the royal pew where the royal family would attend services apart from the general congregation seated below. \n\nThe clergy, musicians and other ecclesiastical officers employed by the monarch at Hampton Court, as in other English royal premises, are known collectively as the [[Chapel Royal]]; properly used the term does not refer to a building.\n\n==Grounds==\nThe grounds as they appear today were laid out in grand style in the late 17th century. There are no authentic remains of Henry VIII's gardens, merely a small [[knot garden]], planted in 1924, which hints at the gardens' 16th-century appearance.<ref name=\"Thurley, P44\">Thurley, p. 44.</ref> Today, the dominating feature of the grounds is the great landscaping scheme constructed for Sir Christopher Wren's intended new palace. From a water-bounded semicircular [[parterre]], the length of the east front, three [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] radiate in a [[Broad arrow|crow's foot]] pattern. The central avenue, containing not a walk or a drive, but the great canal known as the Long Water, was excavated during the reign of Charles II, in 1662. The design, radical at the time, is another immediately recognizable influence from Versailles, and was indeed laid out by pupils of [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre]], Louis XIV's landscape gardener.<ref name=\"Dynes, P95\"/>\n\nOn the south side of the palace is the Privy Garden bounded by semi-circular wrought iron gates by [[Jean Tijou]].<ref>Dynes. p. 95.</ref> This garden, originally William III's private garden, was replanted in 1992 in period style with manicured [[holly|hollies]] and [[taxus|yew]]s along a geometric system of paths.<ref name=\"Thurley, P44\"/>\n\n[[File:HCP - Tudor Garden.jpg|thumb|The garden recreated in the style of Henry VIII's gardens of 1536.]]\nOn a raised site overlooking the Thames, is a small pavilion, the Banqueting House. This was built circa 1700, for informal meals and entertainments in the gardens rather than for the larger state dinners which would have taken place inside the palace itself.  A nearby conservatory houses the \"Great Vine\", planted in 1769; by 1968 it had a trunk 81&nbsp;inches thick and has a length of 100 feet.<ref name=\"Dynes, P95\"/> It still produces an annual crop of grapes.<ref name=\"Thurley, P46\">Thurley, p. 46.</ref>\n\nThe palace included apartments for the use of favoured royal friends. One such apartment is described as being in \"The Pavilion and situated on the Home Park\" of Hampton Court Palace.  This privilege was first extended about 1817 by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, to his friend, Lieut General James Moore, K.C., and his new bride, Miss Cecilia Watson. [[George IV]] continued this arrangement following the death of Prince Edward on 23 January 1820. The Queen continued the arrangement for the widow of General Moore, following his death on 24 April 1838. This particular apartment was used for 21 years or more and spanned three different sponsors.<ref>From [https://books.google.com/books?id=CaTPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA659&lpg=PA659&dq=rowallan+mure+jamaica&source=bl&ots=Z3BspQR3xR&sig=exGNtK3laYYahZYXwPqabkxt9aY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XBiOT6KtC8bm0gH64dGcDw&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&q=hampton%20court&f=false The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 173, pp. 659\u2013660], Obituary for Lieut-General James Moore.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hampton-Court-F.jpg|thumb|left|One of the Palace's sunken gardens.

Sited on the former Chapel Court Garden, it has been planted with flowers and herbs from the 16th century, and is completed by gilded heraldic beasts and bold green and white painted fences. The heraldic beasts carved by [[Ben Harms]] and Ray Gonzalez of G&H Studios include the golden lion of England, The white greyhound of Richmond, the red dragon of Wales and the white hart of Richard II, all carved from English oak.

Building of the palace began in 1515 for Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]], a [[favourite]] of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. In 1529, as Wolsey fell from favour, the cardinal gave the palace to the king to check his disgrace. The palace went on to become one of Henry's most favoured residences; soon after acquiring the property, he arranged for it to be enlarged so that it might more easily accommodate his sizeable retinue of courtiers. Along with [[St James' Palace]], it is one of only two surviving palaces out of the many the king owned. The palace is currently in the possession of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[the Crown]]. \n\nIn the following century, [[William III of England|King William III]]'s massive rebuilding and expansion work, which was intended to rival the [[Palace of Versailles]], destroyed much of the Tudor palace.<ref name=\"Dynes, P90\">Dynes, p. 90.</ref> His work ceased in 1694, leaving the palace in two distinct contrasting architectural styles, domestic [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] and [[Baroque]]. While the palace's styles are an accident of fate, a unity exists due to the use of pink bricks and a symmetrical, if vague, balancing of successive low wings.<ref name=\"Dynes, P86\">Dynes, p. 86.</ref> [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] was the last monarch to reside in the palace.\n\nToday, the palace is open to the public and a major tourist attraction, easily reached by train from [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] in central London and served by [[Hampton Court railway station]] in [[East Molesey]], in [[Transport for London]]'s Zone 6. In addition, London Buses routes [[London Buses route 111|111]], 216, 411 and R68 stop outside the palace gates. The structure and grounds are cared for by an independent charity, [[Historic Royal Palaces]], which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/aboutus/whoweare/default.aspx |title=Who we are |publisher=Historic Royal Palaces |accessdate=12 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901223028/http://www.hrp.org.uk/aboutus/whoweare/default.aspx |archivedate=1 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In addition, the palace displays many works of art from the [[Royal Collection]].\n\nApart from the Palace itself and its gardens, other points of interest for visitors include the [[Hampton Court Maze|celebrated maze]], the historic [[royal tennis]] court (see below), and the huge [[Vitis vinifera|grape vine]], the largest in the world {{As of|2005|lc=y}}.

The historian [[Jonathan Foyle]] has suggested<ref>{{cite web|author = Foyle, Jonathan | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/hampton_court_01.shtml |title=Hampton Court: The Lost Palace |publisher= BBC |date= 29 March 2011 |accessdate= 12 July 2011| author-link=Jonathan Foyle }}</ref> that it is likely that Wolsey had been inspired by Paolo Cortese's ''De Cardinalatu'', a manual for cardinals that included advice on palatial architecture, published in 1510. The architectural historian Sir [[John Summerson]] asserts that the palace shows \"the essence of Wolsey\u2014the plain English churchman who nevertheless made his sovereign the arbiter of Europe and who built and furnished Hampton Court to show foreign embassies that Henry VIII's chief minister knew how to live as graciously as any cardinal in Rome.\"<ref name=\"Summerson, P14\">Summerson, p. 14.</ref> Whatever the concepts were, the architecture is an excellent and rare example of a thirty-year era when English architecture was in a harmonious transition from domestic Tudor, strongly influenced by [[perpendicular Gothic]], to the Italian Renaissance classical style. Perpendicular Gothic owed nothing historically to the Renaissance style, yet harmonised well with it.<ref name=\"Copplestone, P254\">Copplestone, p. 254.</ref> This blending of styles was realised by a small group of Italian craftsmen working at the English court in the second and third decades of the sixteenth century. They specialised in the adding of Renaissance ornament to otherwise straightforward Tudor buildings.<ref name=\"Copplestone, P254\"/> It was one of these, [[Giovanni da Maiano]], who was responsible for the set of eight [[relief]] busts of Roman emperors which were set in the Tudor brickwork.<ref>Copplestone, p. 257.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hampton Court.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne Boleyn]]'s Gate. The Tudor gatehouse and astronomical clock, made for [[Henry VIII]] in 1540 (''C on plan above'') Two of the Renaissance [[bas relief]]s by [[Giovanni da Maiano]] can be seen set into the brickwork.]]\nWolsey was only to enjoy his palace for a few years.<ref name=\"Summerson, P14\"/> In 1528, knowing that his enemies and the King were engineering his downfall, he passed the palace to the King as a gift. Wolsey died two years later in 1530.<ref name=\"Summerson, P14\"/>\n\nWithin six months of coming into ownership, the King began his own rebuilding and expansion.<ref name=\"Thurley, P6\"/> Henry VIII's court consisted of over one thousand people, while the King owned over sixty houses and palaces. Few of these were large enough to hold the assembled court, and thus one of the first of the King's building works (in order to transform Hampton Court to a principal residence) was to build the vast kitchens. These were quadrupled in size in 1529, enabling the King to provide [[bouche of court]] for his entire court.<ref>Thurley, p. 8.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historyhamptonc04lawgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyhamptonc04lawgoog/page/n212 150]|quote=Bouche of court.|title=The History of Hampton Court Palace|last=Law|first=Ernest Philip Alphonse|date=1890-01-01|publisher=George Bell and Sons|language=en}}</ref> The architecture of King Henry's new palace followed the design precedent set by Wolsey: perpendicular Gothic-inspired Tudor with restrained Renaissance ornament. This hybrid architecture was to remain almost unchanged for nearly a century, until [[Inigo Jones]] introduced strong classical influences from Italy to the London palaces of the first Stuart kings.\n\nBetween 1532 and 1535 Henry added the Great Hall (the last medieval [[great hall]] built for the English monarchy) and the [[Royal Tennis Court, Hampton Court|Royal Tennis Court]].<ref>This court is still in use for the game of [[real tennis]], an older version different from the present game. It is now the oldest extant real tennis court.</ref> The Great Hall has a carved [[hammer-beam]] roof. During Tudor times, this was the most important room of the palace; here, the King would dine in state seated at a table upon a raised [[dais]].<ref>Summerson, p. 21.</ref> The hall took five years to complete; so impatient was the King for completion that the masons were compelled to work throughout the night by candlelight.<ref name=\"Williams, P52\"/>\n\nThe gatehouse to the second, inner court was adorned in 1540 with the [[Hampton Court astronomical clock]], an early example of a pre-[[Copernicus|Copernican]] [[astronomical clock]]. Still functioning, the clock shows the time of day, the phases of the moon, the month, the quarter of the year, the date, the sun and star sign, and [[high water]] at [[London Bridge]].<ref>Thurley, p. 18.</ref> The latter information was of great importance to those visiting this Thames-side palace from London, as the preferred method of transport at the time was by barge, and at low water [[London Bridge]] created dangerous rapids. This gatehouse is also known today as [[Anne Boleyn]]'s gate, after Henry's second wife. Work was still underway on Anne Boleyn's apartments above the gate when Boleyn was beheaded.<ref>Williams, p. 53.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hampton-Court-D.jpg|thumb|left|Henry VIII's first building project at Hampton Court created vast kitchens capable of feeding his court of 1,000 people.]]\n[[File:Hearth.jpg|thumb|left|An original Tudor roasting hearth in the Great Kitchens at Hampton Court Palace, Richmond upon Thames, Greater London.]]During the Tudor period, the palace was the scene of many historic events. In 1537, the King's much desired male heir, the future [[Edward VI]], was born at the palace and the child's mother, [[Jane Seymour]], died there two weeks later.<ref name=\"Thurley, p. 9\">Thurley, p. 9.</ref> Four years afterwards, whilst attending [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the palace's chapel, the King was informed of the adultery of his fifth wife, [[Catherine Howard]]. She was then confined to her room for a few days before being sent to Syon House and then on to the Tower of London. Legend claims she briefly escaped her guards and ran through The Haunted Gallery to beg Henry for her life but she was recaptured.<ref name=\"Thurley, P23\">Thurley, p. 23.</ref>\n\nKing Henry died in January 1547 and was succeeded first by his son Edward VI, and then by both his daughters in turn. It was to Hampton Court that [[Queen Mary I]] (Henry's elder daughter) retreated with [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]] to spend her honeymoon, after their wedding at [[Winchester]].<ref name=\"Williams, P52\">Williams, p. 52.</ref> Mary chose Hampton Court as the place for the birth of her first child, which turned out to be the first of two [[phantom pregnancies]]. Mary had initially wanted to give birth at [[Windsor Castle]] as it was a more secure location, and she was still fearful of rebellion. But Hampton Court was considerably larger, and could accommodate the entire court and more besides. Mary stayed at the Palace awaiting the birth of the \"child\" for over five months, and only left because of the inhabitable state of the court being kept in the one location for so long, after which her court departed for the much smaller palace of Oatlands. Mary was succeeded by her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I]], and it was Elizabeth who had the eastern kitchen built; today, this is the palace's public tea room.<ref name=\"Thurley, p. 9\"/>\n\n===Stuart times===\n[[File:HamptonCurt.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher Wren]]'s south front (''G on plan'') built for [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] viewed from the Privy Garden.]]\nOn the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, the Tudor period came to an end. The Queen was succeeded by her first cousin-twice-removed, the Scottish King, James VI, who became known in England as [[James I of England|James I]] of the [[House of Stuart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ww.encyclopediavirginia.org/James_VI_and_I_1566-1625#start_entry|title=James VI and I (1566\u20131625)|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1604, the palace was the site of King James' meeting with representatives of the English [[Puritans]], known as the [[Hampton Court Conference]]; while agreement with the Puritans was not reached, the meeting led to James's commissioning of the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]].<ref name=\"Thurley, P10\">Thurley, p. 10.</ref>\n\nKing James was succeeded in 1625 by his son, the ill-fated [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Hampton Court was to become both his palace and his prison.<ref name=\"Thurley, P10\"/> It was also the setting for his honeymoon with his fifteen-year-old bride, [[Henrietta Maria]] in 1625.<ref name=\"Williams, P52\"/> Following King Charles' execution in 1649, the palace became the property of the Commonwealth presided over by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Unlike some other former royal properties, the palace escaped relatively unscathed. While the government auctioned much of the contents, the building was ignored.<ref>Thurley, p. 11.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his successor [[James II]] visited Hampton Court but largely preferred to reside elsewhere. By current French court standards Hampton Court now appeared old-fashioned. It was in 1689, shortly after Louis XIV's court had moved permanently to [[Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles|Versailles]], that the palace's antiquated state was addressed. England had joint monarchs, [[William III of England|William III]] and his wife, [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]. Within months of their accession they embarked on a massive rebuilding project at Hampton Court. The intention was to demolish the Tudor palace a section at a time, while replacing it with a huge modern palace in the Baroque style retaining only Henry VIII's Great Hall.<ref name=\"Summerson, P16\">Summerson, p. 16.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hampton Court Palace, Great Hall - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The ceiling of the Great Hall of Hampton Court Palace.]]The country's most eminent architect, [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], was called upon to draw the plans, while the master of works was to be [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]]. The plan was for a vast palace constructed around two courtyards at right angles to each other. Wren's design for a domed palace bore resemblances to the work of [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] and [[Louis Le Vau]], both architects employed by Louis XIV at Versailles.<ref name=\"Summerson, P16\" /> It has been suggested, though, that the plans were abandoned because the resemblance to Versailles was too subtle and not strong enough; at this time, it was impossible for any sovereign to visualise a palace that did not emulate Versailles' repetitive Baroque form.<ref>This is the stated opinion of Sir John Summerson. Summerson, p. 19.</ref> However, the resemblances are there: while the fa\u00e7ades are not so long as those of Versailles, they have similar, seemingly unstoppable repetitive rhythms beneath a long flat skyline. The monotony is even repeated as the fa\u00e7ade turns the corner from the east to the south fronts. However, Hampton Court, unlike Versailles, is given an extra dimension by the contrast between the pink brick and the pale [[Portland stone]] quoins, frames and banding.<ref name=\"Dynes, P95\">Dynes, p. 95.</ref> Further diversion is added by the circular and decorated windows of the second floor mezzanine. This theme is repeated in the inner Fountain Court, but the rhythm is faster and the windows, unpedimented on the outer fa\u00e7ades, are given pointed pediments in the courtyard; this has led the courtyard to be described as \"Startling, as of simultaneous exposure to a great many eyes with raised eyebrows.\"<ref name=\"Summerson, P19\">Summerson, p. 19.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hampton-Court-E.jpg|thumb|The Fountain Court designed by Sir Christopher Wren (''E on plan''): \"Startling, as of simultaneous exposure to a great many eyes with raised eyebrows.\"<ref name=\"Summerson, P19\" />]]\nDuring this work, half the Tudor palace was replaced and Henry VIII's state rooms and private apartments were both lost; the new wings around the Fountain Court contained new state apartments and private rooms, one set for the King and one for the Queen. Each suite of state rooms was accessed by a state staircase. The royal suites were of completely equal value in order to reflect William and Mary's unique status as joint sovereigns.<ref name=\"Williams, p. 54\">Williams, p. 54.</ref> The King's Apartments face south over the Privy Garden, the Queen's east over the Fountain Garden. The suites are linked by a gallery running the length of the east fa\u00e7ade, another reference to Versailles, where the King and Queen's apartments are linked by the [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Galerie des Glaces]]. However, at Hampton Court the linking gallery is of more modest proportions and decoration. The King's staircase was decorated with [[fresco]]s by [[Antonio Verrio]] and delicate ironwork by [[Jean Tijou]].<ref>Dynes, p. 94.</ref> Other artists commissioned to decorate the rooms included [[Grinling Gibbons]], Sir [[James Thornhill]] and [[Jacques Rousseau (painter)|Jacques Rousseau]]; furnishings were designed by [[Daniel Marot]].<ref>The furnishing was discussed by Tessa Murdoch, \"The furniture for the King's Apartments: 'Walnuttree' gilding, [[japanning]] and marble\", ''Apollo'' '''140''' (August 1994) pp. 55\u201360.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Queen Mary, King William lost interest in the renovations, and work ceased. However, it was in [[Hampton Court Park]] in 1702 that he fell from his horse, later dying from his injuries at [[Kensington Palace]]. He was succeeded by his sister-in-law [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] who continued the decoration and completion of the state apartments.

Hampton Court]]\n\nThe palace houses many works of art and furnishings from the [[Royal Collection]], mainly dating from the two principal periods of the palace's construction, the early Tudor (Renaissance) and late Stuart to early Georgian period. In September 2015, the Royal Collection recorded 542 works (only those with images) as being located at Hampton Court, mostly paintings and furniture, but also ceramics and sculpture. The full current list can be obtained from their website.<ref>[https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/page/1 Collection search] \u2013 choose Hampton Court from the drop-down menu for \"Where?\"</ref>  The single most important work is [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s ''[[Triumphs of Caesar]]'' housed in the Lower Orangery. The palace once housed the [[Raphael Cartoons]], now kept at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. Their former home, the Cartoon Gallery on the south side of the Fountain Court, was designed by Christopher Wren; copies painted in the 1690s by a minor artist, [[Henry Cooke (artist)|Henry Cooke]], are now displayed in their place. Also on display are important collections of ceramics, including numerous pieces of blue and white porcelain collected by Queen Mary II, both Chinese imports and [[Delftware]].\n\n[[File:Pynequeenmarysstatebedchamberhamptoncourt edited.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Queen Mary II]]'s Bedchamber, also known as [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]]'s State Bedchamber.]]\nMuch of the original furniture dates from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, including tables by [[Jean Pelletier (cabinetmaker)|Jean Pelletier]], \"India back\" walnut chairs by Thomas Roberts and clocks and a barometer by [[Thomas Tompion]]. Several [[state bed]]s are still in their original positions, as is the Throne Canopy in the King's Privy Chamber. This room contains a crystal chandelier of circa 1700, possibly the first such in the country.<ref>Mortimer, Martin (2000). ''The English Glass Chandelier''.  p. 41.</ref>\n\nThe King's Guard Chamber contains a large quantity of arms: muskets, pistols, swords, daggers, [[powder horn]]s and pieces of armour arranged on the walls in decorative patterns. Bills exist for payment to a John Harris dated 1699 for an arrangement believed to be that still seen today.\n\n==The Chapel==\n[[File:Hampton Court Avri 2009 35.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Stained glass]] windows in the Great Watching Chamber.]]\nThe timber and plaster ceiling of the Chapel is considered the \"most important and magnificent in Britain\",<ref name=\"Thurley, P23\"/> but is all that remains of the Tudor decoration, after redecoration supervised by Sir Christopher Wren.  The altar is framed by a massive but plain oak [[reredos]] with garlands carved by [[Grinling Gibbons]] during the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].<ref name=\"Thurley, P23\"/> Opposite the altar, at first-floor level, is the royal pew where the royal family would attend services apart from the general congregation seated below. \n\nThe clergy, musicians and other ecclesiastical officers employed by the monarch at Hampton Court, as in other English royal premises, are known collectively as the [[Chapel Royal]]; properly used the term does not refer to a building.\n\n==Grounds==\nThe grounds as they appear today were laid out in grand style in the late 17th century. There are no authentic remains of Henry VIII's gardens, merely a small [[knot garden]], planted in 1924, which hints at the gardens' 16th-century appearance.<ref name=\"Thurley, P44\">Thurley, p. 44.</ref> Today, the dominating feature of the grounds is the great landscaping scheme constructed for Sir Christopher Wren's intended new palace. From a water-bounded semicircular [[parterre]], the length of the east front, three [[Avenue (landscape)|avenues]] radiate in a [[Broad arrow|crow's foot]] pattern. The central avenue, containing not a walk or a drive, but the great canal known as the Long Water, was excavated during the reign of Charles II, in 1662. The design, radical at the time, is another immediately recognizable influence from Versailles, and was indeed laid out by pupils of [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre]], Louis XIV's landscape gardener.<ref name=\"Dynes, P95\"/>\n\nOn the south side of the palace is the Privy Garden bounded by semi-circular wrought iron gates by [[Jean Tijou]].<ref>Dynes. p. 95.</ref> This garden, originally William III's private garden, was replanted in 1992 in period style with manicured [[holly|hollies]] and [[taxus|yew]]s along a geometric system of paths.<ref name=\"Thurley, P44\"/>\n\n[[File:HCP - Tudor Garden.jpg|thumb|The garden recreated in the style of Henry VIII's gardens of 1536.]]\nOn a raised site overlooking the Thames, is a small pavilion, the Banqueting House. This was built circa 1700, for informal meals and entertainments in the gardens rather than for the larger state dinners which would have taken place inside the palace itself.  A nearby conservatory houses the \"Great Vine\", planted in 1769; by 1968 it had a trunk 81&nbsp;inches thick and has a length of 100 feet.<ref name=\"Dynes, P95\"/> It still produces an annual crop of grapes.<ref name=\"Thurley, P46\">Thurley, p. 46.</ref>\n\nThe palace included apartments for the use of favoured royal friends. One such apartment is described as being in \"The Pavilion and situated on the Home Park\" of Hampton Court Palace.  This privilege was first extended about 1817 by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, to his friend, Lieut General James Moore, K.C., and his new bride, Miss Cecilia Watson. [[George IV]] continued this arrangement following the death of Prince Edward on 23 January 1820. The Queen continued the arrangement for the widow of General Moore, following his death on 24 April 1838. This particular apartment was used for 21 years or more and spanned three different sponsors.<ref>From [https://books.google.com/books?id=CaTPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA659&lpg=PA659&dq=rowallan+mure+jamaica&source=bl&ots=Z3BspQR3xR&sig=exGNtK3laYYahZYXwPqabkxt9aY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XBiOT6KtC8bm0gH64dGcDw&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&q=hampton%20court&f=false The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 173, pp. 659\u2013660], Obituary for Lieut-General James Moore.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hampton-Court-F.jpg|thumb|left|One of the Palace's sunken gardens. In the background is William III's Banqueting House (''H on plan'') of 1700.]]\nA well-known curiosity of the palace's grounds is [[Hampton Court Maze]]; planted in the 1690s by [[George London (landscape architect)|George London]] and [[Henry Wise (gardener)|Henry Wise]] for William III.<ref name=\"Thurley, P46\"/> It was originally planted with [[hornbeam]]; it has been repaired latterly using many different types of hedge. (There is a 3D online browser simulation of the [[Hampton Court Maze]]\u2014see the External Links section.)\n\nInspired by narrow views of a Tudor garden that can be seen through doorways in a painting, ''The Family of Henry VIII'', hanging in the palace's Haunted Gallery, a new garden in the style of Henry VIII's 16th-century Privy Gardens, has been designed to celebrate the anniversary of that King's accession to the throne. Sited on the former Chapel Court Garden, it has been planted with flowers and herbs from the 16th century, and is completed by gilded heraldic beasts and bold green and white painted fences. The heraldic beasts carved by [[Ben Harms]] and Ray Gonzalez of G&H Studios include the golden lion of England, The white greyhound of Richmond, the red dragon of Wales and the white hart of Richard II, all carved from English oak. The garden's architect was Todd Langstaffe-Gowan, who collaborated with James Fox and the Gardens Team at Historic Royal Palaces.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe formal gardens and park are [[Grade I listed]] on the [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England|Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]].<ref name=NHLEGarden>{{NHLE|num=1000108|desc=Hampton Court|access-date=24 April 2017|mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nGarden in Hampton Court.jpg|<center>Flowers and trees in the Great Fountain Garden</center>\nRose Garden in Hampton Court.jpg|<center>Rose garden of the Palace</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===King's Beasts===\n[[File:Hampton Court Palace (3037994888).jpg|thumb|upright|The King's Beasts]]\nThere are also ten statues of heraldic animals, called the King's Beasts, that stand on the bridge over the moat leading to the great gatehouse. Unlike the [[The Queen's Beasts|Queen's Beasts]] in [[Kew Gardens]], these statues represent the ancestry of King Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour.

In fact, George III, from the moment of his accession, never set foot in the palace: he associated the state apartments with a humiliating scene when his grandfather had once struck him following an innocent remark.\nHe did however have the Great Vine planted here in 1763 and had the top two storeys of the Great Gatehouse removed in 1773.<ref name=\"Williams, p. 54\"/>\n\nIn 1796, the Great Hall was restored and in 1838, during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]], the restoration was completed and the palace opened to the public. The heavy-handed restoration plan at this time reduced the Great Gatehouse (''A''), the palace's principal entrance, by two stories and removed the lead [[cupola]]s adorning its four towers.<ref>Dynes, p. 91.</ref> Once opened, the palace soon became a major tourist attraction and, by 1881, over ten million visits had been recorded.<ref>{{cite news|title=Story of Hampton Court Palace|work=Historic Royal Palaces|url=https://www.hrp.org.uk/hampton-court-palace/history-and-stories/the-story-of-hampton-court-palace|accessdate=9 March 2018}}</ref> Visitors arrived both by boat from London and via [[Hampton Court railway station]], opened in February 1849.<ref>{{cite news|title=Horse Power on the Hampton Court Branch by David Turner|work=Molesey History Society|url=http://www.moleseyhistorysociety.org/Horsepower%20on%20the%20Hampton%20Court%20line.pdf|accessdate=9 March 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Hampton Court stairs.jpg|thumb|One of the sets of stairs at the main entrance]]\nOn 2 September 1952, the palace was given statutory protection by being [[Grade I listed]].<ref>{{NHLE |num=1193127 |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref>  Other buildings and structures within the grounds are separately Grade I listed, including the early 16th-century tilt yard tower (the only surviving example of the five original towers);<ref>{{NHLE |num=1065440 |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> [[Christopher Wren]]'s Lion gate built for Anne and George I;<ref>{{NHLE |num=1065442 |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> and the Tudor and 17th-century perimeter walls.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1358066 |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Royal School of Needlework]] moved to premises within the Palace from Princes Gate in [[Kensington]] 1987, and the Palace also houses the headquarters of [[Historic Royal Palaces]], a [[charitable foundation]].\n\n=== Grace and favour residencies ===\nFrom the 1760s, the palace was used to house [[grace and favour]] residents. Many of the palace rooms were adapted to be rent-free apartments, with vacant ones allocated by the [[Lord Chamberlain]] to applicants to reward past services rendered to the Crown. From 1862 to his death in 1867, [[Michael Faraday]] lived here. From the 1960s the number of new residents declined, with the last admitted in the 1980s.<ref name=Grace>{{Cite book|author=Sarah Parker.|title=Grace & Favour: The Hampton Court Palace Community 1750\u20131950.|page=126.

Adaptations to wheelchair tires are another example; widening the tires enables wheelchair users to move over soft surfaces, such as deep snow on ski hills, and sandy beaches.\n\nAssistive technology and adaptive technology have a key role in developing the means for people with disabilities to live more independently, and to more fully participate in mainstream society. In order to have access to assistive or adaptive technology, however, educating the public and even legislating requirements to incorporate this technology have been necessary.\n\n==Employment==\n[[File:Usda hiring applicants with disabilities.jpg|thumb|upright|William P.

Workers in Western countries fare relatively well, having access to more services and training as well as legal protections against employment discrimination. Despite this, in the United States the 2012 unemployment rate for workers with disabilities was 12.9%, while it was 7.3% for workers without disabilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Disability Employment Resources by Topic|url=http://www.dol.gov/odep/#.ULk_D47R3zI|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 Office of Disability Employment Policy|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}</ref> More than half of workers with disabilities (52%) earned less than $25,000 in the previous year, compared with just 38% of workers with no disabilities. This translates into an earnings gap where individuals with disabilities earn about 25 percent less of what workers without disabilities earn. Among occupations with 100,000 or more people, dishwashers had the highest disability rate (14.3%), followed by refuse and recyclable material collectors (12.7%), personal care aides (11.9%), and janitors and building cleaners (11.8%).

Although employment for workers with disabilities is higher in the public sector due to hiring programs targeting persons with disabilities, regulations currently restrict types of work available to persons with disabilities:\n\"Disability-specific employment reservations are limited to the public sector and a large number of the reserved positions continue to be vacant despite nearly two decades of enactment of the PWD Act\".<ref name=\"dsq-sds\" />\n\nExpenses related to adaptive or assistive technology required to participate in the workforce may be tax deductible expenses for individuals with a medical practitioner's prescription in some jurisdictions.\n\n===Disability Management===\nDisability Management (DM) is a specialized area of [[human resources]], to support efforts by employers to better integrate and retain workers with disabilities. Some workplaces have policies in place to provide \"reasonable accommodation\" for employees with disabilities, however, many do not. In some jurisdictions, employers may have legal requirements to end [[ableism|discrimination against persons with disabilities]].\n\nIt has been noted by researchers that where accommodations are in place for employees with disabilities, these frequently apply to individuals with \"pre-determined or apparent disabilities as determined by national social protection or Equality Authorities\",<ref name=\"Geisen165\">{{cite book|author1=Geisen, Thomas |author2=Henry George Harder|title=Disability Management and Workplace Integration: International Research Findings|year=2011|publisher=Gower Publishing|isbn=9781409418887|pages=165}}</ref> which include persons with pre-existing conditions who receive an official disability designation. One of the biggest challenges for employers is in developing policies and practises to manage employees who develop disabilities during the course of employment. Even where these exist, they tend to focus on workplace injuries, overlooking job retention challenges faced by employees who acquire a non-occupation injury or illness. Protecting employability is a factor that can help close the unemployment gap for persons with disabilities.<ref name=\"Geisen165\" />\n\n===Meeting and conference access===\nMeetings and conferences should consider the needs of all of their participants.

Such an approach neglects the influence of interventions in the transport system on broader and often conflicting economic, social and environmental goals. Accessibility based planning defines accessibility as the amount of services and jobs people can access within a certain travel time, considering one or more modes of transport such as walking, cycling, driving or public transport.\nUsing this definition accessibility does not only relate to the qualities of the transport system (e.g. travel speed, time or costs), but also to the qualities of the land use system (e.g. densities and mixes of opportunities). It thus provides planners with the possibility to understand interdependencies between transport and land use development. Accessibility planning opens the floor to a more normative approach to transportation planning involving different actors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.plan4sustainabletravel.org/key_themes/accessibility_key_features/|title=Planning for Sustainable Travel - Key Themes - Accessibility of Key Facilities|website=plan4sustainabletravel.org|access-date=2018-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208070132/http://www.plan4sustainabletravel.org/key_themes/accessibility_key_features/|archive-date=2018-02-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> For politicians, citizens and firms it might be easier to discuss the quality of access to education, services and markets than it is to discuss the inefficiencies of the transport system itself. Accessibility is also defined as \"the potential for interaction\".\n\n===Accessibility instruments===\nGenerally since the 1960s, accessibility instruments have been developed for a multitude of contexts and scopes. These instruments have their focus on origins and on destinations, they measure access through time, distance or cost and focus on different modes of transportation and geographical scales. Accessibility instruments are thus able to show what are the best accessible places or opportunities within a city or region, considering one or more specific modes of transportation, timeslots and target groups. In addition to this, the maps, which are produced as the instrument output, are considered as considerably useful when assessing the effects of new developments in a city. The first ever first large scale compendium of accessibility instruments was developed in 2012, under the framework of Cost Action TU1002, and is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/accessibility-instruments-2/|title=Accessibility Instruments|website=accessibilityplanning.eu}}</ref>\n\n===Potentials of accessibility in planning practice===\nDespite the high potential of accessibility in integrating the different components of urban planning, such as land use and transportation and the large number of accessibility instruments available in the research literature, the latter are not widely used to support urban planning practices.<ref>{{cite book |title=Accessibility Instruments for Planning Practice|date=June 2012|publisher=COST Office|isbn=978-989-20-3210-8 |author1=Angela Hull |author2=Cec\u00edlia Silva |author3=Luca Bertolini |url=http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/COST-Report-1-FINAL.pdf}}</ref> By keeping the accessibility language out of the practice level, older paradigms resist the more informed and people-centred approaches.\nFocusing on the link between research and practice, the Cost Action TU1002 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tut.fi/edge/?page_id=182|title=COST Action TU1002 {{!}} EDGE|website=tut.fi|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> seeks to find out why accessibility instruments are not more often used in urban planning practice and reflects on how to reduce such implementation gap in planning practice. The existence of accessibility instruments is fairly acknowledged, but practitioners do not appear to have found them useful or usable enough for addressing the tasks of sustainable urban management.\nThis Cost Action TU1002 is bringing together developers of accessibility instruments all over Europe and Australia to work with land use and transportation planning practitioners to explore how these instruments can play a more supportive role in enhancing accessibility in European cities and beyond. So far, 24 Accessibility Instruments have been gathered, analysed and described so as to understand in detail their characteristics, planning issues addressed and specific purposes, according to the developers\u2019 view. In turn, these instruments are being tested in a series of workshops with multidisciplinary teams of practitioners around Europe addressing the issue of usability from the practitioners\u2019 viewpoint. In doing so, it is expected that the additional knowledge on the potential of accessibility instruments for urban planning practice will have beneficial impacts on urban quality and decision making on urban land use patterns.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{for|the metric of transport connectivity for planning purposes|Accessibility (transport)}}\n[[File:Curitiba 10 2006 04 RIT.jpg|alt=ramps lowered from the side of a bus are level with the station's high platform|thumb|Accessibility to all [[autobus|buses]] is provided in [[Curitiba]]'s [[Rede Integrada de Transporte|public transport]] system, [[Brazil]].]]\n[[File:\u53f0\u5317\u8eca\u7ad9\u7121\u969c\u7919\u96fb\u68af.jpg|thumb|An [[elevator]] at [[Taipei Railway Station]] allowing for wheelchair access.]]\n[[File:Taxi wheelchair.jpg|thumb|A wheelchair accessible [[taxi]] with a rear ramp, [[Tokyo Motor Show]] 2009.]]\n[[File:Protram205 ramp.JPG|thumb|[[Wheelchair ramp|Wheelchair-access ramp]] in [[Protram 205 WrAs]] tram.]]\nProviding mobility to people with disabilities includes changes for public facilities like gently sloping paths of travel for people with wheelchairs and difficulty walking up stairs, or audio announcements for the blind; dedicated services like [[paratransit]]; and adaptations to personal vehicles.\n\n===Adapted automobiles for persons with disabilities===\n{{See also|Adapted automobile}}\nAutomobile accessibility also refers to ease of use by disabled people. Automobiles, whether a car or a van, can be adapted for a range of physical disabilities. Foot pedals can be raised, or replaced with hand-controlled devices. Wheelchair hoists, lifts or ramps may be customized according to the needs of the driver. [[Ergonomic]] adaptations, such as a lumbar support cushion, may also be needed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dimond|first=Bridget C.|title=Legal Aspects of Physiotherapy|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781405176156|pages=[https://archive.org/details/legalaspectsofph0000dimo/page/263 263]|url=https://archive.org/details/legalaspectsofph0000dimo/page/263}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the more limiting the disability, the more expensive the adaptation needed for the vehicle. Financial assistance is available through some organizations, such as [[Motability]] in the United Kingdom, which requires a contribution by the prospective vehicle owner. Motability makes vehicles available for purchase or lease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dimond|first=Bridget C.|title=Legal Aspects of Occupational Therapy|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781444348163|pages=n.p}}</ref>\n\nWhen an employee with a disability requires an adapted car for work use, the employee does not have to pay for a \"[[reasonable accommodation|reasonable adjustment]]\" in the United Kingdom; if the employer is unable to pay the cost, assistance is offered by government programs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Disability Rights Commission|title=Disability Discrimination Act 1995: Code of Practice; Employment and Occupation|year=2004|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=9780117034198|pages=5}}</ref>\n\n===Low floor===\n{{redirect|Low floor|more details|Low-floor bus|and|Low-floor tram}}\nA significant development in transportation, and [[public transport]] in particular, to achieve accessibility, is the move to \"low-floor\" vehicles. In a low-floor vehicle, access to part or all of the passenger cabin is unobstructed from one or more entrances by the presence of steps, enabling easier access for the infirm or people with [[Baby transport|push chairs]]. A further aspect may be that the entrance and corridors are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Low-floor vehicles have been developed for [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[trams]].\n\nA low floor in the vehicular sense is normally combined in a conceptual meaning with normal pedestrian access from a standard [[Curb (road)|kerb (curb)]] height. However, the accessibility of a low-floor vehicle can also be utilised from slightly raising portions of kerb at [[bus stop]]s, or through use of level boarding [[bus rapid transit]] stations or tram stops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/what-is-brt/|title=What is BRT? - Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|work=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> The combination of access from a kerb was the technological development of the 1990s, as step-free interior layouts for buses had existed in some cases for decades, with entrance steps being introduced as chassis designs and overall height regulations changed.\n\nLow-floor buses may also be designed with special height adjustment controls that permit a stationary bus to temporarily lower itself to ground level, permitting wheelchair access. This is referred to as a [[kneeling bus]].\n\nAt [[rapid transit]] systems, vehicles generally have floors in the same height as the platforms but the stations are often underground or elevated, so accessibility there isn't a question of providing low-floor vehicles, but providing a step-free access from street level to the platforms (generally by [[elevator]]s, which are somewhat restricted to disabled passengers only, so that the step-free access isn't obstructed by healthy people taking advantage).\n\n===Accessibility planning for transportation in the United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], local transport authorities are responsible for checking that all people who live within their area can access essential opportunities and services, and where gaps in provision are identified the local authorities are responsible for organizing changes to make new connections. These requirements are defined in the UK Community Planning Acts legislation<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theknowledgeexchangeblog.com/2017/01/25/community-planning-in-the-devolved-uk/|title=Community planning in the devolved UK|date=2017-01-25|work=The Knowledge Exchange Blog|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> and more detailed guidance has been issued by the [[Department for Transport]] for each [[Local authority#England|local authority]]. This includes the requirement to produce an Accessibility Plan under Community Planning legislation and to incorporate this within their [[Local Transport Plan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/parkingandtravel/transportplansandprojects/localtransportplan|title=Local Transport Plan {{!}} PLYMOUTH.GOV.UK|website=plymouth.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> An Accessibility Plan sets out how each local authority plans to improve access to employment, learning, health care, food shops and other services of local importance, particularly for disadvantaged groups and areas. Accessibility targets are defined in the accessibility plans, these are often the distance or time to access services by different modes of transport including walking, cycling and public transport.\n\nAccessibility Planning was introduced as a result of the report \"Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion\".<ref>Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&nbsp;\u2013 Social Exclusion Unit: \"[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100907154242/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |date=2010-09-07 }}\". February 2003.</ref> This report was the result of research carried out by the [[Social exclusion|Social Exclusion]] Unit. The United Kingdom also has a \"code of practice\" for making train and stations accessible: \"Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice\".<ref>Department of Transport & Transport Scotland: \"[http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/rail/railstations/accessiblestationdesigns/cop.pdf Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice]\". July 2008.</ref> This code of practice was first published in 2002 with the objective of compliance to Section 71B of the Railways Act 1993,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/43/section/71B|title=Railways Act 1993|website=legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> and revised after a public consultation period in 2008.\n\nMaking public services fully accessible to the public has led to some technological innovations. [[Public announcement]] systems using [[audio induction loop]] technology can broadcast announcements directly into the hearing aid of anyone with a hearing impairment, making them useful in such public places as auditoriums and train stations. Australia's government has supported the creation of the [[National Public Toilet Map]], to enable users to locate public toilet facilities throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toiletmap.gov.au/|title=National Public Toilet Map - Home|last=Map|first=National Public Toilet|website=toiletmap.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> [[GPS]] is also included as a feature. The service assists people with continence issues, which is estimated to be up to 18% of the population, including the elderly and families with young children.\n\n====Accessibility in urban design====\nAccessibility modifications to conventional urban environments has become common in recent decades. The use of a [[curb cut]], or [[kassel kerb]], to enable wheelchair or walker movement between sidewalk and street level is found in most major cities of wealthy countries. The creation of priority parking spaces and of [[disabled parking permit]]s has made them a standard feature of urban environments. Features that assist people with visual impairments include [[braille]] signs and [[tactile paving]] to allow a user with a cane to easily identify stairways, train platforms, and similar areas that could pose a physical danger to anyone who has a visual impairment.\n\nUrban design features that may appear to be simple conveniences for persons without disabilities are often essential to anyone who has a disability. The loss of these features presents a significant barrier. For example, sometimes a lack of prompt snow-clearing on sidewalks of major Canadian city streets means that wheelchair and walker users cannot reach pedestrian crossing buttons on crosswalk posts, due to snow bank accumulation around the posts, making the crossing buttons inaccessible. Public services must take into account the need to maintain accessibility features in the urban environment.\n\n==Housing==\n{{Further|Accessible housing}}\nMost existing and new housing, even in the wealthiest nations, lack basic accessibility features unless the designated, immediate occupant of a home currently has a disability. However, there are some initiatives to change typical residential practices so that new homes incorporate basic access features such as zero-step entries and door widths adequate for wheelchairs to pass through. [[Occupational Therapist]]s are a professional group skilled in the assessment and making of recommendations to improve access to homes.<ref>Occupational therapy research on assistive technology and physical environmental issues: A literature review, Fange et al. (2006), Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy</ref> They are involved in both the adaptation of existing housing to improve accessibility,<ref>Changes in accessibility and usability in housing: an exploration of the housing adaptation process (2005), Fange and Iwarsson, Occupational Therapy International</ref> and in the design of future housing.<ref>Accessibility and usability in housing: construct validity and implications for research and practice (2003), Fange and Iwarsson, Disability and Rehabilitation</ref>\n\nThe broad concept of [[Universal design]] is relevant to housing, as it is to all aspects of the built environment. Furthermore, a [[Visitability]] movement<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/visitability|title=Visitability {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> begun by grass roots disability advocates in the 1980s focuses specifically on changing construction practices in new housing. This movement, a network of interested people working in their locales, works on educating, passing laws, and spurring voluntary home access initiatives with the intention that basic access become a routine part of new home construction.\n\n===Accessibility and 'ageing in place'===\nAccessibility in the design of housing and household devices has become more prominent in recent decades due to a rapidly ageing population in developed countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/accessibility/homes/|title=Accessible Home Design: Information & Ideas|work=Disabled World|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> Ageing seniors may wish to continue living independently, but the ageing process naturally increases the disabilities that a senior citizen will experience. A growing trend is the desire for many senior citizens to 'age in place', living as independently as possible for as long as possible. Accessibility modifications that allow ageing in place are becoming more common. Housing may even be designed to incorporate accessibility modifications that can be made throughout the life cycle of the residents.\n\n==Voting==\n\nUnder the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], states parties are bound to assure accessible [[election]]s, [[voting]], and voting procedures. In 2018, the United Nations [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] issued an opinion that all polling stations should be fully accessible. At the [[European Court of Human Rights]], there are currently two ongoing cases about the accessibility of polling places and voting procedures. They were brought against [[Slovenia]] by two voters and the [[Slovenian Disability Rights Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2717030/disabled-take-slovenia-to-human-rights-court-over-polling-stations-accessibility|title=STA: Disabled take Slovenia to Human Rights Court over polling stations accessibility|website=english.sta.si|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> As of January 2020, the cases, called Toplak v.

Access to the technology is restricted to those who can afford it, but it has become more widespread in Western countries in recent years. For those who use it, it provides the ability to access information and services by minimizing the barriers of distance and cost as well as the accessibility and usability of the interface. In many countries this has led to initiatives, laws and/or regulations that aim toward providing universal access to the internet and to phone systems at reasonable cost to citizens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing.html |title=Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium}}</ref>\n\nA major advantage of advanced technology is its flexibility. Some technologies can be used at home, in the workplace, and in school, expanding the ability of the user to participate in various spheres of daily life. [[Augmentative and alternative communication]] technology is one such area of IT progress. It includes inventions such as [[speech-generating device]]s, [[Teletypewriter]] devices, adaptive pointing devices to replace computer mouse devices, and many others. They can be adapted to create accessibility to a range of tasks, and may be suitable for different kinds of disability.\n\nThe following impairments are some of the disabilities that affect communications and technology access, as well as many other life activities:\n* [[communication disorder]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.nih.gov/topic/SpeechCommunicationDisorders|title=Speech and Communication Disorders|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}</ref>\n* [[hearing impairment]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hearingdisordersanddeafness.html|title=Hearing Disorders and Deafness|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n* [[visual impairment]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/visionimpairmentandblindness.html|title=Visual Impairment and Blindness|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n* [[mobility impairment]]s;\n* a [[learning disability]] or impairment in mental functioning.\n\nEach kind of disability requires a different kind of accommodation, and this may require analysis by a medical specialist, an educational specialist or a job analysis when the impairment requires accommodation.\n* [[Job analysis]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2538128|title=Pre-employment and periodical health examinations, job analysis and placement of workers| pmid=13276805|volume=13|issue=4|year=1955|journal=Bull.

Quadriplegics have the most profound disability, and the voice operated wheel chair technology was first developed in 1977 to provide increased mobility. The original version replaced the joystick system with a module that recognized 8 commands. Many other technology accommodation improvements have evolved from this initial development.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=849131|title=Voice Operated Wheelchair| volume=58|issue=4|date=April 1977|journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil|pages=169\u201375|last1=Clark|first1=J. A.|last2=Roemer|first2=R. B.}}</ref>\n\nMissing arms and fingers interferes with the use of a keyboard and pointing device (mouse). This can be one of the most devastating types of handicap, and technology has made great improvements in this area during the last 20 years. Speech recognition devices and software can improve technology access.\n\n====Communication (including speech) impairments====\nA communication disorder interferes with the ability to produce clearly understandable speech. There can be many different causes, such as nerve degeneration, muscle degeneration, stroke, and vocal cord injury. The modern method to deal with speaking disabilities has been to provide a text interface for a speech synthesizer for complete vocal disability. This can be a great improvement for people that have been limited to the use of a throat vibrator to produce speech since the 1960s.\n\n====Hearing impairment====\nAn individual satisfies the definition of hearing disabled when hearing loss is about 30&nbsp;dB for a single frequency, but this is not always perceptible as a handicap.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hear-it.org/Defining-hearing-loss|title=Definition of hearing loss \u2013 Mild, Moderate, Severe & Profound - hear-it.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> For example, loss of sensitivity in one ear interferes with sound localization (directional hearing), which can interfere with communication in a crowd. This is often recognized when certain words are confused during normal conversation. This can interfere with voice-only interfaces, like automated customer service telephone systems, because it is sometimes difficult to increase the volume and repeat the message.\n\nMild to moderate hearing loss may be accommodated with a hearing aid that amplifies ambient sounds. Portable devices with speed recognition that can produce text can reduce problems associated with understanding conversation. This kind of hearing loss is relatively common, and this often grows worse with age.\n\nThe modern method to deal with profound hearing disability is the Internet using email or word processing applications. The [[telecommunications device for the deaf]] (TDD) became available in the form of the [[Teleprinter|teletype]] (TTY) during the 1960s. These devices consist of a keyboard, display and modem that connects two or more of these devices using a dedicated wire or plain old telephone service.\n\n====Visual impairments====\nA wide range of technology products are available to deal with visual impairment. This includes screen magnification for monitors, screen-reading technology for computers and small screen devices, mouse-over speech synthesis browsing, braille displays, braille printers, braille cameras, voice-operated phones, and tablets.\n\nOne emerging product that will make ordinary computer displays available for the blind is the refreshable tactile display, which is very different from a conventional braille display. This provides a raised surface corresponding to the bright and dim spots on a conventional display. An example is the Touch Sight Camera for the Blind.\n\n[[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] ''(V1.0 Released 7 September 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-speech-synthesis-20040907/|title=Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0|website=w3.org}}</ref>)'' and [[Speech Recognition Grammar Specification]] ''(V1.0 released 16 March 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/|title=Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0|website=w3.org}}</ref>)'' are relatively recent technologies intended to standardize communication interfaces using Augmented [[Backus\u2013Naur form|BNF]] Form and [[XML]] Form. These technologies assist visual impairments and physical impairment by providing interactive access to web content without the need to visually observe the content. While these technologies provides access for visually impaired individuals, the primary benefactor has been automated systems that replace live human customer service representatives that handle telephone calls.\n\n===Web accessibility===\n{{See also |Web accessibility}}\n\n====International standards and guidelines====\nThere have been a few major movements to coordinate a set of guidelines for accessibility for the [[World Wide Web|web]]. The first and most well known is The [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] (WAI), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([[W3C]]). This organization developed the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]] (WCAG) 1.0 and 2.0 which explain how to make Web content accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. Web \"content\" generally refers to the information in a Web page or Web application, including text, images, forms, and sounds. (More specific definitions are available in the WCAG documents.)<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/Overview.html |title=WAI Resources on Introducing Web Accessibility | publisher=[[W3C]] | work=[[Web Accessibility Initiative]] | accessdate=18 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe WCAG is separated into three levels of compliance, A, AA and AAA. Each level requires a stricter set of conformance guidelines, such as different versions of [[HTML]] (Transitional vs Strict) and other techniques that need to be incorporated into coding before accomplishing validation. Online tools allow users to submit their website and automatically run it through the WCAG guidelines and produce a report, stating whether or not they conform to each level of compliance. [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] also offers plugins which allow web developers to test these guidelines on their work from within the program.\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 36#WG 7 Culture.2C Language.2C and Human Functioning Activities|ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36 WG7]] 24751 Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training series is freely available and made of 3 parts: Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training, Standards inventory and Guidance on user needs mapping.\n\nAnother source of web accessibility guidance comes from the [[US government]]. In response to [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973#Section 508|Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act]], the Access Board developed standards to which U.S. federal agencies must comply in order to make their sites accessible. The U.S. General Services Administration has developed a website where one can take online training courses for free to learn about these rules.<ref>Section 508: [http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=5 508 Training].</ref>\n\n====Web accessibility features====\nExamples of accessibility features include:\n\n* [[Web Accessibility Initiative|WAI]]-AA compliance with the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines|WAI's WCAG]]\n* [[Semantic HTML|Semantic]] Web markup\n* (X)HTML Validation from the W3C for the pages content\n* CSS Validation from the W3C for the pages layout\n* Compliance with all guidelines from Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act\n* A high contrast version of the site for individuals with low vision, and a low contrast (yellow or blue) version of the site for individuals with dyslexia\n* Alternative media for any multimedia used on the site (video, flash, audio, etc.)\n* Simple and consistent navigation\n* Device independent\n\nWhile WCAG provides much technical information for use by web designers, coders and editors, ''BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility \u2013 Code of Practice''<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility \u2013 Code of Practice].</ref> has been introduced, initially in the UK, to help site owners and product managers to understand the importance of accessibility. It includes advice on the business case behind accessibility, and how organisations might usefully update their policies and production processes to embed accessibility in their business-as-usual. On 28 May 2019, BS 8878 was superseded by ''ISO 30071-1'',<ref>[https://www.hassellinclusion.com/iso-30071-1/ ISO 30071-1].</ref> the international Standard that built on BS 8878 and expanded it for international use.\n\nAnother useful idea is for websites to include a web accessibility statement on the site. Initially introduced in PAS 78,<ref>[http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/footer/accessibility-statement/general-web-accessibility-guidance/ PAS 78].</ref> the best practice for web accessibility statements has been updated in BS 8878<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ BS 8878].</ref> to emphasise the inclusion of: information on how disabled and elderly people could get a better experience of using the website by using assistive technologies or accessibility settings of browsers and operating systems (linking to \"BBC My Web My Way\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/ BBC My Web My Way], [[BBC]], UK.</ref> can be useful here); information on what accessibility features the site's creators have included, and if there are any user needs which the site doesn't currently support (for example, descriptive video to allow blind people to access the information in videos more easily); and contact details for disabled people to be able to use to let the site creators know if they have any problems in using the site. While validations against WCAG, and other accessibility badges can also be included, they should be put lower down the statement, as most disabled people still do not understand these technical terms.<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/accessibility/ Example of an accessibility statement written by the lead-author of BS 8878].</ref>\n\n==Education and accessibility for students==\n[[File:Vietnam phusical therapy school orphanage.jpg|thumb|upright|A teacher helps her student at an orphanage in central [[Vietnam]]. The orphanage caters to many abandoned and disabled children \u2013 through education and communication programs they are able to have a life that would otherwise not be possible.]]\n[[File:Latrine ramp school.jpg|thumb|Construction of a ramp for a school latrine in Ukunda, Kenya, making the school building more accessible to students with disabilities.]]\nEqual access to education for students with disabilities is supported in some countries by legislation. It is still challenging for some students with disabilities to fully participate in mainstream education settings, but many adaptive technologies and assistive programs are making improvements. In India, the [[Medical Council of India]] has now passed the directives to all the medical institutions to make them accessible to persons with disabilities.

Currently, states are permitted to develop two different types of tests in addition to the standard grade-level assessments to target students with special needs. First, the alternate assessment may be used to report proficiency for up to 1% of students in a state. Second, new regulations permit the use of alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards to report proficiency for up to 2% of students in a state.\n\nTo ensure these new tests generate results that permit valid inferences about student performance, they must be accessible to as many individuals as possible. The Test Accessibility and Modification Inventory (TAMI)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/tami.xml |title=Peabody College of Education and Human Development &#124; Vanderbilt University |publisher=Peabody.vanderbilt.edu |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114520/http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/tami.xml |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and its companion evaluation tool, the Accessibility Rating Matrix (ARM), were designed to facilitate the evaluation of tests and test items with a focus on enhancing their accessibility. Both instruments integrate principles of accessibility theory and were guided by research on universal design, assessment accessibility, cognitive load theory, and research on item-writing and test development. The TAMI is a non-commercial instrument that has been made available to all state assessment directors and testing companies. Assessment researchers have used the ARM to conduct accessibility reviews of state assessment items for several state departments of education.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Accessible publishing]]\n* [[Assistive technology]]\n* [[Accessible toilet]]\n* [[Accessible tourism]]\n* [[CEN/CENELEC Guide 6]]\n* [[Computer accessibility]]\n* [[Convenience]]\n* [[Universal design]]\n* [[Design for All (in ICT)]]\n* [[Human factors and ergonomics]]\n* [[Game accessibility]]\n* [[Knowbility]]\n* [[National Federation of the Blind v.

Workers in Western countries fare relatively well, having access to more services and training as well as legal protections against employment discrimination.

Among occupations with 100,000 or more people, dishwashers had the highest disability rate (14.3%), followed by refuse and recyclable material collectors (12.7%), personal care aides (11.9%), and janitors and building cleaners (11.8%).

Some workplaces have policies in place to provide \"reasonable accommodation\" for employees with disabilities, however, many do not. In some jurisdictions, employers may have legal requirements to end [[ableism|discrimination against persons with disabilities]].\n\nIt has been noted by researchers that where accommodations are in place for employees with disabilities, these frequently apply to individuals with \"pre-determined or apparent disabilities as determined by national social protection or Equality Authorities\",<ref name=\"Geisen165\">{{cite book|author1=Geisen, Thomas |author2=Henry George Harder|title=Disability Management and Workplace Integration: International Research Findings|year=2011|publisher=Gower Publishing|isbn=9781409418887|pages=165}}</ref> which include persons with pre-existing conditions who receive an official disability designation. One of the biggest challenges for employers is in developing policies and practises to manage employees who develop disabilities during the course of employment. Even where these exist, they tend to focus on workplace injuries, overlooking job retention challenges faced by employees who acquire a non-occupation injury or illness.

Such an approach neglects the influence of interventions in the transport system on broader and often conflicting economic, social and environmental goals. Accessibility based planning defines accessibility as the amount of services and jobs people can access within a certain travel time, considering one or more modes of transport such as walking, cycling, driving or public transport.\nUsing this definition accessibility does not only relate to the qualities of the transport system (e.g. travel speed, time or costs), but also to the qualities of the land use system (e.g. densities and mixes of opportunities). It thus provides planners with the possibility to understand interdependencies between transport and land use development. Accessibility planning opens the floor to a more normative approach to transportation planning involving different actors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.plan4sustainabletravel.org/key_themes/accessibility_key_features/|title=Planning for Sustainable Travel - Key Themes - Accessibility of Key Facilities|website=plan4sustainabletravel.org|access-date=2018-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208070132/http://www.plan4sustainabletravel.org/key_themes/accessibility_key_features/|archive-date=2018-02-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> For politicians, citizens and firms it might be easier to discuss the quality of access to education, services and markets than it is to discuss the inefficiencies of the transport system itself. Accessibility is also defined as \"the potential for interaction\".\n\n===Accessibility instruments===\nGenerally since the 1960s, accessibility instruments have been developed for a multitude of contexts and scopes. These instruments have their focus on origins and on destinations, they measure access through time, distance or cost and focus on different modes of transportation and geographical scales. Accessibility instruments are thus able to show what are the best accessible places or opportunities within a city or region, considering one or more specific modes of transportation, timeslots and target groups. In addition to this, the maps, which are produced as the instrument output, are considered as considerably useful when assessing the effects of new developments in a city. The first ever first large scale compendium of accessibility instruments was developed in 2012, under the framework of Cost Action TU1002, and is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/accessibility-instruments-2/|title=Accessibility Instruments|website=accessibilityplanning.eu}}</ref>\n\n===Potentials of accessibility in planning practice===\nDespite the high potential of accessibility in integrating the different components of urban planning, such as land use and transportation and the large number of accessibility instruments available in the research literature, the latter are not widely used to support urban planning practices.<ref>{{cite book |title=Accessibility Instruments for Planning Practice|date=June 2012|publisher=COST Office|isbn=978-989-20-3210-8 |author1=Angela Hull |author2=Cec\u00edlia Silva |author3=Luca Bertolini |url=http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/COST-Report-1-FINAL.pdf}}</ref> By keeping the accessibility language out of the practice level, older paradigms resist the more informed and people-centred approaches.\nFocusing on the link between research and practice, the Cost Action TU1002 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tut.fi/edge/?page_id=182|title=COST Action TU1002 {{!}} EDGE|website=tut.fi|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> seeks to find out why accessibility instruments are not more often used in urban planning practice and reflects on how to reduce such implementation gap in planning practice. The existence of accessibility instruments is fairly acknowledged, but practitioners do not appear to have found them useful or usable enough for addressing the tasks of sustainable urban management.\nThis Cost Action TU1002 is bringing together developers of accessibility instruments all over Europe and Australia to work with land use and transportation planning practitioners to explore how these instruments can play a more supportive role in enhancing accessibility in European cities and beyond. So far, 24 Accessibility Instruments have been gathered, analysed and described so as to understand in detail their characteristics, planning issues addressed and specific purposes, according to the developers\u2019 view. In turn, these instruments are being tested in a series of workshops with multidisciplinary teams of practitioners around Europe addressing the issue of usability from the practitioners\u2019 viewpoint. In doing so, it is expected that the additional knowledge on the potential of accessibility instruments for urban planning practice will have beneficial impacts on urban quality and decision making on urban land use patterns.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{for|the metric of transport connectivity for planning purposes|Accessibility (transport)}}\n[[File:Curitiba 10 2006 04 RIT.jpg|alt=ramps lowered from the side of a bus are level with the station's high platform|thumb|Accessibility to all [[autobus|buses]] is provided in [[Curitiba]]'s [[Rede Integrada de Transporte|public transport]] system, [[Brazil]].]]\n[[File:\u53f0\u5317\u8eca\u7ad9\u7121\u969c\u7919\u96fb\u68af.jpg|thumb|An [[elevator]] at [[Taipei Railway Station]] allowing for wheelchair access.]]\n[[File:Taxi wheelchair.jpg|thumb|A wheelchair accessible [[taxi]] with a rear ramp, [[Tokyo Motor Show]] 2009.]]\n[[File:Protram205 ramp.JPG|thumb|[[Wheelchair ramp|Wheelchair-access ramp]] in [[Protram 205 WrAs]] tram.]]\nProviding mobility to people with disabilities includes changes for public facilities like gently sloping paths of travel for people with wheelchairs and difficulty walking up stairs, or audio announcements for the blind; dedicated services like [[paratransit]]; and adaptations to personal vehicles.\n\n===Adapted automobiles for persons with disabilities===\n{{See also|Adapted automobile}}\nAutomobile accessibility also refers to ease of use by disabled people. Automobiles, whether a car or a van, can be adapted for a range of physical disabilities. Foot pedals can be raised, or replaced with hand-controlled devices. Wheelchair hoists, lifts or ramps may be customized according to the needs of the driver. [[Ergonomic]] adaptations, such as a lumbar support cushion, may also be needed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dimond|first=Bridget C.|title=Legal Aspects of Physiotherapy|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781405176156|pages=[https://archive.org/details/legalaspectsofph0000dimo/page/263 263]|url=https://archive.org/details/legalaspectsofph0000dimo/page/263}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the more limiting the disability, the more expensive the adaptation needed for the vehicle. Financial assistance is available through some organizations, such as [[Motability]] in the United Kingdom, which requires a contribution by the prospective vehicle owner. Motability makes vehicles available for purchase or lease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dimond|first=Bridget C.|title=Legal Aspects of Occupational Therapy|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781444348163|pages=n.p}}</ref>\n\nWhen an employee with a disability requires an adapted car for work use, the employee does not have to pay for a \"[[reasonable accommodation|reasonable adjustment]]\" in the United Kingdom; if the employer is unable to pay the cost, assistance is offered by government programs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Disability Rights Commission|title=Disability Discrimination Act 1995: Code of Practice; Employment and Occupation|year=2004|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=9780117034198|pages=5}}</ref>\n\n===Low floor===\n{{redirect|Low floor|more details|Low-floor bus|and|Low-floor tram}}\nA significant development in transportation, and [[public transport]] in particular, to achieve accessibility, is the move to \"low-floor\" vehicles. In a low-floor vehicle, access to part or all of the passenger cabin is unobstructed from one or more entrances by the presence of steps, enabling easier access for the infirm or people with [[Baby transport|push chairs]]. A further aspect may be that the entrance and corridors are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Low-floor vehicles have been developed for [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[trams]].\n\nA low floor in the vehicular sense is normally combined in a conceptual meaning with normal pedestrian access from a standard [[Curb (road)|kerb (curb)]] height. However, the accessibility of a low-floor vehicle can also be utilised from slightly raising portions of kerb at [[bus stop]]s, or through use of level boarding [[bus rapid transit]] stations or tram stops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/what-is-brt/|title=What is BRT? - Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|work=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> The combination of access from a kerb was the technological development of the 1990s, as step-free interior layouts for buses had existed in some cases for decades, with entrance steps being introduced as chassis designs and overall height regulations changed.\n\nLow-floor buses may also be designed with special height adjustment controls that permit a stationary bus to temporarily lower itself to ground level, permitting wheelchair access. This is referred to as a [[kneeling bus]].\n\nAt [[rapid transit]] systems, vehicles generally have floors in the same height as the platforms but the stations are often underground or elevated, so accessibility there isn't a question of providing low-floor vehicles, but providing a step-free access from street level to the platforms (generally by [[elevator]]s, which are somewhat restricted to disabled passengers only, so that the step-free access isn't obstructed by healthy people taking advantage).\n\n===Accessibility planning for transportation in the United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], local transport authorities are responsible for checking that all people who live within their area can access essential opportunities and services, and where gaps in provision are identified the local authorities are responsible for organizing changes to make new connections. These requirements are defined in the UK Community Planning Acts legislation<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theknowledgeexchangeblog.com/2017/01/25/community-planning-in-the-devolved-uk/|title=Community planning in the devolved UK|date=2017-01-25|work=The Knowledge Exchange Blog|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> and more detailed guidance has been issued by the [[Department for Transport]] for each [[Local authority#England|local authority]]. This includes the requirement to produce an Accessibility Plan under Community Planning legislation and to incorporate this within their [[Local Transport Plan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/parkingandtravel/transportplansandprojects/localtransportplan|title=Local Transport Plan {{!}} PLYMOUTH.GOV.UK|website=plymouth.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> An Accessibility Plan sets out how each local authority plans to improve access to employment, learning, health care, food shops and other services of local importance, particularly for disadvantaged groups and areas. Accessibility targets are defined in the accessibility plans, these are often the distance or time to access services by different modes of transport including walking, cycling and public transport.\n\nAccessibility Planning was introduced as a result of the report \"Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion\".<ref>Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&nbsp;\u2013 Social Exclusion Unit: \"[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100907154242/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |date=2010-09-07 }}\". February 2003.</ref> This report was the result of research carried out by the [[Social exclusion|Social Exclusion]] Unit. The United Kingdom also has a \"code of practice\" for making train and stations accessible: \"Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice\".<ref>Department of Transport & Transport Scotland: \"[http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/rail/railstations/accessiblestationdesigns/cop.pdf Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice]\". July 2008.</ref> This code of practice was first published in 2002 with the objective of compliance to Section 71B of the Railways Act 1993,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/43/section/71B|title=Railways Act 1993|website=legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> and revised after a public consultation period in 2008.\n\nMaking public services fully accessible to the public has led to some technological innovations. [[Public announcement]] systems using [[audio induction loop]] technology can broadcast announcements directly into the hearing aid of anyone with a hearing impairment, making them useful in such public places as auditoriums and train stations. Australia's government has supported the creation of the [[National Public Toilet Map]], to enable users to locate public toilet facilities throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toiletmap.gov.au/|title=National Public Toilet Map - Home|last=Map|first=National Public Toilet|website=toiletmap.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> [[GPS]] is also included as a feature. The service assists people with continence issues, which is estimated to be up to 18% of the population, including the elderly and families with young children.\n\n====Accessibility in urban design====\nAccessibility modifications to conventional urban environments has become common in recent decades. The use of a [[curb cut]], or [[kassel kerb]], to enable wheelchair or walker movement between sidewalk and street level is found in most major cities of wealthy countries. The creation of priority parking spaces and of [[disabled parking permit]]s has made them a standard feature of urban environments. Features that assist people with visual impairments include [[braille]] signs and [[tactile paving]] to allow a user with a cane to easily identify stairways, train platforms, and similar areas that could pose a physical danger to anyone who has a visual impairment.\n\nUrban design features that may appear to be simple conveniences for persons without disabilities are often essential to anyone who has a disability. The loss of these features presents a significant barrier. For example, sometimes a lack of prompt snow-clearing on sidewalks of major Canadian city streets means that wheelchair and walker users cannot reach pedestrian crossing buttons on crosswalk posts, due to snow bank accumulation around the posts, making the crossing buttons inaccessible. Public services must take into account the need to maintain accessibility features in the urban environment.\n\n==Housing==\n{{Further|Accessible housing}}\nMost existing and new housing, even in the wealthiest nations, lack basic accessibility features unless the designated, immediate occupant of a home currently has a disability. However, there are some initiatives to change typical residential practices so that new homes incorporate basic access features such as zero-step entries and door widths adequate for wheelchairs to pass through. [[Occupational Therapist]]s are a professional group skilled in the assessment and making of recommendations to improve access to homes.<ref>Occupational therapy research on assistive technology and physical environmental issues: A literature review, Fange et al. (2006), Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy</ref> They are involved in both the adaptation of existing housing to improve accessibility,<ref>Changes in accessibility and usability in housing: an exploration of the housing adaptation process (2005), Fange and Iwarsson, Occupational Therapy International</ref> and in the design of future housing.<ref>Accessibility and usability in housing: construct validity and implications for research and practice (2003), Fange and Iwarsson, Disability and Rehabilitation</ref>\n\nThe broad concept of [[Universal design]] is relevant to housing, as it is to all aspects of the built environment. Furthermore, a [[Visitability]] movement<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/visitability|title=Visitability {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> begun by grass roots disability advocates in the 1980s focuses specifically on changing construction practices in new housing. This movement, a network of interested people working in their locales, works on educating, passing laws, and spurring voluntary home access initiatives with the intention that basic access become a routine part of new home construction.\n\n===Accessibility and 'ageing in place'===\nAccessibility in the design of housing and household devices has become more prominent in recent decades due to a rapidly ageing population in developed countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/accessibility/homes/|title=Accessible Home Design: Information & Ideas|work=Disabled World|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> Ageing seniors may wish to continue living independently, but the ageing process naturally increases the disabilities that a senior citizen will experience. A growing trend is the desire for many senior citizens to 'age in place', living as independently as possible for as long as possible. Accessibility modifications that allow ageing in place are becoming more common. Housing may even be designed to incorporate accessibility modifications that can be made throughout the life cycle of the residents.\n\n==Voting==\n\nUnder the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], states parties are bound to assure accessible [[election]]s, [[voting]], and voting procedures. In 2018, the United Nations [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] issued an opinion that all polling stations should be fully accessible. At the [[European Court of Human Rights]], there are currently two ongoing cases about the accessibility of polling places and voting procedures. They were brought against [[Slovenia]] by two voters and the [[Slovenian Disability Rights Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2717030/disabled-take-slovenia-to-human-rights-court-over-polling-stations-accessibility|title=STA: Disabled take Slovenia to Human Rights Court over polling stations accessibility|website=english.sta.si|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> As of January 2020, the cases, called Toplak v.

Access to the technology is restricted to those who can afford it, but it has become more widespread in Western countries in recent years. For those who use it, it provides the ability to access information and services by minimizing the barriers of distance and cost as well as the accessibility and usability of the interface. In many countries this has led to initiatives, laws and/or regulations that aim toward providing universal access to the internet and to phone systems at reasonable cost to citizens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing.html |title=Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium}}</ref>\n\nA major advantage of advanced technology is its flexibility. Some technologies can be used at home, in the workplace, and in school, expanding the ability of the user to participate in various spheres of daily life. [[Augmentative and alternative communication]] technology is one such area of IT progress. It includes inventions such as [[speech-generating device]]s, [[Teletypewriter]] devices, adaptive pointing devices to replace computer mouse devices, and many others. They can be adapted to create accessibility to a range of tasks, and may be suitable for different kinds of disability.\n\nThe following impairments are some of the disabilities that affect communications and technology access, as well as many other life activities:\n* [[communication disorder]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.nih.gov/topic/SpeechCommunicationDisorders|title=Speech and Communication Disorders|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}</ref>\n* [[hearing impairment]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hearingdisordersanddeafness.html|title=Hearing Disorders and Deafness|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n* [[visual impairment]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/visionimpairmentandblindness.html|title=Visual Impairment and Blindness|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n* [[mobility impairment]]s;\n* a [[learning disability]] or impairment in mental functioning.\n\nEach kind of disability requires a different kind of accommodation, and this may require analysis by a medical specialist, an educational specialist or a job analysis when the impairment requires accommodation.\n* [[Job analysis]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2538128|title=Pre-employment and periodical health examinations, job analysis and placement of workers| pmid=13276805|volume=13|issue=4|year=1955|journal=Bull.

Quadriplegics have the most profound disability, and the voice operated wheel chair technology was first developed in 1977 to provide increased mobility. The original version replaced the joystick system with a module that recognized 8 commands. Many other technology accommodation improvements have evolved from this initial development.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=849131|title=Voice Operated Wheelchair| volume=58|issue=4|date=April 1977|journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil|pages=169\u201375|last1=Clark|first1=J. A.|last2=Roemer|first2=R. B.}}</ref>\n\nMissing arms and fingers interferes with the use of a keyboard and pointing device (mouse). This can be one of the most devastating types of handicap, and technology has made great improvements in this area during the last 20 years. Speech recognition devices and software can improve technology access.\n\n====Communication (including speech) impairments====\nA communication disorder interferes with the ability to produce clearly understandable speech. There can be many different causes, such as nerve degeneration, muscle degeneration, stroke, and vocal cord injury. The modern method to deal with speaking disabilities has been to provide a text interface for a speech synthesizer for complete vocal disability. This can be a great improvement for people that have been limited to the use of a throat vibrator to produce speech since the 1960s.\n\n====Hearing impairment====\nAn individual satisfies the definition of hearing disabled when hearing loss is about 30&nbsp;dB for a single frequency, but this is not always perceptible as a handicap.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hear-it.org/Defining-hearing-loss|title=Definition of hearing loss \u2013 Mild, Moderate, Severe & Profound - hear-it.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> For example, loss of sensitivity in one ear interferes with sound localization (directional hearing), which can interfere with communication in a crowd. This is often recognized when certain words are confused during normal conversation. This can interfere with voice-only interfaces, like automated customer service telephone systems, because it is sometimes difficult to increase the volume and repeat the message.\n\nMild to moderate hearing loss may be accommodated with a hearing aid that amplifies ambient sounds. Portable devices with speed recognition that can produce text can reduce problems associated with understanding conversation. This kind of hearing loss is relatively common, and this often grows worse with age.\n\nThe modern method to deal with profound hearing disability is the Internet using email or word processing applications. The [[telecommunications device for the deaf]] (TDD) became available in the form of the [[Teleprinter|teletype]] (TTY) during the 1960s. These devices consist of a keyboard, display and modem that connects two or more of these devices using a dedicated wire or plain old telephone service.\n\n====Visual impairments====\nA wide range of technology products are available to deal with visual impairment. This includes screen magnification for monitors, screen-reading technology for computers and small screen devices, mouse-over speech synthesis browsing, braille displays, braille printers, braille cameras, voice-operated phones, and tablets.\n\nOne emerging product that will make ordinary computer displays available for the blind is the refreshable tactile display, which is very different from a conventional braille display. This provides a raised surface corresponding to the bright and dim spots on a conventional display. An example is the Touch Sight Camera for the Blind.\n\n[[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] ''(V1.0 Released 7 September 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-speech-synthesis-20040907/|title=Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0|website=w3.org}}</ref>)'' and [[Speech Recognition Grammar Specification]] ''(V1.0 released 16 March 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/|title=Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0|website=w3.org}}</ref>)'' are relatively recent technologies intended to standardize communication interfaces using Augmented [[Backus\u2013Naur form|BNF]] Form and [[XML]] Form. These technologies assist visual impairments and physical impairment by providing interactive access to web content without the need to visually observe the content. While these technologies provides access for visually impaired individuals, the primary benefactor has been automated systems that replace live human customer service representatives that handle telephone calls.\n\n===Web accessibility===\n{{See also |Web accessibility}}\n\n====International standards and guidelines====\nThere have been a few major movements to coordinate a set of guidelines for accessibility for the [[World Wide Web|web]]. The first and most well known is The [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] (WAI), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([[W3C]]). This organization developed the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]] (WCAG) 1.0 and 2.0 which explain how to make Web content accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. Web \"content\" generally refers to the information in a Web page or Web application, including text, images, forms, and sounds. (More specific definitions are available in the WCAG documents.)<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/Overview.html |title=WAI Resources on Introducing Web Accessibility | publisher=[[W3C]] | work=[[Web Accessibility Initiative]] | accessdate=18 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe WCAG is separated into three levels of compliance, A, AA and AAA. Each level requires a stricter set of conformance guidelines, such as different versions of [[HTML]] (Transitional vs Strict) and other techniques that need to be incorporated into coding before accomplishing validation. Online tools allow users to submit their website and automatically run it through the WCAG guidelines and produce a report, stating whether or not they conform to each level of compliance. [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] also offers plugins which allow web developers to test these guidelines on their work from within the program.\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 36#WG 7 Culture.2C Language.2C and Human Functioning Activities|ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36 WG7]] 24751 Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training series is freely available and made of 3 parts: Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training, Standards inventory and Guidance on user needs mapping.\n\nAnother source of web accessibility guidance comes from the [[US government]]. In response to [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973#Section 508|Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act]], the Access Board developed standards to which U.S. federal agencies must comply in order to make their sites accessible. The U.S. General Services Administration has developed a website where one can take online training courses for free to learn about these rules.<ref>Section 508: [http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=5 508 Training].</ref>\n\n====Web accessibility features====\nExamples of accessibility features include:\n\n* [[Web Accessibility Initiative|WAI]]-AA compliance with the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines|WAI's WCAG]]\n* [[Semantic HTML|Semantic]] Web markup\n* (X)HTML Validation from the W3C for the pages content\n* CSS Validation from the W3C for the pages layout\n* Compliance with all guidelines from Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act\n* A high contrast version of the site for individuals with low vision, and a low contrast (yellow or blue) version of the site for individuals with dyslexia\n* Alternative media for any multimedia used on the site (video, flash, audio, etc.)\n* Simple and consistent navigation\n* Device independent\n\nWhile WCAG provides much technical information for use by web designers, coders and editors, ''BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility \u2013 Code of Practice''<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility \u2013 Code of Practice].</ref> has been introduced, initially in the UK, to help site owners and product managers to understand the importance of accessibility. It includes advice on the business case behind accessibility, and how organisations might usefully update their policies and production processes to embed accessibility in their business-as-usual. On 28 May 2019, BS 8878 was superseded by ''ISO 30071-1'',<ref>[https://www.hassellinclusion.com/iso-30071-1/ ISO 30071-1].</ref> the international Standard that built on BS 8878 and expanded it for international use.\n\nAnother useful idea is for websites to include a web accessibility statement on the site. Initially introduced in PAS 78,<ref>[http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/footer/accessibility-statement/general-web-accessibility-guidance/ PAS 78].</ref> the best practice for web accessibility statements has been updated in BS 8878<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ BS 8878].</ref> to emphasise the inclusion of: information on how disabled and elderly people could get a better experience of using the website by using assistive technologies or accessibility settings of browsers and operating systems (linking to \"BBC My Web My Way\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/ BBC My Web My Way], [[BBC]], UK.</ref> can be useful here); information on what accessibility features the site's creators have included, and if there are any user needs which the site doesn't currently support (for example, descriptive video to allow blind people to access the information in videos more easily); and contact details for disabled people to be able to use to let the site creators know if they have any problems in using the site. While validations against WCAG, and other accessibility badges can also be included, they should be put lower down the statement, as most disabled people still do not understand these technical terms.<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/accessibility/ Example of an accessibility statement written by the lead-author of BS 8878].</ref>\n\n==Education and accessibility for students==\n[[File:Vietnam phusical therapy school orphanage.jpg|thumb|upright|A teacher helps her student at an orphanage in central [[Vietnam]]. The orphanage caters to many abandoned and disabled children \u2013 through education and communication programs they are able to have a life that would otherwise not be possible.]]\n[[File:Latrine ramp school.jpg|thumb|Construction of a ramp for a school latrine in Ukunda, Kenya, making the school building more accessible to students with disabilities.]]\nEqual access to education for students with disabilities is supported in some countries by legislation. It is still challenging for some students with disabilities to fully participate in mainstream education settings, but many adaptive technologies and assistive programs are making improvements. In India, the [[Medical Council of India]] has now passed the directives to all the medical institutions to make them accessible to persons with disabilities.

Talking books in the form of talking textbooks are available in Canadian secondary and post-secondary schools. Also, students may require adaptive technology to access computers and the Internet. These may be tax-exempt expenses in some jurisdictions with a medical prescription.\n\n===Test accessibility===\nTest accessibility is defined as the extent to which a test and its constituent item set eliminates barriers and permits the test-taker to demonstrate his or her knowledge of the tested content.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Test accessibility involves an interaction between features of the test and individual test-taker characteristics.\n\nWith the passage of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001 in the United States,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> student accountability in essential content areas such as reading, mathematics, and science has become a major area of focus in educational reform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/execsumm.html|title=Executive Summary of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001|date=2007-11-20|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> As a result, test developers have needed to create tests to ensure all students, including those with special needs (e.g., students identified with disabilities), are given the opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which they have mastered the content measured on state assessments. Currently, states are permitted to develop two different types of tests in addition to the standard grade-level assessments to target students with special needs. First, the alternate assessment may be used to report proficiency for up to 1% of students in a state. Second, new regulations permit the use of alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards to report proficiency for up to 2% of students in a state.\n\nTo ensure these new tests generate results that permit valid inferences about student performance, they must be accessible to as many individuals as possible. The Test Accessibility and Modification Inventory (TAMI)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/tami.xml |title=Peabody College of Education and Human Development &#124; Vanderbilt University |publisher=Peabody.vanderbilt.edu |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114520/http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/tami.xml |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and its companion evaluation tool, the Accessibility Rating Matrix (ARM), were designed to facilitate the evaluation of tests and test items with a focus on enhancing their accessibility. Both instruments integrate principles of accessibility theory and were guided by research on universal design, assessment accessibility, cognitive load theory, and research on item-writing and test development. The TAMI is a non-commercial instrument that has been made available to all state assessment directors and testing companies. Assessment researchers have used the ARM to conduct accessibility reviews of state assessment items for several state departments of education.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Accessible publishing]]\n* [[Assistive technology]]\n* [[Accessible toilet]]\n* [[Accessible tourism]]\n* [[CEN/CENELEC Guide 6]]\n* [[Computer accessibility]]\n* [[Convenience]]\n* [[Universal design]]\n* [[Design for All (in ICT)]]\n* [[Human factors and ergonomics]]\n* [[Game accessibility]]\n* [[Knowbility]]\n* [[National Federation of the Blind v.

Misoprostol taken vaginally tends to have fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications such as ibuprofen reduce pain with medication abortion.\n\nAlthough medical abortion is associated with more bleeding than surgical abortion, overall bleeding for the two methods is minimal and not clinically different. In a large-scale prospective trial published in 1992 of more than 16,000 women undergoing medical abortion using mifepristone with varying doses of [[gemeprost]] or [[sulprostone]], only 0.1% had hemorrhage requiring a [[blood transfusion]]. It is often advised to contact a health care provider if there is bleeding to such degree that more than two pads are soaked per hour for two consecutive hours.\n\n===Management of bleeding===\nVaginal bleeding generally diminishes gradually over about two weeks after a medical abortion, but in individual cases spotting can last up to 45 days.<ref name=\"WHO FAQs 2006\" /> If the woman is well, neither prolonged bleeding nor the presence of tissue in the uterus (as detected by [[obstetric ultrasonography]]) is an indication for surgical intervention (that is, [[vacuum aspiration]] or [[dilation and curettage]]). Remaining [[products of conception]] will be expelled during subsequent vaginal bleeding. Still, surgical intervention may be carried out on the woman's request, if the bleeding is heavy or prolonged, or causes [[anemia]], or if there is evidence of [[endometritis]].\n\n=== Complications ===\nComplications following medical abortion with mifepristone and misprostol under 10 weeks pregnancy are rare; according to two large reviews, bleeding requiring a blood transfusion occurred in 0.03-0.6% of women and serious infection in 0.01-0.5%.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nBetween January 2005 and June 2008 rates of serious infection after medical abortion at Planned Parenthood affiliate centers declined by 93% after a change from vaginal to [[buccal administration]] of misoprostol combined with the routine preventative use of [[doxycycline]] antibiotics.<ref name=\"Fjerstad 2009b\" />\n\nA few rare cases of deaths from [[Clostridium|clostridial]] [[toxic shock syndrome]] have occurred following medical abortions.<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=1188182 | pmid=16093445 | doi=10.1503/cmaj.050980 | volume=173 | issue=5 | title=Septic shock after medical abortions with mifepristone (Mifeprex, RU 486) and misoprostol | year=2005 | journal=CMAJ | page=485 | last1 = Murray | first1 = S | last2 = Wooltorton | first2 = E}}</ref>\n\n==Pharmacology==\nMifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/health-medicine/science-behind-abortion-pill-180963762/ |title = The Science Behind the \"Abortion Pill\"}}</ref><ref>Medical management of first trimestesr abortion, Society of Family Planning Clinical Guideline, Contraception 89(2014) 148-161</ref> causing the lining of the uterus to thin and preventing the embryo from staying implanted and growing.
