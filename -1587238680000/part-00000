In addition there are three much smaller islets, [[Temotufoliki|Motu Foliki]], [[Lefogaki|Lafogaki]] and [[Teatua a Taepoa|Te Afua-a-Taepoa]] spread around the encircling reef flat.\n\nThe [[pulaka]] pits are located on Lakena as the Nanumeans want the main island of Nanumea to remain [[mosquito]] free.

The Nanumean dialect of the [[Tuvaluan language]] is closely related to other west Polynesian languages, including the Tongan language, [[Tokelauan language|Tokelauan]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and the languages of the [[Polynesian outlier]]s. Although the eight Tuvalu communities have distinctive accents and some distinctive vocabulary, the dialects of Tuvalu are mutually intelligible to Tuvalu speakers with the exception of the language of [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]] atoll, whose inhabitants speak a dialect of the [[Gilbertese language]] (with the exception of small children, most Tuvaluans from Nui also speak Tuvaluan). With this exception, Tuvaluan is universally understood and spoken in Tuvalu. [[English language|English]] is also spoken, especially in Tuvalu's capital, and is one of the [[official language]]s of the central government.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Canoe carving on Nanumea.jpg|thumb|left|175px| Canoe carving on Nanumea]]\nThe rich [[Tuvaluan mythology|mythical history of Nanumea]] describes a settlement led by an explorer/adventurer and warrior from the south named Tefolaha. Some accounts say Tefolaha and his crew came from [[Tonga]], others name [[Samoa]], but whether these names refer to today's Tonga and Samoa is not certain. Tefolaha, traditional accounts say, found the island of Nanumea populated by two women, Pai and Vau, whom it was believed had formed it from baskets of sand. Tefolaha wagered with them for the island and eventually won it through trickery, whereupon Pai and Vau departed.<ref name=\"GSS1\">{{cite web| last = Samuels | first = George Siosi  | work= The Loop |title= Tales From Nanumea: Pai & Vau (Animation)|date =|url= http://www.theloop.com.au/siosism/portfolio/tales-from-nanumea-pai-vau/36952 | accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> Tefolaha's sons and daughters are today the founding ancestors of leading families and the seven chiefly lineages of Nanumea. Today's population also traces descent from crew members who arrived with Tefolaha, and from later visitors from the far distant and more recent past. Nanumean traditions describe the islets, [[Temotufoliki|Motu Foliki]], [[Lefogaki|Lafogaki]] and [[Teatua a Taepoa|Te Afua-a-Taepoa]], as being formed when sand spilled from the baskets of two women, Pai and Vau, when they were forced off Nanumea by Tefolaha.<ref name=\"TAH7\">{{cite book |last1=Taulu Isako |first1= Hugh Laracy (ed.) |authorlink1= |title= Tuvalu: A History |url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= 1983 |publisher= Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific and Government of Tuvalu |location= |language= |isbn=|oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=49|chapter=Chapter 7 \u2013 Nanumea|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}</ref>\n\nThe legendary, miraculous spear Kaumaile came with the hero Tefolaha to Nanumea.

Some accounts say Tefolaha and his crew came from [[Tonga]], others name [[Samoa]], but whether these names refer to today's Tonga and Samoa is not certain. Tefolaha, traditional accounts say, found the island of Nanumea populated by two women, Pai and Vau, whom it was believed had formed it from baskets of sand.

The island also elects and sends two representatives to the Tuvalu national [[Parliament of Tuvalu|parliament]] based in the capital, [[Funafuti]].\n\nWhile Nanumea atoll remains the homeland for all Nanumeans, there are increasingly large populations of Nanumean residents in the capital, Funafuti, in New Zealand (especially [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]]), and in [[Australia]] and other [[Pacific Rim|Pacific locations]].
