This change is coordinate invariant and therefore the Lie derivative is defined on any  [[differentiable manifold]].\n\nFunctions, tensor fields and forms can be differentiated with respect to a vector field. If ''T'' is a tensor field and ''X'' is a vector field, then the Lie derivative of ''T'' with respect to ''X'' is denoted <math> \\mathcal{L}_X(T)</math>. The [[differential operator]] <math> T \\mapsto \\mathcal{L}_X(T)</math> is a [[derivation (differential algebra)|derivation]] of the algebra of [[tensor fields]] of the underlying manifold.\n\nThe Lie derivative commutes with [[Tensor contraction|contraction]] and the [[exterior derivative]] on [[differential forms]].\n\nAlthough there are many concepts of taking a derivative in differential geometry, they all agree when the expression being differentiated is a function or [[scalar field]]. Thus in this case the word \"Lie\" is dropped, and one simply speaks of the derivative of a function.\n\nThe Lie derivative of a vector field ''Y'' with respect to another vector field ''X'' is known as the \"[[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]\"  of ''X'' and ''Y'', and is often denoted [''X'',''Y''] instead of <math> \\mathcal{L}_X(Y)</math>. The space of vector fields forms a [[Lie algebra]] with respect to this Lie bracket. The Lie derivative constitutes an infinite-dimensional [[Lie algebra representation]] of this Lie algebra, due to the identity\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]} T = \\mathcal{L}_X \\mathcal{L}_{Y} T - \\mathcal{L}_Y \\mathcal{L}_X T,</math>\n\nvalid for any vector fields ''X'' and ''Y'' and any tensor field ''T''.\n\nConsidering vector fields as [[Lie algebra|infinitesimal generator]]s of [[Flow (mathematics)|flows]] (i.e. one-dimensional [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] of [[diffeomorphism]]s) on ''M'', the Lie derivative is the [[Lie_algebra_representation#Infinitesimal_Lie_group_representations|differential]] of the representation of the [[Diffeomorphism#Diffeomorphism group|diffeomorphism group]] on tensor fields, analogous to Lie algebra representations as [[Lie algebra representation#Infinitesimal Lie group representations|infinitesimal representations]] associated to [[group representation]] in [[Lie group]] theory.\n\nGeneralisations exist for [[spinor]] fields, [[fibre bundle]]s with [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] and vector-valued [[differential forms]].\n\n==Motivation==\nA 'na\u00efve' attempt to define the derivative of a [[tensor field]] with respect to a [[vector field]] would be to take the [[Tensor#As multidimensional arrays|components]] of the tensor field and take the [[directional derivative]] with respect to the vector field of each component. However, this definition is undesirable because it is not invariant under [[Manifold#Transition map|changes of coordinate system]], e.g. the naive derivative expressed in polar or spherical coordinates differs from the naive derivative of the components in polar or spherical coordinates. On an abstract [[manifold]] such a definition is meaningless and ill defined. In [[differential geometry]], there are  three main coordinate independent notions of differentiation of tensor fields: Lie derivatives, derivatives with respect to [[Connection_(differential_geometry)|connections]], and the [[exterior derivative]] of completely anti symmetric (covariant) tensors or [[differential forms]]. The main difference between the Lie derivative and a derivative with respect to a connection is that the latter derivative of a tensor field with respect to a [[tangent space|tangent vector]] is well-defined even if it is not specified how to extend that tangent vector to a vector field. However a connection requires the choice of an additional geometric structure (e.g. a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] or just an abstract [[Connection_(differential_geometry)|connection]]) on the manifold. In contrast, when taking a Lie derivative, no additional structure on the manifold is needed, but it is impossible to talk about the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to a single tangent vector, since the value of the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to a vector field ''X'' at a point ''p'' depends on the value of ''X'' in a neighborhood of ''p'', not just at ''p'' itself. Finally, the exterior derivative of differential forms does not require any additional choices, but is only a well defined derivative of differential forms (including functions).\n\n==Definition==\nThe Lie derivative may be defined in several equivalent ways. To keep things simple, we begin by defining the Lie derivative acting on scalar functions and vector fields, before moving on to the definition for general tensors.\n\n===The (Lie) derivative of a function===\nThe problem with generalizing the derivative of a function when we consider functions over manifolds is that the usual [[difference quotient]] requires we define addition on the function's inputs but it is meaningless to add points on a manifold which is not a vector space.  The critical issue, however, is to consider how the function changes relative to smooth displacements of the points.  The Lie derivative of a scalar function can be thought of as a definition of the derivative where we are using the flows defined by vector fields to displace the points:\n\n:The Lie derivative of a function ''f'' with respect to a [[vector field]] ''X'' at a point ''p'' of the manifold ''M'' is the value\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_X f (p) = \\lim_{t\\to 0} \\frac{f(P(t;p)) - f(p)}{t}</math>\nwhere <math>P(t; p)</math> is the point to which the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] defined by the vector field <math>X</math> maps the point <math>p</math> as follows: in a coordinate neighbourhood with coordinates <math> x^1,..., x^n</math>we can express the vector field (which we consider as a first order differential operator) as <math>X = X^\\mu(x)\\partial_\\mu = X^\\mu \\frac\\partial{\\partial x^\\mu}</math>. Locally, the flow is then defined by <math> x^\\mu(P(t; p)) = P^\\mu(t, p^1,..., p^n)</math> where <math>p^\\mu = x^\\mu(p)</math> and <math>P^\\mu(t;0)</math> is the solution to the partial differential equation  \n::<math> \\partial_t P^\\mu(t; p^1, ..., p^n) = X^\\mu(P^1(t; p^1,..., p^n),..., P^n(t, p^1, ..., p^n)) </math>\nwith <math>P^\\mu(0; p^1,...,p^n) = p^\\mu</math>.\n \nWe can then identify the Lie derivative of a function at ''p'' with the [[directional derivative]]:\n::<math>(\\mathcal{L}_X f)(p) = (X f)(p) = X^\\mu \\partial_\\mu(f(p(x^1,...,x^n))) = \\partial_t (f(P(t; p)))</math>\n\n===The Lie derivative of a vector field===\nIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are both vector fields, then the Lie derivative of ''Y'' with respect to ''X'' is also known as the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] of ''X'' and ''Y'', and is sometimes denoted <math>[X,Y]</math>. There are several approaches to defining the Lie bracket, all of which are equivalent. We list two definitions here, corresponding to the two definitions of a vector field given above:\n\n* The Lie bracket of ''X'' and ''Y'' at ''p'' is given in local coordinates by the formula\n\n<math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y (p) = [X,Y](p) = \\partial_X Y(p) - \\partial_Y X(p),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\partial_X</math> and <math>\\partial_Y</math> denote the operations of taking the [[directional derivative]]s with respect to ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively. Here we are treating a vector in ''n''-dimensional space as an ''n''-[[tuple]], so that its directional derivative is simply the tuple consisting of the directional derivatives of its coordinates. Although the final expression <math>\\partial_X Y(p) - \\partial_Y X(p)</math> appearing in this definition does not depend on the choice of local coordinates, the individual terms <math>\\partial_X Y(p)</math> and <math>\\partial_Y X(p)</math> do depend on the choice of coordinates.\n\n* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are vector fields on a manifold ''M'' according to the second definition, then the operator <math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y = [X,Y]</math> defined by the formula\n::<math>[X,Y]: C^\\infty(M) \\rightarrow C^\\infty(M)</math>\n::<math>[X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))</math>\nis a derivation of order zero of the algebra of smooth functions of ''M'', i.e. this operator is a vector field according to the second definition.\n\n===The Lie derivative of a tensor field===\nMore generally, if we have a [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[tensor field]] ''T'' of [[Tensor order|rank]] <math>(q,r)</math> and a differentiable [[vector field]] ''Y'' (i.e. a differentiable section of the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM''), then we can define the Lie derivative of ''T'' along ''Y''. Let, for some open interval ''I'' around 0, {{nowrap|''\u03c6'' : ''M'' \u00d7 ''I'' \u2192 ''M''}} be the one-parameter semigroup of local diffeomorphisms of ''M'' induced by the [[vector flow]] of ''Y'' and denote {{nowrap|1=''\u03c6''<sub>''t''</sub>(''p'') := ''\u03c6''(''p'', ''t'')}}. For each sufficiently small ''t'', ''\u03c6''<sub>''t''</sub> is a diffeomorphism from a [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] in ''M'' to another neighborhood in ''M'', and ''\u03c6''<sub>0</sub> is the identity diffeomorphism. The Lie derivative of ''T'' is defined at a point ''p'' by\n\n:<math>(\\mathcal{L}_Y T)_p=\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\left((\\varphi_{-t})_*T_{\\varphi_{t}(p)}\\right).</math>\n\nwhere <math>(\\varphi_t)_*</math> is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along the diffeomorphism and <math>(\\varphi_t)^*</math> is the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] along the diffeomorphism. Intuitively, if you have a tensor field <math>T</math> and a vector field ''Y'', then <math>\\mathcal{L}_{Y} T</math> is the infinitesimal change you would see when you flow <math>T</math> using the vector field \u2212''Y'', which is the same thing as the infinitesimal change you would see in <math>T</math> if you yourself flowed along the vector field  ''Y''.\n\nWe now give an algebraic definition. The algebraic definition for the Lie derivative of a tensor field follows from the following four axioms:\n\n:'''Axiom 1.''' The Lie derivative of a function is equal to the directional derivative of the function. This fact is often expressed by the formula\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Yf=Y(f)</math>\n\n:'''Axiom 2.''' The Lie derivative obeys the following version of Leibniz's rule: For any tensor fields ''S'' and ''T'', we have\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Y(S\\otimes T)=(\\mathcal{L}_YS)\\otimes T+S\\otimes (\\mathcal{L}_YT).</math>\n\n:'''Axiom 3.''' The Lie derivative obeys the Leibniz rule with respect to [[Tensor contraction|contraction]]:\n::<math> \\mathcal{L}_X (T(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)) = (\\mathcal{L}_X T)(Y_1,\\ldots, Y_n) + T((\\mathcal{L}_X Y_1), \\ldots, Y_n) + \\cdots + T(Y_1, \\ldots, (\\mathcal{L}_X Y_n)) </math>\n\n:'''Axiom 4.''' The Lie derivative commutes with exterior derivative on functions:\n::<math> [\\mathcal{L}_X, d] = 0 </math>\n\nIf these axioms hold, then applying the Lie derivative <math>\\mathcal{L}_X</math> to the relation <math> df(Y) = Y(f) </math> shows that\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y (f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f)),</math>\nwhich is one of the standard definitions for the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]].\n\nThe Lie derivative acting on a differential form is the [[Commutator#Ring theory|anticommutator]] of the [[interior product]] with the exterior derivative. So if \u03b1 is a differential form,\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha=i_Yd\\alpha+di_Y\\alpha.</math>\nThis follows easily by checking that the expression commutes with exterior derivative, is a derivation (being an anticommutator of graded derivations) and does the right thing on functions.\n\nExplicitly, let ''T'' be a tensor field of type {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}}. Consider ''T'' to be a differentiable [[multilinear map]] of [[smooth function|smooth]] [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] ''\u03b1''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''\u03b1''<sup>''q''</sup> of the cotangent bundle ''T''<sup>\u2217</sup>''M'' and of sections ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>p</sub> of the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'', written ''T''(''\u03b1''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ...) into '''R'''. Define the Lie derivative of ''T'' along ''Y'' by the formula\n\n:<math>(\\mathcal{L}_Y T)(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots) =Y(T(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\ldots,X_1,X_2,\\ldots))</math>\n::<math>- T(\\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots)\n- T(\\alpha_1, \\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots) -\\ldots </math>\n::<math>- T(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, \\mathcal{L}_YX_1, X_2, \\ldots)\n-  T(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, \\mathcal{L}_YX_2, \\ldots) - \\ldots\n</math>\n\nThe analytic and algebraic definitions can be proven to be equivalent using the properties of the pushforward and the [[General Leibniz rule|Leibniz rule]] for differentiation. The Lie derivative commutes with the contraction.\n\n===The Lie derivative of a differential form===\n{{see also|Interior product}}\nA particularly important class of tensor fields is the class of [[differential forms]]. The restriction of the Lie derivative to the space of differential forms is closely related to the [[exterior derivative]]. Both the Lie derivative and the exterior derivative attempt to capture the idea of a derivative in different ways. These differences can be bridged by introducing the idea of an [[interior product]], after which the relationships falls out as an identity known as '''Cartan's formula'''. Cartan's formula can also be used as a definition of the Lie derivative on the space of differential forms.\n\nLet ''M'' be a manifold and ''X'' a vector field on ''M''. Let <math>\\omega \\in \\Lambda^{k+1}(M)</math> be a {{nowrap|(''k'' + 1)}}-[[Differential form|form]], i.e. for each <math>p \\in M</math>, <math>\\omega(p)</math> is an [[Alternating form|alternating]] [[multilinear map]] from <math>(T_p M)^{k + 1}</math> to the real numbers. The [[interior product]] of ''X'' and ''\u03c9'' is the ''k''-form <math>i_X\\omega</math> defined as\n\n:<math>(i_X\\omega) (X_1, \\ldots, X_k) = \\omega (X,X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\,</math>\n\nThe differential form <math>i_X\\omega</math> is also called the '''contraction''' of ''\u03c9'' with ''X'', and\n:<math>i_X:\\Lambda^{k+1}(M) \\rightarrow \\Lambda^k(M)</math>\n\nand  <math>i_X</math> is a <math>\\wedge</math>-[[derivation (abstract algebra)|antiderivation]]. That is, <math>i_X</math> is '''R'''-linear, and\n\n:<math>i_X (\\omega \\wedge \\eta) = \n(i_X \\omega) \\wedge \\eta + (-1)^k \\omega \\wedge (i_X \\eta)</math>\n\nfor <math>\\omega \\in \\Lambda^k(M)</math> and \u03b7 another differential form. Also, for a function <math>f \\in \\Lambda^0(M)</math>, that is, a real- or complex-valued function on ''M'', one has\n\n:<math>i_{fX} \\omega = f\\,i_X\\omega</math>\n\nwhere <math>f X</math> denotes the product of ''f'' and ''X''.\nThe relationship between [[exterior derivative]]s and Lie derivatives can then be summarized as follows. First, since the Lie derivative of a function ''f'' with respect to a vector field ''X'' is the same as the directional derivative ''X''(''f''), it is also the same as the [[Differential form#Operations on forms|contraction]] of the exterior derivative of ''f'' with ''X'':\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_Xf = i_X \\, df</math>\n\nFor a general differential form, the Lie derivative is likewise a contraction, taking into account the variation in ''X'':\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X\\omega = i_Xd\\omega + d(i_X \\omega).</math>\n\nThis identity is known variously as '''Cartan formula''', '''Cartan homotopy formula''' or '''Cartan's magic formula'''. See [[interior product]] for details. The Cartan formula can be used as a definition of the Lie derivative of a differential form.

Alternatively, if we are using a [[torsion (differential geometry)|torsion-free]] [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] (e.g., the [[Levi Civita connection]]), then the partial derivative <math>\\partial_a</math> can be replaced with the [[covariant derivative]] which means replacing <math>\\partial_a X^b</math>   with (by abuse of notation) <math>\\nabla_a X^b = X^b_{;a} := (\\nabla X)_a^{\\ b} = \\partial_a X^b  + \\Gamma^b_{ac}X^c</math> where the <math>\\Gamma^a_{bc} = \\Gamma^a_{cb}</math> are the [[Christoffel coefficients]].\n\nThe Lie derivative of a tensor is another tensor of the same type, i.e., even though the individual terms in the expression depend on the choice of coordinate system, the expression as a whole results in a tensor <math>(\\mathcal{L}_X T) ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s}\\partial_{a_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes\\partial_{a_r}\\otimes dx^{b_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes dx^{b_s}</math>\nwhich is independent of any coordinate system and of the same type as <math>T</math>.\n\nThe definition can be extended further to tensor densities.

This is not obvious from the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression, as the right-hand side seems to depend on the metric through the spin connection (covariant derivative), the dualisation of vector fields (lowering of the indices) and the Clifford multiplication on the [[spinor bundle]]. Such is not the case: the quantities on the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression combine so as to make all metric and connection dependent terms cancel.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the long-debated concept of Lie derivative of spinor fields one may refer to the original article,<ref>{{cite book |last=Fatibene |first=L. |last2=Ferraris |first2=M. |last3=Francaviglia |first3=M. |last4=Godina |first4=M. |year=1996 |chapter=A geometric definition of Lie derivative for Spinor Fields |title=Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Differential Geometry and Applications, August 28th\u2013September 1st 1995 (Brno, Czech Republic) |editor-last=Janyska |editor-first=J. |editor2-last=Kol\u00e1\u0159 |editor2-first=I. |editor3-last=Slov\u00e1k |editor3-first=J. |publisher=Masaryk University |location=Brno |pages=549\u2013558 |isbn=80-210-1369-9 |arxiv=gr-qc/9608003v1 |bibcode=1996gr.qc.....8003F }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Godina |first=M. |last2=Matteucci |first2=P. |year=2003 |title=Reductive G-structures and Lie derivatives |journal=[[Journal of Geometry and Physics]] |volume=47 |issue= |pages=66\u201386 |doi=10.1016/S0393-0440(02)00174-2 |arxiv=math/0201235 |bibcode=2003JGP....47...66G }}</ref> where the definition of a Lie derivative of spinor fields is placed in the more general framework of the theory of Lie derivatives of sections of fiber bundles and the direct approach by Y.

This is the covariant Lie derivative.\n\nSee [[connection form]] for more details.\n\n===Nijenhuis\u2013Lie derivative===\n\nAnother generalization, due to [[Albert Nijenhuis]], allows one to define the Lie derivative of a differential form along any section of the bundle \u03a9<sup>''k''</sup>(''M'', T''M'') of differential forms with values in the tangent bundle.

This change is coordinate invariant and therefore the Lie derivative is defined on any  [[differentiable manifold]].\n\nFunctions, tensor fields and forms can be differentiated with respect to a vector field. If ''T'' is a tensor field and ''X'' is a vector field, then the Lie derivative of ''T'' with respect to ''X'' is denoted <math> \\mathcal{L}_X(T)</math>. The [[differential operator]] <math> T \\mapsto \\mathcal{L}_X(T)</math> is a [[derivation (differential algebra)|derivation]] of the algebra of [[tensor fields]] of the underlying manifold.\n\nThe Lie derivative commutes with [[Tensor contraction|contraction]] and the [[exterior derivative]] on [[differential forms]].\n\nAlthough there are many concepts of taking a derivative in differential geometry, they all agree when the expression being differentiated is a function or [[scalar field]]. Thus in this case the word \"Lie\" is dropped, and one simply speaks of the derivative of a function.\n\nThe Lie derivative of a vector field ''Y'' with respect to another vector field ''X'' is known as the \"[[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]\"  of ''X'' and ''Y'', and is often denoted [''X'',''Y''] instead of <math> \\mathcal{L}_X(Y)</math>. The space of vector fields forms a [[Lie algebra]] with respect to this Lie bracket. The Lie derivative constitutes an infinite-dimensional [[Lie algebra representation]] of this Lie algebra, due to the identity\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]} T = \\mathcal{L}_X \\mathcal{L}_{Y} T - \\mathcal{L}_Y \\mathcal{L}_X T,</math>\n\nvalid for any vector fields ''X'' and ''Y'' and any tensor field ''T''.\n\nConsidering vector fields as [[Lie algebra|infinitesimal generator]]s of [[Flow (mathematics)|flows]] (i.e. one-dimensional [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] of [[diffeomorphism]]s) on ''M'', the Lie derivative is the [[Lie_algebra_representation#Infinitesimal_Lie_group_representations|differential]] of the representation of the [[Diffeomorphism#Diffeomorphism group|diffeomorphism group]] on tensor fields, analogous to Lie algebra representations as [[Lie algebra representation#Infinitesimal Lie group representations|infinitesimal representations]] associated to [[group representation]] in [[Lie group]] theory.\n\nGeneralisations exist for [[spinor]] fields, [[fibre bundle]]s with [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] and vector-valued [[differential forms]].\n\n==Motivation==\nA 'na\u00efve' attempt to define the derivative of a [[tensor field]] with respect to a [[vector field]] would be to take the [[Tensor#As multidimensional arrays|components]] of the tensor field and take the [[directional derivative]] with respect to the vector field of each component. However, this definition is undesirable because it is not invariant under [[Manifold#Transition map|changes of coordinate system]], e.g. the naive derivative expressed in polar or spherical coordinates differs from the naive derivative of the components in polar or spherical coordinates. On an abstract [[manifold]] such a definition is meaningless and ill defined. In [[differential geometry]], there are  three main coordinate independent notions of differentiation of tensor fields: Lie derivatives, derivatives with respect to [[Connection_(differential_geometry)|connections]], and the [[exterior derivative]] of completely anti symmetric (covariant) tensors or [[differential forms]]. The main difference between the Lie derivative and a derivative with respect to a connection is that the latter derivative of a tensor field with respect to a [[tangent space|tangent vector]] is well-defined even if it is not specified how to extend that tangent vector to a vector field. However a connection requires the choice of an additional geometric structure (e.g. a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] or just an abstract [[Connection_(differential_geometry)|connection]]) on the manifold. In contrast, when taking a Lie derivative, no additional structure on the manifold is needed, but it is impossible to talk about the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to a single tangent vector, since the value of the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to a vector field ''X'' at a point ''p'' depends on the value of ''X'' in a neighborhood of ''p'', not just at ''p'' itself. Finally, the exterior derivative of differential forms does not require any additional choices, but is only a well defined derivative of differential forms (including functions).\n\n==Definition==\nThe Lie derivative may be defined in several equivalent ways. To keep things simple, we begin by defining the Lie derivative acting on scalar functions and vector fields, before moving on to the definition for general tensors.\n\n===The (Lie) derivative of a function===\nThe problem with generalizing the derivative of a function when we consider functions over manifolds is that the usual [[difference quotient]] requires we define addition on the function's inputs but it is meaningless to add points on a manifold which is not a vector space.  The critical issue, however, is to consider how the function changes relative to smooth displacements of the points.  The Lie derivative of a scalar function can be thought of as a definition of the derivative where we are using the flows defined by vector fields to displace the points:\n\n:The Lie derivative of a function ''f'' with respect to a [[vector field]] ''X'' at a point ''p'' of the manifold ''M'' is the value\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_X f (p) = \\lim_{t\\to 0} \\frac{f(P(t;p)) - f(p)}{t}</math>\nwhere <math>P(t; p)</math> is the point to which the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] defined by the vector field <math>X</math> maps the point <math>p</math> as follows: in a coordinate neighbourhood with coordinates <math> x^1,..., x^n</math>we can express the vector field (which we consider as a first order differential operator) as <math>X = X^\\mu(x)\\partial_\\mu = X^\\mu \\frac\\partial{\\partial x^\\mu}</math>. Locally, the flow is then defined by <math> x^\\mu(P(t; p)) = P^\\mu(t, p^1,..., p^n)</math> where <math>p^\\mu = x^\\mu(p)</math> and <math>P^\\mu(t;0)</math> is the solution to the partial differential equation  \n::<math> \\partial_t P^\\mu(t; p^1, ..., p^n) = X^\\mu(P^1(t; p^1,..., p^n),..., P^n(t, p^1, ..., p^n)) </math>\nwith <math>P^\\mu(0; p^1,...,p^n) = p^\\mu</math>.\n \nWe can then identify the Lie derivative of a function at ''p'' with the [[directional derivative]]:\n::<math>(\\mathcal{L}_X f)(p) = (X f)(p) = X^\\mu \\partial_\\mu(f(p(x^1,...,x^n))) = \\partial_t (f(P(t; p)))</math>\n\n===The Lie derivative of a vector field===\nIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are both vector fields, then the Lie derivative of ''Y'' with respect to ''X'' is also known as the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] of ''X'' and ''Y'', and is sometimes denoted <math>[X,Y]</math>. There are several approaches to defining the Lie bracket, all of which are equivalent. We list two definitions here, corresponding to the two definitions of a vector field given above:\n\n* The Lie bracket of ''X'' and ''Y'' at ''p'' is given in local coordinates by the formula\n\n<math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y (p) = [X,Y](p) = \\partial_X Y(p) - \\partial_Y X(p),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\partial_X</math> and <math>\\partial_Y</math> denote the operations of taking the [[directional derivative]]s with respect to ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively. Here we are treating a vector in ''n''-dimensional space as an ''n''-[[tuple]], so that its directional derivative is simply the tuple consisting of the directional derivatives of its coordinates. Although the final expression <math>\\partial_X Y(p) - \\partial_Y X(p)</math> appearing in this definition does not depend on the choice of local coordinates, the individual terms <math>\\partial_X Y(p)</math> and <math>\\partial_Y X(p)</math> do depend on the choice of coordinates.\n\n* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are vector fields on a manifold ''M'' according to the second definition, then the operator <math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y = [X,Y]</math> defined by the formula\n::<math>[X,Y]: C^\\infty(M) \\rightarrow C^\\infty(M)</math>\n::<math>[X,Y](f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f))</math>\nis a derivation of order zero of the algebra of smooth functions of ''M'', i.e. this operator is a vector field according to the second definition.\n\n===The Lie derivative of a tensor field===\nMore generally, if we have a [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[tensor field]] ''T'' of [[Tensor order|rank]] <math>(q,r)</math> and a differentiable [[vector field]] ''Y'' (i.e. a differentiable section of the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM''), then we can define the Lie derivative of ''T'' along ''Y''. Let, for some open interval ''I'' around 0, {{nowrap|''\u03c6'' : ''M'' \u00d7 ''I'' \u2192 ''M''}} be the one-parameter semigroup of local diffeomorphisms of ''M'' induced by the [[vector flow]] of ''Y'' and denote {{nowrap|1=''\u03c6''<sub>''t''</sub>(''p'') := ''\u03c6''(''p'', ''t'')}}. For each sufficiently small ''t'', ''\u03c6''<sub>''t''</sub> is a diffeomorphism from a [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] in ''M'' to another neighborhood in ''M'', and ''\u03c6''<sub>0</sub> is the identity diffeomorphism. The Lie derivative of ''T'' is defined at a point ''p'' by\n\n:<math>(\\mathcal{L}_Y T)_p=\\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}\\left((\\varphi_{-t})_*T_{\\varphi_{t}(p)}\\right).</math>\n\nwhere <math>(\\varphi_t)_*</math> is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along the diffeomorphism and <math>(\\varphi_t)^*</math> is the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] along the diffeomorphism. Intuitively, if you have a tensor field <math>T</math> and a vector field ''Y'', then <math>\\mathcal{L}_{Y} T</math> is the infinitesimal change you would see when you flow <math>T</math> using the vector field \u2212''Y'', which is the same thing as the infinitesimal change you would see in <math>T</math> if you yourself flowed along the vector field  ''Y''.\n\nWe now give an algebraic definition. The algebraic definition for the Lie derivative of a tensor field follows from the following four axioms:\n\n:'''Axiom 1.''' The Lie derivative of a function is equal to the directional derivative of the function. This fact is often expressed by the formula\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Yf=Y(f)</math>\n\n:'''Axiom 2.''' The Lie derivative obeys the following version of Leibniz's rule: For any tensor fields ''S'' and ''T'', we have\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Y(S\\otimes T)=(\\mathcal{L}_YS)\\otimes T+S\\otimes (\\mathcal{L}_YT).</math>\n\n:'''Axiom 3.''' The Lie derivative obeys the Leibniz rule with respect to [[Tensor contraction|contraction]]:\n::<math> \\mathcal{L}_X (T(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n)) = (\\mathcal{L}_X T)(Y_1,\\ldots, Y_n) + T((\\mathcal{L}_X Y_1), \\ldots, Y_n) + \\cdots + T(Y_1, \\ldots, (\\mathcal{L}_X Y_n)) </math>\n\n:'''Axiom 4.''' The Lie derivative commutes with exterior derivative on functions:\n::<math> [\\mathcal{L}_X, d] = 0 </math>\n\nIf these axioms hold, then applying the Lie derivative <math>\\mathcal{L}_X</math> to the relation <math> df(Y) = Y(f) </math> shows that\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_X Y (f) = X(Y(f)) - Y(X(f)),</math>\nwhich is one of the standard definitions for the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]].\n\nThe Lie derivative acting on a differential form is the [[Commutator#Ring theory|anticommutator]] of the [[interior product]] with the exterior derivative. So if \u03b1 is a differential form,\n::<math>\\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha=i_Yd\\alpha+di_Y\\alpha.</math>\nThis follows easily by checking that the expression commutes with exterior derivative, is a derivation (being an anticommutator of graded derivations) and does the right thing on functions.\n\nExplicitly, let ''T'' be a tensor field of type {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}}. Consider ''T'' to be a differentiable [[multilinear map]] of [[smooth function|smooth]] [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] ''\u03b1''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''\u03b1''<sup>''q''</sup> of the cotangent bundle ''T''<sup>\u2217</sup>''M'' and of sections ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>p</sub> of the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'', written ''T''(''\u03b1''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b1''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ...) into '''R'''. Define the Lie derivative of ''T'' along ''Y'' by the formula\n\n:<math>(\\mathcal{L}_Y T)(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots) =Y(T(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\ldots,X_1,X_2,\\ldots))</math>\n::<math>- T(\\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots)\n- T(\\alpha_1, \\mathcal{L}_Y\\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, X_2, \\ldots) -\\ldots </math>\n::<math>- T(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, \\mathcal{L}_YX_1, X_2, \\ldots)\n-  T(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, X_1, \\mathcal{L}_YX_2, \\ldots) - \\ldots\n</math>\n\nThe analytic and algebraic definitions can be proven to be equivalent using the properties of the pushforward and the [[General Leibniz rule|Leibniz rule]] for differentiation. The Lie derivative commutes with the contraction.\n\n===The Lie derivative of a differential form===\n{{see also|Interior product}}\nA particularly important class of tensor fields is the class of [[differential forms]]. The restriction of the Lie derivative to the space of differential forms is closely related to the [[exterior derivative]]. Both the Lie derivative and the exterior derivative attempt to capture the idea of a derivative in different ways. These differences can be bridged by introducing the idea of an [[interior product]], after which the relationships falls out as an identity known as '''Cartan's formula'''. Cartan's formula can also be used as a definition of the Lie derivative on the space of differential forms.\n\nLet ''M'' be a manifold and ''X'' a vector field on ''M''. Let <math>\\omega \\in \\Lambda^{k+1}(M)</math> be a {{nowrap|(''k'' + 1)}}-[[Differential form|form]], i.e. for each <math>p \\in M</math>, <math>\\omega(p)</math> is an [[Alternating form|alternating]] [[multilinear map]] from <math>(T_p M)^{k + 1}</math> to the real numbers. The [[interior product]] of ''X'' and ''\u03c9'' is the ''k''-form <math>i_X\\omega</math> defined as\n\n:<math>(i_X\\omega) (X_1, \\ldots, X_k) = \\omega (X,X_1, \\ldots, X_k)\\,</math>\n\nThe differential form <math>i_X\\omega</math> is also called the '''contraction''' of ''\u03c9'' with ''X'', and\n:<math>i_X:\\Lambda^{k+1}(M) \\rightarrow \\Lambda^k(M)</math>\n\nand  <math>i_X</math> is a <math>\\wedge</math>-[[derivation (abstract algebra)|antiderivation]]. That is, <math>i_X</math> is '''R'''-linear, and\n\n:<math>i_X (\\omega \\wedge \\eta) = \n(i_X \\omega) \\wedge \\eta + (-1)^k \\omega \\wedge (i_X \\eta)</math>\n\nfor <math>\\omega \\in \\Lambda^k(M)</math> and \u03b7 another differential form. Also, for a function <math>f \\in \\Lambda^0(M)</math>, that is, a real- or complex-valued function on ''M'', one has\n\n:<math>i_{fX} \\omega = f\\,i_X\\omega</math>\n\nwhere <math>f X</math> denotes the product of ''f'' and ''X''.\nThe relationship between [[exterior derivative]]s and Lie derivatives can then be summarized as follows. First, since the Lie derivative of a function ''f'' with respect to a vector field ''X'' is the same as the directional derivative ''X''(''f''), it is also the same as the [[Differential form#Operations on forms|contraction]] of the exterior derivative of ''f'' with ''X'':\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_Xf = i_X \\, df</math>\n\nFor a general differential form, the Lie derivative is likewise a contraction, taking into account the variation in ''X'':\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_X\\omega = i_Xd\\omega + d(i_X \\omega).</math>\n\nThis identity is known variously as '''Cartan formula''', '''Cartan homotopy formula''' or '''Cartan's magic formula'''. See [[interior product]] for details. The Cartan formula can be used as a definition of the Lie derivative of a differential form. Cartan's formula shows in particular that\n\n:<math>d\\mathcal{L}_X\\omega = \\mathcal{L}_X(d\\omega).</math>\n\nThe Lie derivative also satisfies the relation\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_{fX}\\omega = f\\mathcal{L}_X\\omega + df \\wedge i_X \\omega .</math>\n\n==Coordinate expressions==\n{{Einstein summation convention}}\n\nIn local [[coordinate]] notation, for a type {{nowrap|(''r'', ''s'')}} tensor field <math>T</math>, the Lie derivative along <math>X</math> is\n:<math> \\begin{align}\n(\\mathcal{L}_X T) ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} = & X^c(\\partial_c T^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s}) \\\\ & - (\\partial_c X ^{a_1}) T ^{c a_2 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} - \\ldots - (\\partial_c X^{a_r}) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_{r-1}c}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} \\\\ & + (\\partial_{b_1} X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{c b_2 \\ldots b_s} + \\ldots + (\\partial_{b_s}X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_{s-1} c}\n\\end{align}</math>\nhere, the notation <math>\\partial_a = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^a}</math> means taking the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate <math> x^a</math>. Alternatively, if we are using a [[torsion (differential geometry)|torsion-free]] [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] (e.g., the [[Levi Civita connection]]), then the partial derivative <math>\\partial_a</math> can be replaced with the [[covariant derivative]] which means replacing <math>\\partial_a X^b</math>   with (by abuse of notation) <math>\\nabla_a X^b = X^b_{;a} := (\\nabla X)_a^{\\ b} = \\partial_a X^b  + \\Gamma^b_{ac}X^c</math> where the <math>\\Gamma^a_{bc} = \\Gamma^a_{cb}</math> are the [[Christoffel coefficients]].\n\nThe Lie derivative of a tensor is another tensor of the same type, i.e., even though the individual terms in the expression depend on the choice of coordinate system, the expression as a whole results in a tensor <math>(\\mathcal{L}_X T) ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s}\\partial_{a_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes\\partial_{a_r}\\otimes dx^{b_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes dx^{b_s}</math>\nwhich is independent of any coordinate system and of the same type as <math>T</math>.\n\nThe definition can be extended further to tensor densities.  If ''T'' is a tensor density of some real number valued weight ''w'' (e.g. the volume density of weight 1), then its Lie derivative is a tensor density of the same type and weight.\n:<math> (\\mathcal {L}_X T) ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} = X^c(\\partial_c T^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s}) - (\\partial_c X ^{a_1}) T ^{c a_2 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} - \\ldots - (\\partial_c X^{a_r}) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_{r-1}c}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_s} +</math>\n::<math>+  (\\partial_{b_1} X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{c b_2 \\ldots b_s} + \\ldots + (\\partial_{b_s} X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_{s-1} c} + w (\\partial_{c} X^c) T ^{a_1 \\ldots a_r}{}_{b_1 \\ldots b_{s}}\n</math>\nNotice the new term at the end of the expression.\n\nFor a [[Affine connection|linear connection]] <math>\\Gamma =( \\Gamma^{a}_{bc} )</math>, the Lie derivative along <math>X</math> is<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Kentaro Yano (mathematician) |last=Yano |first=K. |title=The Theory of Lie Derivatives and its Applications\n|url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofliederiv029601mbp|publisher=North-Holland|year=1957|page=[https://archive.org/details/theoryofliederiv029601mbp/page/n25 8]|isbn=978-0-7204-2104-0}}</ref>\n:<math>\n(\\mathcal{L}_X \\Gamma)^{a}_{bc} =  X^d\\partial_d \\Gamma^{a}_{bc} + \\partial_b\\partial_c X^a - \\Gamma^{d}_{bc}\\partial_d X^a \n+ \\Gamma^{a}_{dc}\\partial_b X^d + \\Gamma^{a}_{bd}\\partial_c X^d\n</math>\n\n===Examples===\nFor clarity we now show the following examples in local [[coordinate]] notation.\n\nFor a [[scalar field]] <math>\\phi(x^c)\\in\\mathcal{F}(M)</math> we have:\n:<math> (\\mathcal {L}_X \\phi)=X(\\phi) = X^a \\partial_a \\phi</math>.\nHence for the scalar field <math>\\phi(x,y) = x^2 - \\sin(y)</math> and the vector field <math>X = \\sin(x)\\partial_y - y^2\\partial_x</math> the corresponding Lie derivative becomes \n<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{alignat}{4}\n\\mathcal{L}_X\\phi &= (\\sin(x)\\partial_y - y^2\\partial_x)(x^2 - \\sin(y))\\\\\n                  & = -\\sin(x)\\cos(y) - 2xy^2\n\\end{alignat}\n</math>\n\nFor an example of higher rank differential form, \nconsider the 2-form <math>\\omega = (x^2 + y^2)dx\\wedge dz</math> and the vector field <math>X</math> from the previous example.

This is not obvious from the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression, as the right-hand side seems to depend on the metric through the spin connection (covariant derivative), the dualisation of vector fields (lowering of the indices) and the Clifford multiplication on the [[spinor bundle]]. Such is not the case: the quantities on the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression combine so as to make all metric and connection dependent terms cancel.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the long-debated concept of Lie derivative of spinor fields one may refer to the original article,<ref>{{cite book |last=Fatibene |first=L. |last2=Ferraris |first2=M. |last3=Francaviglia |first3=M. |last4=Godina |first4=M. |year=1996 |chapter=A geometric definition of Lie derivative for Spinor Fields |title=Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Differential Geometry and Applications, August 28th\u2013September 1st 1995 (Brno, Czech Republic) |editor-last=Janyska |editor-first=J. |editor2-last=Kol\u00e1\u0159 |editor2-first=I. |editor3-last=Slov\u00e1k |editor3-first=J. |publisher=Masaryk University |location=Brno |pages=549\u2013558 |isbn=80-210-1369-9 |arxiv=gr-qc/9608003v1 |bibcode=1996gr.qc.....8003F }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Godina |first=M. |last2=Matteucci |first2=P. |year=2003 |title=Reductive G-structures and Lie derivatives |journal=[[Journal of Geometry and Physics]] |volume=47 |issue= |pages=66\u201386 |doi=10.1016/S0393-0440(02)00174-2 |arxiv=math/0201235 |bibcode=2003JGP....47...66G }}</ref> where the definition of a Lie derivative of spinor fields is placed in the more general framework of the theory of Lie derivatives of sections of fiber bundles and the direct approach by Y. Kosmann to the spinor case is generalized to gauge natural bundles in the form of a new geometric concept called the [[Kosmann lift]].\n\n===Covariant Lie derivative===\nIf we have a principal bundle over the manifold M with G as the structure group, and we pick X to be a covariant vector field as section of the tangent space of the principal bundle (i.e. it has horizontal and vertical components), then the covariant Lie derivative is just the Lie derivative with respect to X over the principal bundle.\n\nNow, if we're given a vector field ''Y'' over ''M'' (but not the principal bundle) but we also have a [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] over the principal bundle, we can define a vector field X over the principal bundle such that its horizontal component matches ''Y'' and its vertical component agrees with the connection. This is the covariant Lie derivative.\n\nSee [[connection form]] for more details.\n\n===Nijenhuis\u2013Lie derivative===\n\nAnother generalization, due to [[Albert Nijenhuis]], allows one to define the Lie derivative of a differential form along any section of the bundle \u03a9<sup>''k''</sup>(''M'', T''M'') of differential forms with values in the tangent bundle. If ''K''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;\u03a9<sup>''k''</sup>(''M'', T''M'') and \u03b1 is a differential ''p''-form, then it is possible to define the interior product ''i''<sub>''K''</sub>\u03b1 of ''K'' and \u03b1. The Nijenhuis\u2013Lie derivative is then the anticommutator of the interior product and the exterior derivative:\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_K\\alpha=[d,i_K]\\alpha = di_K\\alpha-(-1)^{k-1}i_K \\, d\\alpha.</math>\n\n==History==\nIn 1931, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u015alebodzi\u0144ski]] introduced a new differential operator, later called by [[David van Dantzig]] that of Lie derivation, which can be applied to scalars, vectors, tensors and affine connections and which proved to be a powerful instrument in the study of groups of automorphisms.\n\nThe Lie derivatives of general geometric objects (i.e., sections of [[natural bundle|natural fiber bundle]]s) were studied by [[Albert Nijenhuis|A.

Peralta shows \"class clown\" traits, constantly pulling pranks and making immature jokes at the expense of his colleagues, particularly his partner, Amy Santiago. He is fun-loving and sarcastic but is often motivated by his emotions more than his colleagues. Despite his goofy traits, Peralta is extremely smart, perceptive and quick thinking, and as such has the best arrest rate in the precinct. In the pilot, Terry Jeffords explains to Captain Holt that Peralta is his best detective, that he likes putting away bad guys, and that he loves puzzles, although \"the only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.\" As of season seven, he is 38 years old and has been a detective with the 9-9 since 2005.<ref name=\"Unsolvable\">{{Cite episode|title=Unsolvable|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=March 18, 2014|season=1|number=21}}</ref> This would imply that he became a detective at 23.\n\nHis father left his family during his childhood and, as a result, he feels a strong tie to memories involving his father, such as his favorite Brooklyn pizza joint. He also initially refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving, since he associates the holiday with his father's absenteeism. He has a strong emotional tie to his muscle car, a 1967 Ford Mustang, which he bought outright on his first day as a cop and always carries a positive association for him (until he sold it to help pay for Terry's new child). He often quotes and makes references to his favorite movie, ''[[Die Hard]]''. In \"Boyle-Linetti Wedding\" it is revealed that Jake is Jewish, having lost his childhood sweetheart Jenny Gildenhorn to Eddie Fung at his [[Bar Mitzvah]].\n\nPeralta's best  friend is Charles Boyle, who works along with him at the precinct and admires Peralta and encourages his eventual romance with Santiago. Peralta and Gina Linetti are childhood friends, which resulted in him helping Gina get a job at the precinct. Diaz and Peralta were classmates at the police academy.\n\nJake began his career as a patrol officer with the 74th Precinct and was partnered with Stevie Schillens and the two nicknamed themselves the \"Beatsie Boys\"; in 2016, Jake was forced to arrest Stevie, now a detective with the neighboring 98th Precinct for planting evidence.<ref name=\"The 9-8\">{{Cite episode|title=The 9-8|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 9, 2016|season=3|number=15}}</ref> \n\nWhile Jake doesn't initially approve of Captain Holt's strict management, he eventually matures under Holt's supervision and comes to see Holt as a father-figure; even calling him \"Dad\" on many occasions. In \"The Oolong Slayer\", Jake achieves his lifelong dream to catch a serial killer, the Oolong Slayer, but gives up the credit for the arrest to the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives in exchange for effecting Holt's transfer back to the 99th Precinct.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\">{{Cite episode|title=The Oolong Slayer|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=October 18, 2015|season=3|number=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of season four, Jake and Rosa Diaz are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Although he is eager to return to work, his time in prison left him with some post-traumatic stress that affected his job performance.\n\nPeralta continuously pranks and teases his partner Santiago, masking his secret romantic feelings for her. Peralta confesses his feelings to her in the season one finale before going undercover for a mafia operation.

She attended [[parochial school]], later studied [[ballet]], and was a classmate of Jake's in the police academy.<ref name=\"castlist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/devwatch/brooklyn-nine-nine/|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine (FOX)|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> When she was younger, the pressure for her to succeed at ballet school eventually led her to commit several crimes before landing in juvenile detention. Her parents provided little support, leaving Rosa to turn her life around by herself. \n\nThough Diaz is a loyal and effective member of the squad, her anger management issues and lack of empathy terrify most of her coworkers. She is highly secretive about her personal life \u2013 should anyone discover a secret of hers, she normally threatens them with death should they disclose it. It is also made clear that she does not stay in her apartments for long periods of time, and her neighbors know her by both a different name and a completely different personality. As revealed in \"Cop-Con\", she and Amy are younger than most of the other precinct members as they are hurt by a device that emits a loud noise to those under 35, whereas Jake and Boyle only pretend to be affected by it. In \"White Whale\", she reveals to Amy that she's attended medical school, business school, and has a pilot's license. Rosa also briefly mentions in \"Greg and Larry\" that her name \"Rosa Diaz\" may be an alias to cover up her real name from the rest of the 9-9.\n\nIn season two, Rosa dates Captain Holt's nephew, Marcus, but breaks up with him in season three. Later in the season, she finds love with former undercover detective Adrian Pimento; the two get engaged in \"Paranoia\" while chasing a drug dealer through an alley, but their wedding is delayed when Pimento is targeted by Figgis and forced to leave the state. Once he returns, they try to have their wedding the next day but decide to go steady after realizing they were rushing their relationship.\n\nAt the end of season four, Rosa and Jake are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Following her months of isolation, she starts spending more time with her family and ends her relationship with Pimento. Later in the season, she comes out as bisexual to the precinct and her family, and has a brief relationship with an unseen woman that the squad never meet or learn the name of, nicknamed \"Becky\". She has a brief flirtation with one of Gina's friends, but this does not lead anywhere. On the day of Jake and Amy's wedding, she and Terry meet a cab driver named Alicia that she becomes interested in. The two begin a relationship off-screen. However, it's short-lived, as Rosa mentions in \"The Tattler\" that they broke up because Alicia was moving to London. \n\nIn season six, Rosa begins dating a cosmetologist named Jocelyn and begins to patch up her relationship with her mother, who was initially unaccepting of her bisexuality. In season seven, Rosa and Jocelyn broke up prior to the season's Jimmy Jab Games.\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Diaz.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", she received a commendation for her work as the leader of a drug task force.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Terry Jeffords ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Terry Jeffords\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Sergeant {{small|(seasons 1\u20136)}}|[[Lieutenant]] {{small|(season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Terry Crews]]|Theodore Barnes (child)}}\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Terrence Vincent Jeffords\n| family      = \n| spouse      = [[#Sharon Jeffords|Sharon Jeffords]] (wife)\n| significant_other = {{ubl|[[#Chiaki|Chiaki]] (ex-girlfriend)|[[#Veronica Hopkins|Veronica Hopkins]] (ex-girlfriend)}}\n| children    = {{ubl|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Cagney Jeffords]] (daughter)|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Lacey Jeffords]] (daughter)|Ava Jeffords (daughter)}}\n| relatives   = {{ubl|Lawrence Jeffords (brother)|[[#Zeke|Zeke]] (brother-in-law)|Unnamed father (deceased)|Unnamed grandmother (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Terry Crews by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Terry Crews]]]]\n[[Terry Crews]] portrays Lieutenant (previously Sergeant) '''Terrence \"Terry\" Vincent Jeffords''', the supervisor of the 9-9's Detective Squad. An avid [[bodybuilder]] who stands at more than six feet tall, with a [[linebacker]]'s build, Terry's intimidating size and appearance is contrasted by his caring, protective nature and paternal instincts. Jeffords is devoted to his wife and three young daughters Cagney, Lacey (named after the [[Cagney & Lacey|1980s TV series]]), and Ava. He fears the danger of police work because of the possibility that he could leave his children fatherless. Following a panic attack prior to the show's beginning, Terry was removed from field work, but he has since cautiously returned. He is high-strung, prone to nervous excitement, loves yogurt, and has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person. He is an effective and caring leader to the detective squad, often having to play the mature adult in order to keep them in line.\n\nA running gag throughout the series is for Terry to break things (examples include a Magic 8 Ball, a phone and Captain Holt's office) because of his incredible strength. He has been a detective since 1995 and used to be assigned to the 65th Precinct (as seen in \"Terry Kitties\"), where he was constantly mocked for a botched case which he and Jake later proved he was correct in. In S1.Ep.1. Holt mentions that he & Terry have worked together before. In 2005, he was the senior detective at the 9-9 (the position Jake now holds since Terry's promotion). He was a linebacker at [[Syracuse University]], where he graduated ''magna cum laude'', as revealed in \"The Swedes\". He also studied abroad in Japan while in college and dated a Japanese student named Chiaki who broke his heart. He speaks Japanese infrequently throughout the show.\n\nIn season two, Terry nearly gets a [[vasectomy]] at his wife's request, but Jake convinces him not to when he finds out Terry secretly wants to have more kids. His wife becomes pregnant later in the season and gives birth to their third daughter, Ava, in season three. He entrusts Jake to be Ava's godfather.\n\nWhile Terry is satisfied with his role as Sergeant, he aimed to become a Lieutenant during the first six seasons. As revealed in \"The Honeypot\", he brought a new pair of suspenders that he planned to put on after he passed the Lieutenant's Exam but kept them in the box when he ended up failing and held onto them as a reminder of his higher goals. In \"Moo Moo\", he attempted to apply to be a city council liaison to take on more responsibilities but was rejected after reporting that another cop racially profiled him. In season six, Terry reveals to the group that he passed the Lieutenant's Exam weeks before the annual Halloween Heist (which they hosted on Cinco de Mayo).\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Lieutenant Jeffords.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd bronze.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Commendation or Commendation\u2014Integrity\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD Unit Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD Unit Citation\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Amy Santiago-Peralta===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Amy Santiago-Peralta (engaged)\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* Detective {{small|(seasons 1\u20135)}} \n* Sergeant {{small|(season 5\u2013present)}}\n}}\n| portrayer          = [[Melissa Fumero]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| alias              = Isabel Cortez (undercover alias)\n| family             = \n| spouse             = [[#Jake Peralta|Jake Peralta]]\n| significant_other  = {{ubl|[[#Teddy Wells|Teddy Wells]] (ex-boyfriend)|[[#Constantine Kane|Constantine Kane]] (ex-boyfriend)|Luke Mueller (ex-boyfriend)}}\n| children           = \n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Victor Santiago|Victor Santiago]] (father)|[[#Camila Santiago|Camila Santiago]] (mother)|Tony Santiago (brother)|[[#David Santiago|David Santiago]] (brother)|Mason Santiago (nephew)|[[#Roger Peralta|Roger Peralta]] (father-in-law)|[[#Karen Peralta|Karen Peralta]] (mother-in-law)|[[#Kate Peralta|Kate Peralta]] (half sister-in-law)|Five unnamed brothers|Two unnamed half sisters-in-law|An unknown number of half brothers-in-law|Unnamed niece}}\n| religion           = \n| nationality        = Cuban-American\n}}\n[[File:Melissa Fumero May 2018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Melissa Fumero]]]]\n[[Melissa Fumero]] portrays Sergeant (previously Detective) '''Amy Santiago-Peralta''', Jake's uptight, by-the-book, rule-following [[Cuban-American]] partner, and later wife.<ref name=castlist/> A neurotic overachiever, she is continually trying to ingratiate herself with Captain Holt, and any authority figure in arm's reach of her. In the pilot, Terry explains to Holt that Amy's competitiveness is a result of her having seven brothers. Amy is a stickler for department protocol and is frequently exasperated by Jake's childishness, as well as the ease with which he succeeds as a detective. She is initially seen as Holt's teacher's pet, but over time is shown to command respect from others. \n\nAmy was originally a patrol officer at the 64th precinct but requested a transfer to the 99th when her captain almost sexually assaulted her shortly after her promotion to detective. She didn't tell anyone for years out of fear for what it would do to her career until she revealed it to Jake when they were investigating a sexual assault case in \"He Said, She Said\". \n\nIn \"Charges and Specs\", the season one finale, Jake confesses that he wishes something romantic could happen between them. She confesses to having had feelings for Jake in \"The Road Trip\" and is shown to still have feelings for Jake in \"Det. Dave Majors\". The two share their first kiss in \"Johnny and Dora\"<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> and begin dating in \"New Captain\", although their working relationship does not change at all. They decide to move in together in the season three finale \"Greg and Larry\", but don't make it official until season four's \"The Fugitive\". Jake proposes to Amy at the end of their annual Halloween heist in \"HalloVeen\" and the two eventually marry. In season seven's \"Ding Dong\", Amy reveals she is pregnant with Jake's child.\n\nNear the end of season three, Amy goes undercover as a pregnant inmate in a women's prison in Texas to obtain information from Maura Figgis. This was done to cover Melissa Fumero's actual pregnancy at the time without making her character pregnant.\n\nIn season five, Amy achieves her dream of being the youngest woman to pass the Sergeant's Exam. It is not known exactly how old Amy is, but she is under 35 as of the episode \"Cop-Con\". In season six she is revealed to be 36 years old.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Sergeant Santiago.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD Baby Delivery Citation.jpg|100px]]\n|Citation bar for delivering a baby\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Charles Boyle ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Charles Boyle\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Male\n| occupation         = Detective\n| portrayer          = [[Joe Lo Truglio]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| spouse             = [[#Eleanor Horstweil|Eleanor Hortsweil]] (ex-wife)\n| significant_other   = {{ubl||[[#Genevieve Mirren-Carter|Genevieve Mirren-Carter]] (girlfriend)|[[#Vivian Ludley|Vivian Ludley]] (ex-fianc\u00e9e)|[[#Gina Linetti|Gina Linetti]] (ex-lover)|[[#Lt.

He is divorced from his wife Eleanor, who had numerous affairs during their marriage, to the point where she has to pay alimony to him. He is also a huge, unapologetic [[foodie]], maintaining a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email and often relishing bizarre foreign cuisine that disgusts his coworkers. \n\nFor saving Detective Diaz's life during \"Christmas\" (during which he was shot in the buttocks), he was awarded the [[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]] in \"The Bet\", though he was overshadowed by a revered and heroic NYPD horse named Sgt Peanut Butter.  In \"The Swedes\", it is revealed that Boyle is a graduate of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].\n\nIn the show's first season, Charles has a crush on Rosa, but he eventually gets over her when he starts dating Vivian Ludley, whom he met at Captain Holt's birthday party. They get engaged but break up after Charles refuses to move to Canada with her. He and Gina start to see each other in season two, and their brief relationship results in his father and Gina's mother's marriage. In season three, he starts dating Genevieve Mirren-Carter after he and Jake clear her name from an art thief. They eventually move in together and adopt a son from Latvia named Nikolaj. \n\nIn season five, Charles starts his own food truck business called \"The One Thing\", which specializes in meatball subs. The truck is burned down by one of Charles' ex-employees, but he's thankful it happened as running the food truck made him spend less time with his family and built up a large debt.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Boyle.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation 1.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:Fictional Police Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar\n|}\n \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Gina Linetti ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Gina Linetti\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| last               = \"Return of the King\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{ubl|[[Administrator (business)|Administrator]] {{small|(Seasons 1\u20136)}}|Internet personality {{small|(Season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer          = [[Chelsea Peretti]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name          = Regina Linetti\n| significant_other   = {{ubl|[[#Charles Boyle|Charles Boyle]] (ex-lover)|[[#Milton Boyle|Milton Boyle]] (lover, father of her child)|Eight unnamed ex-fianc\u00e9s}}\n| children           = The Enigma \"Iggy\" Boyle (daughter)\n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Darlene Linetti|Darlene Linetti]] (mother)|[[#Lynn Boyle|Lynn Boyle]] (stepfather)|Charles Boyle (stepbrother)|Susan Grapecoat (great-aunt)|Anthony (nephew)|Unnamed sibling|Unnamed father}}\n| nationality        = American\n}}\n[[File:Chelsea Peretti at Meltdown (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Chelsea Peretti]]]]\n[[Chelsea Peretti]] portrays '''Regina \"Gina\" Linetti''', the 99th Precinct's sardonic and egomaniacal civilian administrator and Captain Holt's assistant.<ref name=castlist/> Despite maintaining a clueless and dimwitted disposition most of the time, she can be surprisingly observant and has demonstrated traits of being more intelligent than she likes to show. Gina is obsessed with social media and is constantly on her phone. It is a running gag to try to pry her from her phone, to the point where Captain Holt becomes involved. She is extremely narcissistic and constantly praises and exalts herself, such as claiming to be a better dancer than [[Britney Spears]] in the episode \"Karen Peralta\". As the only civilian in the precinct, Gina often uses her outsider's perspective to assist the other detectives. In the episode \"The Party\", to prevent the mostly [[working class]] detectives from embarrassing themselves in front of a crowd of [[academia|academics]], Rosa tricks Gina into talking to a group of psychology professors at Holt's birthday party, who then take copious notes about her narcissistic personality. They conclude that she has a complete overlap of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], a condition previously thought to be purely theoretical.\n\nShe casually admits on myriad occasions that she doesn't value her colleagues \u2013 except for Jake \u2013 as people. She was also childhood friends with Jake, who got her the job at the precinct. Gina also ruined Jake's senior year of high school by framing him as \"The Tattler\", though she did it to avoid Jake getting involved with the wrong crowd. She transferred to the Public relations Division with Captain Holt in \"Johnny and Dora\", and returns to the 9-9 with him in \"The Oolong Slayer\".<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/><ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> In the episode \"The Apartment\", it is revealed that she has been engaged eight times, but never married. At the end of \"The Fugitive Pt. 2\", she gets hit by a bus after receiving a text from Charles. The penultimate episode of season four reveals she has become pregnant following a relationship with Charles' cousin, Milton (which coincided with Chelsea Peretti's actual pregnancy). She is absent for the first half of season five on maternity leave after giving birth to a girl she nicknames \"Iggy\" (short for Enigma). \n\nIn the episode \"Halloween IV\", Gina reveals that in the fourth grade at a classmate's birthday party, a bowling ball fell onto her face. This incident knocked out her two front teeth; she's been wearing false teeth since.\n\nIn season six, Jake helps Gina realize that her talents would be better spent elsewhere and she quits her job. She becomes an internet celebrity and hosts a web show called \"The G-Hive,\" in which she gives her viewers life advice. Her work has made it too busy to spend time with her former coworkers, but she is aiming to improve after Jake confronts her for not talking to them for months. \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Raymond Holt ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Raymond Holt\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Commanding Officer, NYPD 99th Precinct {{small|(seasons 1\u20136; season 7-present)}}|Patrol officer {{small|(season 6\u20137)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Andre Braugher]]|Seth Carr (child)}}\n| alias       = Greg Stickney ([[WITSEC]] alias)\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Raymond Jacob Holt\n| spouse      = [[#Kevin Cozner|Kevin Cozner]]\n| significant_other = [[#Frederick|Frederick]] (ex-boyfriend)\n| relatives   = {{ubl|[[#Laverne Holt|Laverne Holt]] (mother)|Unnamed father (deceased)|[[#Debbie|Debbie]] (sister)| [[#Marcus|Marcus]] (nephew)<br>Geoffrey Holt (uncle)<br>Martin Cozner (brother-in-law)<br>Carol Wilg (goddaughter)<br>Gary (ex-brother-in-law)<br>Unnamed uncle (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Andre Braugher 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andre Braugher]]]]\n[[Andre Braugher]] portrays Captain '''Raymond Jacob Holt''', the 99th Precinct's strict Commanding Officer. Holt is known for his cold, calm and robotic manner of speaking, overly formal demeanor and lack of outwardly visible emotion, although his non-work friends frequently refer to him having a much more fun persona that is very rarely seen by either the Nine-Nine members or the viewer. He has sophisticated and cultured interests, enjoying classical music, opera and attending dinner parties with his husband's academic friends, amongst other things. The Nine-Nine is Holt's first command despite many years of outstanding service, and he attributes the delay to prejudice against both his [[race (human classification)|race]] and [[homosexuality]]. He came out in 1987 and until recently led a group that supported LGBT African-American NYPD members, which he himself created.<ref name=castlist/> He was a homicide detective in the 1980s, and spent twelve years in the Community Affairs Bureau immediately prior to commanding the Nine-Nine. \n\nHolt is married to Kevin Cozner, the Chair of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Classics]] Department,<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Party|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 4, 2014|season=1|number=16}}</ref> and has a longstanding professional rivalry with Madeline Wuntch, with whom he came up through the ranks; while his career stalled, she kept advancing and is now his immediate superior. After he and Peralta successfully solved a major case in \"The Chopper\", Bureau Chief Wuntch nominated him for a promotion to head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, a promotion he accepted lest Wuntch transfer his staff to horrible posts around New York City.<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> During the number of weeks he was in charge of Public Affairs, Holt was unable to accomplish anything significant thanks to Chief Wuntch's constant micromanaging. After helping Peralta solve a serial killer case, Holt found himself transferred back to command of the 9-9 by the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> He owned a burgundy [[Chevrolet Corvair]] named Gertie which was his prized possession until it was stolen in \"The Fugitive\". Doug Judy purchased him a new identical one and named it Sexarella.\n\nAt the end of season three, Holt is forced to go into witness protection in Florida with Jake when they are threatened by crime boss Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis. He worked at a family entertainment center called the Fun Zone under the alias of Greg until he and Jake baited Figgis into coming to Florida and took the criminal down with the Nine-Nine. In season five, his life and career are put at risk when he makes a deal with mobster Seamus Murphy in exchange for information to clear Jake and Rosa's names from Lt. Hawkins.\n\nDuring season five, Holt learns that the [[New York City Police Commissioner]] is retiring at the end of the year and that he is on the shortlist of candidates to replace him. He spends the rest of the season campaigning to win the Commissioner title but ends up losing to John Kelly.\n\nIn season six, Holt is encouraged by Jake and Amy to stand up to Kelly's regressive policies, leading the Commissioner to retaliate against the Nine-Nine. However, Peralta and Wuntch team up, without Holt's knowledge, to take Kelly down, resulting in Wuntch being named interim Commissioner. This detente doesn't last long, as Holt is demoted to a uniformed officer by Commissioner Wuntch after she realized he was promoted to detective too soon earlier in his career. Shortly after Wuntch's death, however, he is quickly promoted back to captain in the middle of the seventh season.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Captain Holt.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Meritorious Police Duty (with numeral \"10\")\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", he received a commendation for his supervision of Det.

Despite their inept nature, Hitchcock and Scully have both shown on occasion to be competent and even good detectives, though their laziness tends to keep them from demonstrating this most of the time. As revealed in \"Hitchcock and Scully\", the two were excellent detectives in their youths and had well-built bodies, but their careers and their physiques went downhill after they tried the wings at their eventual favorite restaurant, Wing Slutz.\n\nThe majority of the precinct tends to be disgusted by Hitchcock's more perverted nature and attitude towards women. It's revealed in \"The Last Ride\" (Season 4) that Hitchcock held the all-time record for closed cases at the 99th Precinct, one more than Sgt. Jeffords as of that episode. This is mainly due to Hitchcock being at the 99th twenty years longer than Terry. To celebrate, Hitchcock got a tattoo of himself holding a gun and putting it in his mouth, oblivious to what it [[Suicide|actually implies]].\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Hitchcock.<ref name=\"The Funeral\">{{Cite episode|title=The Funeral|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=October 4, 2015|season=3|number=2}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|\n|Unidentified Award\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Norm Scully ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Norm Scully\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = Detective 2nd Grade\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Joel McKinnon Miller]]|[[Alan Ritchson]] (young)}}\n| full_name   = \n| spouse      = Kelly (ex-wife)\n| significant_other = {{ubl|[[#Cindy Shatz|Cindy Shatz]] (girlfriend)|Lucille (ex-girlfriend)}}\n| children    = 2\n| relatives   = Earl Scully (twin brother)\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n\n[[Joel McKinnon Miller]] portrays Detective '''Norman \"Norm\" Scully''' (season 2\u2013present; recurring season 1), a middle-aged, lazy desk worker who has been best friends and partners with Detective Hitchcock for over 30 years. Scully shows talent as a [[tenor]] [[opera]] singer, [[French language|French]] speaker, having an understanding of [[Morse code]] and can \"make great [[coffee]]\", according to Sgt. Jeffords. He also displayed an uncanny ability to reassemble shredded documents in one episode. Scully routinely discloses disgusting medical issues like the entire bottom of his foot being a wart or having various strains of [[fungi]]. He claims to constantly have medical emergencies, and despite having a [[pacemaker]] fitted, he frequently suffers from [[heart attack]]s. He often embarrasses himself either unintentionally or willingly and admits to being indifferent to the judgment of others (most frequently, the fellow members of his squad.) In the early seasons, Scully is married and has a dog. The team are unsure which one of them is called Kelly, though it is later revealed in season 7 that both of them were named Kelly. He is dating Cindy Shatz, who is very similar to him in her attire and personality. He has a twin brother named Earl, also portrayed by Miller.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Scully.<ref name=\"The Funeral\"/>\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar \n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n| [[Image:NYPD Baby Delivery Citation.jpg|100px]]\n|Citation bar for delivering a baby\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Recurring characters==\n===NYPD and other law enforcement===\n* {{anchor|Fire Marshal Boone}}[[Patton Oswalt]] as [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] [[Fire Marshal]] Boone, the fire marshal of the local fire station.

After the death of Seth Dozerman, Pembroke becomes the Commanding Officer of the 99th Precinct until Captain Holt returns. In \"The Venue\", the Vulture steals Jake and Amy's venue at the last second to host his wedding to a kind charity worker named Jean Munhroe. When the two discover that he is unfaithful to Jean and lying to her about his character, they decide to tell Jean at the cost of Vulture taking their venue on their wedding night.

Teddy used to date Amy Santiago; they resume their relationship after meeting up at a training exercise. Later Amy breaks up with him again, because she dislikes his dull personality and is unable to show interest in his home pilsner-brewing hobby. In season four, Teddy evaluates the Nine-Nine when the crime rate drops and one precinct has to close. He claims to have changed but Jake and Amy agree that he is still \"The most boring man in America\". He also admits to Amy that he still loves her and proposes to her twice; once in front of his new girlfriend and Jake, and the second time in front of the entire squad. In season five, Teddy has joined the bomb squad and tries unsuccessfully to steal Amy away from Jake on the day of their wedding.\n\n* {{anchor|Adrian Pimento}}[[Jason Mantzoukas]] as Adrian Pimento, an emotionally unstable and volatile former detective who returned to the 99th Precinct after spending 12 years undercover in the organization of Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis. He began dating Rosa in \"Cheddar\", and the two got engaged in \"Paranoia\", promptly before Pimento and the 99 were forced to fake his death. Pimento returns from hiding when Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis is caught, but is refused his old job at the NYPD and becomes a Private Investigator. His relationship continued with Rosa, but she later breaks up with him in season five. He spends the next couple of months in Alaska before returning to Brooklyn to return as an insurance agent in \"Gray Star Mutual\", but is fired in the episode and starts working at a hand lotion store.

Wuntch and Holt were once partners and friends, but they fell out after Holt rejected her sexual advances and Wuntch gained promotions for which Holt was passed over, resulting in Wuntch eventually becoming Holt's direct superior. Wuntch constantly went out of her way to undermine the 99th Precinct, and appeared to take great pleasure in its and Holt's failures; Holt, in turn, gleefully insulted and belittled Wuntch every time their paths cross.  In \"The Chopper\" and \"Johnny and Dora\", she culminated her victory over Holt when she makes him head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, where she humiliated him by making him do menial jobs, although he is eventually transferred back to the 99 thanks to Jake. In \"Suicide Squad\", she helped Jake and the Nine-Nine expose Commissioner Kelly's illegal wiretapping activity and became the acting commissioner until a new one was decided on. Wuntch died in the episode \"Ding Dong\". At her memorial, Holt admits that he will genuinely miss her and their rivalry.<ref name=\"Ding Dong\">{{Cite episode|title=Ding Dong|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=March 12, 2020|season=7|number=163}}</ref>\n\n* {{anchor|Marcus Marinovich}}Perry L.

This backfires after he rejects their request to go to Florida and assist Jake and Holt and he assigns them to the night shift. He is eventually removed from the Captain position after he is awarded for taking down a major drug dealer (that Jake and Holt primarily took care of) and demonstrates his lack of professionalism in front of a group of reporters. It's revealed that Holt called the reporters in to help the crew return to the day shift.\n\n* {{anchor|Olivia Crawford}}[[Allison Tolman]] as Captain Olivia Crawford, a candidate for the Commissioner position Holt is also seeking.

Jake and Rosa initially pretend to be dirty cops so they can get her to lead them to Nucci, but she defeats them both after ingesting some of the cocaine. After discovering most of Debbie's bad choices stemmed from her parents treating her poorly, Rosa empathizes with Debbie and convinces her to free them so they could defeat Nucci.

He dislikes the NYPD due to their treatment of Holt and his homosexuality during his earlier years on the force but thaws a little when Jake shows him how much the 99th respects and cares for Holt. Like his husband, Kevin is cold, sardonic, formal and unemotional, although he claims that Raymond is the \"funny\" one in their relationship, something that puzzles the detectives. Cozner develops a rapport with Holt's assistant Gina Linetti, referring to her by her first name (by contrast, he takes pains to always call Jake \"Peralta\").

Peralta shows \"class clown\" traits, constantly pulling pranks and making immature jokes at the expense of his colleagues, particularly his partner, Amy Santiago. He is fun-loving and sarcastic but is often motivated by his emotions more than his colleagues. Despite his goofy traits, Peralta is extremely smart, perceptive and quick thinking, and as such has the best arrest rate in the precinct. In the pilot, Terry Jeffords explains to Captain Holt that Peralta is his best detective, that he likes putting away bad guys, and that he loves puzzles, although \"the only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.\" As of season seven, he is 38 years old and has been a detective with the 9-9 since 2005.<ref name=\"Unsolvable\">{{Cite episode|title=Unsolvable|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=March 18, 2014|season=1|number=21}}</ref> This would imply that he became a detective at 23.\n\nHis father left his family during his childhood and, as a result, he feels a strong tie to memories involving his father, such as his favorite Brooklyn pizza joint. He also initially refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving, since he associates the holiday with his father's absenteeism. He has a strong emotional tie to his muscle car, a 1967 Ford Mustang, which he bought outright on his first day as a cop and always carries a positive association for him (until he sold it to help pay for Terry's new child). He often quotes and makes references to his favorite movie, ''[[Die Hard]]''. In \"Boyle-Linetti Wedding\" it is revealed that Jake is Jewish, having lost his childhood sweetheart Jenny Gildenhorn to Eddie Fung at his [[Bar Mitzvah]].\n\nPeralta's best  friend is Charles Boyle, who works along with him at the precinct and admires Peralta and encourages his eventual romance with Santiago. Peralta and Gina Linetti are childhood friends, which resulted in him helping Gina get a job at the precinct. Diaz and Peralta were classmates at the police academy.\n\nJake began his career as a patrol officer with the 74th Precinct and was partnered with Stevie Schillens and the two nicknamed themselves the \"Beatsie Boys\"; in 2016, Jake was forced to arrest Stevie, now a detective with the neighboring 98th Precinct for planting evidence.<ref name=\"The 9-8\">{{Cite episode|title=The 9-8|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 9, 2016|season=3|number=15}}</ref> \n\nWhile Jake doesn't initially approve of Captain Holt's strict management, he eventually matures under Holt's supervision and comes to see Holt as a father-figure; even calling him \"Dad\" on many occasions. In \"The Oolong Slayer\", Jake achieves his lifelong dream to catch a serial killer, the Oolong Slayer, but gives up the credit for the arrest to the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives in exchange for effecting Holt's transfer back to the 99th Precinct.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\">{{Cite episode|title=The Oolong Slayer|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=October 18, 2015|season=3|number=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of season four, Jake and Rosa Diaz are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Although he is eager to return to work, his time in prison left him with some post-traumatic stress that affected his job performance.\n\nPeralta continuously pranks and teases his partner Santiago, masking his secret romantic feelings for her. Peralta confesses his feelings to her in the season one finale before going undercover for a mafia operation. His romantic feelings for her develop further throughout season two and they share their first kiss in \"Johnny and Dora\".<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\">{{Cite episode|title=Johnny and Dora|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=May 17, 2015|season=2|number=23}}</ref> Jake and Amy start dating in \"New Captain\" and decide to move in together in the season three finale \"Greg and Larry\", but don't make it official until season four's \"The Fugitive\".

Her parents provided little support, leaving Rosa to turn her life around by herself. \n\nThough Diaz is a loyal and effective member of the squad, her anger management issues and lack of empathy terrify most of her coworkers. She is highly secretive about her personal life \u2013 should anyone discover a secret of hers, she normally threatens them with death should they disclose it. It is also made clear that she does not stay in her apartments for long periods of time, and her neighbors know her by both a different name and a completely different personality. As revealed in \"Cop-Con\", she and Amy are younger than most of the other precinct members as they are hurt by a device that emits a loud noise to those under 35, whereas Jake and Boyle only pretend to be affected by it. In \"White Whale\", she reveals to Amy that she's attended medical school, business school, and has a pilot's license. Rosa also briefly mentions in \"Greg and Larry\" that her name \"Rosa Diaz\" may be an alias to cover up her real name from the rest of the 9-9.\n\nIn season two, Rosa dates Captain Holt's nephew, Marcus, but breaks up with him in season three. Later in the season, she finds love with former undercover detective Adrian Pimento; the two get engaged in \"Paranoia\" while chasing a drug dealer through an alley, but their wedding is delayed when Pimento is targeted by Figgis and forced to leave the state. Once he returns, they try to have their wedding the next day but decide to go steady after realizing they were rushing their relationship.\n\nAt the end of season four, Rosa and Jake are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Following her months of isolation, she starts spending more time with her family and ends her relationship with Pimento. Later in the season, she comes out as bisexual to the precinct and her family, and has a brief relationship with an unseen woman that the squad never meet or learn the name of, nicknamed \"Becky\". She has a brief flirtation with one of Gina's friends, but this does not lead anywhere. On the day of Jake and Amy's wedding, she and Terry meet a cab driver named Alicia that she becomes interested in. The two begin a relationship off-screen. However, it's short-lived, as Rosa mentions in \"The Tattler\" that they broke up because Alicia was moving to London. \n\nIn season six, Rosa begins dating a cosmetologist named Jocelyn and begins to patch up her relationship with her mother, who was initially unaccepting of her bisexuality. In season seven, Rosa and Jocelyn broke up prior to the season's Jimmy Jab Games.\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Diaz.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", she received a commendation for her work as the leader of a drug task force.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Terry Jeffords ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Terry Jeffords\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Sergeant {{small|(seasons 1\u20136)}}|[[Lieutenant]] {{small|(season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Terry Crews]]|Theodore Barnes (child)}}\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Terrence Vincent Jeffords\n| family      = \n| spouse      = [[#Sharon Jeffords|Sharon Jeffords]] (wife)\n| significant_other = {{ubl|[[#Chiaki|Chiaki]] (ex-girlfriend)|[[#Veronica Hopkins|Veronica Hopkins]] (ex-girlfriend)}}\n| children    = {{ubl|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Cagney Jeffords]] (daughter)|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Lacey Jeffords]] (daughter)|Ava Jeffords (daughter)}}\n| relatives   = {{ubl|Lawrence Jeffords (brother)|[[#Zeke|Zeke]] (brother-in-law)|Unnamed father (deceased)|Unnamed grandmother (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Terry Crews by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Terry Crews]]]]\n[[Terry Crews]] portrays Lieutenant (previously Sergeant) '''Terrence \"Terry\" Vincent Jeffords''', the supervisor of the 9-9's Detective Squad. An avid [[bodybuilder]] who stands at more than six feet tall, with a [[linebacker]]'s build, Terry's intimidating size and appearance is contrasted by his caring, protective nature and paternal instincts. Jeffords is devoted to his wife and three young daughters Cagney, Lacey (named after the [[Cagney & Lacey|1980s TV series]]), and Ava. He fears the danger of police work because of the possibility that he could leave his children fatherless. Following a panic attack prior to the show's beginning, Terry was removed from field work, but he has since cautiously returned. He is high-strung, prone to nervous excitement, loves yogurt, and has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person. He is an effective and caring leader to the detective squad, often having to play the mature adult in order to keep them in line.\n\nA running gag throughout the series is for Terry to break things (examples include a Magic 8 Ball, a phone and Captain Holt's office) because of his incredible strength. He has been a detective since 1995 and used to be assigned to the 65th Precinct (as seen in \"Terry Kitties\"), where he was constantly mocked for a botched case which he and Jake later proved he was correct in. In S1.Ep.1. Holt mentions that he & Terry have worked together before. In 2005, he was the senior detective at the 9-9 (the position Jake now holds since Terry's promotion). He was a linebacker at [[Syracuse University]], where he graduated ''magna cum laude'', as revealed in \"The Swedes\". He also studied abroad in Japan while in college and dated a Japanese student named Chiaki who broke his heart. He speaks Japanese infrequently throughout the show.\n\nIn season two, Terry nearly gets a [[vasectomy]] at his wife's request, but Jake convinces him not to when he finds out Terry secretly wants to have more kids. His wife becomes pregnant later in the season and gives birth to their third daughter, Ava, in season three. He entrusts Jake to be Ava's godfather.\n\nWhile Terry is satisfied with his role as Sergeant, he aimed to become a Lieutenant during the first six seasons. As revealed in \"The Honeypot\", he brought a new pair of suspenders that he planned to put on after he passed the Lieutenant's Exam but kept them in the box when he ended up failing and held onto them as a reminder of his higher goals. In \"Moo Moo\", he attempted to apply to be a city council liaison to take on more responsibilities but was rejected after reporting that another cop racially profiled him. In season six, Terry reveals to the group that he passed the Lieutenant's Exam weeks before the annual Halloween Heist (which they hosted on Cinco de Mayo).\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Lieutenant Jeffords.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd bronze.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Commendation or Commendation\u2014Integrity\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD Unit Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD Unit Citation\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Amy Santiago===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Amy Santiago\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* Detective {{small|(seasons 1\u20135)}} \n* Sergeant {{small|(season 5\u2013present)}}\n}}\n| portrayer          = [[Melissa Fumero]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| alias              = Isabel Cortez (undercover alias)\n| family             = \n| spouse             = [[#Jake Peralta|Jake Peralta]]\n| significant_other  = {{ubl|[[#Teddy Wells|Teddy Wells]] (ex-boyfriend)|[[#Constantine Kane|Constantine Kane]] (ex-boyfriend)|Luke Mueller (ex-boyfriend)}}\n| children           = \n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Victor Santiago|Victor Santiago]] (father)|[[#Camila Santiago|Camila Santiago]] (mother)|Tony Santiago (brother)|[[#David Santiago|David Santiago]] (brother)|Mason Santiago (nephew)|[[#Roger Peralta|Roger Peralta]] (father-in-law)|[[#Karen Peralta|Karen Peralta]] (mother-in-law)|[[#Kate Peralta|Kate Peralta]] (half sister-in-law)|Five unnamed brothers|Two unnamed half sisters-in-law|An unknown number of half brothers-in-law|Unnamed niece}}\n| religion           = \n| nationality        = Cuban-American\n}}\n[[File:Melissa Fumero May 2018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Melissa Fumero]]]]\n[[Melissa Fumero]] portrays Sergeant (previously Detective) '''Amy Santiago''', Jake's uptight, by-the-book, rule-following [[Cuban-American]] partner, and later wife.<ref name=castlist/> A neurotic overachiever, she is continually trying to ingratiate herself with Captain Holt, and any authority figure in arm's reach of her. In the pilot, Terry explains to Holt that Amy's competitiveness is a result of her having seven brothers. Amy is a stickler for department protocol and is frequently exasperated by Jake's childishness, as well as the ease with which he succeeds as a detective. She is initially seen as Holt's teacher's pet, but over time is shown to command respect from others. \n\nAmy was originally a patrol officer at the 64th precinct but requested a transfer to the 99th when her captain almost sexually assaulted her shortly after her promotion to detective. She didn't tell anyone for years out of fear for what it would do to her career until she revealed it to Jake when they were investigating a sexual assault case in \"He Said, She Said\". \n\nIn \"Charges and Specs\", the season one finale, Jake confesses that he wishes something romantic could happen between them. She confesses to having had feelings for Jake in \"The Road Trip\" and is shown to still have feelings for Jake in \"Det. Dave Majors\". The two share their first kiss in \"Johnny and Dora\"<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> and begin dating in \"New Captain\", although their working relationship does not change at all. They decide to move in together in the season three finale \"Greg and Larry\", but don't make it official until season four's \"The Fugitive\". Jake proposes to Amy at the end of their annual Halloween heist in \"HalloVeen\" and the two eventually marry. In season seven's \"Ding Dong\", Amy reveals she is pregnant with Jake's child.\n\nNear the end of season three, Amy goes undercover as a pregnant inmate in a women's prison in Texas to obtain information from Maura Figgis. This was done to cover Melissa Fumero's actual pregnancy at the time without making her character pregnant.\n\nIn season five, Amy achieves her dream of being the youngest woman to pass the Sergeant's Exam. It is not known exactly how old Amy is, but she is under 35 as of the episode \"Cop-Con\". In season six she is revealed to be 36 years old.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Sergeant Santiago.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD Baby Delivery Citation.jpg|100px]]\n|Citation bar for delivering a baby\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Charles Boyle ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Charles Boyle\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Male\n| occupation         = Detective\n| portrayer          = [[Joe Lo Truglio]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| spouse             = [[#Eleanor Horstweil|Eleanor Hortsweil]] (ex-wife)\n| significant_other   = {{ubl||[[#Genevieve Mirren-Carter|Genevieve Mirren-Carter]] (girlfriend)|[[#Vivian Ludley|Vivian Ludley]] (ex-fianc\u00e9e)|[[#Gina Linetti|Gina Linetti]] (ex-lover)|[[#Lt.

He is divorced from his wife Eleanor, who had numerous affairs during their marriage, to the point where she has to pay alimony to him. He is also a huge, unapologetic [[foodie]], maintaining a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email and often relishing bizarre foreign cuisine that disgusts his coworkers. \n\nFor saving Detective Diaz's life during \"Christmas\" (during which he was shot in the buttocks), he was awarded the [[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]] in \"The Bet\", though he was overshadowed by a revered and heroic NYPD horse named Sgt Peanut Butter.  In \"The Swedes\", it is revealed that Boyle is a graduate of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].\n\nIn the show's first season, Charles has a crush on Rosa, but he eventually gets over her when he starts dating Vivian Ludley, whom he met at Captain Holt's birthday party. They get engaged but break up after Charles refuses to move to Canada with her. He and Gina start to see each other in season two, and their brief relationship results in his father and Gina's mother's marriage. In season three, he starts dating Genevieve Mirren-Carter after he and Jake clear her name from an art thief. They eventually move in together and adopt a son from Latvia named Nikolaj. \n\nIn season five, Charles starts his own food truck business called \"The One Thing\", which specializes in meatball subs. The truck is burned down by one of Charles' ex-employees, but he's thankful it happened as running the food truck made him spend less time with his family and built up a large debt.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Boyle.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation 1.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:Fictional Police Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar\n|}\n \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Gina Linetti ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Gina Linetti\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| last               = \"Return of the King\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{ubl|[[Administrator (business)|Administrator]] {{small|(Seasons 1\u20136)}}|Internet personality {{small|(Season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer          = [[Chelsea Peretti]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name          = Regina Linetti\n| significant_other   = {{ubl|[[#Charles Boyle|Charles Boyle]] (ex-lover)|[[#Milton Boyle|Milton Boyle]] (lover, father of her child)|Eight unnamed ex-fianc\u00e9s}}\n| children           = The Enigma \"Iggy\" Boyle (daughter)\n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Darlene Linetti|Darlene Linetti]] (mother)|[[#Lynn Boyle|Lynn Boyle]] (stepfather)|Charles Boyle (stepbrother)|Susan Grapecoat (great-aunt)|Anthony (nephew)|Unnamed sibling|Unnamed father}}\n| nationality        = American\n}}\n[[File:Chelsea Peretti at Meltdown (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Chelsea Peretti]]]]\n[[Chelsea Peretti]] portrays '''Regina \"Gina\" Linetti''', the 99th Precinct's sardonic and egomaniacal civilian administrator and Captain Holt's assistant.<ref name=castlist/> Despite maintaining a clueless and dimwitted disposition most of the time, she can be surprisingly observant and has demonstrated traits of being more intelligent than she likes to show. Gina is obsessed with social media and is constantly on her phone. It is a running gag to try to pry her from her phone, to the point where Captain Holt becomes involved. She is extremely narcissistic and constantly praises and exalts herself, such as claiming to be a better dancer than [[Britney Spears]] in the episode \"Karen Peralta\". As the only civilian in the precinct, Gina often uses her outsider's perspective to assist the other detectives. In the episode \"The Party\", to prevent the mostly [[working class]] detectives from embarrassing themselves in front of a crowd of [[academia|academics]], Rosa tricks Gina into talking to a group of psychology professors at Holt's birthday party, who then take copious notes about her narcissistic personality. They conclude that she has a complete overlap of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], a condition previously thought to be purely theoretical.\n\nShe casually admits on myriad occasions that she doesn't value her colleagues \u2013 except for Jake \u2013 as people. She was also childhood friends with Jake, who got her the job at the precinct. Gina also ruined Jake's senior year of high school by framing him as \"The Tattler\", though she did it to avoid Jake getting involved with the wrong crowd. She transferred to the Public relations Division with Captain Holt in \"Johnny and Dora\", and returns to the 9-9 with him in \"The Oolong Slayer\".<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/><ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> In the episode \"The Apartment\", it is revealed that she has been engaged eight times, but never married. At the end of \"The Fugitive Pt. 2\", she gets hit by a bus after receiving a text from Charles. The penultimate episode of season four reveals she has become pregnant following a relationship with Charles' cousin, Milton (which coincided with Chelsea Peretti's actual pregnancy). She is absent for the first half of season five on maternity leave after giving birth to a girl she nicknames \"Iggy\" (short for Enigma). \n\nIn the episode \"Halloween IV\", Gina reveals that in the fourth grade at a classmate's birthday party, a bowling ball fell onto her face. This incident knocked out her two front teeth; she's been wearing false teeth since.\n\nIn season six, Jake helps Gina realize that her talents would be better spent elsewhere and she quits her job. She becomes an internet celebrity and hosts a web show called \"The G-Hive,\" in which she gives her viewers life advice. Her work has made it too busy to spend time with her former coworkers, but she is aiming to improve after Jake confronts her for not talking to them for months. \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Raymond Holt ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Raymond Holt\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Commanding Officer, NYPD 99th Precinct {{small|(seasons 1\u20136; season 7-present)}}|Patrol officer {{small|(season 6\u20137)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Andre Braugher]]|Seth Carr (child)}}\n| alias       = Greg Stickney ([[WITSEC]] alias)\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Raymond Jacob Holt\n| spouse      = [[#Kevin Cozner|Kevin Cozner]]\n| significant_other = [[#Frederick|Frederick]] (ex-boyfriend)\n| relatives   = {{ubl|[[#Laverne Holt|Laverne Holt]] (mother)|Unnamed father (deceased)|[[#Debbie|Debbie]] (sister)| [[#Marcus|Marcus]] (nephew)<br>Geoffrey Holt (uncle)<br>Martin Cozner (brother-in-law)<br>Carol Wilg (goddaughter)<br>Gary (ex-brother-in-law)<br>Unnamed uncle (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Andre Braugher 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andre Braugher]]]]\n[[Andre Braugher]] portrays Captain '''Raymond Jacob Holt''', the 99th Precinct's strict Commanding Officer.

He has sophisticated and cultured interests, enjoying classical music, opera and attending dinner parties with his husband's academic friends, amongst other things. The Nine-Nine is Holt's first command despite many years of outstanding service, and he attributes the delay to prejudice against both his [[race (human classification)|race]] and [[homosexuality]].

After he and Peralta successfully solved a major case in \"The Chopper\", Bureau Chief Wuntch nominated him for a promotion to head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, a promotion he accepted lest Wuntch transfer his staff to horrible posts around New York City.<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> During the number of weeks he was in charge of Public Affairs, Holt was unable to accomplish anything significant thanks to Chief Wuntch's constant micromanaging. After helping Peralta solve a serial killer case, Holt found himself transferred back to command of the 9-9 by the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> He owned a burgundy [[Chevrolet Corvair]] named Gertie which was his prized possession until it was stolen in \"The Fugitive\". Doug Judy purchased him a new identical one and named it Sexarella.\n\nAt the end of season three, Holt is forced to go into witness protection in Florida with Jake when they are threatened by crime boss Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis. He worked at a family entertainment center called the Fun Zone under the alias of Greg until he and Jake baited Figgis into coming to Florida and took the criminal down with the Nine-Nine. In season five, his life and career are put at risk when he makes a deal with mobster Seamus Murphy in exchange for information to clear Jake and Rosa's names from Lt. Hawkins.\n\nDuring season five, Holt learns that the [[New York City Police Commissioner]] is retiring at the end of the year and that he is on the shortlist of candidates to replace him. He spends the rest of the season campaigning to win the Commissioner title but ends up losing to John Kelly.\n\nIn season six, Holt is encouraged by Jake and Amy to stand up to Kelly's regressive policies, leading the Commissioner to retaliate against the Nine-Nine. However, Peralta and Wuntch team up, without Holt's knowledge, to take Kelly down, resulting in Wuntch being named interim Commissioner. This detente doesn't last long, as Holt is demoted to a uniformed officer by Commissioner Wuntch after she realized he was promoted to detective too soon earlier in his career. Shortly after Wuntch's death, however, he is quickly promoted back to captain in the middle of the seventh season.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Captain Holt.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Meritorious Police Duty (with numeral \"10\")\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", he received a commendation for his supervision of Det.

Despite their inept nature, Hitchcock and Scully have both shown on occasion to be competent and even good detectives, though their laziness tends to keep them from demonstrating this most of the time. As revealed in \"Hitchcock and Scully\", the two were excellent detectives in their youths and had well-built bodies, but their careers and their physiques went downhill after they tried the wings at their eventual favorite restaurant, Wing Slutz.\n\nThe majority of the precinct tends to be disgusted by Hitchcock's more perverted nature and attitude towards women. It's revealed in \"The Last Ride\" (Season 4) that Hitchcock held the all-time record for closed cases at the 99th Precinct, one more than Sgt. Jeffords as of that episode. This is mainly due to Hitchcock being at the 99th twenty years longer than Terry. To celebrate, Hitchcock got a tattoo of himself holding a gun and putting it in his mouth, oblivious to what it [[Suicide|actually implies]].\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Hitchcock.<ref name=\"The Funeral\">{{Cite episode|title=The Funeral|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=October 4, 2015|season=3|number=2}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|\n|Unidentified Award\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Norm Scully ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Norm Scully\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = Detective 2nd Grade\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Joel McKinnon Miller]]|[[Alan Ritchson]] (young)}}\n| full_name   = \n| spouse      = Kelly (ex-wife)\n| significant_other = {{ubl|[[#Cindy Shatz|Cindy Shatz]] (girlfriend)|Lucille (ex-girlfriend)}}\n| children    = 2\n| relatives   = Earl Scully (twin brother)\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n\n[[Joel McKinnon Miller]] portrays Detective '''Norman \"Norm\" Scully''' (season 2\u2013present; recurring season 1), a middle-aged, lazy desk worker who has been best friends and partners with Detective Hitchcock for over 30 years. Scully shows talent as a [[tenor]] [[opera]] singer, [[French language|French]] speaker, having an understanding of [[Morse code]] and can \"make great [[coffee]]\", according to Sgt. Jeffords. He also displayed an uncanny ability to reassemble shredded documents in one episode. Scully routinely discloses disgusting medical issues like the entire bottom of his foot being a wart or having various strains of [[fungi]]. He claims to constantly have medical emergencies, and despite having a [[pacemaker]] fitted, he frequently suffers from [[heart attack]]s. He often embarrasses himself either unintentionally or willingly and admits to being indifferent to the judgment of others (most frequently, the fellow members of his squad.) In the early seasons, Scully is married and has a dog. The team are unsure which one of them is called Kelly, though it is later revealed in season 7 that both of them were named Kelly. He is dating Cindy Shatz, who is very similar to him in her attire and personality. He has a twin brother named Earl, also portrayed by Miller.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Scully.<ref name=\"The Funeral\"/>\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar \n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n| [[Image:NYPD Baby Delivery Citation.jpg|100px]]\n|Citation bar for delivering a baby\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Recurring characters==\n===NYPD and other law enforcement===\n* {{anchor|Fire Marshal Boone}}[[Patton Oswalt]] as [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] [[Fire Marshal]] Boone, the fire marshal of the local fire station.

He frequently makes lewd comments toward the squad and has a greatly inflated sense of self. After the death of Seth Dozerman, Pembroke becomes the Commanding Officer of the 99th Precinct until Captain Holt returns. In \"The Venue\", the Vulture steals Jake and Amy's venue at the last second to host his wedding to a kind charity worker named Jean Munhroe. When the two discover that he is unfaithful to Jean and lying to her about his character, they decide to tell Jean at the cost of Vulture taking their venue on their wedding night.

Teddy used to date Amy Santiago; they resume their relationship after meeting up at a training exercise. Later Amy breaks up with him again, because she dislikes his dull personality and is unable to show interest in his home pilsner-brewing hobby. In season four, Teddy evaluates the Nine-Nine when the crime rate drops and one precinct has to close. He claims to have changed but Jake and Amy agree that he is still \"The most boring man in America\". He also admits to Amy that he still loves her and proposes to her twice; once in front of his new girlfriend and Jake, and the second time in front of the entire squad. In season five, Teddy has joined the bomb squad and tries unsuccessfully to steal Amy away from Jake on the day of their wedding.\n\n* {{anchor|Adrian Pimento}}[[Jason Mantzoukas]] as Adrian Pimento, an emotionally unstable and volatile former detective who returned to the 99th Precinct after spending 12 years undercover in the organization of Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis. He began dating Rosa in \"Cheddar\", and the two got engaged in \"Paranoia\", promptly before Pimento and the 99 were forced to fake his death. Pimento returns from hiding when Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis is caught, but is refused his old job at the NYPD and becomes a Private Investigator. His relationship continued with Rosa, but she later breaks up with him in season five. He spends the next couple of months in Alaska before returning to Brooklyn to return as an insurance agent in \"Gray Star Mutual\", but is fired in the episode and starts working at a hand lotion store. In \"Pimemento\", it is revealed that he has worked for celebrities before as a private investigator.\n\n* {{anchor|Commissioner Podolski}}[[James M.

Wuntch and Holt were once partners and friends, but they fell out after Holt rejected her sexual advances and Wuntch gained promotions for which Holt was passed over, resulting in Wuntch eventually becoming Holt's direct superior. Wuntch constantly went out of her way to undermine the 99th Precinct, and appeared to take great pleasure in its and Holt's failures; Holt, in turn, gleefully insulted and belittled Wuntch every time their paths cross.  In \"The Chopper\" and \"Johnny and Dora\", she culminated her victory over Holt when she makes him head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, where she humiliated him by making him do menial jobs, although he is eventually transferred back to the 99 thanks to Jake. In \"Suicide Squad\", she helped Jake and the Nine-Nine expose Commissioner Kelly's illegal wiretapping activity and became the acting commissioner until a new one was decided on. Wuntch died in the episode \"Ding Dong\". At her memorial, Holt admits that he will genuinely miss her and their rivalry.<ref name=\"Ding Dong\">{{Cite episode|title=Ding Dong|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=March 12, 2020|season=7|number=163}}</ref>\n\n* {{anchor|Marcus Marinovich}}Perry L.

This backfires after he rejects their request to go to Florida and assist Jake and Holt and he assigns them to the night shift. He is eventually removed from the Captain position after he is awarded for taking down a major drug dealer (that Jake and Holt primarily took care of) and demonstrates his lack of professionalism in front of a group of reporters. It's revealed that Holt called the reporters in to help the crew return to the day shift.\n\n* {{anchor|Olivia Crawford}}[[Allison Tolman]] as Captain Olivia Crawford, a candidate for the Commissioner position Holt is also seeking.

Jake and Rosa initially pretend to be dirty cops so they can get her to lead them to Nucci, but she defeats them both after ingesting some of the cocaine. After discovering most of Debbie's bad choices stemmed from her parents treating her poorly, Rosa empathizes with Debbie and convinces her to free them so they could defeat Nucci.

He dislikes the NYPD due to their treatment of Holt and his homosexuality during his earlier years on the force but thaws a little when Jake shows him how much the 99th respects and cares for Holt. Like his husband, Kevin is cold, sardonic, formal and unemotional, although he claims that Raymond is the \"funny\" one in their relationship, something that puzzles the detectives. Cozner develops a rapport with Holt's assistant Gina Linetti, referring to her by her first name (by contrast, he takes pains to always call Jake \"Peralta\").

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season (changing the name of the series to ''Anne with an E'') on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the [[1890s]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds [[Anne Shirley]], an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl, instead (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea.

It also seems to think that Anne needs a radical feminist makeover when, in fact, the story of her success was feminist in its own right.\" This is part of a more general problem Robinson notes, that conflicts are exaggerated and overdone: \"this series thrives on non-stop tragedy.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robinson, Joanna|title=The Depths of Despair: Anne of Green Gables: Netflix's Bleak Adaptation Gets It All So Terribly Wrong|journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 12, 2017|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/anne-of-green-gables-netflix-review-anne-with-an-e-bleak-sad-wrong}}</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\nReviews for the second season were mixed.

While based upon the 1908 Canadian novel ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', its inclusion of original storylines that highlight implied trauma in the source material led to a screenplay that differs in tone from previous adaptations. The series was adapted by Emmy Award winning writer and producer [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and stars [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]], [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert,  [[R. H. Thomson]] as Matthew Cuthbert, and [[Lucas Jade Zumann]] as [[Gilbert Blythe]].\n\nIt aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] in Canada and was later made available for streaming on [[Netflix]]. The series premiered on March 19, 2017, on CBC and on May 12 internationally. It was renewed for a second season (changing the name of the series to ''Anne with an E'') on August 3, 2017, and for a third season in August 2018. Shortly after the third season was released in Fall 2019, CBC and Netflix announced that the series was canceled.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the [[1890s]], brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both of whom never married and are past their prime, decide to adopt an orphan boy from a local orphanage to help out around their ancestral farm of [[Green Gables (Prince Edward Island)|Green Gables]], on the outskirts of the town of [[Avonlea (Anne of Green Gables)|Avonlea]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. When Matthew goes to pick the child up at the railway station, he finds an imaginative, bright, high-spirited, and talkative girl instead, [[Anne Shirley]] (an orphan since her parents died when she was a few months old, Anne lived as a servant in various households before being placed in an orphan asylum). \n\nWhile Matthew decides he would like for her to stay, Marilla doesn't trust Anne, given her status as an unknown orphan, and the perceived uselessness of a young girl. Her distrust appears confirmed when Marilla cannot locate a brooch, thus leading her to believe that Anne is a thief. The Cuthberts send her away, thus \"returning\" her to the orphanage. While she does arrive back at the orphanage, she is terrified to enter, haunted by bullying she had endured there, and returns to the train station. Meanwhile, Marilla discovers that the brooch had been misplaced rather than lost, and that prejudice had led her to believe Anne was a thief. Matthew consequently finds Anne and convinces her to return to Green Gables, where she is officially made part of their family. However, Anne continues to face bullying from students in the Avonlea school, and class-based discrimination from Diana's parents and others in Avolea. Anne once again returns to her survival mechanisms of imagination, intelligence, and problem solving abilities that eventually lead to her acceptance by the rest of the community.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Amybeth McNulty]] as [[Anne Shirley]]<ref name=cast>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/netflix-anne-of-green-gables-cast-anne-shirley-marilla-matthew-1201840328/|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Geraldine James]] as Marilla Cuthbert<ref name=cast/>\n* [[R.

But its desire to reveal more of Anne's miserable past in order to be more true to what the desperation of an orphan is like feels at odds with Montgomery's story.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Keene, Allison|title='Anne with an E' Review: Netflix's Green Gables Adaptation Has Grit|url=https://collider.com/anne-with-an-e-review-netflix/#images|website=Collider|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', critic Sonia Saraiya is even more ambivalent, describing the series as on the one hand \"a brilliant adaptation\" which \"succeeds admirably\", but on the other hand, \"the show can't quite sustain the brilliance, veering first into maudlin territory and then into the oddly saccharine as it tests out its tone\", contending that \"the show gets a bit bogged down in telling the story of Anne's dysfunction\", presenting \"a slightly soapy view of Anne's trials and tribulations that at times really humanize her and in others, are rather infantilizing\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Saraiya, Sonia|title=TV Review: 'Anne With an E,' Based on the Book 'Anne of Green Gables'|journal=Variety|date=May 11, 2017|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/reviews/tv-review-anne-with-an-e-anne-of-green-gables-netflix-1202424199/}}</ref>\n\nSarah Larson, writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', was not at all impressed with changes made to the story, arguing that they alter Anne's character to the point of non-recognition. While she acknowledges that bringing subtext to the fore is a fine idea, she is not pleased with the execution, saying that the result is part \"the Anne we know and love\" and part \"untrustworthy stranger\", calling the alteration and addition of scenes a \"betrayal\" of Montgomery's novel, comparing the treatment unfavourably to [[Patricia Rozema]]'s [[Mansfield Park (1999 film)|1999 adaptation]] of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Mansfield Park]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Larson, Sarah|title=How Not to Adapt \"Anne of Green Gables\"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/how-not-to-adapt-anne-of-green-gables|journal=The New Yorker|date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> For Joanna Robinson, writing for ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'', a central problem with the show is that it \"seems to think that in order for Anne to be a feminist figure, she has to butt up against a straw-man-filled patriarchy,\" and so it turned many of the male characters into [[misogynists]], most notably the Reverend Allan, who is considered by Anne to be a \"kindred spirit\" in the book: \"''Anne with an E'' seems to think Anne's triumphs are only noteworthy if she's continually told she can't succeed, when in fact her unfettered brilliance needs no such clumsy opposition. It also seems to think that Anne needs a radical feminist makeover when, in fact, the story of her success was feminist in its own right.\" This is part of a more general problem Robinson notes, that conflicts are exaggerated and overdone: \"this series thrives on non-stop tragedy.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Robinson, Joanna|title=The Depths of Despair: Anne of Green Gables: Netflix's Bleak Adaptation Gets It All So Terribly Wrong|journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 12, 2017|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/anne-of-green-gables-netflix-review-anne-with-an-e-bleak-sad-wrong}}</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\nReviews for the second season were mixed.
