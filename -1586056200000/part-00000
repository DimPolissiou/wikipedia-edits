It is the peacetime equivalent of the [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC), and is awarded for the \"most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent valour or self-sacrifice\" other than in the face of the enemy. The decoration may be awarded either to military or civilian personnel.\n\nFlt. Lt. [[Suhas Biswas]] was the first [[Indian Air Force]] officer to be awarded the Ashoka Chakra<!--wasn't he the first person of any description?  why single out the air force?-->. Subsequent awards of the Ashoka Chakra are recognized by a bar to the medal ribbon. A recipient can be awarded the [[Kirti Chakra]] or [[Shaurya Chakra]] in addition for separate acts of gallantry.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe medal was originally established on 4 January 1952 as the \"Ashoka Chakra, Class I\" as the first step of a three-class sequence of non-combatant bravery decorations. In 1967, these decorations were removed from the \"class-based\" system and renamed as the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra. This is an important point in understanding the independent Indian view of decorations. It would also lead to changes in the Padma Vibhushan series, the distinguished service medal series, the life saving medal series, and the Defence Security Corps medal series.\n\nFrom 1 February 1999, the central government instituted a monthly stipend for Ashoka Chakra recipients of Rs. 1400. Jammu and Kashmir awarded a cash award of Rs. 1500 for recipients of this award.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n'''Obverse:''' Circular gold gilt, 1-3/8&nbsp;inches in diameter. In the center, the chakra (wheel) of Ashoka, surrounded by a lotus wreath and with an ornate edge. Suspended by a straight bar suspender. The medal is named on the edge.\n\n'''Reverse:''' Blank in the center, with \"Ashoka Chakra\" in [[Hindi]] along the upper edge on the medal and the same name in English along the lower rim. On either side is a lotus design. The center is blank, perhaps with the intent that details of the award be engraved there. There is no indication of the class on the pre-1967 awards, and, in fact, there is no difference between these medals & the post-1967 awards.\n\n'''Ribbon:''' 32&nbsp;mm, dark green with a 2&nbsp;mm central saffron stripe.\n\nTo date, 83 people have been awarded the \"Ashoka Chakra\".</small><ref name=\"gallantryawards.gov.in\"/><ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyred-corporal-jyoti-prakash-nirala-joins-elite-iaf-club-tomorrow/articleshow/62647401.cms</ref><!--have any been awarded a bar?-->\n\n== Ashoka Chakra recipients ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Key\n|-\n|align=center style=\"width:50px;background-color:#e3d9ff;\"|{{Hash}}\n|Indicates a posthumous honour\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ List of award recipients, showing the year\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n!Rank\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient\n!Branch\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |{{Tooltip|Refs.|Reference}}\n|-\n| 2019 \n|[[Lance naik|Lance Naik]]||[[ Nazir Ahmad Wani]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref>{{cite web|title=411 Republic Day Gallantry and Other Defence Decorations Announced|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=187777|website=pib.nic.in}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2018 \n|[[Corporal]]||[[Jyoti Prakash Nirala]] #\n|[[Indian Air Force|Indian Airforce]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2018\"/<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyred-corporal-jyoti-prakash-nirala-joins-elite-iaf-club-tomorrow/articleshow/62647401.cms</ref>\n|-\n| 2017 \n|[[Havildar]]||[[Hangpan Dada]]#\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n| 2016 \n|[[Lance naik|Lance Naik]]||[[Lance Naik Mohan Goswami|Mohan Goswami]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2014\n|[[Major]]||[[Mukund Varadarajan]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n|[[Naik (military rank)|Naik]]||[[Neeraj Kumar Singh]] #\n|[[Indian Army]]||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n|[[Sub-inspector|Sub-Inspector]]||[[K.

It is the peacetime equivalent of the [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC), and is awarded for the \"most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent valour or self-sacrifice\" other than in the face of the enemy. The decoration may be awarded either to military or civilian personnel.\n\nFlt. Lt. [[Suhas Biswas]] was the first [[Indian Air Force]] officer to be awarded the Ashoka Chakra<!--wasn't he the first person of any description?  why single out the air force?-->. Subsequent awards of the Ashoka Chakra are recognized by a bar to the medal ribbon. A recipient can be awarded the [[Kirti Chakra]] or [[Shaurya Chakra]] in addition for separate acts of gallantry.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe medal was originally established on 4 January 1952 as the \"Ashoka Chakra, Class I\" as the first step of a three-class sequence of non-combatant bravery decorations. In 1967, these decorations were removed from the \"class-based\" system and renamed as the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra. This is an important point in understanding the independent Indian view of decorations. It would also lead to changes in the Padma Vibhushan series, the distinguished service medal series, the life saving medal series, and the Defence Security Corps medal series.\n\nFrom 1 February 1999, the central government instituted a monthly stipend for Ashoka Chakra recipients of Rs. 1400. Jammu and Kashmir awarded a cash award of Rs. 1500 for recipients of this award.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n'''Obverse:''' Circular gold gilt, 1-3/8&nbsp;inches in diameter. In the center, the chakra (wheel) of Ashoka, surrounded by a lotus wreath and with an ornate edge. Suspended by a straight bar suspender. The medal is named on the edge.\n\n'''Reverse:''' Blank in the center, with \"Ashoka Chakra\" in [[Hindi]] along the upper edge on the medal and the same name in English along the lower rim. On either side is a lotus design. The center is blank, perhaps with the intent that details of the award be engraved there. There is no indication of the class on the pre-1967 awards, and, in fact, there is no difference between these medals & the post-1967 awards.\n\n'''Ribbon:''' 32&nbsp;mm, dark green with a 2&nbsp;mm central saffron stripe.\n\nTo date, 83 people have been awarded the \"Ashoka Chakra\".</small><ref name=\"gallantryawards.gov.in\"/><ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyred-corporal-jyoti-prakash-nirala-joins-elite-iaf-club-tomorrow/articleshow/62647401.cms</ref><!--have any been awarded a bar?-->\n\n== Ashoka Chakra recipients ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Key\n|-\n|align=center style=\"width:50px;background-color:#e3d9ff;\"|{{Hash}}\n|Indicates a posthumous honour\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ List of award recipients, showing the year\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n!Rank\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient\n!Branch\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |{{Tooltip|Refs.|Reference}}\n|-\n| 2019 \n|Lance Naik||[[ Nazir Ahmad Wani]] #\n|Indian Army||<ref>{{cite web|title=411 Republic Day Gallantry and Other Defence Decorations Announced|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=187777|website=pib.nic.in}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2018 \n|Corporal||[[Jyoti Prakash Nirala]] #\n|Indian Airforce||<ref name=\"AC2009-2018\"/<ref>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/martyred-corporal-jyoti-prakash-nirala-joins-elite-iaf-club-tomorrow/articleshow/62647401.cms</ref>\n|-\n| 2017 \n|Havildar||[[Hangpan Dada]]#\n|Indian Army||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n| 2016 \n|Lance Naik||[[Lance Naik Mohan Goswami|Mohan Goswami]] #\n|Indian Army||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2014\n|Major||[[Mukund Varadarajan]] #\n|Indian Army||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n|Naik||[[Neeraj Kumar Singh]] #\n|Indian Army||<ref name=\"AC2009-2016\"/>\n|-\n|Sub Inspector||[[K.

It was [[Estelle Getty]]'s final film before her retirement in 2001 and her death in 2008.\n\n==Plot==\nEleanor and Frederick Little are intending to [[Adoption|adopt]] a new family member. They go to an [[orphanage]] where they meet an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] teenage mouse named Stuart. Despite misgivings from Mrs. Keeper, they adopt Stuart and take him home. However, Stuart is greeted coldly by their young son George, who refuses to acknowledge the mouse as his brother, and the family cat, Snowbell, who is disgusted at having a mouse for a \"master\". Despite Eleanor and Frederick's intentions, Stuart is treated as outcast due to his small size. Stuart admits his feelings of loneliness to his adoptive parents, who ask Mrs. Keeper to search whereabouts of Stuart's biological parents.\n\nAfter accidentally stumbling across George's playroom in the basement, Stuart finally bonds with George when they play together and plan to finish George's remote controlled racing sailboat, the Wasp, for an upcoming boat race in [[Central Park]]. At the same time, however, one of Snowbell's alley cat friends, Monty, visits unexpectedly and discovers Stuart. Determined not to have his reputation destroyed, Snowbell later meets with Monty's leader, Smokey, who accepts to remove Stuart from the household.\n\nStuart and George finish the Pee Pee Poo Poo Wasp in time for the race, but on the day of the race, the controller is smashed by accident. To make it up to George, Stuart pilots the Wasp himself, but ends up in a tussle with a larger boat piloted by George's rival, Anton. Stuart manages to win the race, gaining George's respect. However, during the family celebration, the Littles are visited by a mouse couple, Reginald and Camille Stout, who claim to be Stuart's parents that gave him up to the orphanage due to poverty. Reluctantly, Stuart leaves with the Stouts and George gives him his favorite toy car as a farewell gift. However, Mrs. Keeper arrives and tells the Littles that Stuart's real parents died many years ago in an accident at a supermarket. Realizing that the Stouts are imposters, the Littles call the police, who start a search operation.\n\nFearing retribution should the Littles discover his deception, Snowbell talks with Smokey, who orders the Stouts to hand Stuart over to them, but the Stouts, having grown to love Stuart like their own, tell him the truth and instruct him to flee. In Central Park, Stuart is confronted by Smokey and his gang, who chase him into a sewer drain, where he manages to outrun Smokey and his gang, but losing his car in the process. \n\nStuart returns home, but unfortunately he comes early when the Littles gone to put up posters of him all over the city. Stuart enters the house where he meets Snowbell, who lies that the Littles have been enjoying themselves greatly since Stuart\u2019s departure. Feeling unwanted, a heartbroken Stuart leaves.\n\nThe Littles return home with no success of finding Stuart. Meanwhile, Smokey, Monty and the other alley cats manage to pinpoint Stuart's location back to Central Park and bring Snowbell along for the hunt. Snowbell, remorseful over his selfishness, finds Stuart and saves him from the cats, admitting about his lies and, together, defeat Smokey, Monty and the other cats by dropping them into the water. \n\nStuart and Snowbell later return home, where Stuart happily reunites with the Little family.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live-action cast===\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Geena Davis]] as Eleanor Little\n*[[Hugh Laurie]] as Frederick Little\n*[[Jonathan Lipnicki]] as George Little\n*[[Jim Doughan]] as Officer Allen\n*[[Stan Freberg]] as Race Announcer\n*[[Jeffrey Jones]] as Uncle Crenshaw\n*[[Connie Ray]] as Aunt Tina\n*[[Allyce Beasley]] as Aunt Beatrice\n*[[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Cousin Edgar\n*[[Estelle Getty]] as Grandma Estelle\n*[[Harold Gould]] as Grandpa Spencer\n*[[Patrick Thomas O'Brien]] as Uncle Stretch\n*[[Arturo Peniche]] as Carlos\n*[[Julia Sweeney]] as Mrs. Keeper\n*[[Manuel Ojeda]] as Genaro\n*[[Dabney Coleman]] as Dr. Beechwood\n* Miles Marsico as Anton\n*[[Jon Polito]] as Officer Sherman\n*[[Francisco Gattorno]] as Jose Maria \n*Joe Bays as Race Starter\n*[[Taylor Negron]] as Salesman\n*[[Cesar Evora]] as Gabriel\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Voice cast===\n*[[Michael J.
