It is not clear how far Reymond, Pache, and Salama had ascended&nbsp;\u2013 but in summarizing, Crowley ventured \"We had reached a height of approximately {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.\" Attempting a \"mutinous\" late-in-the-day descent from Camp 5 to Camp 4, climber Alexis Pache (who earlier that day had been one of three to ascend possibly higher than any before), and three local porters, were killed in an avalanche. Despite the insistence of one of the men that \"The demon of Kangchenjunga was propitiated with the sacrifice\", Crowley decided enough was enough and that it was inappropriate to continue.<ref name=\"crowley52\">Crowley, A.; Symonds, J.; Grant, K.

On 1 September, they evidently went further; some members of the team, Reymond, Pache, and Salama, \"got over the bad patch\" that had forced them to return to Camp 5 the day before, and progressed \"out of sight and hearing\" before returning to Crowley and the men with packs, who could not cross the dangerous section unassisted with their burdens.

This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture, while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into [[Scandinavia]] itself, with profound developmental implications in both directions. During the Viking Age the Norse homelands were gradually consolidated into three larger kingdoms, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The [[Normans]], descendants of Vikings who became rulers of [[Normandy]] which was named after them, also formed the aristocracy of England from the [[Norman conquest of England]].\n\nNorse civilisation during the Viking Age was technologically, military and culturally advanced. Yet popular, modern conceptions of the Vikings\u2014the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia\u2014often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from [[archaeology]] and historical sources, namely that of the advanced civilisation that Norsemen were.

The Old Norse feminine ''v\u00edking'' (as in the phrase ''fara \u00ed v\u00edking'') may originally have been a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A ''v\u00edkingr'' (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.<ref name=\"Eldar Heide 2008 23\u201328\"/>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the word ''wicing'' appears first in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] poem, ''[[Widsith]]'', which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen]] written by [[Adam of Bremen]] in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved [[Middle English]] texts. One theory made by the [[Iceland]]er \u00d6rnolfur Kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is \"''wicinga cynn''\" in Widsith, referring to the people or the race living in [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] (York, in the ninth century under control by Norsemen), ''J\u00f3r-Wicings'' (note, however, that this is not the origin of ''J\u00f3rv\u00edk'').<ref name=\"arch in europe\">{{cite web|last=Beard |first=David |title=The Term \"Viking\" |url=http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |work=archeurope.com |publisher=Archaeology in Europe |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407050944/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''Viking'' was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"[[barbarian]] warrior\" or [[noble savage]]. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like ''Viking age'', ''Viking culture'', ''Viking art'', ''Viking religion'', ''Viking ship'' and so on.<ref name=\"arch in europe\"/>\n\nThe term \u201dViking\u201d that appeared in Northwestern Germanic sources in the Viking Age denoted pirates. According to some researchers, the term back then had no geographic or ethnic connotations that limited it to Scandinavia only. The term was instead used about anyone who to the Norse peoples appeared as a pirate. Therefore, the term had been used about Israelites on the Red Sea; Muslims encountering Scandinavians in the Mediterranean; Caucasian pirates encountering the famous Swedish Ingvar-Expedition, and Estonian pirates on the Baltic Sea. Thus the term \"Viking\" was supposedly never limited to a single ethnicity as such, but rather an activity.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/8906219/_Vikings_and_the_Viking_Age?email_work_card=title]</ref>\n\n===Other names===\n[[File:Europe 814.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Europe in 814.

The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |title=Viking expeditions and raids |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172137/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |archive-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : a very short introduction|last=Richards|first=J.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea.

Kendrick]], ''A History of the Vikings'', Courier Dover Publications, 2004, pp. 179ff, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43396-7}}</ref>\n\n===End of the Viking Age===\nDuring the Viking Age, Scandinavian men and women travelled to many parts of Europe and beyond, in a cultural diaspora that left its traces from [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] to [[Byzantium]]. This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.<ref>Roesdahl, pp. 295\u201397</ref> In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.\n\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the [[Catholic Church]] (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.<ref>Gareth Williams, \"Kingship, Christianity and coinage: monetary and political perspectives on silver economy in the Viking Age\", in ''Silver Economy in the Viking Age'', ed. [[James Graham-Campbell]] and Gareth Williams, pp.&nbsp;177\u2013214; {{ISBN|978-1-59874-222-0}}</ref> By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<ref>Roesdahl, p. 296</ref>\n\n==== Assimilation into Christendom ====\n[[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianity had taken root]] in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at [[Lund]], Scania, then part of Denmark.\n\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so [[chattel slavery]] diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.\n\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, [[Sigurd I of Norway]] sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; {{ISBN|0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on [[runestone]]s. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|title=Written sources shed light on Viking travels|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172414/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<ref>Hall, 2010, pp. 8 ''passim''.</ref><ref>Roesdahl, pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.\n\n===Literature and language===\n{{See also|Old Norse|The Norse Sagas }}\n[[File:Lbs fragm 82, 0001v - 1.jpg|thumb|One of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the [[Heimskringla Saga]]s, written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] c. 1260. The leaf tells of [[Olaf II of Norway|King \u00d3lafur]].]]\n\nThe most important [[primary sources]] on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.<ref>Hall, pp. 8\u201311</ref> Writing in [[Latin]] letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.<ref>Lindqvist, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in [[runes]], but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.\n\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval [[Christian culture]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]]. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of [[skald]]ic poetry attributed to [[Poet laureate|court poets]] of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.\n\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like [[Egilsay]] (from ''Eigils ey'' meaning Eigil's Island), [[Ormskirk]] (from ''Ormr kirkja'' meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), [[Meols]] (from ''merl'' meaning Sand Dunes), [[Snaefell]] (Snow Fell), [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] (Ravens Rock), [[Vinland]] (Land of Wine or Land of [[Winberry]]), [[Kaupanger]] (Market Harbour), [[T\u00f3rshavn]] (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of [[Odense]], meaning a place where [[Odin]] was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the [[Tynwald]] on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nCommon words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays ([[Thursday]] means Thor's day), [[wikt:axle|axle]], [[wikt:crook|crook]], [[wikt:raft|raft]], [[wikt:knife|knife]], [[wikt:plough|plough]], [[wikt:leather|leather]], [[wikt:window|window]], [[berserker|berserk]], [[bylaw]], [[thorp]], [[skerry]], [[wikt:husband|husband]], {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Hel (being)|Hell]], [[Normans|Norman]] and [[wikt:ransack|ransack]] stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.<ref>See [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]] for further explanations on specific words.</ref> In the [[Northern Isles]] of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct [[Norn language]]. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as [[York]] (Horse Bay), [[Swansea]] ([[Sven|Sveinn]]'s Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like [[Tocqueville (disambiguation)|Tocqueville]] (Toki's farm).<ref>See [[Norman toponymy]].</ref>\n\n[[Linguistic]] and [[etymology|etymological]] studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<ref>Henriksen, Louise K\u00e6mpe: [http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 Nordic place names in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032738/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 |date=22 February 2014 }} Viking Ship Museum Roskilde</ref><ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html Viking Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125117/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html |date=3 February 2007 }} The British Library</ref> A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref>[http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ Department of Scandinavian Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084718/http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ |date=8 February 2014 }} University of Copenhagen</ref> Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the [[Slavic languages]] in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe.

There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the [[longship]].<ref>Longships are sometimes erroneously called ''drakkar'', a corruption of \"dragon\" in Norse.</ref> Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the [[Leidang]], the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to ''go Viking'', which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.<ref>Hadingham, Evan: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html Secrets of Viking Ships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912023933/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html |date=12 September 2017 }} (05.09.00) NOVA science media.</ref><ref>Durham, Keith: ''Viking Longship'' Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The ''[[knarr]]'' was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the '[[beitass]]', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.<ref>Block, Leo, [https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc ''To Harness the Wind: A Short History of the Development of Sails''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203825/https://books.google.com/books?id=ezgq0VnV5XQC&hl=en |date=1 January 2016 }}, Naval Institute Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-55750-209-9}}</ref> It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = VIKING LONGSHIP \"SEA STALLION\" ARRIVES IN DUBLIN.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Sea Stallion\n| caption1  = [[Sea Stallion (longship)|A reconstructed longship]]\n| image2    = Modell Knorr.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Knarr Haithabu\n| caption2  = A model of the ''knarr'' ship type\n| footer    = Two typical viking ships.\n}}\n\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] in Norway<ref>Ian Heath, The Vikings, p. 4, Osprey Publishing, 1985.</ref> and the excavated ship burial at [[Ladby ship|Ladby]] in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the [[Salme ships]] on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |title=The First Vikings |magazine=Archaeology |publisher=the Archaeological Institute of America |first=Andrew |last=Curry |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228192503/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |archive-date=28 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from [[Roskilde Fjord]] in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the ''knarr''. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect [[Roskilde]], then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the [[Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Everyday life===\n\n====Social structure====\n[[File:Reconstructed Viking House.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Viking house in Iceland]]\n[[File:Viking house Ale Sweden.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed Viking Longhouse in Ale, north of Gothenburg [[Sweden]] ]]\n[[File:Chieftains house (reconstruction) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at [[Lofotr Viking Museum]], Norway]]\n[[File:Busdorf - Haithabu - Wikinger-H\u00e4user 05 ies.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed town houses from [[Haithabu]] (now in Germany)]]\n\nViking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the [[Eddic poem]] of [[R\u00edgs\u00feula]], which also explains that it was the [[R\u00edg (Norse god)|God R\u00edg]]\u2014father of mankind also known as [[Heimdallr]]\u2014who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.<ref name=\"Roesdahl 38\">Roesdahl, pp. 38\u201348, 61\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[Thrall]]s were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vikings may have first taken to seas to find women, slaves |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=15 April 2016 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190115/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |archive-date=1 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and the economy. Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'tr\u00e6l' and 'ty'.\n\nKarls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.\n\nThe Jarls were the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes [[Human sacrifice in Germanic paganism|sacrificially killed]] and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|title=Double graves with headless slaves|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=23 June 2014|author=Mari Kildah|publisher=University of Oslo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011090033/http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|archive-date=11 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it is believed that there must have been some social mobility. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like ''hauldr'', ''thegn'', ''landmand'', show mobility between the Karls and the Jarls.\n\nOther social structures included the communities of ''f\u00e9lag'' in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called ''f\u00e9lagi'') were obliged. A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as ''drenge'', one of the words for warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the [[Thing (assembly)|Things]].\n\n====Women====\nWomen had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic [[Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s]] and the Norwegian [[Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Borgstr\u00f6m Eva {{in lang|sv}}: Makal\u00f6sa kvinnor: k\u00f6ns\u00f6verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.).

Almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see [[Viking art]]). Finger rings were seldom used and earrings were not used at all, as they were seen as a [[Slavic people|Slavic]] phenomenon.

This included spear and stone throwing, building and testing physical strength through [[wrestling]] (see [[glima]]), [[fist fighting]], and stone lifting. In areas with mountains, [[mountain climbing]] was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship's railing as it was being rowed. [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] was a popular sport and [[Snorri Sturluson]] describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of [[knife juggling]] as well.\n\n[[Skiing]] and [[ice skating]] were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north.\n\nHorse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions.\n\nIcelandic sources refer to the sport of ''[[knattleikr|knattleik]]''. A ball game akin to [[hockey]], knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice. The rules are unclear, but it was popular with both adults and children, even though it often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.\n\nHunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, [[deer]], [[hare]]s and [[fox]]es were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows. The techniques were stalking, snare and traps and ''[[par force]]'' hunting with dog packs.\n\n====Games and entertainment====\n[[File:Beserker, Lewis Chessmen, British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rook, [[Lewis chessmen]], at the British Museum in London]]\nBoth archaeological finds and written sources testify to the fact that the Vikings set aside time for social and festive gatherings.<ref name=KWolf/><ref name=SportsGames/><ref name=NatMus>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-people/games-and-entertainment/|title=Games and entertainment in the Viking period|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502075927/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-people/games-and-entertainment/|archive-date=2 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoard games and dice games were played as a popular pastime at all levels of society.

This trade satisfied the Vikings' need for leather and meat to some extent, and perhaps hides for [[parchment]] production on the European mainland. Wool was also very important as a domestic product for the Vikings, to produce warm clothing for the cold Scandinavian and Nordic climate, and for sails. Sails for Viking ships required large amounts of wool, as evidenced by experimental archaeology. There are archaeological signs of organised textile productions in Scandinavia, reaching as far back as the early [[Nordic Iron Age|Iron Ages]].

The devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]].<ref>English Historical Documents, c. 500\u20131042 by Dorothy Whitelock; p. 776</ref> Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".<ref>Derry (2012).

Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the [[Icelanders]] Snorri Sturluson and [[S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.\n\nThe 200-year Viking influence on [[History of Europe|European history]] is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] chronicles, [[Novgorod]] chronicles, [[Ibn Fadlan]] chronicles, [[Ibn Rusta]] chronicles, and brief mentions by [[Photius]], patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other chroniclers of Viking history include [[Adam of Bremen]], who wrote, in the fourth volume of his ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'', \"[t]here is much gold here (in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called ''wichingi'' by their own people, and ''Ascomanni'' by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the [[Battle of Maldon]] between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.\n\n===Post-medieval perceptions===\n[[File:Vikings fight.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Combat reenactment|modern reenactment]] of a Viking battle]]\nEarly modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (''History of the northern people'') of [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century ''Gesta Danorum'' (''Deeds of the Danes''),  by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and the Swede [[Olaus Rudbeck]] used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], who published his ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' (''Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages'') in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.\n\nThe word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his poem, ''The Viking''. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of ''[[Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna]]'', which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n[[File:Viking Siege of Paris.jpg|thumb|Viking long ships [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieging Paris]] in 845, 19th century portrayal]]\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called [[Viking revival]] in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of [[Romantic nationalism]]. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"[[Wagnerian]]\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries [[Scandinavism]]. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by [[Richard Wagner]]. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.<ref>[[William W. Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, p. 363</ref> Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in [[Nazi Germany]] as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of [[Nazi mysticism]]. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda.\n\n[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ohloblyn |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |accessdate=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907221348/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |archive-date=7 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives.

The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side.\n\nHistorians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th-century enthusiasts of ''[[Geatish Society|G\u00f6tiska F\u00f6rbundet]]'', founded in 1811 in [[Stockholm]].<ref name=\"Frank\">{{cite book |last=Frank |first=Roberta |title=International Scandinavian and Medieval Studies in Memory of Gerd Wolfgang Weber |year=2000 |publisher=Ed.

This was done to legitimise the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealised in European culture.\n\nThe latter-day ''mythos'' created by [[National Romanticism|national romantic ideas]] blended the Viking Age with aspects of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] some 2,000 years earlier. Horned helmets from the Bronze Age were shown in [[petroglyph]]s and appeared in archaeological finds (see [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] and [[Vikso]] helmets).

This period of expansion witnessed the wider dissemination of Norse culture, while simultaneously introducing strong foreign cultural influences into [[Scandinavia]] itself, with profound developmental implications in both directions. During the Viking Age the Norse homelands were gradually consolidated into three larger kingdoms, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The [[Normans]], descendants of Vikings who became rulers of [[Normandy]] which was named after them, also formed the aristocracy of England from the [[Norman conquest of England]].\n\nNorse civilisation during the Viking Age was technologically, military and culturally advanced. Yet popular, modern conceptions of the Vikings\u2014the term frequently applied casually to their modern descendants and the inhabitants of modern Scandinavia\u2014often strongly differ from the complex picture that emerges from [[archaeology]] and historical sources, namely that of the advanced civilisation that Norsemen were.

The Old Norse feminine ''v\u00edking'' (as in the phrase ''fara \u00ed v\u00edking'') may originally have been a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A ''v\u00edkingr'' (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.<ref name=\"Eldar Heide 2008 23\u201328\"/>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the word ''wicing'' appears first in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] poem, ''[[Widsith]]'', which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen]] written by [[Adam of Bremen]] in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved [[Middle English]] texts. One theory made by the [[Iceland]]er \u00d6rnolfur Kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is \"''wicinga cynn''\" in Widsith, referring to the people or the race living in [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] (York, in the ninth century under control by Norsemen), ''J\u00f3r-Wicings'' (note, however, that this is not the origin of ''J\u00f3rv\u00edk'').<ref name=\"arch in europe\">{{cite web|last=Beard |first=David |title=The Term \"Viking\" |url=http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |work=archeurope.com |publisher=Archaeology in Europe |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407050944/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''Viking'' was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"[[barbarian]] warrior\" or [[noble savage]]. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like ''Viking age'', ''Viking culture'', ''Viking art'', ''Viking religion'', ''Viking ship'' and so on.<ref name=\"arch in europe\"/>\n\nThe term \u201dViking\u201d that appeared in Northwestern Germanic sources in the Viking Age denoted pirates. According to some researchers, the term back then had no geographic or ethnic connotations that limited it to Scandinavia only.

England suffered from internal divisions and was relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers. Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted. The decline in the profitability of old [[trade route]]s could also have played a role.

The [[Jutes]] invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, pouring out from [[Jutland]] during the [[Age of Migrations]], before the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] settled there. The [[Saxons]] and the [[Angles]] did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |title=Viking expeditions and raids |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172137/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |archive-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : a very short introduction|last=Richards|first=J.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea.

This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.<ref>Roesdahl, pp. 295\u201397</ref> In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.\n\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the [[Catholic Church]] (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.<ref>Gareth Williams, \"Kingship, Christianity and coinage: monetary and political perspectives on silver economy in the Viking Age\", in ''Silver Economy in the Viking Age'', ed. [[James Graham-Campbell]] and Gareth Williams, pp.&nbsp;177\u2013214; {{ISBN|978-1-59874-222-0}}</ref> By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<ref>Roesdahl, p. 296</ref>\n\n==== Assimilation into Christendom ====\n[[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianity had taken root]] in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at [[Lund]], Scania, then part of Denmark.\n\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so [[chattel slavery]] diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.\n\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, [[Sigurd I of Norway]] sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; {{ISBN|0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on [[runestone]]s. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|title=Written sources shed light on Viking travels|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172414/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<ref>Hall, 2010, pp. 8 ''passim''.</ref><ref>Roesdahl, pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.\n\n===Literature and language===\n{{See also|Old Norse|The Norse Sagas }}\n[[File:Lbs fragm 82, 0001v - 1.jpg|thumb|One of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the [[Heimskringla Saga]]s, written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] c. 1260. The leaf tells of [[Olaf II of Norway|King \u00d3lafur]].]]\n\nThe most important [[primary sources]] on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.<ref>Hall, pp. 8\u201311</ref> Writing in [[Latin]] letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.<ref>Lindqvist, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in [[runes]], but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.\n\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval [[Christian culture]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]]. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of [[skald]]ic poetry attributed to [[Poet laureate|court poets]] of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.\n\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like [[Egilsay]] (from ''Eigils ey'' meaning Eigil's Island), [[Ormskirk]] (from ''Ormr kirkja'' meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), [[Meols]] (from ''merl'' meaning Sand Dunes), [[Snaefell]] (Snow Fell), [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] (Ravens Rock), [[Vinland]] (Land of Wine or Land of [[Winberry]]), [[Kaupanger]] (Market Harbour), [[T\u00f3rshavn]] (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of [[Odense]], meaning a place where [[Odin]] was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the [[Tynwald]] on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nCommon words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays ([[Thursday]] means Thor's day), [[wikt:axle|axle]], [[wikt:crook|crook]], [[wikt:raft|raft]], [[wikt:knife|knife]], [[wikt:plough|plough]], [[wikt:leather|leather]], [[wikt:window|window]], [[berserker|berserk]], [[bylaw]], [[thorp]], [[skerry]], [[wikt:husband|husband]], {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Hel (being)|Hell]], [[Normans|Norman]] and [[wikt:ransack|ransack]] stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.<ref>See [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]] for further explanations on specific words.</ref> In the [[Northern Isles]] of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct [[Norn language]]. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as [[York]] (Horse Bay), [[Swansea]] ([[Sven|Sveinn]]'s Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like [[Tocqueville (disambiguation)|Tocqueville]] (Toki's farm).<ref>See [[Norman toponymy]].</ref>\n\n[[Linguistic]] and [[etymology|etymological]] studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<ref>Henriksen, Louise K\u00e6mpe: [http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 Nordic place names in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032738/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 |date=22 February 2014 }} Viking Ship Museum Roskilde</ref><ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html Viking Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125117/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html |date=3 February 2007 }} The British Library</ref> A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref>[http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ Department of Scandinavian Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084718/http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ |date=8 February 2014 }} University of Copenhagen</ref> Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the [[Slavic languages]] in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe.

There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the [[longship]].<ref>Longships are sometimes erroneously called ''drakkar'', a corruption of \"dragon\" in Norse.</ref> Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the [[Leidang]], the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to ''go Viking'', which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.<ref>Hadingham, Evan: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html Secrets of Viking Ships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912023933/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html |date=12 September 2017 }} (05.09.00) NOVA science media.</ref><ref>Durham, Keith: ''Viking Longship'' Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The ''[[knarr]]'' was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the '[[beitass]]', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.<ref>Block, Leo, [https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc ''To Harness the Wind: A Short History of the Development of Sails''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203825/https://books.google.com/books?id=ezgq0VnV5XQC&hl=en |date=1 January 2016 }}, Naval Institute Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-55750-209-9}}</ref> It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = VIKING LONGSHIP \"SEA STALLION\" ARRIVES IN DUBLIN.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Sea Stallion\n| caption1  = [[Sea Stallion (longship)|A reconstructed longship]]\n| image2    = Modell Knorr.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Knarr Haithabu\n| caption2  = A model of the ''knarr'' ship type\n| footer    = Two typical viking ships.\n}}\n\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] in Norway<ref>Ian Heath, The Vikings, p. 4, Osprey Publishing, 1985.</ref> and the excavated ship burial at [[Ladby ship|Ladby]] in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the [[Salme ships]] on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |title=The First Vikings |magazine=Archaeology |publisher=the Archaeological Institute of America |first=Andrew |last=Curry |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228192503/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |archive-date=28 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from [[Roskilde Fjord]] in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the ''knarr''. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect [[Roskilde]], then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the [[Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Everyday life===\n\n====Social structure====\n[[File:Reconstructed Viking House.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Viking house in Iceland]]\n[[File:Viking house Ale Sweden.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed Viking Longhouse in Ale, north of Gothenburg [[Sweden]] ]]\n[[File:Chieftains house (reconstruction) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at [[Lofotr Viking Museum]], Norway]]\n[[File:Busdorf - Haithabu - Wikinger-H\u00e4user 05 ies.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed town houses from [[Haithabu]] (now in Germany)]]\n\nViking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls.

Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'tr\u00e6l' and 'ty'.\n\nKarls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.\n\nThe Jarls were the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes [[Human sacrifice in Germanic paganism|sacrificially killed]] and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|title=Double graves with headless slaves|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=23 June 2014|author=Mari Kildah|publisher=University of Oslo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011090033/http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|archive-date=11 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it is believed that there must have been some social mobility. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like ''hauldr'', ''thegn'', ''landmand'', show mobility between the Karls and the Jarls.\n\nOther social structures included the communities of ''f\u00e9lag'' in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called ''f\u00e9lagi'') were obliged. A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as ''drenge'', one of the words for warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the [[Thing (assembly)|Things]].\n\n====Women====\nWomen had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic [[Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s]] and the Norwegian [[Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Borgstr\u00f6m Eva {{in lang|sv}}: Makal\u00f6sa kvinnor: k\u00f6ns\u00f6verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.).

Almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see [[Viking art]]). Finger rings were seldom used and earrings were not used at all, as they were seen as a [[Slavic people|Slavic]] phenomenon.

[[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] was a popular sport and [[Snorri Sturluson]] describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of [[knife juggling]] as well.\n\n[[Skiing]] and [[ice skating]] were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north.\n\nHorse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions.\n\nIcelandic sources refer to the sport of ''[[knattleikr|knattleik]]''. A ball game akin to [[hockey]], knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice. The rules are unclear, but it was popular with both adults and children, even though it often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.\n\nHunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, [[deer]], [[hare]]s and [[fox]]es were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows. The techniques were stalking, snare and traps and ''[[par force]]'' hunting with dog packs.\n\n====Games and entertainment====\n[[File:Beserker, Lewis Chessmen, British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rook, [[Lewis chessmen]], at the British Museum in London]]\nBoth archaeological finds and written sources testify to the fact that the Vikings set aside time for social and festive gatherings.<ref name=KWolf/><ref name=SportsGames/><ref name=NatMus>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-people/games-and-entertainment/|title=Games and entertainment in the Viking period|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502075927/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-people/games-and-entertainment/|archive-date=2 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoard games and dice games were played as a popular pastime at all levels of society.

The Vikings played several types of ''tafl'' games; ''[[hnefatafl]]'', ''nitavl'' ([[nine men's morris]]) and the less common ''[[Tafl games|kvatrutafl]]''. [[Chess]] also appeared at the end of the Viking Age. Hnefatafl is a war game, in which the object is to capture the king piece\u2014a large hostile army threatens and the king's men have to protect the king. It was played on a board with squares using black and white pieces, with moves made according to dice rolls.

The devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]].<ref>English Historical Documents, c. 500\u20131042 by Dorothy Whitelock; p. 776</ref> Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".<ref>Derry (2012).

Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the [[Icelanders]] Snorri Sturluson and [[S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.\n\nThe 200-year Viking influence on [[History of Europe|European history]] is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] chronicles, [[Novgorod]] chronicles, [[Ibn Fadlan]] chronicles, [[Ibn Rusta]] chronicles, and brief mentions by [[Photius]], patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other chroniclers of Viking history include [[Adam of Bremen]], who wrote, in the fourth volume of his ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'', \"[t]here is much gold here (in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called ''wichingi'' by their own people, and ''Ascomanni'' by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the [[Battle of Maldon]] between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.\n\n===Post-medieval perceptions===\n[[File:Vikings fight.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Combat reenactment|modern reenactment]] of a Viking battle]]\nEarly modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (''History of the northern people'') of [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century ''Gesta Danorum'' (''Deeds of the Danes''),  by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and the Swede [[Olaus Rudbeck]] used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], who published his ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' (''Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages'') in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.\n\nThe word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his poem, ''The Viking''. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of ''[[Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna]]'', which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n[[File:Viking Siege of Paris.jpg|thumb|Viking long ships [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieging Paris]] in 845, 19th century portrayal]]\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called [[Viking revival]] in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of [[Romantic nationalism]]. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"[[Wagnerian]]\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries [[Scandinavism]]. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by [[Richard Wagner]]. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.<ref>[[William W. Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, p. 363</ref> Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in [[Nazi Germany]] as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of [[Nazi mysticism]]. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda.\n\n[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ohloblyn |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |accessdate=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907221348/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |archive-date=7 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives.

These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as [[Frans Gunnar Bengtsson]]'s ''[[The Long Ships]]'' (which was also released as a [[The Long Ships (1963 film)|1963 film]]), and historical fantasies such as the film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'', [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' (movie version called ''[[The 13th Warrior]]''), and the comedy film ''[[Erik the Viking]]''. The vampire [[Eric Northman]], in the HBO TV series ''[[True Blood]]'', was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the [[Danish American]] writer [[Poul Anderson]], while British explorer, historian, and writer [[Tim Severin]] authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world.\n\nIn 1962, American comic book writer [[Stan Lee]] and his brother [[Larry Lieber]], together with [[Jack Kirby]], created the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011 [[Marvel Studios]] film [[Thor (film)|''Thor'']] and its sequels ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''. The character also appears in the 2012 film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and its associated [[Marvel's Avengers Assemble (TV series)|animated series]].\n\nThe appearance of Vikings within popular media and television has seen a resurgence in recent decades, especially with the History Channel's series [[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings (2013)]], directed by Michael Hirst. The show has a loose grounding in historical facts and sources, but bases itself more so on literary sources, such as [[Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok|fornaldarsaga Ragnars saga lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar]], itself more legend than fact, and Old Norse Eddic and Skaldic poetry.<ref>Gareth Lloyd Evans, \"Michael Hirst\u2019s Vikings and Old Norse Poetry\", ''Translating Early Medieval Poetry: Transformation, Reception, Interpretation''.

Tillich's work continues to be studied and discussed around the world, and the North American Paul Tillich Society, Deutsche Paul-Tillich-Gesellschaft, and l'Association Paul Tillich d'expression fran\u00e7aise regularly host international conferences and seminars on his thought and its possibilities. \n\n== Biography ==\nTillich was born on August 20, 1886, in the small village of [[Starzeddel]] (Starosiedle), [[Province of Brandenburg]], which was [[Former eastern territories of Germany|then part of Germany]]. He was the oldest of three children, with two sisters: Johanna (born 1888, died 1920) and Elisabeth (born 1893). Tillich's [[Prussia]]n father Johannes Tillich was a conservative [[Lutheran]] pastor of the [[Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces]]; his mother Mathilde D\u00fcrselen was from the [[Rhineland]] and more liberal.\n\nWhen Tillich was four, his father became  [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendent]] of a diocese in [[Bad Sch\u00f6nfliess]] (now [[Trzci\u0144sko-Zdr\u00f3j]], Poland), a town of three thousand, where Tillich began primary school (''[[:de:Elementarschule|Elementarschule]]'').  In 1898, Tillich was sent to [[K\u00f6nigsberg in der Neumark]] (now [[Chojna]], Poland) to begin his ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' schooling. He was billeted in a boarding house and experienced a loneliness that he sought to overcome by reading the Bible while encountering [[Humanism|humanistic]] ideas at school.<ref name =\"britannica\" />\n\nIn 1900, Tillich's father was transferred to [[Berlin]], resulting in Tillich switching in 1901 to a Berlin school, from which he graduated in 1904. Before his graduation, however, his mother died of [[cancer]] in September 1903, when Tillich was 17. Tillich attended several universities \u2014 the [[University of Berlin]] beginning in 1904, the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] in 1905, and the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]] from 1905 to 1907.  He received his Doctor of Philosophy degree at the [[University of Breslau]] in 1911 and his Licentiate of Theology degree at Halle-Wittenberg in 1912.<ref name=britannica /> During his time at university, he became a member of the [[Wingolf]] in Berlin, T\u00fcbingen and Halle.<ref>{{Citation | title = Gesamtverzeichnis des Wingolf | place = Lichtenberg | year = 1991}}.</ref>\n\nThat same year, 1912, Tillich was ordained as a Lutheran minister in the Province of Brandenburg. On 28 September 1914 he married Margarethe (\"Grethi\") Wever (1888\u20131968), and in October he joined the [[Imperial German Army]] as a [[chaplain]] during [[World War I]].  Grethi deserted Tillich in 1919 after an affair that produced a child not fathered by Tillich; the two then divorced.{{Sfn | Pauck | Wilhelm | Marion | 1989 | pages 86-87}}  Tillich's academic career began after the war; he became a Privatdozent of Theology at the [[University of Berlin]], a post he held from 1919 to 1924.  On his return from the war he had met Hannah Werner-Gottschow, then married and pregnant.<ref name = ptlover>{{Citation | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908007-1,00.html | title = Paul Tillich, Lover | newspaper = Time | date = October 8, 1973}}.</ref> In March 1924 they married; it was the second marriage for both. She later wrote a book entitled ''From Time to Time'' about their life together, which included their commitment to open marriage, upsetting to some; despite this, they remained together into old age.<ref>{{Citation |author=Wolfgang Saxon | title = Hannah Tillich, 92, Christian Theologian's Widow |work=New York Times |date=October 30, 1988 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1924 to 1925, Tillich served as a Professor of Theology at the [[University of Marburg]], where he began to develop his systematic theology, teaching a course on it during the last of his three terms. From 1925 until 1929, Tillich was a Professor of Theology at the [[Dresden University of Technology]] and the [[University of Leipzig]]. He held the same post at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] from 1929 to 1933. Paul Tillich was in conversation with [[Erich Przywara]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Thomas | last = O'Meara | title = Paul Tillich and Erich Przywara at Davos | journal = Gregorianum | volume = 87 | year = 2006 | pages = 227\u201338}}.</ref>\n\nWhile at the University of Frankfurt, Tillich gave public lectures and speeches throughout Germany that brought him into conflict with the [[Nazi]] movement.  When [[Adolf Hitler]] became German Chancellor in 1933, Tillich was dismissed from his position.  [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] visited Germany in the summer of 1933 and, already impressed with Tillich's writings, contacted Tillich upon learning of his dismissal. Niebuhr urged Tillich to join the faculty at New York City's [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]; Tillich accepted.{{Sfn | Pauck | Wilhelm | Marion | 1976}}{{Sfn | Tillich | 1964 | p = 16}}\n\nAt the age of 47, Tillich moved with his family to the United States. This meant learning English, the language in which Tillich would eventually publish works such as the ''Systematic Theology''.  From 1933 until 1955 he taught at Union Theological Seminary, where he began as a Visiting Professor of [[Philosophy of Religion]].  During 1933\u201334 he was also a Visiting Lecturer in Philosophy at [[Columbia University]].<ref name = \"britannica\" />\n\nThe Fellowship of Socialist Christians was organized in the early 1930s by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and others with similar views.\nLater it changed its name to Frontier Fellowship and then to Christian Action.\nThe main supporters of the Fellowship in the early days included Tillich, [[Eduard Heimann]], [[Sherwood Eddy]] and [[Rose Terlin]]. \nIn its early days the group thought capitalist individualism was incompatible with Christian ethics.\nAlthough not Communist, the group acknowledged [[Karl Marx]]'s social philosophy.<ref name=Stone115>{{citation|page=115 |last=Stone|first=Ronald H.|title=Professor Reinhold Niebuhr: A Mentor to the Twentieth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypy5Uz4qm5YC&pg=PA115|accessdate=2016-03-14 |date=1992-01-01|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25390-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Grave of Paul Johannes Tillich (1886-1965).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Tillich's gravestone in the Paul Tillich Park, New Harmony, Indiana.]]\nTillich acquired [[Tenure (academic)|tenure]] at the Union Theological Seminary in 1937, and in 1940 he was promoted to Professor of [[Philosophical Theology]] and became an American citizen.<ref name = \"britannica\" />\nAt Union, Tillich earned his reputation, publishing a series of books that outlined his particular synthesis of Protestant Christian theology and existential philosophy.  He published ''On the Boundary'' in 1936; ''The Protestant Era'', a collection of his essays, in 1948; and ''The Shaking of the Foundations'', the first of three volumes of his sermons, also in 1948. His collections of sermons would give Tillich a broader audience than he had yet experienced.\n\nHis most heralded achievements though, were the 1951 publication of volume one of ''Systematic Theology'' which brought Tillich academic acclaim, and the 1952 publication of ''The Courage to Be''. The first volume of the systematic theology series prompted an invitation to give the prestigious [[Gifford lectures]] during 1953\u201354 at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. The latter book, called \"his masterpiece\",{{Sfn | Pauck | Wilhelm | Marion | 1976 | p = 225}} was based on his 1950 [[Dwight H. Terry Lectureship]] and reached a wide general readership.<ref name = britannica />\n\nThese works led to an appointment at the [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1955, where he became one of the University's five University Professors \u2013 the five highest ranking professors at Harvard.  He was primarily a professor of undergraduates because Harvard did not have a department of religion for them, but thereby he was more exposed to the wider University and \"most fully embodied the ideal of a University Professor.\"<ref name=Divinings>{{Citation |author-last=Williams |author-first=George Hunston | title =Divinings: Religion At Harvard |volume=2 |pages=424 f.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Tillich became one of the founding members of the [[Society for the Arts, Religion and Contemporary Culture]], an organization with which he maintained ties for the remainder of his life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Meyer |first = Betty H. |title=The ARC story: a narrative account of the Society for the Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture |year=2003 | publisher = Association for Religion and Intellectual Life | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-97470130-1}}</ref>  During this period, he published volume&nbsp;2 of ''Systematic Theology'' and also the popular book ''Dynamics of Faith'' (both 1957). His career at Harvard lasted until 1962 when he moved to the [[University of Chicago]], remaining a professor of theology there until his death in 1965.\n\nVolume&nbsp;3 of ''Systematic Theology'' was published in 1963.  In 1964, Tillich became the first theologian to be honored in Kegley and Bretall's ''Library of Living Theology'': \"The adjective 'great,' in our opinion, can be applied to very few thinkers of our time, but Tillich, we are far from alone in believing, stands unquestionably amongst these few\".{{Sfn | Kegley | Bretall | 1964 | pp = ix\u2013x}} A widely quoted critical assessment of his importance was [[Georgia Harkness]]' comment: \"What [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] was to [[American philosophy]], Tillich has been to American theology\".<ref name= timesobit>{{Citation | title =Dr. Paul Tillich, Outstanding Protestant Theologian |work=The Times |date=25 Oct 1965}}</ref><ref name = thomas>{{Citation | title = Tillich | first = John Heywood | last = Thomas | publisher = Continuum | year = 2002 | ISBN = 0-8264-5082-2 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/tillichoutstandi00john }}.</ref>\n\nTillich died on October 22, 1965, ten days after having a heart attack. In 1966, his ashes were interred in the [[New Harmony, Indiana#Paul Tillich Park|Paul Tillich Park]] in [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], [[Indiana]]. Gravestone inscription : \"And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit for his season, his leaf also shall not wither. And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.\"\n\n== Philosophy and theology ==\n===Being===\nTillich used the concept of being (''Sein'') throughout his philosophical and theological work. Some of his work engaged with the fundamental ontology of Martin Heidegger.<ref>The development of the intellectual profile of Tillich happened in a context where the fundamental ontology of [[Martin Heidegger]] was also taking shape, and especially in terms of the Heideggerian reflection on the question of being (''Seinsfrage'') as it unfolded in ''Sein und Zeit'' ([[Being and Time]]), the connection of Tillich's notion of being to that of Heidegger has been rarely studied; a recent account of this has been published in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Ontological Meditations on Tillich and Heidegger', ''Iris:'' ''Annales de Philosophie'' Volume 36 (2015), pp. 109-114 (a peer-refereed journal published by the Facult\u00e9 des lettres et des sciences humaines, Universit\u00e9 Saint-Joseph, Beyrouth)</ref> \n\nTillich's analysis of being ascends from the human [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]'s asking of the ontological question (\"What is being itself?\"), upwards to the highest categories of [[metaphysics]].<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 163</ref> He distinguishes among four levels of ontological analysis. The concepts in the first three levels of analysis are polar, while the concepts in the final level of analysis are not, since they are \"highest generic concepts.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 165</ref> Tillich's first level of ontological analysis concerns \"the basic ontological structure which is the implicit condition of the ontological question.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 164</ref> This is the structure of self-world, because \"the self [has] a world to which it belongs.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 164</ref> The second level of ontological analysis concerns \"the elements which constitute the ontological structure\" of self-world.<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 164</ref> These elements are also polar: individualization and participation, dynamics and form, freedom and destiny.<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 164-186</ref> The first element of each polarity expresses the \"self-relatedness of being,\" while the second element of each polarity expresses \"the belongingness of being, its character of being part of a universe of being.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 165</ref> The third level of ontological analysis concerns \"the characteristics of being which are the conditions of existence.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 165</ref> These are essential being and existential being (or essence and existence). The fourth and final level of ontological analysis concerns the categories, or the \"basic forms of thought and being.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 165</ref> Tillich identifies these as [[time]], [[space]], [[causality]], and substance.\n\nBeing plays a key role throughout Tillich's ''Systematic Theology'' in his analyses of [[reason]] and revelation, being and God, existence and the Christ, life and the Spirit, and history and the Kingdom of God. In the opening to the second volume, Tillich writes: \n{{Quote |... [The concept of Being] appears in the present system in three places: in the doctrine of God, where God is called the being as being or the ground and the power of being; \nin the doctrine of man, where the distinction is carried through between man's essential and his existential being; \nand finally, in the doctrine of the Christ, where he is called the manifestation of the New Being, the actualization of which is the work of the divine Spirit. |Tillich{{Sfn | Tillich | 1957 | p = 10}}}}\n\n{{Quote |... It is the expression of the experience of being over against non-being. Therefore, it can be described as the power of being which resists non-being. For this reason, the medieval philosophers called being the basic ''transcendentale'', beyond the universal and the particular ...\n\nThe same word, the emptiest of all concepts when taken as an abstraction, becomes the most meaningful of all concepts when it is understood as the power of being in everything that has being. |Tillich{{Sfn | Tillich | 1957 | p = 11}}}}\n\n===God as the ground of being===\n[[File:Tillich Park Bust.jpg|thumb|Bust of Tillich by [[James Rosati]] in [[New Harmony, Indiana]]]]\nThroughout most of his work Tillich provides an ontological view of God as being-itself, the ground of being, and the power of being, one in which God is beyond essence and existence.<ref>{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 |page=235-6}}</ref> He was critical of conceptions of God as a being (e.g., the highest being), as well as of pantheistic conceptions of God as universal essence. Traditional medieval [[philosophical theology]] in the work of figures such as [[St.&nbsp;Anselm]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[William of Ockham]] tended to understand God as the highest existing being{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}, to which predicates such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, goodness, righteousness, holiness, etc. may be ascribed. Arguments for and against the existence of God presuppose such an understanding of God. Tillich is critical of this mode of discourse, which he refers to as \"theological theism,\" and argues that if God is a being, even if the highest being, God cannot be properly called the source of all being. With respect to both God's existence and essence, moreover, Tillich shows how difficulties beset [[Thomas Aquinas]]' attempt to \"maintain the truth that God is beyond essence and existence while simultaneously arguing for the existence of God.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 |page=236}}</ref> \n\nAccording to Tillich, it remains undeniable that being is, and, therefore, that there is a ground of being, namely God. Though Tillich is critical of propositional arguments for the existence of God, he still affirms the reality of God as the ground of being. A similar argument has been advanced by [[Eric Voegelin]].<ref>{{citation |last=Voegelin |first=Eric | title=Conversations with Eric Voegelin |page=51}}</ref> \n\nTillich addresses questions both ontological and personalist concerning God. One issue deals with whether and in what way personal language about the nature of God and humanity's relationship to God is appropriate. In distinction to \"theological theism\", Tillich refers to another kind of theism as that of the \"divine-human encounter\". Such is the theism of the encounter with the \"Wholly Other\" (\"Das ganz Andere\"), as in the work of [[Karl Barth]] and [[Rudolf Otto]]. It implies a personalism with regard to God's self-revelation. Tillich is quite clear that this is both appropriate and necessary, as it is the basis of the personalism of biblical religion altogether and of the concept of the \"Word of God\",<ref>Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality, University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1955, 21-62.</ref> but can become falsified if the theologian tries to turn such encounters with God as the Wholly Other into an understanding of God as a being.<ref>The Courage to Be, Yale: New Haven, 2000, 184.</ref> In other words, God is both personal and transpersonal.<ref>The Courage to Be, Yale: New Haven, 2000, 187.</ref> \n\nTillich's ontological view of God has precedent in Christian theology. In addition to affinities with the concept of God as being-itself in [[classical theism]], it shares similarities with Hellenistic and Patristic conceptions of God as the \"unoriginate source\" (''agennetos'') of all being.<ref>J.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines, HarperCollins: New York, 1978, 128.</ref> This view was espoused in particular by [[Origen]], one of a number of early theologians whose thought influenced Tillich's. Their views in turn had pre-Christian precedents in [[middle Platonism]]. Aside from classical and Christian influences in Tillich's concept of God, there is a dynamism in Tillich's notion of \"the living God,\" reflecting some influence from Spinoza.<ref>{{citation |last=Lamm | first=Julia| chapter='Catholic Substance' Revisited: Reversals of Expectation in Tillich's Doctrine of God | title=Paul Tillich: A New Catholic Assessment | editors=Raymond F. Bulman, Frederick J. Parrella |page=54}}</ref> \n\nTillich combines his ontological conception of God with a largely existential and phenomenological understanding of faith in God, remarking that God is \"the answer to the question implied in man's finitude ... the name for that which concerns man ultimately.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 |page=211}}</ref> This is notably manifest in his understanding of faith as ultimate concern. Following his existential analysis, Tillich further argues that theological theism is not only logically problematic, but is unable to speak into the situation of radical doubt and despair about meaning in life. This issue, he said, was of primary concern in the modern age, as opposed to [[anxiety]] about fate, guilt, death and condemnation.<ref name=\"Tillich, Courage To Be, p 184\"/> This is because the state of finitude entails by necessity anxiety, and that it is our finitude as human beings, our being a mixture of being and nonbeing, that is at the ultimate basis of anxiety. If God is not the ground of being, then God cannot provide an answer to the question of finitude; God would also be finite in some sense. The term \"God Above God,\" then, means to indicate the God who appears, who is the ground of being, when the \"God\" of theological theism has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.<ref>The Courage to Be, Yale: New Haven, 2000, 190.</ref> While on the one hand this God goes beyond the God of [[theism]] as usually defined, it finds expression in many religious symbols of the Christian faith, particularly that of the crucified Christ. The possibility thus exists, says Tillich, that religious symbols may be recovered which would otherwise have been rendered ineffective by contemporary society.\n\nTillich argues that the God of theological theism is at the root of much revolt against theism and religious faith in the modern period. Tillich states, sympathetically, that the God of theological theism {{quote |deprives me of my subjectivity because he is all-powerful and all-knowing. I revolt and make ''him'' into an object, but the revolt fails and becomes desperate. God appears as the invincible tyrant, the being in contrast with whom all other beings are without freedom and subjectivity. He is equated with the recent tyrants who with the help of terror try to transform everything into a mere object, a thing among things, a cog in a machine they control. He becomes the model of everything against which Existentialism revolted. This is the God [[Nietzsche]] said had to be killed because nobody can tolerate being made into a mere object of absolute knowledge and absolute control. This is the deepest root of atheism. It is an atheism which is justified as the reaction against theological theism and its disturbing implications.<ref>Tillich, ''Courage To Be'', p 185.</ref>}}\n\nAnother reason Tillich criticized theological theism was because it placed God into the subject-object [[dichotomy]]. This is the basic distinction made in [[Epistemology]], that branch of [[Philosophy]] which deals with human knowledge, how it is possible, what it is, and its limits. ''Epistemologically'', God cannot be made into an object, that is, an object of the knowing subject. Tillich deals with this question under the rubric of the relationality of God. The question is \"whether there are external relations between God and the creature\".<ref name=SysTheoV1P271>{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology vol. 1 |page=271}}</ref> Traditionally Christian theology has always understood the doctrine of creation to mean precisely this external relationality between God, the Creator, and the creature as separate and not identical realities. Tillich reminds us of the point, which can be found in Luther, that \"there is no place to which man can withdraw from the divine thou, because it includes the ego and is nearer to the ego than the ego to itself\".<ref name=SysTheoV1P271/>\n\nTillich goes further to say that the desire to draw God into the subject\u2013object dichotomy is an \"insult\" to the divine holiness.<ref>{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology vol. 1 |page=272}}</ref> Similarly, if God were made into the subject rather than the object of knowledge (The Ultimate Subject), then the rest of existing entities then become subjected to the absolute knowledge and scrutiny of God, and the human being is \"reified,\" or made into a mere object. It would deprive the person of his or her own subjectivity and creativity. According to Tillich, theological theism has provoked the rebellions found in atheism and Existentialism, although other social factors such as the [[industrial revolution]] have also contributed to the \"reification\" of the human being. The modern man could no longer tolerate the idea of being an \"object\" completely subjected to the absolute knowledge of God. Tillich argued, as mentioned, that theological theism is \"bad theology\".\n{{quote |The God of the theological theism is a being besides others and as such a part of the whole reality. He is certainly considered its most important part, but as a part and therefore as subjected to the structure of the whole. He is supposed to be beyond the ontological elements and categories which constitute reality. But every statement subjects him to them. He is seen as a self which has a world, as an ego which relates to a thought, as a cause which is separated from its effect, as having a definite space and endless time. He is a being, not being-itself<ref name=\"Tillich, Courage To Be, p 184\">Tillich, ''Courage To Be'', p 184.</ref>}}\n\nAlternatively, Tillich presents the above-mentioned ontological view of God as Being-Itself, [[Ground of Being]], Power of Being, and occasionally as [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]] or God's \"Abysmal Being\". What makes Tillich's ontological view of God different from theological theism is that it transcends it by being the foundation or ultimate reality that \"precedes\" all beings. Just as [[Being]] for [[Heidegger]] is ontologically ''prior'' to conception, Tillich views God to be beyond being.<ref name=\"Tillich, p 15\">Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', p 15.</ref> God is not a supernatural entity among other entities. Instead, God is the inexhaustible ground which empowers the existence of beings. We cannot perceive God as an object which is related to a subject because God ''precedes'' the subject\u2013object dichotomy.<ref name=\"Tillich, p 15\"/>\n\nThus Tillich dismisses a literalistic [[Biblicism]]. Instead of rejecting the notion of personal God, however, Tillich sees it as a symbol that points directly to the Ground of Being.<ref>Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', p 127-132.</ref> Since the Ground of Being ontologically precedes reason, it cannot be comprehended since comprehension presupposes the subject\u2013object dichotomy. Tillich disagreed with any literal philosophical and religious statements that can be made about God. Such literal statements attempt to define God and lead not only to [[anthropomorphism]] but also to a philosophical mistake that [[Immanuel Kant]] warned against, that setting limits against the transcendent inevitably leads to contradictions. Any statements about God are simply symbolic, but these symbols are sacred in the sense that they function to participate or point to the Ground of Being.\n\nTillich also further elaborated the thesis of the God above the God of theism in his Systematic Theology.\n\n{{quote |... (the God above the God of theism) This has been misunderstood as a dogmatic statement of a pantheistic or mystical character. First of all, it is not a dogmatic, but an apologetic, statement. It takes seriously the radical doubt experienced by many people. It gives one the courage of self-affirmation even in the extreme state of radical doubt. |Tillich | |''Systematic Theology Vol. 2 '', p. 12}}\n\n{{quote |... In such a state the God of both religious and theological language disappears. But something remains, namely, the seriousness of that doubt in which meaning within meaninglessness is affirmed. The source of this affirmation of meaning within meaninglessness, of certitude within doubt, is not the God of traditional theism but the \"God above God,\" the power of being, which works through those who have no name for it, not even the name God. |Tillich | |''Systematic Theology Vol. 2 '', p. 12}}\n\n{{quote |... This is the answer to those who ask for a message in the nothingness of their situation and at the end of their courage to be. But such an extreme point is not a space with which one can live. The dialectics of an extreme situation are a criterion of truth but not the basis on which a whole structure of truth can be built. |Tillich | |''Systematic Theology Vol. 2 '', p.12}}\n\n===Method of correlation===\nThe key to understanding Tillich's theology is what he calls the \"method of correlation.\" It is an approach that correlates insights from Christian [[revelation]] with the issues raised by [[existentialism|existential]], psychological, and philosophical analysis.<ref name =CODWR />\n\nTillich states in the introduction to the ''Systematic Theology'':\n{{Quote |Theology formulates the questions implied in human existence, and theology formulates the answers implied in divine self-manifestation under the guidance of the questions implied in human existence. This is a circle which drives man to a point where question and answer are not separated.  This point, however, is not a moment in time.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 61}}}}\n\n{{Quote |The Christian message provides the answers to the questions implied in human existence.  These answers are contained in the revelatory events on which Christianity is based and are taken by systematic theology from the sources, through the medium, under the norm.  Their content cannot be derived from questions that would come from an analysis of human existence.  They are 'spoken' to human existence from beyond it, in a sense.  Otherwise, they would not be answers, for the question is human existence itself.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 64}}}}\n\nFor Tillich, the existential questions of human existence are associated with the field of philosophy and, more specifically, [[ontology]] (the study of being). This is because, according to Tillich, a lifelong pursuit of philosophy reveals that the central question of every philosophical inquiry always comes back to the question of being, or what it means to be, and, consequently, what it means to be a finite human being within being.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1955 | pp = 11\u201320}}  To be correlated with existential questions are theological answers, themselves derived from Christian revelation.  The task of the philosopher primarily involves developing the questions, whereas the task of the theologian primarily involves developing the answers to these questions.  However, it should be remembered that the two tasks overlap and include one another: the theologian must be somewhat of a philosopher and vice versa, for Tillich's notion of faith as \"ultimate concern\" necessitates that the theological answer be correlated with, compatible with, and in response to the general ontological question which must be developed independently from the answers.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1957 | p = 23}}{{Sfn | Tillich | 1952 | pp = 58ff}}  Thus, on one side of the correlation lies an ontological analysis of the human situation, whereas on the other is a presentation of the Christian message as a response to this existential dilemma. For Tillich, no formulation of the question can contradict the theological answer.  This is because the Christian message claims, ''a priori'', that the ''logos'' \"who became flesh\" is also the universal ''logos'' of the Greeks.{{Sfn |  Tillich | 1951 | p = 28}}\n\nIn addition to the intimate relationship between philosophy and theology, another important aspect of the method of correlation is Tillich's distinction between form and content in the theological answers.  While the nature of revelation determines the actual content of the theological answers, the character of the questions determines the form of these answers.  This is because, for Tillich, theology must be an answering theology, or [[Christian apologetics|apologetic theology]]. God is called the \"ground of being\" in part because God is the answer to the ontological threat of non-being, and this characterization of the theological answer in philosophical terms means that the answer has been conditioned (insofar as its form is considered) by the question. {{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 64}}  Throughout the ''Systematic Theology'', Tillich is careful to maintain this distinction between form and content without allowing one to be inadvertently conditioned by the other.  Many criticisms of Tillich's methodology revolve around this issue of whether the integrity of the Christian message is really maintained when its form is conditioned by philosophy.{{Sfn | McKelway | 1964 | p = 47}}\n\nThe theological answer is also determined by the sources of theology, our experience, and the norm of theology.  Though the form of the theological answers are determined by the character of the question, these answers (which \"are contained in the revelatory events on which Christianity is based\") are also \"taken by systematic theology from the sources, through the medium, under the norm.\"{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 64}}  There are three main sources of systematic theology: the Bible, Church history, and the history of religion and culture.  Experience is not a source but a medium through which the sources speak.  And the norm of theology is that by which both sources and experience are judged with regard to the content of the Christian faith.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 47}}  Thus, we have the following as elements of the method and structure of systematic theology:\n\n* Sources of theology{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 40}}\n** Bible{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 35}}\n** Church history\n** History of religion and culture\n* Medium of the sources\n** Collective experience of the Church\n* Norm of theology (determines use of sources)\n** Content of which is the biblical message itself, for example:\n*** Justification through faith\n*** New Being in Jesus as the Christ\n*** The Protestant Principle\n*** The criterion of the cross\n\nAs McKelway explains, the sources of theology contribute to the formation of the norm, which then becomes the criterion through which the sources and experience are judged.{{Sfn | McKelway | 1964 | pp = 55\u201356}}  The relationship is circular, as it is the present situation which conditions the norm in the interaction between church and biblical message.  The norm is then subject to change, but Tillich insists that its basic content remains the same: that of the biblical message.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 52}}  It is tempting to conflate revelation with the norm, but we must keep in mind that revelation (whether original or dependent) is not an element of the structure of systematic theology per se, but an event.{{Sfn | McKelway | 1964 | p = 80}}  For Tillich, the present-day norm is the \"New Being in Jesus as the Christ as our Ultimate Concern\".{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 50}}  This is because the present question is one of estrangement, and the overcoming of this estrangement is what Tillich calls the \"New Being\". But since Christianity answers the question of estrangement with \"Jesus as the Christ\", the norm tells us that we find the New Being in Jesus as the Christ.\n\nThere is also the question of the validity of the method of correlation.  Certainly one could reject the method on the grounds that there is no ''a priori'' reason for its adoption. But Tillich claims that the method of any theology and its system are interdependent. That is, an absolute methodological approach cannot be adopted because the method is continually being determined by the system and the objects of theology.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 60}}\n\n===Life and the Spirit===\nThis is part four of Tillich's ''Systematic Theology''. In this part, Tillich talks about life and the divine Spirit.\n\n{{quote|Life remains ambiguous as long as there is life. The question implied in the ambiguities of life derives to a new question, namely, that of the direction in which life moves. This is the question of history. Systematically speaking, history, characterized as it is by its direction toward the future, is the dynamic quality of life. Therefore, the \"riddle of history\" is a part of the problem of life.<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 2'', p. 4</ref>}}\n\n===Absolute faith===\nTillich stated the courage to take meaninglessness into oneself presupposes a relation to the ground of being: absolute faith.<ref>The Courage to Be, page 182</ref> Absolute faith can transcend the theistic idea of God, and has three elements.\n\n{{quote |... The first element is the experience of the power of being which is present even in the face of the most radical manifestation of non being. If one says that in this experience vitality resists despair, one must add that vitality in man is proportional to intentionality.\n\nThe vitality that can stand the abyss of meaninglessness is aware of a hidden meaning within the destruction of meaning.\n |Tillich | |''The Courage to Be'', p.177 }}\n\n{{quote |The second element in absolute faith is the dependence of the experience of nonbeing on the experience of being and the dependence of the experience of meaninglessness on the experience of meaning. Even in the state of despair one has enough being to make despair possible. |Tillich | |''The Courage to Be'', p.177 }}\n\n{{quote |There is a third element in absolute faith, the acceptance of being accepted. Of course, in the state of despair there is nobody and nothing that accepts. But there is the power of acceptance itself which is experienced. Meaninglessness, as long as it is experienced, includes an experience of the \"power of acceptance\". To accept this power of acceptance consciously is the religious answer of absolute faith, of a faith which has been deprived by doubt of any concrete content, which nevertheless is faith and the source of the most paradoxical manifestation of the courage to be.\n |Tillich | |''The Courage to Be'', p.177 }}\n\n===Faith as ultimate concern===\nAccording to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Tillich believes the essence of religious attitudes is what he calls \"ultimate concern\".  Separate from all profane and ordinary realities, the object of the concern is understood as sacred, [[numinous]] or holy. The perception of its reality is felt as so overwhelming and valuable that all else seems insignificant, and for this reason requires total surrender.<ref>{{citation |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts-god/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Concepts of God |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=2010-09-29|last=Wainwright|first=William |accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>  In 1957, Tillich defined his conception of faith more explicitly in his work, ''Dynamics of Faith''.\n\n{{quote|Man, like every living being, is concerned about many things, above all about those which condition his very existence ... If [a situation or concern] claims ultimacy it demands the total surrender of him who accepts this claim ... it demands that all other concerns ... be sacrificed.<ref>Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', pp. 1\u20132</ref>}}\n\nTillich further refined his conception of faith by stating that, \"Faith as ultimate concern is an act of the total personality. It is the most centered act of the human mind ... it participates in the dynamics of personal life.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', p. 5</ref>\n\nAn arguably central component of Tillich's concept of faith is his notion that faith is \"ecstatic\". That is to say:\n\n{{quote|It transcends both the drives of the nonrational unconsciousness and the structures of the rational conscious ... the ecstatic character of faith does not exclude its rational character although it is not identical with it, and it includes nonrational strivings without being identical with them. 'Ecstasy' means 'standing outside of oneself' - without ceasing to be oneself - with all the elements which are united in the personal center.<ref>Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', pp. 8\u20139</ref>}}\n\nIn short, for Tillich, faith does not stand opposed to rational or nonrational elements (reason and emotion respectively), as some philosophers would maintain. Rather, it ''transcends'' them in an ecstatic passion for the ultimate.<ref>{{YouTube|KR7QAjm3yxU|Tillich Interview part 12}}</ref>\n\nIt should also be noted that Tillich does not exclude [[atheism|atheists]] in his exposition of faith. Everyone has an ultimate concern, and this concern can be in an act of faith, \"even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. Where there is ultimate concern, God can be denied only in the name of God\"<ref>Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', p. 52</ref>\n\n=== Tillich's ontology of courage ===\n\nIn Paul Tillich's work ''The Courage to Be'' he defines courage as the self-affirmation of one's being in spite of a threat of nonbeing. He relates courage to anxiety, anxiety being the threat of non-being and the courage to be what we use to combat that threat. For Tillich, he outlines three types of anxiety and thus three ways to display the courage to be.\n\n1)\tThe Anxiety of Fate and Death\na.\tThe Anxiety of Fate and Death is the most basic and universal form of anxiety for Tillich. It relates quite simply to the recognition of our mortality. This troubles us humans. We become anxious when we are unsure whether our actions create a causal damnation which leads to a very real and quite unavoidable death (42-44). \"Nonbeing threatens man's ontic self-affirmation, relatively in terms of fate, absolutely in terms of death\" (41).\nb.\tWe display courage when we cease to rely on others to tell us what will come of us, (what will happen when we die etc.) and begin seeking those answers out for ourselves. Called the \"courage of confidence\" (162-63).\n\n2)\tThe Anxiety of Guilt and Condemnation\na.\tThis anxiety afflicts our moral self-affirmation. We as humans are responsible for our moral being, and when asked by our judge (whomever that may be) what we have made of ourselves we must answer. The anxiety is produced when we realize our being is unsatisfactory. \"It [Nonbeing] threatens man's moral self-affirmation, relatively in terms of guilt, absolutely in terms of condemnation\" (41).\nb.\tWe display courage when we first identify our sin; despair or whatever is causing us guilt or afflicting condemnation. We then rely on the idea that we are accepted regardless. \"The courage to be is the courage to accept oneself as accepted in spite of being unacceptable\" (164).\n\n3)\tThe Anxiety of Meaninglessness and Emptiness \na.\tThe Anxiety of Meaninglessness and Emptiness attacks our being as a whole. We worry about the loss of an ultimate concern or goal. This anxiety is also brought on by a loss of spirituality. We as beings feel the threat of non-being when we feel we have no place or purpose in the world. \"It [Nonbeing] threatens man's spiritual self-affirmation, relatively in terms of emptiness, absolutely in terms of meaninglessness\" (41).\nb.\tWe display the courage to be when facing this anxiety by displaying true faith, and by again, self-affirming oneself. We draw from the \"power of being\" which is God for Tillich and use that faith to in turn affirm ourselves and negate the non-being. We can find our meaning and purpose through the \"power of being\" (172-73).\n\nTillich writes that the ultimate source of the courage to be is the \"God above God,\" which transcends the theistic idea of God and is the content of absolute faith (defined as \"the accepting of the acceptance without somebody or something that accepts\") (185).\n\n== Popular works ==\n\nTwo of Tillich's works, ''The Courage to Be'' (1952) and ''Dynamics of Faith'' (1957), were read widely, including by people who would not normally read religious books. In ''The Courage to Be'', he lists three basic anxieties: anxiety about our biological finitude, i.e. that arising from the knowledge that we will eventually die; anxiety about our moral finitude, linked to guilt; and anxiety about our existential finitude, a sense of aimlessness in life. Tillich related these to three different historical eras: the early centuries of the [[Christian era]]; the [[Reformation]]; and the 20th century. Tillich's popular works have influenced psychology as well as theology, having had an influence on [[Rollo May]], whose \"The Courage to Create\" was inspired by \"The Courage to Be\".\n\n== Reception ==\n\nToday, Tillich's most observable legacy may well be that of a spiritually-oriented public intellectual and teacher with a broad and continuing range of influence. Tillich's chapel sermons (especially at Union) were enthusiastically received<ref>{{cite book |last=Grenz |first=Stanley J. and Roger E.

When the psalmist looks at God, for Whom a thousand years are like one day, he is looking at that eternity which alone gives him a place on which he can stand, a now which has infinite reality and infinite significance. In every moment that we say now, something temporal and something eternal are united. Whenever a human being says, 'Now I am living; now I am really present,' resisting the stream which drives the future into the past, eternity is.

In academic theology, he is best known for his major three-volume work ''Systematic Theology'' (1951\u201363), in which he developed his \"method of correlation,\" an approach that explores the symbols of Christian [[revelation]] as answers to the problems of human existence raised by contemporary [[Existentialism|existential]] analysis.<ref name = \"CODWR\">{{Citation | contribution = Tillich, Paul Johannes Oskar | title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions | editor-first = John | editor-last = Bowker | year = 2000 | series = Oxford Reference Online | publisher = Oxford University Press}}.</ref><ref name =britannica>{{Citation | contribution = Tillich, Paul | title = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | year = 2008 | edition = online | accessdate = 17 February 2008 | url = http://search.eb.com/eb/article-7265}}.</ref> Unlike mainstream interpretations of existentialism which emphasized the priority of existence over [[essence]], Tillich considered existentialism \"possible only as an element in a larger whole, as an element in a vision of the structure of [[being]] in its created goodness, and then as a description of man's existence within that framework.\"<ref>Tillich, ''My Search for Absolutes'', 245</ref> \n\nTillich's unique integration of essentialism and existentialism, as well as his sustained engagement with ontology in the ''Systematic Theology'' and other works, has attracted scholarship from a variety of influential thinkers including [[H.

Tillich's work continues to be studied and discussed around the world, and the North American Paul Tillich Society, Deutsche Paul-Tillich-Gesellschaft, and l'Association Paul Tillich d'expression fran\u00e7aise regularly host international conferences and seminars on his thought and its possibilities. \n\n== Biography ==\nTillich was born on August 20, 1886, in the small village of [[Starzeddel]] (Starosiedle), [[Province of Brandenburg]], which was [[Former eastern territories of Germany|then part of Germany]]. He was the oldest of three children, with two sisters: Johanna (born 1888, died 1920) and Elisabeth (born 1893). Tillich's [[Prussia]]n father Johannes Tillich was a conservative [[Lutheran]] pastor of the [[Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces]]; his mother Mathilde D\u00fcrselen was from the [[Rhineland]] and more liberal.\n\nWhen Tillich was four, his father became  [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendent]] of a diocese in [[Bad Sch\u00f6nfliess]] (now [[Trzci\u0144sko-Zdr\u00f3j]], Poland), a town of three thousand, where Tillich began primary school (''[[:de:Elementarschule|Elementarschule]]'').  In 1898, Tillich was sent to [[K\u00f6nigsberg in der Neumark]] (now [[Chojna]], Poland) to begin his ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' schooling. He was billeted in a boarding house and experienced a loneliness that he sought to overcome by reading the Bible while encountering [[Humanism|humanistic]] ideas at school.<ref name =\"britannica\" />\n\nIn 1900, Tillich's father was transferred to [[Berlin]], resulting in Tillich switching in 1901 to a Berlin school, from which he graduated in 1904. Before his graduation, however, his mother died of [[cancer]] in September 1903, when Tillich was 17. Tillich attended several universities \u2014 the [[University of Berlin]] beginning in 1904, the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] in 1905, and the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]] from 1905 to 1907.  He received his Doctor of Philosophy degree at the [[University of Breslau]] in 1911 and his Licentiate of Theology degree at Halle-Wittenberg in 1912.<ref name=britannica /> During his time at university, he became a member of the [[Wingolf]] in Berlin, T\u00fcbingen and Halle.<ref>{{Citation | title = Gesamtverzeichnis des Wingolf | place = Lichtenberg | year = 1991}}.</ref>\n\nThat same year, 1912, Tillich was ordained as a Lutheran minister in the Province of Brandenburg. On 28 September 1914 he married Margarethe (\"Grethi\") Wever (1888\u20131968), and in October he joined the [[Imperial German Army]] as a [[chaplain]] during [[World War I]].  Grethi deserted Tillich in 1919 after an affair that produced a child not fathered by Tillich; the two then divorced.{{Sfn | Pauck | Wilhelm | Marion | 1989 | pages 86-87}}  Tillich's academic career began after the war; he became a Privatdozent of Theology at the [[University of Berlin]], a post he held from 1919 to 1924.  On his return from the war he had met Hannah Werner-Gottschow, then married and pregnant.<ref name = ptlover>{{Citation | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908007-1,00.html | title = Paul Tillich, Lover | newspaper = Time | date = October 8, 1973}}.</ref> In March 1924 they married; it was the second marriage for both. She later wrote a book entitled ''From Time to Time'' about their life together, which included their commitment to open marriage, upsetting to some; despite this, they remained together into old age.<ref>{{Citation |author=Wolfgang Saxon | title = Hannah Tillich, 92, Christian Theologian's Widow |work=New York Times |date=October 30, 1988 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1924 to 1925, Tillich served as a Professor of Theology at the [[University of Marburg]], where he began to develop his systematic theology, teaching a course on it during the last of his three terms. From 1925 until 1929, Tillich was a Professor of Theology at the [[Dresden University of Technology]] and the [[University of Leipzig]]. He held the same post at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] from 1929 to 1933. Paul Tillich was in conversation with [[Erich Przywara]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Thomas | last = O'Meara | title = Paul Tillich and Erich Przywara at Davos | journal = Gregorianum | volume = 87 | year = 2006 | pages = 227\u201338}}.</ref>\n\nWhile at the University of Frankfurt, Tillich gave public lectures and speeches throughout Germany that brought him into conflict with the [[Nazi]] movement.  When [[Adolf Hitler]] became German Chancellor in 1933, Tillich was dismissed from his position.  [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] visited Germany in the summer of 1933 and, already impressed with Tillich's writings, contacted Tillich upon learning of his dismissal. Niebuhr urged Tillich to join the faculty at New York City's [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]; Tillich accepted.{{Sfn | Pauck | Wilhelm | Marion | 1976}}{{Sfn | Tillich | 1964 | p = 16}}\n\nAt the age of 47, Tillich moved with his family to the United States. This meant learning English, the language in which Tillich would eventually publish works such as the ''Systematic Theology''.  From 1933 until 1955 he taught at Union Theological Seminary, where he began as a Visiting Professor of [[Philosophy of Religion]].  During 1933\u201334 he was also a Visiting Lecturer in Philosophy at [[Columbia University]].<ref name = \"britannica\" />\n\nThe Fellowship of Socialist Christians was organized in the early 1930s by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and others with similar views.\nLater it changed its name to Frontier Fellowship and then to Christian Action.\nThe main supporters of the Fellowship in the early days included Tillich, [[Eduard Heimann]], [[Sherwood Eddy]] and [[Rose Terlin]]. \nIn its early days the group thought capitalist individualism was incompatible with Christian ethics.\nAlthough not Communist, the group acknowledged [[Karl Marx]]'s social philosophy.<ref name=Stone115>{{citation|page=115 |last=Stone|first=Ronald H.|title=Professor Reinhold Niebuhr: A Mentor to the Twentieth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypy5Uz4qm5YC&pg=PA115|accessdate=2016-03-14 |date=1992-01-01|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25390-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Grave of Paul Johannes Tillich (1886-1965).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Tillich's gravestone in the Paul Tillich Park, New Harmony, Indiana.]]\nTillich acquired [[Tenure (academic)|tenure]] at the Union Theological Seminary in 1937, and in 1940 he was promoted to Professor of [[Philosophical Theology]] and became an American citizen.<ref name = \"britannica\" />\nAt Union, Tillich earned his reputation, publishing a series of books that outlined his particular synthesis of Protestant Christian theology and existential philosophy.  He published ''On the Boundary'' in 1936; ''The Protestant Era'', a collection of his essays, in 1948; and ''The Shaking of the Foundations'', the first of three volumes of his sermons, also in 1948. His collections of sermons would give Tillich a broader audience than he had yet experienced.\n\nHis most heralded achievements though, were the 1951 publication of volume one of ''Systematic Theology'' which brought Tillich academic acclaim, and the 1952 publication of ''The Courage to Be''. The first volume of the systematic theology series prompted an invitation to give the prestigious [[Gifford lectures]] during 1953\u201354 at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. The latter book, called \"his masterpiece\",{{Sfn | Pauck | Wilhelm | Marion | 1976 | p = 225}} was based on his 1950 [[Dwight H. Terry Lectureship]] and reached a wide general readership.<ref name = britannica />\n\nThese works led to an appointment at the [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1955, where he became one of the University's five University Professors \u2013 the five highest ranking professors at Harvard.  He was primarily a professor of undergraduates because Harvard did not have a department of religion for them, but thereby he was more exposed to the wider University and \"most fully embodied the ideal of a University Professor.\"<ref name=Divinings>{{Citation |author-last=Williams |author-first=George Hunston | title =Divinings: Religion At Harvard |volume=2 |pages=424 f.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Tillich became one of the founding members of the [[Society for the Arts, Religion and Contemporary Culture]], an organization with which he maintained ties for the remainder of his life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Meyer |first = Betty H. |title=The ARC story: a narrative account of the Society for the Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture |year=2003 | publisher = Association for Religion and Intellectual Life | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-97470130-1}}</ref>  During this period, he published volume&nbsp;2 of ''Systematic Theology'' and also the popular book ''Dynamics of Faith'' (both 1957). His career at Harvard lasted until 1962 when he moved to the [[University of Chicago]], remaining a professor of theology there until his death in 1965.\n\nVolume&nbsp;3 of ''Systematic Theology'' was published in 1963.  In 1964, Tillich became the first theologian to be honored in Kegley and Bretall's ''Library of Living Theology'': \"The adjective 'great,' in our opinion, can be applied to very few thinkers of our time, but Tillich, we are far from alone in believing, stands unquestionably amongst these few\".{{Sfn | Kegley | Bretall | 1964 | pp = ix\u2013x}} A widely quoted critical assessment of his importance was [[Georgia Harkness]]' comment: \"What [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] was to [[American philosophy]], Tillich has been to American theology\".<ref name= timesobit>{{Citation | title =Dr. Paul Tillich, Outstanding Protestant Theologian |work=The Times |date=25 Oct 1965}}</ref><ref name = thomas>{{Citation | title = Tillich | first = John Heywood | last = Thomas | publisher = Continuum | year = 2002 | ISBN = 0-8264-5082-2 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/tillichoutstandi00john }}.</ref>\n\nTillich died on October 22, 1965, ten days after having a heart attack. In 1966, his ashes were interred in the [[New Harmony, Indiana#Paul Tillich Park|Paul Tillich Park]] in [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], [[Indiana]]. Gravestone inscription : \"And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit for his season, his leaf also shall not wither. And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.\"\n\n== Philosophy and theology ==\n===Being===\nTillich used the concept of being (''Sein'') throughout his philosophical and theological work. Some of his work engaged with the fundamental ontology of Martin Heidegger.<ref>The development of the intellectual profile of Tillich happened in a context where the fundamental ontology of [[Martin Heidegger]] was also taking shape, and especially in terms of the Heideggerian reflection on the question of being (''Seinsfrage'') as it unfolded in ''Sein und Zeit'' ([[Being and Time]]), the connection of Tillich's notion of being to that of Heidegger has been rarely studied; a recent account of this has been published in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Ontological Meditations on Tillich and Heidegger', ''Iris:'' ''Annales de Philosophie'' Volume 36 (2015), pp. 109-114 (a peer-refereed journal published by the Facult\u00e9 des lettres et des sciences humaines, Universit\u00e9 Saint-Joseph, Beyrouth)</ref> \n\nTillich's analysis of being ascends from the human [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]'s asking of the ontological question (\"What is being itself?\"), upwards to the highest categories of [[metaphysics]].<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 163</ref> He distinguishes among four levels of ontological analysis. The concepts in the first three levels of analysis are polar, while the concepts in the final level of analysis are not, since they are \"highest generic concepts.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 165</ref> Tillich's first level of ontological analysis concerns \"the basic ontological structure which is the implicit condition of the ontological question.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 164</ref> This is the structure of self-world, because \"the self [has] a world to which it belongs.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 164</ref> The second level of ontological analysis concerns \"the elements which constitute the ontological structure\" of self-world.<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 164</ref> These elements are also polar: individualization and participation, dynamics and form, freedom and destiny.<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 164-186</ref> The first element of each polarity expresses the \"self-relatedness of being,\" while the second element of each polarity expresses \"the belongingness of being, its character of being part of a universe of being.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 165</ref> The third level of ontological analysis concerns \"the characteristics of being which are the conditions of existence.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 165</ref> These are essential being and existential being (or essence and existence). The fourth and final level of ontological analysis concerns the categories, or the \"basic forms of thought and being.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', 1951, p. 165</ref> Tillich identifies these as [[time]], [[space]], [[causality]], and substance.\n\nBeing plays a key role throughout Tillich's ''Systematic Theology'' in his analyses of [[reason]] and revelation, being and God, existence and the Christ, life and the Spirit, and history and the Kingdom of God. In the opening to the second volume, Tillich writes: \n{{Quote |... [The concept of Being] appears in the present system in three places: in the doctrine of God, where God is called the being as being or the ground and the power of being; \nin the doctrine of man, where the distinction is carried through between man's essential and his existential being; \nand finally, in the doctrine of the Christ, where he is called the manifestation of the New Being, the actualization of which is the work of the divine Spirit. |Tillich{{Sfn | Tillich | 1957 | p = 10}}}}\n\n{{Quote |... It is the expression of the experience of being over against non-being. Therefore, it can be described as the power of being which resists non-being. For this reason, the medieval philosophers called being the basic ''transcendentale'', beyond the universal and the particular ...\n\nThe same word, the emptiest of all concepts when taken as an abstraction, becomes the most meaningful of all concepts when it is understood as the power of being in everything that has being. |Tillich{{Sfn | Tillich | 1957 | p = 11}}}}\n\nBeing, moreover, plays a key role in Tillich's understanding of reason, both in itself and as it informs his analysis of the modern situation vis-\u00e0-vis theology. Tillich distinguishes between an ontological and a technical conception of reason. Ontological reason is reason in the classical sense, the structure of the mind which enables it to grasp and transform reality.<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', p. 72</ref> Ontological reason is effective in the [[cognitive]], [[aesthetic]], [[practical]], and [[technical]] functions of the human mind. Technical reason, on the other hand, accompanies but sometimes replaces ontological reason. Tillich contends that technical reason, irrespective of its logical and methodological precision, is \"impoverished and corrupted if it is not continually nourished by ontological reason.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', p. 73</ref> Indeed, without the presence of ontological reason, technical reason \"dehumanizes man.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 1'', p. 73</ref>\n\n===God as the ground of being===\n[[File:Tillich Park Bust.jpg|thumb|Bust of Tillich by [[James Rosati]] in [[New Harmony, Indiana]]]]\nThroughout most of his work Tillich provides an ontological view of God as being-itself, the ground of being, and the power of being, one in which God is beyond essence and existence.<ref>{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 |page=235-6}}</ref> He was critical of conceptions of God as a being (e.g., the highest being), as well as of pantheistic conceptions of God as universal essence. Traditional medieval [[philosophical theology]] in the work of figures such as [[St.&nbsp;Anselm]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[William of Ockham]] tended to understand God as the highest existing being{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}, to which predicates such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, goodness, righteousness, holiness, etc. may be ascribed. Arguments for and against the existence of God presuppose such an understanding of God. Tillich is critical of this mode of discourse, which he refers to as \"theological theism,\" and argues that if God is a being, even if the highest being, God cannot be properly called the source of all being. With respect to both God's existence and essence, moreover, Tillich shows how difficulties beset [[Thomas Aquinas]]' attempt to \"maintain the truth that God is beyond essence and existence while simultaneously arguing for the existence of God.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 |page=236}}</ref> \n\nAccording to Tillich, it remains undeniable that being is, and, therefore, that there is a ground of being, namely God. Though Tillich is critical of propositional arguments for the existence of God, he still affirms the reality of God as the ground of being. A similar argument has been advanced by [[Eric Voegelin]].<ref>{{citation |last=Voegelin |first=Eric | title=Conversations with Eric Voegelin |page=51}}</ref> \n\nTillich addresses questions both ontological and personalist concerning God. One issue deals with whether and in what way personal language about the nature of God and humanity's relationship to God is appropriate. In distinction to \"theological theism\", Tillich refers to another kind of theism as that of the \"divine-human encounter\". Such is the theism of the encounter with the \"Wholly Other\" (\"Das ganz Andere\"), as in the work of [[Karl Barth]] and [[Rudolf Otto]]. It implies a personalism with regard to God's self-revelation. Tillich is quite clear that this is both appropriate and necessary, as it is the basis of the personalism of biblical religion altogether and of the concept of the \"Word of God\",<ref>Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality, University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1955, 21-62.</ref> but can become falsified if the theologian tries to turn such encounters with God as the Wholly Other into an understanding of God as a being.<ref>The Courage to Be, Yale: New Haven, 2000, 184.</ref> In other words, God is both personal and transpersonal.<ref>The Courage to Be, Yale: New Haven, 2000, 187.</ref> \n\nTillich's ontological view of God has precedent in Christian theology. In addition to affinities with the concept of God as being-itself in [[classical theism]], it shares similarities with Hellenistic and Patristic conceptions of God as the \"unoriginate source\" (''agennetos'') of all being.<ref>J.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines, HarperCollins: New York, 1978, 128.</ref> This view was espoused in particular by [[Origen]], one of a number of early theologians whose thought influenced Tillich's. Their views in turn had pre-Christian precedents in [[middle Platonism]]. Aside from classical and Christian influences in Tillich's concept of God, there is a dynamism in Tillich's notion of \"the living God,\" reflecting some influence from Spinoza.<ref>{{citation |last=Lamm | first=Julia| chapter='Catholic Substance' Revisited: Reversals of Expectation in Tillich's Doctrine of God | title=Paul Tillich: A New Catholic Assessment | editors=Raymond F. Bulman, Frederick J. Parrella |page=54}}</ref> \n\nTillich combines his ontological conception of God with a largely existential and phenomenological understanding of faith in God, remarking that God is \"the answer to the question implied in man's finitude ... the name for that which concerns man ultimately.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 |page=211}}</ref> This is notably manifest in his understanding of faith as ultimate concern. Following his existential analysis, Tillich further argues that theological theism is not only logically problematic, but is unable to speak into the situation of radical doubt and despair about meaning in life. This issue, he said, was of primary concern in the modern age, as opposed to [[anxiety]] about fate, guilt, death and condemnation.<ref name=\"Tillich, Courage To Be, p 184\"/> This is because the state of finitude entails by necessity anxiety, and that it is our finitude as human beings, our being a mixture of being and nonbeing, that is at the ultimate basis of anxiety. If God is not the ground of being, then God cannot provide an answer to the question of finitude; God would also be finite in some sense. The term \"God Above God,\" then, means to indicate the God who appears, who is the ground of being, when the \"God\" of theological theism has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.<ref>The Courage to Be, Yale: New Haven, 2000, 190.</ref> While on the one hand this God goes beyond the God of [[theism]] as usually defined, it finds expression in many religious symbols of the Christian faith, particularly that of the crucified Christ. The possibility thus exists, says Tillich, that religious symbols may be recovered which would otherwise have been rendered ineffective by contemporary society.\n\nTillich argues that the God of theological theism is at the root of much revolt against theism and religious faith in the modern period. Tillich states, sympathetically, that the God of theological theism {{quote |deprives me of my subjectivity because he is all-powerful and all-knowing. I revolt and make ''him'' into an object, but the revolt fails and becomes desperate. God appears as the invincible tyrant, the being in contrast with whom all other beings are without freedom and subjectivity. He is equated with the recent tyrants who with the help of terror try to transform everything into a mere object, a thing among things, a cog in a machine they control. He becomes the model of everything against which Existentialism revolted. This is the God [[Nietzsche]] said had to be killed because nobody can tolerate being made into a mere object of absolute knowledge and absolute control. This is the deepest root of atheism. It is an atheism which is justified as the reaction against theological theism and its disturbing implications.<ref>Tillich, ''Courage To Be'', p 185.</ref>}}\n\nAnother reason Tillich criticized theological theism was because it placed God into the subject-object [[dichotomy]]. This is the basic distinction made in [[Epistemology]], that branch of [[Philosophy]] which deals with human knowledge, how it is possible, what it is, and its limits. ''Epistemologically'', God cannot be made into an object, that is, an object of the knowing subject. Tillich deals with this question under the rubric of the relationality of God. The question is \"whether there are external relations between God and the creature\".<ref name=SysTheoV1P271>{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology vol. 1 |page=271}}</ref> Traditionally Christian theology has always understood the doctrine of creation to mean precisely this external relationality between God, the Creator, and the creature as separate and not identical realities. Tillich reminds us of the point, which can be found in Luther, that \"there is no place to which man can withdraw from the divine thou, because it includes the ego and is nearer to the ego than the ego to itself\".<ref name=SysTheoV1P271/>\n\nTillich goes further to say that the desire to draw God into the subject\u2013object dichotomy is an \"insult\" to the divine holiness.<ref>{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology vol. 1 |page=272}}</ref> Similarly, if God were made into the subject rather than the object of knowledge (The Ultimate Subject), then the rest of existing entities then become subjected to the absolute knowledge and scrutiny of God, and the human being is \"reified,\" or made into a mere object. It would deprive the person of his or her own subjectivity and creativity. According to Tillich, theological theism has provoked the rebellions found in atheism and Existentialism, although other social factors such as the [[industrial revolution]] have also contributed to the \"reification\" of the human being. The modern man could no longer tolerate the idea of being an \"object\" completely subjected to the absolute knowledge of God. Tillich argued, as mentioned, that theological theism is \"bad theology\".\n{{quote |The God of the theological theism is a being besides others and as such a part of the whole reality. He is certainly considered its most important part, but as a part and therefore as subjected to the structure of the whole. He is supposed to be beyond the ontological elements and categories which constitute reality. But every statement subjects him to them. He is seen as a self which has a world, as an ego which relates to a thought, as a cause which is separated from its effect, as having a definite space and endless time. He is a being, not being-itself<ref name=\"Tillich, Courage To Be, p 184\">Tillich, ''Courage To Be'', p 184.</ref>}}\n\nAlternatively, Tillich presents the above-mentioned ontological view of God as Being-Itself, [[Ground of Being]], Power of Being, and occasionally as [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]] or God's \"Abysmal Being\". What makes Tillich's ontological view of God different from theological theism is that it transcends it by being the foundation or ultimate reality that \"precedes\" all beings. Just as [[Being]] for [[Heidegger]] is ontologically ''prior'' to conception, Tillich views God to be beyond being.<ref name=\"Tillich, p 15\">Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', p 15.</ref> God is not a supernatural entity among other entities. Instead, God is the inexhaustible ground which empowers the existence of beings. We cannot perceive God as an object which is related to a subject because God ''precedes'' the subject\u2013object dichotomy.<ref name=\"Tillich, p 15\"/>\n\nThus Tillich dismisses a literalistic [[Biblicism]]. Instead of rejecting the notion of personal God, however, Tillich sees it as a symbol that points directly to the Ground of Being.<ref>Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', p 127-132.</ref> Since the Ground of Being ontologically precedes reason, it cannot be comprehended since comprehension presupposes the subject\u2013object dichotomy. Tillich disagreed with any literal philosophical and religious statements that can be made about God. Such literal statements attempt to define God and lead not only to [[anthropomorphism]] but also to a philosophical mistake that [[Immanuel Kant]] warned against, that setting limits against the transcendent inevitably leads to contradictions. Any statements about God are simply symbolic, but these symbols are sacred in the sense that they function to participate or point to the Ground of Being.\n\nTillich also further elaborated the thesis of the God above the God of theism in his Systematic Theology.\n\n{{quote |... (the God above the God of theism) This has been misunderstood as a dogmatic statement of a pantheistic or mystical character. First of all, it is not a dogmatic, but an apologetic, statement. It takes seriously the radical doubt experienced by many people. It gives one the courage of self-affirmation even in the extreme state of radical doubt. |Tillich | |''Systematic Theology Vol. 2 '', p. 12}}\n\n{{quote |... In such a state the God of both religious and theological language disappears. But something remains, namely, the seriousness of that doubt in which meaning within meaninglessness is affirmed. The source of this affirmation of meaning within meaninglessness, of certitude within doubt, is not the God of traditional theism but the \"God above God,\" the power of being, which works through those who have no name for it, not even the name God. |Tillich | |''Systematic Theology Vol. 2 '', p. 12}}\n\n{{quote |... This is the answer to those who ask for a message in the nothingness of their situation and at the end of their courage to be. But such an extreme point is not a space with which one can live. The dialectics of an extreme situation are a criterion of truth but not the basis on which a whole structure of truth can be built. |Tillich | |''Systematic Theology Vol. 2 '', p.12}}\n\n===Method of correlation===\nThe key to understanding Tillich's theology is what he calls the \"method of correlation.\" It is an approach that correlates insights from Christian [[revelation]] with the issues raised by [[existentialism|existential]], psychological, and philosophical analysis.<ref name =CODWR />\n\nTillich states in the introduction to the ''Systematic Theology'':\n{{Quote |Theology formulates the questions implied in human existence, and theology formulates the answers implied in divine self-manifestation under the guidance of the questions implied in human existence. This is a circle which drives man to a point where question and answer are not separated.  This point, however, is not a moment in time.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 61}}}}\n\n{{Quote |The Christian message provides the answers to the questions implied in human existence.  These answers are contained in the revelatory events on which Christianity is based and are taken by systematic theology from the sources, through the medium, under the norm.  Their content cannot be derived from questions that would come from an analysis of human existence.  They are 'spoken' to human existence from beyond it, in a sense.  Otherwise, they would not be answers, for the question is human existence itself.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 64}}}}\n\nFor Tillich, the existential questions of human existence are associated with the field of philosophy and, more specifically, [[ontology]] (the study of being). This is because, according to Tillich, a lifelong pursuit of philosophy reveals that the central question of every philosophical inquiry always comes back to the question of being, or what it means to be, and, consequently, what it means to be a finite human being within being.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1955 | pp = 11\u201320}}  To be correlated with existential questions are theological answers, themselves derived from Christian revelation.  The task of the philosopher primarily involves developing the questions, whereas the task of the theologian primarily involves developing the answers to these questions.  However, it should be remembered that the two tasks overlap and include one another: the theologian must be somewhat of a philosopher and vice versa, for Tillich's notion of faith as \"ultimate concern\" necessitates that the theological answer be correlated with, compatible with, and in response to the general ontological question which must be developed independently from the answers.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1957 | p = 23}}{{Sfn | Tillich | 1952 | pp = 58ff}}  Thus, on one side of the correlation lies an ontological analysis of the human situation, whereas on the other is a presentation of the Christian message as a response to this existential dilemma. For Tillich, no formulation of the question can contradict the theological answer.  This is because the Christian message claims, ''a priori'', that the ''logos'' \"who became flesh\" is also the universal ''logos'' of the Greeks.{{Sfn |  Tillich | 1951 | p = 28}}\n\nIn addition to the intimate relationship between philosophy and theology, another important aspect of the method of correlation is Tillich's distinction between form and content in the theological answers.  While the nature of revelation determines the actual content of the theological answers, the character of the questions determines the form of these answers.  This is because, for Tillich, theology must be an answering theology, or [[Christian apologetics|apologetic theology]]. God is called the \"ground of being\" in part because God is the answer to the ontological threat of non-being, and this characterization of the theological answer in philosophical terms means that the answer has been conditioned (insofar as its form is considered) by the question. {{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 64}}  Throughout the ''Systematic Theology'', Tillich is careful to maintain this distinction between form and content without allowing one to be inadvertently conditioned by the other.  Many criticisms of Tillich's methodology revolve around this issue of whether the integrity of the Christian message is really maintained when its form is conditioned by philosophy.{{Sfn | McKelway | 1964 | p = 47}}\n\nThe theological answer is also determined by the sources of theology, our experience, and the norm of theology.  Though the form of the theological answers are determined by the character of the question, these answers (which \"are contained in the revelatory events on which Christianity is based\") are also \"taken by systematic theology from the sources, through the medium, under the norm.\"{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 64}}  There are three main sources of systematic theology: the Bible, Church history, and the history of religion and culture.  Experience is not a source but a medium through which the sources speak.  And the norm of theology is that by which both sources and experience are judged with regard to the content of the Christian faith.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 47}}  Thus, we have the following as elements of the method and structure of systematic theology:\n\n* Sources of theology{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 40}}\n** Bible{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 35}}\n** Church history\n** History of religion and culture\n* Medium of the sources\n** Collective experience of the Church\n* Norm of theology (determines use of sources)\n** Content of which is the biblical message itself, for example:\n*** Justification through faith\n*** New Being in Jesus as the Christ\n*** The Protestant Principle\n*** The criterion of the cross\n\nAs McKelway explains, the sources of theology contribute to the formation of the norm, which then becomes the criterion through which the sources and experience are judged.{{Sfn | McKelway | 1964 | pp = 55\u201356}}  The relationship is circular, as it is the present situation which conditions the norm in the interaction between church and biblical message.  The norm is then subject to change, but Tillich insists that its basic content remains the same: that of the biblical message.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 52}}  It is tempting to conflate revelation with the norm, but we must keep in mind that revelation (whether original or dependent) is not an element of the structure of systematic theology per se, but an event.{{Sfn | McKelway | 1964 | p = 80}}  For Tillich, the present-day norm is the \"New Being in Jesus as the Christ as our Ultimate Concern\".{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 50}}  This is because the present question is one of estrangement, and the overcoming of this estrangement is what Tillich calls the \"New Being\". But since Christianity answers the question of estrangement with \"Jesus as the Christ\", the norm tells us that we find the New Being in Jesus as the Christ.\n\nThere is also the question of the validity of the method of correlation.  Certainly one could reject the method on the grounds that there is no ''a priori'' reason for its adoption. But Tillich claims that the method of any theology and its system are interdependent. That is, an absolute methodological approach cannot be adopted because the method is continually being determined by the system and the objects of theology.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 60}}\n\n===Life and the Spirit===\nThis is part four of Tillich's ''Systematic Theology''. In this part, Tillich talks about life and the divine Spirit.\n\n{{quote|Life remains ambiguous as long as there is life. The question implied in the ambiguities of life derives to a new question, namely, that of the direction in which life moves. This is the question of history. Systematically speaking, history, characterized as it is by its direction toward the future, is the dynamic quality of life. Therefore, the \"riddle of history\" is a part of the problem of life.<ref>Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 2'', p. 4</ref>}}\n\n===Absolute faith===\nTillich stated the courage to take meaninglessness into oneself presupposes a relation to the ground of being: absolute faith.<ref>The Courage to Be, page 182</ref> Absolute faith can transcend the theistic idea of God, and has three elements.\n\n{{quote |... The first element is the experience of the power of being which is present even in the face of the most radical manifestation of non being. If one says that in this experience vitality resists despair, one must add that vitality in man is proportional to intentionality.\n\nThe vitality that can stand the abyss of meaninglessness is aware of a hidden meaning within the destruction of meaning.\n |Tillich | |''The Courage to Be'', p.177 }}\n\n{{quote |The second element in absolute faith is the dependence of the experience of nonbeing on the experience of being and the dependence of the experience of meaninglessness on the experience of meaning. Even in the state of despair one has enough being to make despair possible. |Tillich | |''The Courage to Be'', p.177 }}\n\n{{quote |There is a third element in absolute faith, the acceptance of being accepted. Of course, in the state of despair there is nobody and nothing that accepts. But there is the power of acceptance itself which is experienced. Meaninglessness, as long as it is experienced, includes an experience of the \"power of acceptance\". To accept this power of acceptance consciously is the religious answer of absolute faith, of a faith which has been deprived by doubt of any concrete content, which nevertheless is faith and the source of the most paradoxical manifestation of the courage to be.\n |Tillich | |''The Courage to Be'', p.177 }}\n\n===Faith as ultimate concern===\nAccording to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Tillich believes the essence of religious attitudes is what he calls \"ultimate concern\".  Separate from all profane and ordinary realities, the object of the concern is understood as sacred, [[numinous]] or holy. The perception of its reality is felt as so overwhelming and valuable that all else seems insignificant, and for this reason requires total surrender.<ref>{{citation |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts-god/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Concepts of God |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=2010-09-29|last=Wainwright|first=William |accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>  In 1957, Tillich defined his conception of faith more explicitly in his work, ''Dynamics of Faith''.\n\n{{quote|Man, like every living being, is concerned about many things, above all about those which condition his very existence ... If [a situation or concern] claims ultimacy it demands the total surrender of him who accepts this claim ... it demands that all other concerns ... be sacrificed.<ref>Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', pp. 1\u20132</ref>}}\n\nTillich further refined his conception of faith by stating that, \"Faith as ultimate concern is an act of the total personality. It is the most centered act of the human mind ... it participates in the dynamics of personal life.\"<ref>Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', p. 5</ref>\n\nAn arguably central component of Tillich's concept of faith is his notion that faith is \"ecstatic\". That is to say:\n\n{{quote|It transcends both the drives of the nonrational unconsciousness and the structures of the rational conscious ... the ecstatic character of faith does not exclude its rational character although it is not identical with it, and it includes nonrational strivings without being identical with them. 'Ecstasy' means 'standing outside of oneself' - without ceasing to be oneself - with all the elements which are united in the personal center.<ref>Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', pp. 8\u20139</ref>}}\n\nIn short, for Tillich, faith does not stand opposed to rational or nonrational elements (reason and emotion respectively), as some philosophers would maintain. Rather, it ''transcends'' them in an ecstatic passion for the ultimate.<ref>{{YouTube|KR7QAjm3yxU|Tillich Interview part 12}}</ref>\n\nIt should also be noted that Tillich does not exclude [[atheism|atheists]] in his exposition of faith. Everyone has an ultimate concern, and this concern can be in an act of faith, \"even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. Where there is ultimate concern, God can be denied only in the name of God\"<ref>Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', p. 52</ref>\n\n=== Tillich's ontology of courage ===\n\nIn Paul Tillich's work ''The Courage to Be'' he defines courage as the self-affirmation of one's being in spite of a threat of nonbeing. He relates courage to anxiety, anxiety being the threat of non-being and the courage to be what we use to combat that threat. For Tillich, he outlines three types of anxiety and thus three ways to display the courage to be.\n\n1)\tThe Anxiety of Fate and Death\na.\tThe Anxiety of Fate and Death is the most basic and universal form of anxiety for Tillich. It relates quite simply to the recognition of our mortality. This troubles us humans. We become anxious when we are unsure whether our actions create a causal damnation which leads to a very real and quite unavoidable death (42-44). \"Nonbeing threatens man's ontic self-affirmation, relatively in terms of fate, absolutely in terms of death\" (41).\nb.\tWe display courage when we cease to rely on others to tell us what will come of us, (what will happen when we die etc.) and begin seeking those answers out for ourselves. Called the \"courage of confidence\" (162-63).\n\n2)\tThe Anxiety of Guilt and Condemnation\na.\tThis anxiety afflicts our moral self-affirmation. We as humans are responsible for our moral being, and when asked by our judge (whomever that may be) what we have made of ourselves we must answer. The anxiety is produced when we realize our being is unsatisfactory. \"It [Nonbeing] threatens man's moral self-affirmation, relatively in terms of guilt, absolutely in terms of condemnation\" (41).\nb.\tWe display courage when we first identify our sin; despair or whatever is causing us guilt or afflicting condemnation. We then rely on the idea that we are accepted regardless. \"The courage to be is the courage to accept oneself as accepted in spite of being unacceptable\" (164).\n\n3)\tThe Anxiety of Meaninglessness and Emptiness \na.\tThe Anxiety of Meaninglessness and Emptiness attacks our being as a whole. We worry about the loss of an ultimate concern or goal. This anxiety is also brought on by a loss of spirituality. We as beings feel the threat of non-being when we feel we have no place or purpose in the world. \"It [Nonbeing] threatens man's spiritual self-affirmation, relatively in terms of emptiness, absolutely in terms of meaninglessness\" (41).\nb.\tWe display the courage to be when facing this anxiety by displaying true faith, and by again, self-affirming oneself. We draw from the \"power of being\" which is God for Tillich and use that faith to in turn affirm ourselves and negate the non-being. We can find our meaning and purpose through the \"power of being\" (172-73).\n\nTillich writes that the ultimate source of the courage to be is the \"God above God,\" which transcends the theistic idea of God and is the content of absolute faith (defined as \"the accepting of the acceptance without somebody or something that accepts\") (185).\n\n== Popular works ==\n\nTwo of Tillich's works, ''The Courage to Be'' (1952) and ''Dynamics of Faith'' (1957), were read widely, including by people who would not normally read religious books. In ''The Courage to Be'', he lists three basic anxieties: anxiety about our biological finitude, i.e. that arising from the knowledge that we will eventually die; anxiety about our moral finitude, linked to guilt; and anxiety about our existential finitude, a sense of aimlessness in life. Tillich related these to three different historical eras: the early centuries of the [[Christian era]]; the [[Reformation]]; and the 20th century. Tillich's popular works have influenced psychology as well as theology, having had an influence on [[Rollo May]], whose \"The Courage to Create\" was inspired by \"The Courage to Be\".\n\n== Reception ==\n\nToday, Tillich's most observable legacy may well be that of a spiritually-oriented public intellectual and teacher with a broad and continuing range of influence. Tillich's chapel sermons (especially at Union) were enthusiastically received<ref>{{cite book |last=Grenz |first=Stanley J. and Roger E.

When the psalmist looks at God, for Whom a thousand years are like one day, he is looking at that eternity which alone gives him a place on which he can stand, a now which has infinite reality and infinite significance. In every moment that we say now, something temporal and something eternal are united. Whenever a human being says, 'Now I am living; now I am really present,' resisting the stream which drives the future into the past, eternity is.

But more importantly, she also saw virus particles in the B814 sample.\"<ref name=\"Tyrrell_Fielder_2002\"/>{{rp|96}} She told Tyrrell that the B814 specimens had reminded her of particles she had previously studied in a \"disease called infectious bronchitis of chickens\" and in another disease\u2014\"mouse hepatitis liver inflammation.\" Her papers on these had been rejected because the referees considered her [[electron micrograph]]s to be \"bad pictures\" of known influenza virus particles.

Tyrrell's team had been attempting to detect the presence of [[rhinovirus]]es in tissue cultures of cells that they had produced in the lab. They wanted to detect a specific respiratory virus they called B814. A Swedish professor, Bertil Hoorn could make all Tyrrell's respiratory viruses in organ cultures of cells from the human airway in the laboratory, except for virus B814.

These included a sample prepared with the B814 virus, along with samples infected with influenza and herpes, which were well-known.

But more importantly, she also saw virus particles in the B814 sample.\"<ref name=\"Tyrrell_Fielder_2002\"/>{{rp|96}} She told Tyrrell that the B814 specimens had reminded her of particles she had previously studied in a \"disease called infectious bronchitis of chickens\" and in another disease- \"mouse hepatitis liver inflammation.\" Her papers on these had been rejected because the referees considered her [[electron micrograph]]s to be \"bad pictures\" of known influenza virus particles. She told him she now knew that these \"three viruses were something quite new.\"<ref name=\"Tyrrell_Fielder_2002\"/>{{rp|96}}\n\nAccording to Tyrrell, once Almeida had identified the \"previously unrecognised group of viruses\", they met in Waterson's office, to decide on its name.

The list includes established breeds recognized by various [[Cat registry|cat registries]], new and experimental breeds, [[landrace]]s being established as standardized breeds, distinct domestic populations not being actively developed and lapsed (extinct) breeds. \n\n[[The International Cat Association|As of 2019, The International Cat Association]] (TICA) recognizes 71 standardized breeds,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tica.org/public/breeds.php |title=The International Cat Association - TICA Breed Standards |access-date=2010-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722123919/http://tica.org/public/breeds.php |archive-date=2015-07-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA) recognizes 44,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070629034229/http://www.cfa.org/breeds.html Cat Fanciers' Association - CFA Breed Standards]\n</ref> and the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale F\u00e9line]] (FIFe) recognizes 43.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130218232042/http://fifeweb.org/wp/breeds/breeds_prf_stn.php F\u00e9d\u00e9ration InternationF\u00e9line - FIFe Breed Standards]<!-- Add at least [[World Cat Federation]] (WCF) and [[Governing Council of the Cat Fancy]] (GCCF), too.-->\n</ref>\n\nInconsistency in breed classification and naming among registries means that an individual animal may be considered different breeds by different registries (though not necessarily eligible for registry in them all, depending on its exact ancestry). For example, TICA's Himalayan is considered a colorpoint variety of the Persian by the CFA, while the Javanese (or Colorpoint Longhair) is a color variation of the Balinese in both the TICA and the CFA; both breeds are merged (along with the Colorpoint Shorthair) into a single \"mega-breed\", the Colourpoint<!--The WCF name is always spelled with a u-->, by the [[World Cat Federation]] (WCF), who have repurposed the name \"Javanese\" for the [[Oriental Longhair]]. Also, \"Colo[u]rpoint Longhair\" refers to different breeds in other registries. There are many examples of nomenclatural overlap and differences of this sort. Furthermore, many geographical and cultural names for cat breeds are fanciful selections made by Western breeders to be exotic sounding and bear no relationship to the actual origin of the breeds;<ref>{{cite book |last=Somerville |first=Louisa |title=The Ultimate Guide to Cat Breeds |date=2007 |publisher=Chartwell Books |location=Edison, New Jersey |isbn=9780785822646 |page=44 |quote=There is a lot of confusion surrounding the use of this name in the cat world, although it is always used to describe cats of distinctly Oriental type. It has been adopted simply because of the tradition which has grown up for using the names of countries and islands from south-eastern Asia for other Oriental breeds, such as the Siamese and Balinese.}}</ref> the Balinese, Javanese, and Himalayan are all examples of this trend.\n\nThe [[domestic short-haired]] and [[domestic long-haired cat]] types are not breeds, but terms used (with various spellings) in the [[cat fancy]] to describe [[mongrel]] cats of a general type, by coat length, that do not belong to a particular breed. Some registries permit them to be [[Pedigree (animal)|pedigreed]] and they have been used as [[foundation stock]] in the establishment of some breeds.

For example, TICA's Himalayan is considered a colorpoint variety of the Persian by the CFA, while the Javanese (or Colorpoint Longhair) is a color variation of the Balinese in both the TICA and the CFA; both breeds are merged (along with the Colorpoint Shorthair) into a single \"mega-breed\", the Colourpoint<!--The WCF name is always spelled with a u-->, by the [[World Cat Federation]] (WCF), who have repurposed the name \"Javanese\" for the [[Oriental Longhair]]. Also, \"Colo[u]rpoint Longhair\" refers to different breeds in other registries. There are many examples of nomenclatural overlap and differences of this sort. Furthermore, many geographical and cultural names for cat breeds are fanciful selections made by Western breeders to be exotic sounding and bear no relationship to the actual origin of the breeds;<ref>{{cite book |last=Somerville |first=Louisa |title=The Ultimate Guide to Cat Breeds |date=2007 |publisher=Chartwell Books |location=Edison, New Jersey |isbn=9780785822646 |page=44 |quote=There is a lot of confusion surrounding the use of this name in the cat world, although it is always used to describe cats of distinctly Oriental type.

Some registries permit them to be [[Pedigree (animal)|pedigreed]] and they have been used as [[foundation stock]] in the establishment of some breeds.
