the West Indies in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]] on the boundary with the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=GovC/> The island was previously called '''Iyonola''', the name given to the island by the native [[Amerindian|Amerindians]] and later, '''Hewanorra''', the name given by the native [[Island Caribs|Caribs]]. Part of the [[Lesser Antilles]], it is located north/northeast of the island of [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]], northwest of [[Barbados]] and south of [[Martinique]]. It covers a land area of {{convert|617|km2|abbr=in}} and reported a population of 165,595 in the 2010 census.<ref name=census>{{cite web|url=http://192.147.231.244:9090/stats/index.php/statistics/population |title=Population & Vital Statistics |publisher=Central Statistics Office of St. Lucia |accessdate=18 November 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119182317/http://192.147.231.244:9090/stats/index.php/statistics/population |archivedate=19 November 2016 }}</ref> Its capital is [[Castries]].\n\nThe French were the island's first European settlers. They signed a treaty with the native [[Island Caribs]] in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France fourteen times, and the rule of the island changed frequently (it was ruled seven times each by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \"Helen of the West Indies\" after the Greek mythological character, [[Helen of Troy]].\n\nRepresentative government came about in 1840 (universal [[suffrage]] was established in 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the [[West Indies Federation]]. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=\"GovC\">\n  \"The Saint Lucia Constitution\" (1978-December-20 effective\n  1979-February-22), Government of St. Lucia, December 2008,\n  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1901/made\n</ref> Saint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction,<ref>[http://www.juriglobe.ca/eng/sys-juri/class-poli/sys-mixtes.php Mixed Legal Systems]. juriglobe.ca</ref> meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[English common law]].

The Arawak are believed to have come from northern [[South America]] sometime around 200\u2013400 [[AD]], as there are numerous [[archeology|archaeological]] sites on the island where specimens of their well-developed [[pottery]] have been found. There is evidence to suggest that the Arawak called the island ''Iouanalao'', meaning 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of [[iguana]]s.<ref name=AllAbout>[http://www.allaboutstlucia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121 All about St Lucia: ''History'']</ref>\n\nThe more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] arrived around 800 AD, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society.<ref name=AllAbout/> They called the island ''Hewanarau'', and later ''Hewanorra'' (Io\u00fcanalao, or \"there where iguanas are found\").{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=10}}\n\n===Early European period===\n[[Christopher Columbus]] may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, since he made landfall on [[Martinique]], yet he does not mention the island in his log. [[Juan de la Cosa]] noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it El Falcon, and another island to the south Las Agujas. A Spanish [[Cedula|c\u00e9dula]] from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1520, shows the island as Sancta Lucia.\n\nIn the late 1550s, the French [[pirate]] [[Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc]] (known as ''Jambe de Bois'', due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]], from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the ''Oliphe Blossome'' was blown off-course on its way to [[Guyana]], and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605 only 19 survived following continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so the settlers fled the island.{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=16\u201321}}\n\n===French colony===\n{{Main|French West Indies}}\n\nIn 1664, Thomas Warner (son of [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Sir Thomas Warner]], the governor of [[St Kitts]]) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the [[French West India Company]] resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.<ref name=Statesmen>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Lucia.html World Statesmen: ''Saint Lucia Chronology''] Linked 2014-01-20</ref>\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}\n\nBoth the British and the French found the island attractive after the slave-based sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.\n\nIn 1722, [[George I of Great Britain]] granted both Saint Lucia and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] to [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|The 2nd Duke of Montagu]]. He in turn appointed [[Nathaniel Uring]], a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Montagu, John (1688?-1749)|first=Henry Manners |last=Chichester|volume=38}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year. Britain handed the island back to the French at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations in 1765.\n\nIn January 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] sent four ''commissaires'' to St Lucia to spread their revolutionary philosophy. By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In December 1792, Lt. [[Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse]] arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as ''patriots''. On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General [[Nicolas Xavier de Ricard]] took over as Governor.  The [[National Convention]] abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]] on 1 April 1794. [[Morne Fortune]] became ''Fort Charlotte''. Soon, a patriot army of resistance, ''L'Armee Fran\u00e7aise dans les Bois'', began to fight back.  Thus started the [[First Brigand War]].{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=60\u201365}}\n\nA short time later the British invaded the island as a part of the recently broken out war with France. On 21 February 1795 and a group of locals under the nominal control of [[Victor Hugues]] defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux Fort and Rabot. In 1796, [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|General John Moore]] retook Fort Charlotte in 1796 with the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th Inniskilling Fusiliers]] after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at [[Morne Fortune]] for an hour before being replaced by the [[Union Jack]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trimble|first=Copeland|title=Historical record of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment from the period of its institution as a volunteer corps till the present time|publisher=William Clowes|year=1876|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog/page/n83 49]}}</ref> Moore would then participate in British efforts to repress the slave rebels until falling ill of [[yellow fever]], upon which he returned to Britain before 1798.\n\nIn 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many of the rebels escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established [[maroon communities]].<ref>''They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters'' by Robert J Devaux</ref>\n\nThe slavery on the island was continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807.\n\nFrance and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony.\n\nThe institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1836, as it was throughout the [[British Empire]]. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \"apprenticeship,\" to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During this period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. Some people of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.\n\nCastries' harbour was protected by a system of 60 surrounding forts. Along the top of Morne Fortune there are six military sites, building work by the French started in 1768, and the British completed the work by 1890. They include Fort Charlotte (Old Morne Fortress), the Apostle's Battery (1888\u20131890), The Powder Magazine built by the French in the 1750s, Provost's [[Redoubt]] (1792) built as a lookout point, and the Combermere [[barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Sarah|title=St Lucia & Dominica Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Fort-de-France ...|date=2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=9781909268319|page=32|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9MH9AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA32&dq=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Flag of Saint Lucia (1939\u20131967).svg|thumb|[[Flag of Saint Lucia]] 1939\u20131967]]\nThe best preserved installation is a battery at La Toc Point, completed in 1888 it was not abandoned till 1905.

In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979, it gained full independence under [[Sir John Compton]] of the conservative [[United Workers Party (Saint Lucia)|United Workers party (UWP)]].

Typical essential foodstuffs are potatoes, onions, [[celery]], [[thyme]], [[coconut milk]], the very hot [[Scotch bonnet|scotch bonnet peppers]], flour, and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St. Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over [[ground provisions]] or rice. The island is also home to the famous fried dough, known by many as a bake or Johnny Cake. These bakes can be served with different sides, such as saltfish which is either saut\u00e9ed or lightly fried along with red, green peppers, onions, and seasoned well. This is the most common way for bake to be prepared, though it can also be served with meats such as stewed chicken or beef.\n\nOne popular Saint Lucian dessert is the pastry called a turnover. The pastry is made with sweetened coconut that is boiled with spices, some sugar, and whatever is satisfying. It is boiled until cooked to a light or dark brown colour; then the mixture is separated into various size portions placed on a rolled out piece of dough. The dough size may vary too depending on how much is desired, and lastly, it is baked in the oven until the colour of the turnover is nicely browned.\n\nDue to Saint Lucia's Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular; however due to the blend of cooking styles, curry dishes have a distinct Caribbean twist. Roti is typically served as a fast food meal: the bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas and potato, seafood such as shrimp and conch, or meats such as chicken, beef, goat, and liver.\n\n===LGBTQ non-acceptance===\n[[LGBT rights in Saint Lucia|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people living in Saint Lucia]] face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT members of the population.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Avery |title=71 Countries Where Homosexuality is Illegal |url=https://www.newsweek.com/73-countries-where-its-illegal-be-gay-1385974 |work=Newsweek |date=4 April 2019}}</ref> Saint Lucia prohibits male-on-male sexual activity, punishing those found guilty with 10 years in jail.

They signed a treaty with the native [[Island Caribs]] in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France fourteen times, and the rule of the island changed frequently (it was ruled seven times each by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \"Helen of the West Indies\" after the Greek mythological character, [[Helen of Troy]].\n\nRepresentative government came about in 1840 (universal [[suffrage]] was established in 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the [[West Indies Federation]]. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=\"GovC\">\n  \"The Saint Lucia Constitution\" (1978-December-20 effective\n  1979-February-22), Government of St. Lucia, December 2008,\n  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1901/made\n</ref> Saint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction,<ref>[http://www.juriglobe.ca/eng/sys-juri/class-poli/sys-mixtes.php Mixed Legal Systems]. juriglobe.ca</ref> meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[English common law]].

The Arawak are believed to have come from northern [[South America]] sometime around 200\u2013400 [[AD]], as there are numerous [[archeology|archaeological]] sites on the island where specimens of their well-developed [[pottery]] have been found. There is evidence to suggest that the Arawak called the island ''Iouanalao'', meaning 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of [[iguana]]s.<ref name=AllAbout>[http://www.allaboutstlucia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121 All about St Lucia: ''History'']</ref>\n\nThe more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] arrived around 800 AD, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society.<ref name=AllAbout/> They called the island ''Hewanarau'', and later ''Hewanorra'' (Io\u00fcanalao, or \"there where iguanas are found\").{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=10}}\n\n===Early European period===\n[[Christopher Columbus]] may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, since he made landfall on [[Martinique]], yet he does not mention the island in his log. [[Juan de la Cosa]] noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it El Falcon, and another island to the south Las Agujas. A Spanish [[Cedula|c\u00e9dula]] from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1520, shows the island as Sancta Lucia.\n\nIn the late 1550s, the French [[pirate]] [[Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc]] (known as ''Jambe de Bois'', due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]], from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the ''Oliphe Blossome'' was blown off-course on its way to [[Guyana]], and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605 only 19 survived following continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so the settlers fled the island.{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=16\u201321}}\n\n===French colony===\n{{Main|French West Indies}}\n\nIn 1664, Thomas Warner (son of [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Sir Thomas Warner]], the governor of [[St Kitts]]) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the [[French West India Company]] resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.<ref name=Statesmen>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Lucia.html World Statesmen: ''Saint Lucia Chronology''] Linked 2014-01-20</ref>\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}\n\nBoth the British and the French found the island attractive after the slave-based sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.\n\nIn 1722, [[George I of Great Britain]] granted both Saint Lucia and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] to [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|The 2nd Duke of Montagu]]. He in turn appointed [[Nathaniel Uring]], a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Montagu, John (1688?-1749)|first=Henry Manners |last=Chichester|volume=38}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year. Britain handed the island back to the French at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations in 1765.\n\nIn January 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] sent four ''commissaires'' to St Lucia to spread their revolutionary philosophy. By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In December 1792, Lt. [[Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse]] arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as ''patriots''. On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General [[Nicolas Xavier de Ricard]] took over as Governor.  The [[National Convention]] abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]] on 1 April 1794. [[Morne Fortune]] became ''Fort Charlotte''. Soon, a patriot army of resistance, ''L'Armee Fran\u00e7aise dans les Bois'', began to fight back.  Thus started the [[First Brigand War]].{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=60\u201365}}\n\nA short time later the British invaded the island as a part of the recently broken out war with France. On 21 February 1795 and a group of locals under the nominal control of [[Victor Hugues]] defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux Fort and Rabot. In 1796, [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|General John Moore]] retook Fort Charlotte in 1796 with the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th Inniskilling Fusiliers]] after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at [[Morne Fortune]] for an hour before being replaced by the [[Union Jack]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trimble|first=Copeland|title=Historical record of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment from the period of its institution as a volunteer corps till the present time|publisher=William Clowes|year=1876|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog/page/n83 49]}}</ref> Moore would then participate in British efforts to repress the slave rebels until falling ill of [[yellow fever]], upon which he returned to Britain before 1798.\n\nIn 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many of the rebels escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established [[maroon communities]].<ref>''They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters'' by Robert J Devaux</ref>\n\nThe slavery on the island was continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807.\n\nFrance and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony.\n\nThe institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1836, as it was throughout the [[British Empire]]. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \"apprenticeship,\" to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During this period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. Some people of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.\n\nCastries' harbour was protected by a system of 60 surrounding forts. Along the top of Morne Fortune there are six military sites, building work by the French started in 1768, and the British completed the work by 1890. They include Fort Charlotte (Old Morne Fortress), the Apostle's Battery (1888\u20131890), The Powder Magazine built by the French in the 1750s, Provost's [[Redoubt]] (1792) built as a lookout point, and the Combermere [[barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Sarah|title=St Lucia & Dominica Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Fort-de-France ...|date=2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=9781909268319|page=32|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9MH9AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA32&dq=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Flag of Saint Lucia (1939\u20131967).svg|thumb|[[Flag of Saint Lucia]] 1939\u20131967]]\nThe best preserved installation is a battery at La Toc Point, completed in 1888 it was not abandoned till 1905.

In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979, it gained full independence under [[Sir John Compton]] of the conservative [[United Workers Party (Saint Lucia)|United Workers party (UWP)]].

However, with the US, Canada, and Europe in recession, tourism declined by double digits in early 2009. The recent change in the [[European Union]] import preference regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia.\n\nSaint Lucia has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, which is Saint Lucia's main source of revenue. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalise the banana industry. Despite negative growth in 2011, economic fundamentals remain solid, and GDP growth should recover in the future.\n\nInflation has been relatively low, averaging 5.5 percent between 2006 and 2008.

Typical essential foodstuffs are potatoes, onions, [[celery]], [[thyme]], [[coconut milk]], the very hot [[Scotch bonnet|scotch bonnet peppers]], flour, and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St. Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over [[ground provisions]] or rice. The island is also home to the famous fried dough, known by many as a bake or Johnny Cake. These bakes can be served with different sides, such as saltfish which is either saut\u00e9ed or lightly fried along with red, green peppers, onions, and seasoned well. This is the most common way for bake to be prepared, though it can also be served with meats such as stewed chicken or beef.\n\nOne popular Saint Lucian dessert is the pastry called a turnover. The pastry is made with sweetened coconut that is boiled with spices, some sugar, and whatever is satisfying. It is boiled until cooked to a light or dark brown colour; then the mixture is separated into various size portions placed on a rolled out piece of dough. The dough size may vary too depending on how much is desired, and lastly, it is baked in the oven until the colour of the turnover is nicely browned.\n\nDue to Saint Lucia's Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular; however due to the blend of cooking styles, curry dishes have a distinct Caribbean twist. Roti is typically served as a fast food meal: the bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas and potato, seafood such as shrimp and conch, or meats such as chicken, beef, goat, and liver.\n\n===LGBTQ non-acceptance===\n[[LGBT rights in Saint Lucia|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people living in Saint Lucia]] face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT members of the population.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Avery |title=71 Countries Where Homosexuality is Illegal |url=https://www.newsweek.com/73-countries-where-its-illegal-be-gay-1385974 |work=Newsweek |date=4 April 2019}}</ref> Saint Lucia prohibits male-on-male sexual activity, punishing those found guilty with 10 years in jail.

This establishment was possible with aid from other institutions such as universities ([[Gadjah Mada University|UGM]], [[Padjadjaran University|UNPAD]] and [[Diponegoro University|UNDIP]]), PTIP Department (now DIKTI), provincial government of [[Central Java]] and leaders of the Indonesian armed forces.\n\nWhen established, UNSOED had three faculties: Agriculture, Economics and Biology. Now it has eight faculties and postgraduate programmes, comprising 31 undergraduate programmes (Strata 1/S1), nine master's degree programmes (Strata 2/S2) and 11 three-year diploma programs (D3).<ref>http://www.unsoed.ac.id</ref>\n\n== Academics ==\n\n=== Undergraduate and Diploma Programmes===\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n'''Science'''\n*[http://faperta.unsoed.ac.id/ '''Faculty of Agriculture '''(Faperta)] \n** S1 Agrotechnology\n** S1 Agribusiness\n** S1 Agricultural Engineering\n** S1 Food Science and Technology\n** D3 Agrobusiness\n** D3 Soil Science\n*[http://bio.unsoed.ac.id/ '''Faculty of Biology '''(Fabio)] \n** S1 Biology\n** D3 Fishery Resource Management\n*[http://fapet.unsoed.ac.id/ '''Faculty of Animal Husbandry '''(Fapet)]\n** S1 Animal Husbandry\n** D3 Poultry Production\n*[http://fk.unsoed.ac.id/ '''Faculty of Medicine''' (FK)] \n** S1 [https://web.archive.org/web/20101120215828/http://kedokteran.unsoed.ac.id/ Medicial Education] \n** S1 [http://dentistry.unsoed.ac.id/ Dentistry]  \n*[http://ft.unsoed.ac.id '''Faculty of Engineering''' (FT)]    \n** S1 [http://if.unsoed.ac.id/ Informatics Engineering] \n** S1 Civil Engineering\n** S1 [http://te.unsoed.ac.id/ Electrical Engineering] \n** S1 Geological Engineering\n** S1 Industrial Engineering\n*[http://fikes.unsoed.ac.id '''Faculty of Health Sciences''' (Fikes)] \n** S1 Public Health\n** S1 Nursing\n** S1 Pharmacy\n** S1 Nutrition\n**D3 Physical Education, Sport, Health, and Recreation\n*[http://fmipa.unsoed.ac.id '''Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences''' (FMIPA)] \n** S1 Chemistry\n** S1 Mathematics\n** S1 [http://fisika.fst.unsoed.ac.id/ Physics]\n*[http://fpik.unsoed.ac.id/ '''Faculty of Fishery and Marine Sciences''' (FPIK)] \n** S1 Aquatic Resources Management\n** S1 Aquatic Culture\n** S1 Oceanology\n|width=\"50\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n'''Non-science'''\n*[http://feb.unsoed.ac.id/ '''Faculty of Economics and Business '''(FEB)]  \n** S1 Economic Development\n** S1 [https://web.archive.org/web/20101202010136/http://manajemen.unsoed.ac.id/ Management] \n**S1 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110429023059/http://akuntansi.unsoed.ac.id/ Accounting]  \n**S1 Economic Education\n**D3 Financial Administration\n** D3 Accounting\n** D3 Secretariat\n** D3 International Business\n*[http://fh.unsoed.ac.id/ '''Faculty of Law '''(FH)] \n** S1 Law Science\n*[http://fisip.unsoed.ac.id/ '''Faculty of Social and Political Science''' (FISIP)]\n** S1 Sociology\n** S1 [http://ane.unsoed.ac.id/ Public Administration]\n** S1 Communication Science\n** S1 Political Science\n** S1 International Relations\n*[http://fib.unsoed.ac.id '''Faculty of Humanity''' (FIB)] \n** S1 Indonesian Literature\n** S1 English Literature\n**S1 Japanese Literature\n**S1 Indonesian Language Education\n**S1 English Language Education\n** D3 English Literature\n** D3 Chinese Literature\n|}\n\n=== Postgraduate programmes ===\n* '''Master course'''\n** Accounting\n** Management\n** Public Administration \n** Economics\n** Law \n** [http://psacabio.unsoed.ac.id/ Biology]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n** Environmental Science\n** Crop Science\n** Animal Resources\n* '''Doctoral Course'''\n** Biology\n** Management\n\n==Admission==\nAdmission to UNSOED is conducted through nationwide entrance examinations.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Jenderal Soedirman University}}\n* [http://www.unsoed.ac.id Official website]\n* [http://Cahunsoed.com Cahunsoed.com] (Student News Agency)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101125042217/http://web.beta.unsoed.ac.id/ Official website, Beta Version (under reconstruction)]\n\n{{Universities in Indonesia}}\n\n{{coord|-6.889852|107.609968|display=t|type:edu}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jenderal Soedirman University}}\n[[Category:Universities in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1920]]\n[[Category:Universities in Central Java]]\n[[Category:Banyumas Regency]]\n[[Category:Indonesian state universities]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: medicial\u2192medical", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenderal_Soedirman_University"}

Among these settlers were four sons born to John and Elizabeth Griggs: Benjamin (b. 1690), Daniel, Samuel, and Thomas. Griggstown was named after Benjamin Griggs, who established a grist mill on the Millstone River that served as a meeting place for the European farmers of the area and as such the center of the community that would become Griggstown.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP had a total area of 2.519 square miles (6.524&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), including 2.447 square miles (6.338&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land and 0.072 square miles (0.187&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of water (2.86%).<ref name=CensusArea/><ref name=\"GR1\" />\n\nGriggstown is adjacent to the communities of [[Kingston, New Jersey|Kingston]], [[Rocky Hill, New Jersey|Rocky Hill]], [[Montgomery Township, New Jersey|Montgomery Township]], [[Kendall Park, New Jersey|Kendall Park]] (in [[South Brunswick, New Jersey|South Brunswick]]), and [[Franklin Park, New Jersey|Franklin Park]].

The major roads in Griggstown are Bunker Hill Road and Canal Road.

He was born in the town of [[Villa Union]] in the state of [[Durango]], [[Mexico]], but now  resides in [[Aguanga, California]]. He is unmarried and has two daughters, Lianna and Arabi. He originally worked as a [[cowboy boot]]s salesman and a construction worker, but a construction accident caused him to leave the latter job. He made a metal sculpture of a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' for his daughter Lianna after she asked for a dinosaur for [[Christmas]] following a viewing of ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''.\n\nHe continued work on sculptures, and was eventually discovered by a philanthropist named Dennis Avery who paid him to construct one piece that then resulted in more than 100 sculptures on his property at [[Galleta Meadows Estate]] based on beasts found in a book he funded that depicts now-fossilized creatures in the [[Anza Borrego Desert State Park|Anza Borrego Desert]] as well as mythological creatures. Notable statues made by Breceda include a stagecoach pulled by horses, a large serpent, and a Tyranosaurus rex.\n\nBreceda was the subject of a book called \"Ricardo Breceda: Accidental Artist\", and his art was cited by both [[The Huffington Post]] and the ''[[Union Tribune San Diego]]'' as reasons why people should visit the Anza-Borrego Desert. You can visit his outdoor studio location known for its rustic charm and open landscape; in [[Aguanga]], which allows the structures to be a part of the surrounding outdoor landscape with hilltop views and winding country roads. It\u2019s acsesible to everyone as a vibrant public space that exists to exhibit and purchase, as well as giving intriguing experiences that engage the senses, activate the imagination, and provide connections between the viewer and collection of free-standing metal statues and kinetic sculptures\u2014from garden-sized to monumental\u2014displayed throughout the beautiful grounds at 44450 Highway 79 S. [[Aguanga]], [[California]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nRicardo Breceda was born in [[Durango]], [[Mexico]].<ref name = \"Ricardo Breceda's Roadside Site\"/> He is a single parent to his daughter.<ref name = \"Ricardo Breceda career beginnings\"/> He later moved to [[Borrego Springs, California]].\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Breceda Sea Serpent.jpg|256px|right|thumb|This Sea Serpent sculpture is one of Breceda's most famous and largest works.]]\nBreceda worked as a [[cowboy boot]]s salesman in Durango, among other professions.<ref name = \"Ricardo Breceda career beginnings\">{{ cite web |url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/dec/01/borrego-sculpture-breceda-animals/ |title = 'Dinosaur' sculptor moving base to Borrego |last = Jones |first = J.

After the movie, he asked his daughter what she wanted for [[Christmas]], and she replied that she wanted a [[dinosaur]]. A few weeks later, Breceda made his first metal statue, which was a 20-foot tall, 45-foot long ''[[Tyranosaurus rex]]'', for his daughter. This led to him making more of these statues as a hobby, and eventually people began to show interest and offered to purchase some of his statues.<ref name = \"Ricardo Breceda career beginnings\"/> In 2007, a philanthropist named Dennis Avery drove by his studio, then located in [[Riverside County]] in [[Perris, California]]. Avery asked Breceda to create statues on his property based on beasts featured in a book he financed about now-fossilized creatures once found in the Anza-Borrego Desert. Avery continued to request that Breceda create more of the beasts found in the book until he ran out of animals for Breceda to recreate. Once this happened, Breceda began work on statues based on mythical creatures.

He was born in the town of [[Villa Union]] in the state of [[Durango]], [[Mexico]], but now  resides in [[Aguanga, California]]. He is unmarried and has two daughters, Lianna and Arabi. He originally worked as a [[cowboy boot]]s salesman and a construction worker, but a construction accident caused him to leave the latter job. He made a metal sculpture of a [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] for his daughter Lianna after she asked for a dinosaur for [[Christmas]] following a viewing of ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''.\n\nHe continued work on sculptures, and was eventually discovered by a philanthropist named Dennis Avery who paid him to construct one piece that then resulted in more than 100 sculptures on his property at [[Galleta Meadows Estate]] based on beasts found in a book he funded that depicts now-fossilized creatures in the [[Anza Borrego Desert State Park|Anza Borrego Desert]] as well as mythological creatures. Notable statues made by Breceda include a stagecoach pulled by horses, a large serpent, and a Tyranosaurus Rex.\n\nBreceda was the subject of a book called \"Ricardo Breceda: Accidental Artist\", and his art was cited by both [[The Huffington Post]] and the ''[[Union Tribune San Diego]]'' as reasons why people should visit the Anza-Borrego Desert. You can visit his outdoor studio location known for its rustic charm and open landscape; in [[Aguanga]], which allows the structures to be a part of the surrounding outdoor landscape with hilltop views and winding country roads. It\u2019s acsesible to everyone as a vibrant public space that exists to exhibit and purchase, as well as giving intriguing experiences that engage the senses, activate the imagination, and provide connections between the viewer and collection of free-standing metal statues and kinetic sculptures\u2014from garden-sized to monumental\u2014displayed throughout the beautiful grounds at 44450 Highway 79 S. [[Aguanga]], [[California]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nRicardo Breceda was born in [[Durango]], [[Mexico]].<ref name = \"Ricardo Breceda's Roadside Site\"/> He is a single parent to his daughter.<ref name = \"Ricardo Breceda career beginnings\"/> He later moved to [[Borrego Springs, California]].\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Breceda Sea Serpent.jpg|256px|right|thumb|This Sea Serpent sculpture is one of Breceda's most famous and largest works.]]\nBreceda worked as a [[cowboy boot]]s salesman in Durango, among other professions.<ref name = \"Ricardo Breceda career beginnings\">{{ cite web |url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/dec/01/borrego-sculpture-breceda-animals/ |title = 'Dinosaur' sculptor moving base to Borrego |last = Jones |first = J.

After the movie, he asked his daughter what she wanted for [[Christmas]], and she replied that she wanted a [[dinosaur]]. A few weeks later, Breceda made his first metal statue, which was a 20-foot tall, 45-foot long [[Tyranosaurus Rex]], for his daughter. This led to him making more of these statues as a hobby, and eventually people began to show interest and offered to purchase some of his statues.<ref name = \"Ricardo Breceda career beginnings\"/> In 2007, a philanthropist named Dennis Avery drove by his studio, then located in [[Riverside County]] in [[Perris, California]]. Avery asked Breceda to create statues on his property based on beasts featured in a book he financed about now-fossilized creatures once found in the Anza-Borrego Desert. Avery continued to request that Breceda create more of the beasts found in the book until he ran out of animals for Breceda to recreate. Once this happened, Breceda began work on statues based on mythical creatures. When Avery died in 2012, a fund was established to ensure that if storms or vandals damaged his statues, he would be able to repair them.<ref name = \"Ricardo Breceda career beginnings\"/> By the time Avery had died, Breceda had finished 130 of the sculptures requested of him by Avery.<ref name = \"Quick Getaways\">{{ cite web |url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/road-654934-desert-borrego.html |title = Quick getaways: Go fast if you want to see the wildflowers of Anza-Borrego |work = The Orange County Register |date = 2015-03-20 |accessdate = 2015-04-26 }}</ref> The sculptures contributed to an increase in economic prosperity in Borrego Springs, which suffered from the [[Great Recession]].

He set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending [[untouchability]], and above all for achieving ''[[Swaraj]]'' or self-rule.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maeleine Slade |first1=Mirabehn |title=Gleanings Gathered at Bapu's Feet |publisher=Navjivan publications |location=Ahmedabad |url=http://gandhiserve.org/e/information/questions_and_answers/faq5/faq5.htm |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth, or short ''[[dhoti]]'' and, in the winter, a shawl, both woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel, or ''[[Spinning wheel#Charkha|charkha]]'', as a mark of identification with India's rural poor.

However, he could not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry Salt's]] writing, he joined the [[Vegetarian Society|London Vegetarian Society]] and was elected to its executive committee<ref name=\"Brown1991\">[[#Brown1991|Brown (1991)]].</ref> under the aegis of its president and benefactor [[Arnold Hills]]. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a [[Bayswater]] chapter.<ref name=\"Tendulkar1951\" /> Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the [[Theosophical Society]], which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' both in translation as well as in the original.<ref name=\"Brown1991\"/>\n\nGandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued LVS membership of fellow committee member [[Thomas Allinson|Dr Thomas Allinson]]. Their disagreement is the first known example of Gandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.\n\nAllinson had been promoting [[Birth_control#Birth_control_movement|newly available birth control methods]], but Hills disapproved of these, believing they undermined public morality. He believed [[History_of_vegetarianism#19th_century|vegetarianism to be a moral movement]] and that Allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the LVS. Gandhi shared Hills views on the dangers of birth control, but defended Allinson's right to differ.<ref>Shyness my shield https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap18.htm</ref> \nIt would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and unlike Gandhi, highly eloquent.

He was also a highly accomplished sportsman who would go on to found the football club [[West Ham United]].\n\n{{quote| The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity.

Gandhi\u2019s shyness was an obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting.

After several such incidents with [[White South African|Whites in South Africa]], Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights.

Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a \"parasite\", \"semi-barbarous\", \"canker\", \"squalid coolie\", \"yellow man\", and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.<ref name=\"Desai2015p26\"/>\n\nWhile in South Africa, Gandhi focused on racial persecution of Indians but ignored those of Africans. In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, his behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation.<ref name=\"Desai2015p26\"/> During a speech in September 1896, Gandhi complained that the whites in the British colony of South Africa were degrading Indian Hindus and Muslims to \"a level of [[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theprint.in/opinion/ramachandra-guha-is-wrong-a-middle-aged-gandhi-was-racist-and-no-mahatma/168222/|title=Ram Guha is wrong.

Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists' opinions that \"Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples\", and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans.<ref name=\"Herman 2008 pp. 88\"/>\n\nYears later, Gandhi and his colleagues served and helped Africans as nurses and by opposing racism, according to the Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Nelson Mandela]].

The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan.

The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were backed by the local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow [[Indigofera]], a cash crop for [[Indigo dye]] whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad.

A social boycott of ''mamlatdars'' and ''talatdars'' (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.<ref name=\"Brown1974\"/>\n\n====Khilafat movement====\n\n<blockquote>\nEvery revolution begins with a single act of defiance.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1919, following World War I, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the [[Ottoman Empire]] that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917\u201318. Gandhi had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers to fight the war in Europe on the British side. This effort of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with ''swaraj'' (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I.<ref name=robbins133/> The British government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi.<ref name=\"green89\"/> Gandhi announced his ''satyagraha'' (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the [[Rowlatt Act]], to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for \"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial\".<ref name=minault68/>\n\nGandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the [[Khilafat movement]], wherein [[Sunni]] Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish [[Caliph]] as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (''[[ummah]]''). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of [[Ottoman Empire]] in World War I.<ref>Minault, Gail (1982) ''The Khilafat Movement Religious Symbolism and Political Mobilization in India'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-05072-0}}, pp. 4\u20138</ref><ref name=paine20/><ref name=ghosep161/> Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results.

Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the tax on salt in March 1930. Gandhi sent an ultimatum in the form of a polite letter to the viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, on 2 March. Gandhi condemned British rule in the letter, describing it as \"a curse\" that \"has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of progressive exploitation and by a ruinously expensive military and civil administration... It has reduced us politically to serfdom.\" Gandhi also mentioned in the letter that the viceroy received a salary \"over five thousand times India's average income.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=S R Bakshi|title=Gandhi and Gandhi and the Mass Movement|year= 1988|publisher= New Delhi|pages=133\u201334}}</ref> British violence, Gandhi promised, was going to be defeated by Indian non-violence.\n\nThis was highlighted by the Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where, together with 78 volunteers, he marched {{convert|388|km|mi}} from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself, with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws. The march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with Gandhi speaking to often huge crowds along the way. Thousands of Indians joined him in Dandi. On 5 May he was interned under a regulation dating from 1827 in anticipation of a protest that he had planned. The protest at Dharasana salt works on 21 May went ahead without its leader, Gandhi. A horrified American journalist, [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]], described the British response thus:\n\n{{quote|In complete silence the Gandhi men drew up and halted a hundred yards from the stockade. A picked column advanced from the crowd, waded the ditches and approached the barbed wire stockade... at a word of command, scores of native policemen rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads with their steel-shot lathis [long bamboo sticks].

The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.<ref name=\"Murali1985\"/>\n\nAccording to Dennis Dalton, it was the ideas that were responsible for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by \"brute force and immorality\", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by \"soul force and morality\".<ref name=dennis20/> Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning \"hate with love\".

After he returned to India, people flocked to him because he reflected their values.<ref name=dennis20/>\n\nGandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another.

The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.<ref name=\"Herman2008\">[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]] [https://books.google.com/?id=tquxD6dk914C&pg=PA375 pp. 375\u201377.]</ref>\n\nIn Britain, [[Winston Churchill]], a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans. Churchill often ridiculed Gandhi, saying in a widely reported 1931 speech:\n\n{{quote|It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace....to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.<ref name=\"Herman\">{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Gandhi & Churchill: The Epic Rivalry that Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C&pg=PA359|year=2008|publisher=Random House|page=359|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101071616/https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C&pg=PA359|archivedate=1 January 2016|df=dmy-all|isbn=9780553905045}}</ref>}}\n\nChurchill's bitterness against Gandhi grew in the 1930s.

He did not disagree with the party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.{{sfn|Gandhi|1990|p=246}}\n\nGandhi returned to active politics again in 1936, with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress. Although Gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about India's future, he did not restrain the Congress from adopting socialism as its goal. Gandhi had a clash with Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest.<ref>Ghose, Sankar (1992).

This, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism at the cost of other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships.<ref name=parekh5/> To Gandhi, states Parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital.

A [[:Category:Gandhians|Gandhian]] can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to, Gandhism.<ref name=\"Hardiman2001\"/> M. M. Sankhdher argues that Gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy. Rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view. It is an effort not to systematise wisdom but to transform society and is based on an undying faith in the goodness of human nature.<ref>Sankhdher, M. M. (1972), \"Gandhism: A Political Interpretation\", ''Gandhi Marg'', pp. 68\u201374.</ref> However Gandhi himself did not approve of the notion of \"Gandhism\", as he explained in 1936:\n{{quote|There is no such thing as \"Gandhism\", and I do not want to leave any sect after me. I do not claim to have originated any new principle or doctrine. I have simply tried in my own way to apply the eternal truths to our daily life and problems...The opinions I have formed and the conclusions I have arrived at are not final.

He set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending [[untouchability]], and above all for achieving ''[[Swaraj]]'' or self-rule.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maeleine Slade |first1=Mirabehn |title=Gleanings Gathered at Bapu's Feet |publisher=Navjivan publications |location=Ahmedabad |url=http://gandhiserve.org/e/information/questions_and_answers/faq5/faq5.htm |accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe same year Gandhi adopted the Indian loincloth, or short ''[[dhoti]]'' and, in the winter, a shawl, both woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional Indian spinning wheel, or ''[[Spinning wheel#Charkha|charkha]]'', as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. Thereafter, he lived modestly in a [[Sabarmati Ashram|self-sufficient residential community]], ate simple vegetarian food, and [[List of fasts undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi|undertook long fasts]] as a means of self-purification and political protest.

He tried to adopt \"English\" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he could not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry Salt's]] writing, he joined the [[Vegetarian Society|London Vegetarian Society]] and was elected to its executive committee<ref name=\"Brown1991\">[[#Brown1991|Brown (1991)]].</ref> under the aegis of its president and benefactor [[Arnold Hills]]. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a [[Bayswater]] chapter.<ref name=\"Tendulkar1951\" /> Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the [[Theosophical Society]], which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' both in translation as well as in the original.<ref name=\"Brown1991\"/>\n\nGandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued LVS membership of fellow committee member [[Thomas Allinson|Dr Thomas Allinson]]. Their disagreement is the first known example of Gandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.\n\nAllinson had been promoting [[Birth_control#Birth_control_movement|newly available birth control methods]], but Hills disapproved of these, believing they undermined public morality. He believed [[History_of_vegetarianism#19th_century|vegetarianism to be a moral movement]] and that Allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the LVS. Gandhi shared Hills views on the dangers of birth control, but defended Allinson's right to differ.<ref>Shyness my shield https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap18.htm</ref> \nIt would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and unlike Gandhi, highly eloquent. He bankrolled the LVS and was a [[captain of industry]] with his [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] company employing more than 6,000 people in the [[East End of London]]. He was also a highly accomplished sportsman who would go on to found the football club [[West Ham United]].\n\n{{quote| The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought it was quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the society<ref>From the essay \u2018shyness my shield\u2019 https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap18.htm</ref>}}\n\nA motion to remove Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee. Gandhi\u2019s shyness was an obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting. He wrote his views down on paper but shyness prevented him reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them out for him. Although some other members of the committee agreed with Gandhi, the vote was lost and Allinson excluded. There were no hard feelings, with Hills proposing the toast at the LVS farewell dinner in honour of Gandhi\u2019s return to India.<ref>From International Vegetarian Union website.

After several such incidents with [[White South African|Whites in South Africa]], Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights.

Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a \"parasite\", \"semi-barbarous\", \"canker\", \"squalid coolie\", \"yellow man\", and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.<ref name=\"Desai2015p26\"/>\n\nWhile in South Africa, Gandhi focused on racial persecution of Indians but ignored those of Africans. In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, his behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation.<ref name=\"Desai2015p26\"/> During a speech in September 1896, Gandhi complained that the whites in the British colony of South Africa were degrading Indian Hindus and Muslims to \"a level of [[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theprint.in/opinion/ramachandra-guha-is-wrong-a-middle-aged-gandhi-was-racist-and-no-mahatma/168222/|title=Ram Guha is wrong.

Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists' opinions that \"Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples\", and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans.<ref name=\"Herman 2008 pp. 88\"/>\n\nYears later, Gandhi and his colleagues served and helped Africans as nurses and by opposing racism, according to the Nobel Peace Prize winner [[Nelson Mandela]].

The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan.

The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were backed by the local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow [[Indigofera]], a cash crop for [[Indigo dye]] whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad.

A social boycott of ''mamlatdars'' and ''talatdars'' (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.<ref name=\"Brown1974\"/>\n\n====Khilafat movement====\n\n<blockquote>\nEvery revolution begins with a single act of defiance.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1919, following World War I, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the [[Ottoman Empire]] that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917\u201318. Gandhi had already supported the British crown with resources and by recruiting Indian soldiers to fight the war in Europe on the British side. This effort of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with ''swaraj'' (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I.<ref name=robbins133/> The British government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi.<ref name=\"green89\"/> Gandhi announced his ''satyagraha'' (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the [[Rowlatt Act]], to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for \"preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial\".<ref name=minault68/>\n\nGandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the [[Khilafat movement]], wherein [[Sunni]] Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish [[Caliph]] as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (''[[ummah]]''). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of [[Ottoman Empire]] in World War I.<ref>Minault, Gail (1982) ''The Khilafat Movement Religious Symbolism and Political Mobilization in India'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-05072-0}}, pp. 4\u20138</ref><ref name=paine20/><ref name=ghosep161/> Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results.

Gandhi led Congress celebrated 26 January 1930 as [[Independence Day (India)|India's Independence Day]] in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the tax on salt in March 1930. Gandhi sent an ultimatum in the form of a polite letter to the viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, on 2 March. Gandhi condemned British rule in the letter, describing it as \"a curse\" that \"has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of progressive exploitation and by a ruinously expensive military and civil administration... It has reduced us politically to serfdom.\" Gandhi also mentioned in the letter that the viceroy received a salary \"over five thousand times India's average income.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=S R Bakshi|title=Gandhi and Gandhi and the Mass Movement|year= 1988|publisher= New Delhi|pages=133\u201334}}</ref> British violence, Gandhi promised, was going to be defeated by Indian non-violence.\n\nThis was highlighted by the Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where, together with 78 volunteers, he marched {{convert|388|km|mi}} from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself, with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws. The march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with Gandhi speaking to often huge crowds along the way. Thousands of Indians joined him in Dandi. On 5 May he was interned under a regulation dating from 1827 in anticipation of a protest that he had planned. The protest at Dharasana salt works on 21 May went ahead without its leader, Gandhi. A horrified American journalist, [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]], described the British response thus:\n\n{{quote|In complete silence the Gandhi men drew up and halted a hundred yards from the stockade. A picked column advanced from the crowd, waded the ditches and approached the barbed wire stockade... at a word of command, scores of native policemen rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads with their steel-shot lathis [long bamboo sticks].

The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.<ref name=\"Murali1985\"/>\n\nAccording to Dennis Dalton, it was the ideas that were responsible for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by \"brute force and immorality\", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by \"soul force and morality\".<ref name=dennis20/> Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning \"hate with love\".

After he returned to India, people flocked to him because he reflected their values.<ref name=dennis20/>\n\nGandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used terminology and phrases such as ''[[Rama]]-rajya'' from ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Prahlada]] as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of ''swaraj'' and ''satyagraha''.<ref>{{cite book|author=S.

F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]], decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The [[Gandhi\u2013Irwin Pact]] was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.<ref name=\"Herman2008\">[[#Herman2008|Herman (2008)]] [https://books.google.com/?id=tquxD6dk914C&pg=PA375 pp. 375\u201377.]</ref>\n\nIn Britain, [[Winston Churchill]], a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans. Churchill often ridiculed Gandhi, saying in a widely reported 1931 speech:\n\n{{quote|It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace....to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.<ref name=\"Herman\">{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Gandhi & Churchill: The Epic Rivalry that Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C&pg=PA359|year=2008|publisher=Random House|page=359|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101071616/https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C&pg=PA359|archivedate=1 January 2016|df=dmy-all|isbn=9780553905045}}</ref>}}\n\nChurchill's bitterness against Gandhi grew in the 1930s. He called Gandhi as the one who was \"seditious in aim\" whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the British empire.

Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.{{sfn|Gandhi|1990|p=246}}\n\nGandhi returned to active politics again in 1936, with the Nehru presidency and the Lucknow session of the Congress.

This, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism at the cost of other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships.<ref name=parekh5/> To Gandhi, states Parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital.

A [[:Category:Gandhians|Gandhian]] can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to, Gandhism.<ref name=\"Hardiman2001\"/> M. M. Sankhdher argues that Gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy. Rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view. It is an effort not to systematise wisdom but to transform society and is based on an undying faith in the goodness of human nature.<ref>Sankhdher, M. M. (1972), \"Gandhism: A Political Interpretation\", ''Gandhi Marg'', pp. 68\u201374.</ref> However Gandhi himself did not approve of the notion of \"Gandhism\", as he explained in 1936:\n{{quote|There is no such thing as \"Gandhism\", and I do not want to leave any sect after me. I do not claim to have originated any new principle or doctrine. I have simply tried in my own way to apply the eternal truths to our daily life and problems...The opinions I have formed and the conclusions I have arrived at are not final.

Both Independents would caucus with the Democrats, forming a majority caucus with a combined total of 55 seats. \n\nAs of 2020, this is the last time Democrats won control of the Senate.\n\nThe [[2012 United States presidential election|presidential election]], [[2012 United States House of Representatives elections|elections to the House of Representatives]], [[2012 United States gubernatorial elections|elections for governors in 14 states and territories]], and many state and local elections were also held on the same day.\n\n== Milestones ==\n* This was the third consecutive election of [[Classes of United States Senators|Class 1]] senators where Democrats gained seats.\n* This was the third consecutive Senate election held in a presidential election year where the party belonging to the winning presidential candidate gained seats.\n* This was the first time since [[1936 United States Senate elections|1936]] where a Democratic presidential candidate who won a second term also had Senate coattails in both occasions (although Franklin Roosevelt won a third and fourth term in 1940 and 1944 respectively, he lost Senate seats on both occasions).\n* This was the first time since [[1964 United States Senate elections|1964]] in which either party had to defend more than two-thirds of the Senate seats up for grabs, but managed to make net gains.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/senate-races.html?pagewanted=all|title=Democrats Keep Control of the Senate|first=Jonathan |last=Weisman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203347104578101441741711334|title=Democrats Retain Control of U.S. Senate| first =Naftali |last=Bendavid|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Results summary ==\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:53%;\" | '''53'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent (US)/meta/color}}; color:black; width:2%;\" | '''2'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:45%;\" | '''45'''\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:53%\" | <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| style=\"width:2%\" | '''Independent'''\n| style=\"width:45%\" | <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\nShading indicates party with largest share of that line.\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n\n|-\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Parties\n| style=\"background-color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Independent Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Libertarian Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Independence Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Green Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Other Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n! rowspan=2 | Total\n\n|-\n!

However, in the last few weeks with new polls conducted it appeared as though Nelson was headed for a victory. The last poll place him 5 percentage points ahead of Mack. In fact Nelson would win easily by 13 percentage points. Nelson performed well in Southeast Florida (the Miami area), [[Tampa]], [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], typically Democratic areas. Nelson however managed to win in areas that lean Republican. For example, Nelson won in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] home of [[Jacksonville]], and [[Volusia County]] home of [[Daytona Beach]]. Nelson's ability to outperform President Obama led to him winning the Election easily. President Obama would still win [[Florida]], but by just about 74,000 votes, and less than a percentage point.

He had been elected in a [[2010 United States Senate special election in Massachusetts|special election in 2010]] following the death of incumbent Democrat [[Ted Kennedy]]. Brown faced no challengers from his own party. For the Democrats, an initial wide field of prospective candidates narrowed after the entry of [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Elizabeth Warren]], the architect of the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]. Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with all but one of the other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.\n\nThe election was one of the most-followed races in 2012 and cost approximately $82 million, which made it the most expensive election in Massachusetts history and the second-most expensive in the entire [[2012 United States elections|2012 election cycle]], next to [[2012 United States presidential election|that year's presidential election]]. This was despite the two candidates' having agreed not to allow [[Political action committee|outside money]] to influence the race. Opinion polling indicated a close race for much of the campaign, though Warren opened up a small but consistent lead in the final few weeks. She went on to defeat Brown by over 236,000 votes, 54% to 46%.\n\n[[Massachusetts Democratic Party|Democratic]] U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] was re-elected in [[2006 United States Senate election in Massachusetts|2006]], and died on August 25, 2009 from a [[malignant]] [[brain tumor]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Ted Kennedy Dies of Brain Cancer at Age 77 | date=August 26, 2009 | publisher=[[ABC News]] | url =http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TedKennedy/story?id=6692022 | access-date=August 26, 2009}}</ref> On September 24, 2009, [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Deval Patrick]] appointed longtime friend of Kennedy and former [[Democratic National Committee]] Chairman [[Paul G.

Casey, the incumbent, despite being seen as somewhat vulnerable, went into election night with most analysts thinking he would win. Casey would win by more than expected. This can be traced to several factors. Casey trounced Smith in [[Philadelphia County]] home of [[Philadelphia]]. Casey also won the surrounding collar counties of, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery, which are seen as vital in statewide elections in [[Pennsylvania]].

[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] had 21 seats up for election, plus 1 [[Independent (United States)|Independent]] and 1 [[Independent Democrat]], while the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] had only 10 seats up for election. The Democrats gained Republican-held seats in Massachusetts and Indiana and one from an Independent Democrat in Connecticut, leaving them with a total of 53 seats. Additionally, they held open seats in Hawaii, New Mexico, North Dakota, Virginia and Wisconsin. The Republicans, despite losing two of their seats, picked up an open seat in Nebraska and retained open seats in Arizona and Texas, ending with a total of 45 seats. The Independents retained a seat in Vermont and gained an additional seat from the Republicans in Maine, bringing their total to 2 seats. Both Independents would caucus with the Democrats, forming a majority caucus with a combined total of 55 seats. \n\nAs of 2020, this is the last time Democrats won control of the Senate.\n\nThe [[2012 United States presidential election|presidential election]], [[2012 United States House of Representatives elections|elections to the House of Representatives]], [[2012 United States gubernatorial elections|elections for governors in 14 states and territories]], and many state and local elections were also held on the same day.\n\n== Milestones ==\n* This was the third consecutive election of [[Classes of United States Senators|Class 1]] senators where Democrats gained seats.\n* This was the third consecutive Senate election held in a presidential election year where the party belonging to the winning presidential candidate gained seats.\n* This was the first time since [[1936 United States Senate elections|1936]] where a Democratic presidential candidate who won a second term also had Senate coattails in both occasions (although Franklin Roosevelt won a third and fourth term in 1940 and 1944 respectively, he lost Senate seats on both occasions).\n* This was the first time since [[1964 United States Senate elections|1964]] in which either party had to defend more than two-thirds of the Senate seats up for grabs, but managed to make net gains.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/senate-races.html?pagewanted=all|title=Democrats Keep Control of the Senate|first=Jonathan |last=Weisman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203347104578101441741711334|title=Democrats Retain Control of U.S. Senate| first =Naftali |last=Bendavid|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Results summary ==\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:53%;\" | '''53'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent (US)/meta/color}}; color:black; width:2%;\" | '''2'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:45%;\" | '''45'''\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:53%\" | <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| style=\"width:2%\" | '''Independent'''\n| style=\"width:45%\" | <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\nShading indicates party with largest share of that line.\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n\n|-\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Parties\n| style=\"background-color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Independent Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Libertarian Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Independence Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Green Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n| style=\"background-color:{{Other Party (US)/meta/color}}\" |\n! rowspan=2 | Total\n\n|-\n!

For example, Nelson won in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] home of [[Jacksonville]], and [[Volusia County]] home of [[Daytona Beach]]. Nelson's ability to outperform President Obama led to him winning the Election easily. President Obama would still win [[Florida]], but by just about 74,000 votes, and less than a percentage point.

He had been elected in a [[2010 United States Senate special election in Massachusetts|special election in 2010]] following the death of incumbent Democrat [[Ted Kennedy]]. Brown faced no challengers from his own party. For the Democrats, an initial wide field of prospective candidates narrowed after the entry of [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Elizabeth Warren]], the architect of the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]. Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with all but one of the other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.\n\nThe election was one of the most-followed races in 2012 and cost approximately $82 million, which made it the most expensive election in Massachusetts history and the second-most expensive in the entire [[2012 United States elections|2012 election cycle]], next to [[2012 United States presidential election|that year's presidential election]]. This was despite the two candidates' having agreed not to allow [[Political action committee|outside money]] to influence the race. Opinion polling indicated a close race for much of the campaign, though Warren opened up a small but consistent lead in the final few weeks. She went on to defeat Brown by over 236,000 votes, 54% to 46%.\n\n[[Massachusetts Democratic Party|Democratic]] U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] was re-elected in [[2006 United States Senate election in Massachusetts|2006]], and died on August 25, 2009 from a [[malignant]] [[brain tumor]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Ted Kennedy Dies of Brain Cancer at Age 77 | date=August 26, 2009 | publisher=[[ABC News]] | url =http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/TedKennedy/story?id=6692022 | access-date=August 26, 2009}}</ref> On September 24, 2009, [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Deval Patrick]] appointed longtime friend of Kennedy and former [[Democratic National Committee]] Chairman [[Paul G.

The Democratic primary was not heavily contested. Incumbent Bob Casey, Jr., defeated Joseph Vodvarka by a wide margin.

Additionally, Republicans had controlled the [[Pennsylvania Senate|State Senate]] since 1995, while Democrats assumed control of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives|State House]] following the [[2006 Pennsylvania House of Representatives elections|2006 election]], only to lose control in the [[2010 Pennsylvania House of Representatives elections|2010 election]], though the Democrats had won the state in every presidential election from [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] to [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]].\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n | title      = Pennsylvania Democratic primary<ref name=primaryreturns>{{cite web|title=2012 General Primary: United States Senator|url=http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=13&ElectionID=45&OfficeID=2|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of State|accessdate=April 25, 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n | candidate  = Bob Casey, Jr. (Incumbent)\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | votes      = 565,488\n | percentage = 80.9%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | candidate  = Joseph Vodvarka\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | votes      = 133,683\n | percentage = 19.1%\n}}\n{{Election box total no change\n | votes      = 699,171\n | percentage = 100.0%\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nDespite many predictions of a close race, the election was not close.

Casey also won the surrounding collar counties of, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery, which are seen as vital in statewide elections in [[Pennsylvania]]. Casey also performed well in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] home of [[Pittsburgh]]. Casey also performed well in Erie. Casey also performed strongly in the [[Scranton]] area.

Hanway was also instrumental in establishing the [[Magdalen Hospital]] to rehabilitate [[prostitute]]s. These organizations were funded by subscription and run as voluntary associations. They raised public awareness of their activities through the emerging popular press and were generally held{{by whom|date=September 2018}} in high social regard - some charities received state recognition in the form of the [[royal charter]].\n\nCharities also began to adopt campaigning roles, where they would champion a cause and lobby the government for legislative change. This included organized campaigns against the ill treatment of animals and children and the campaign that eventually succeeded at the turn of the 19th century in ending the [[slave trade]] throughout the [[British Empire]] and within its considerable sphere of influence. (This process was however a lengthy one, which finally concluded when Saudi Arabia abolished slavery in 1962.)\n\nThe Enlightenment also saw growing philosophical debate between those who championed state intervention and those who believed that [[private charities]] should provide welfare. The Reverend [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766-1834), the political economist, criticized [[poor relief]] for paupers on economic and moral grounds and proposed leaving charity entirely to the private sector.<ref>{{cite book |author= T.

The [[Labourer's Friend Society]], chaired by [[Lord Shaftesbury]] in the United Kingdom in 1830, aimed to improve working-class conditions. It promoted, for example, the allotment of land to labourers for \"cottage husbandry\" that later became the [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]] movement. In 1844 it became the first [[Model Dwellings Company]] - one of a group of organizations that sought to improve the housing conditions of the working classes by building new homes for them, at the same time receiving a competitive rate of return on any investment. This was one of the first [[housing association]]s, a philanthropic endeavour that flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century brought about by the growth of the [[middle class]]. Later associations included the [[Peabody Trust]] (originating in 1862) and the [[Guinness Trust]] (founded in 1890). The principle of philanthropic intention with capitalist return was given{{by whom|date=September 2018}} the label \"five per cent philanthropy\".<ref name=Tarn>Tarn, J.N.

''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine cartoon by [[Louis Dalrymple]], 1903.]]\nThere was strong growth in municipal charities. The Brougham Commission led on to the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which reorganized multiple local charities by incorporating them into single entities under supervision from [[local government]].\n\nCharities at the time, including the [[Charity Organization Society]] (established in 1869) tended to discriminate between the \"deserving poor\" who would be provided with suitable relief and the \"underserving\" or \"improvident poor\" who were regarded{{by whom|date=September 2018}} as the cause of their own woes through their idleness. Charities tended to oppose the provision of welfare by the state, due to the perceived [[moral hazard|demoralizing effect]]. Although minimal state involvement was the dominant philosophy of the period, there was still significant government involvement in the shape of statutory regulation and even limited funding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stgeorgeintheeast.withtank.com/|title=st george-in-the-east - St George-in-the-East PCC - Charity Number 1133761|website=stgeorgeintheeast.withtank.com|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n[[Philanthropy]] became a very fashionable activity among the expanding middle classes in Britain and America. [[Octavia Hill]] (1838-1912) and [[John Ruskin]] (1819-1900) were an important force behind the development of [[social housing]], and [[Andrew Carnegie]] (1835-1919) exemplified the large-scale philanthropy of the newly rich in industrialized America.

In 2002, the federal government established an inquiry into the definition of a charity. The inquiry proposed a statutory definition of a charity, based on the principles developed through case law. This resulted in the ''Charities Bill 2003'', which included limitations on involvement of charities in political campaigning, which many charities saw as an unwelcome departure from the case law. The government appointed a Board of Taxation inquiry to consult with charities on the bill. As a result of widespread criticism from charities, the government abandoned the bill.\n\nThe government then introduced what became the ''Extension of Charitable Purpose Act 2004'', which did not attempt to codify the definition of a charitable purpose, but merely sought to clarify that certain purposes were charitable, whose charitable status had been subject to legal doubts. These purposes included childcare, self-help groups, and closed/contemplative religious orders.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd164.pdf| title=Extension of Charitable Purpose Bill 2004 (Bills Digest, no. 164, 2003-04)| publisher=Department of Parliamentary Services| location=Australia| accessdate=2009-07-25| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329054436/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd164.pdf| archivedate=2009-03-29}}</ref>\n\nTo publicly raise funds, a charity in Australia must register in each Australian jurisdiction in which it intends to raise funds.

In ''Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v. Pemsel'' (1891), Lord McNaughten identified four categories of charity which could be extracted from the Charitable Uses Act and which were the accepted definition of charity prior to the Charities Act 2006.\n# the relief of [[poverty]],\n# the advancement of [[education]],\n# the advancement of [[religion]], and\n# other purposes considered beneficial to the community.\n\nCharities in England and Wales \u2013 such as Age UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ([[RSPB]]) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rspb.org.uk/|title=The RSPB Wildlife Charity: Nature Reserves & Wildlife Conservation|website=The RSPB|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> and the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals ([[RSPCA]]) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rspca.org.uk|title=Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals - RSPCA|author=|date=|website=RSPCA.org.uk|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> \u2013 must comply with the 2011 Act regulating matters such as charity reports and accounts and fundraising.\n\n=====Structures=====\n{{As of|2011}}, there are a number of types of legal structure for a charity in England and Wales.\n* Unincorporated association\n* Trust\n* Company limited by guarantee\n* Another incorporation, such as by royal charter\n* [[Charitable incorporated organization]]\n\nThe [[unincorporated association]] is the most common form of organization within the voluntary sector in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seniorsnetwork.co.uk/constitution/unincorporated.htm/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=Seniors Network - Unincorporated Association |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014307/http://www.seniorsnetwork.co.uk/constitution/unincorporated.htm |archivedate=April 23, 2008 }}</ref> This is essentially a contractual arrangement between individuals who have agreed to come together to form an organization for a particular purpose. An unincorporated association will normally have as its governing document a constitution or set of rules, which will deal with such matters as the appointment of office bearers, and the rules governing membership. The organization is not though a separate legal entity, so it cannot start legal action, it cannot borrow money, and it cannot enter into contracts in its own name. Its officers can be personally liable if the charity is sued or has debts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/askncvo/index.asp?id=107/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=NCVO - Legal structures for voluntary organizations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206100622/http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/askncvo/index.asp?id=107%2F |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nA [[Trust law|trust]] is essentially a relationship among three parties: the donor of some assets, the trustees who hold the assets, and the beneficiaries (those people who are eligible to benefit from the charity). When the trust has charitable purposes, and is a charity, the trust is known as a charitable trust. The governing document is the trust deed or declaration of trust, which comes into operation once it is signed by all the trustees. The main disadvantage of a trust is that, as with an unincorporated association, it does not have a separate legal entity and the trustees must themselves own property and enter into contracts. The trustees are also liable if the charity is sued or incurs liability.\n\nA company limited by guarantee is a private limited company where the liability of members is limited. A guarantee company does not have a share capital, but instead has members who are guarantors instead of shareholders. In the event of the company being wound up, the members agree to pay a nominal sum which can be as little as \u00a31. A company limited by guarantee is a useful structure for a charity where it is desirable for the trustees to have the protection of limited liability. Also, the charity has legal personality, and so can enter into contracts, such as employment contracts in its own name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsgo.com/guaranteecompany.asp/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=Guarantee Company - Not for Profit Companies - Charities |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915081559/http://www.sfsgo.com/guaranteecompany.asp |archivedate=September 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA small number of charities are incorporated by [[royal charter]], a document which creates a corporation with legal personality (or, in some instances, transforms a charity incorporated as a company into a charity incorporated by royal charter). The charter must be approved by the [[Privy Council]] before receiving royal assent. Although the nature of the charity will vary depending on the clauses enacted, generally a royal charter will offer a charity the same limited liability as a company and the ability to enter into contracts.\n\nThe Charities Act 2006 legislated for a new legal form of incorporation designed specifically for charities, the [[charitable incorporated organization]], with powers similar to a company but without the need to register as a company. Becoming a CIO was only made possible in 2013, with staggered introduction dates, with the charities with highest turnover eligible first.\n\nThe word ''foundation'' is not generally used in England and Wales. Occasionally, a charity will use the word as part of its name, e.g. [[British Heart Foundation]], but this has no legal significance and does not provide any information about either the work of the charity or how it is legally structured.

These include reliefs and exemptions in relation to income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, stamp duty land tax and value added tax.  These tax exemptions have led to criticisms that private schools are able to use charitable status as a [[tax avoidance]] technique rather than because they offer a genuine charitable good.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sparrow|first=Andrew|title=Labour could strip private schools of charitable status, says Stephen Twigg|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jul/19/twigg-private-schools-lose-charitable-status|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], a charitable organization is an organization operated for purposes that are beneficial to the [[public interest]].<ref name=\"IRS document P557\"/> There are different types of charitable organizations. Every U.S. and foreign charity that qualifies as [[tax-exempt]] under Section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] is considered a \"[[private foundation]]\" ''unless'' it demonstrates to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] that it falls into another category. Generally, any organization that is not a private foundation (i.e.,&nbsp;it qualifies as something else) is usually a public charity as described in Section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.<ref name=fdncenFAQ>FoundationCenter.org, [http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/faqs/html/pfandpc.html What is the difference between a private foundation and a public charity?], accessed 2009-06-20</ref>\n\nIn addition, a private foundation usually derives its principal funding from an individual, family, corporation, or some other single source and is more often than not a [[grantmaker]] and does not solicit funds from the public. In contrast, a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] or public charity generally receives grants from individuals, government, and private foundations, and while some public charities engage in [[grantmaking]] activities, most conduct direct service or other tax-exempt activities. Foundations that are generally grantmakers (i.e. they use their [[Financial endowment|endowment]] to make grants to other organizations, which in turn carry out the goals of the foundation indirectly) are usually called \"grantmaker\" or \"non-operating\" foundations.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe requirements and procedures for forming charitable organizations vary from state to state, as do the registration and filing requirements for charitable organizations that conduct charitable activities, solicit charitable contributions, or hire professional fundraisers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasconet.org |title=NASCO National Association of State Charity Officials|access-date=2008-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/authority/attorney-general-charities.php |title=U.S. List of Charitable Solicitation Authorities by State |access-date=2014-01-27}}</ref> In practice, the detailed definition of \"charitable organization\" is determined by the requirements of state law where the charitable organization operates, and the requirements for federal tax relief by the IRS.\n\nResources exist to provide information, even rankings, of US charities.<ref>Adriene Hill, \"[http://www.marketplace.org/topics/your-money/worst-charities-get-information-you-make-donation The worst charities: Get information before you make a donation]\", ''Marketplace'', [[NPR]], June 14, 2013</ref>\n\n====Federal tax relief====\nFederal tax law provides tax benefits to nonprofit organizations recognized as exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The benefits of 501(c)(3) status include exemption from federal income tax as well as eligibility to receive tax deductible charitable contributions. To qualify for 501(c)(3) status most organizations must apply to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for such status.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4220.pdf |title=Applying for 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status: Publication P4220|accessdate=|publisher = IRS|date = March 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeveral requirements must be met for a charitable organization to obtain 501(c)(3) status. These include the organization being organized as a corporation, trust, or unincorporated association, and the organization's organizing document (such as the articles of incorporation, trust documents, or articles of association) must limit its purposes to being charitable, and permanently dedicate its assets to charitable purposes. The organization must refrain from undertaking a number of other activities such as participating in the political campaigns of candidates for local, state or federal office, and must ensure that its earnings do not benefit any individual.<ref name=\"IRS document P557\"/>  Most tax exempt organizations are required to file annual financial reports ([[IRS Form 990]]) at the state and federal level. A tax exempt organization's 990 and some other forms are required to be made available to public scrutiny.\n\nThe types of charitable organization that are considered by the IRS to be organized for the public benefit include those that are organized for:\n* Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged\n* Advancement of religion\n* Advancement of education or science\n* Construction or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works\n* Lessening the burdens of government\n* Lessening of neighborhood tensions\n* Elimination of prejudice and discrimination\n* Defense of human and civil rights secured by law\n* Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.<ref name=\"IRS document P557\">\"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf Publication 557: Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization]\".

Both Christianity and Islam incorporated significant charitable elements from their very beginnings<ref>Note for example Acts 2:44-45: \"And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.\" ''Zak\u0101t'' (charity) ranks as one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]].</ref> and ''d\u0101na'' (alms-giving) has a long tradition in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Charities provided education, health, housing and even prisons. Almshouses were established throughout [[Europe]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]] to provide a place of residence for poor, old and distressed people; [[Athelstan of England|King Athelstan]] of England (reigned 924-939) founded the first recorded almshouse in [[York]] in the 10th century.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.almshouses.org/history/historical-summary/ |title= The Almshouse Association: A Historical Summary |access-date= 2013-10-09 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130825175919/http://www.almshouses.org/history/historical-summary/ |archive-date= 2013-08-25 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n===Enlightenment charity===\n[[File:Foundling Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Foundling Hospital. The building has been demolished.]]\nIn the [[Enlightenment era]] charitable and [[philanthropy|philanthropic activity]] among [[voluntary association]]s and rich benefactors became a widespread cultural practice. Societies, [[gentleman's club]]s, and [[Mutual organization|mutual associations]] began to flourish in [[England]], and the upper-classes increasingly adopted a philanthropic attitude toward the disadvantaged. In England this new social activism was channeled into the establishment of charitable organizations; these proliferated from the middle of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.londonlives.org/static/AssociationalCharities.jsp |title= Associational Charities | quote = Through the middle decades of the eighteenth century a slew of new-style charities were created.

[[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[Thomas Coram]], appalled by the number of abandoned children living on the streets of  [[London]], set up the [[Foundling Hospital]] in 1741 to look after these unwanted orphans in Lamb's Conduit Fields, [[Bloomsbury]]. This, the first such charity in the world,<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.thedorsetpage.com/people/thomas_coram.htm|title= Thomas Coram (1688-1751)|access-date= 2013-10-09|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161225110032/http://www.thedorsetpage.com/people/thomas_coram.htm|archive-date= 2016-12-25|url-status= dead}}</ref> served as the precedent for incorporated associational charities in general.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.victorianweb.org/history/orphanages/coram1.html|title= Captain Coram and the Foundling Hospital | quote = The result was the first children's charity in the country, and one that 'set the pattern for incorporated associational charities' in general (McClure 248).}}</ref>\n\n[[Jonas Hanway]], another notable philanthropist of the Enlightenment era, established [[The Marine Society]] in 1756 as the first seafarer's charity, in a bid to aid the recruitment of men to the [[Royal Navy|navy]].<ref>[[N. A. M. Rodger]], ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649-1815'' (New York: W.W. Norton & Company: 2004), 313.</ref> By 1763 the Society had recruited over 10,000 men; an [[Act of Parliament]] incorporated it in 1772. Hanway was also instrumental in establishing the [[Magdalen Hospital]] to rehabilitate [[prostitute]]s. These organizations were funded by subscription and run as voluntary associations. They raised public awareness of their activities through the emerging popular press and were generally held{{by whom|date=September 2018}} in high social regard - some charities received state recognition in the form of the [[royal charter]].\n\nCharities also began to adopt campaigning roles, where they would champion a cause and lobby the government for legislative change. This included organized campaigns against the ill treatment of animals and children and the campaign that eventually succeeded at the turn of the 19th century in ending the [[slave trade]] throughout the [[British Empire]] and within its considerable sphere of influence. (This process was however a lengthy one, which finally concluded when Saudi Arabia abolished slavery in 1962.)\n\nThe Enlightenment also saw growing philosophical debate between those who championed state intervention and those who believed that [[private charities]] should provide welfare. The Reverend [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766-1834), the political economist, criticized [[poor relief]] for paupers on economic and moral grounds and proposed leaving charity entirely to the private sector.<ref>{{cite book |author= T.

The [[Labourer's Friend Society]], chaired by [[Lord Shaftesbury]] in the United Kingdom in 1830, aimed to improve working-class conditions. It promoted, for example, the allotment of land to labourers for \"cottage husbandry\" that later became the [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]] movement. In 1844 it became the first [[Model Dwellings Company]] - one of a group of organizations that sought to improve the housing conditions of the working classes by building new homes for them, at the same time receiving a competitive rate of return on any investment. This was one of the first [[housing association]]s, a philanthropic endeavour that flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century brought about by the growth of the [[middle class]]. Later associations included the [[Peabody Trust]] (originating in 1862) and the [[Guinness Trust]] (founded in 1890). The principle of philanthropic intention with capitalist return was given{{by whom|date=September 2018}} the label \"five per cent philanthropy\".<ref name=Tarn>Tarn, J.N.

''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine cartoon by [[Louis Dalrymple]], 1903.]]\nThere was strong growth in municipal charities. The Brougham Commission led on to the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which reorganized multiple local charities by incorporating them into single entities under supervision from [[local government]].\n\nCharities at the time, including the [[Charity Organization Society]] (established in 1869) tended to discriminate between the \"deserving poor\" who would be provided with suitable relief and the \"underserving\" or \"improvident poor\" who were regarded{{by whom|date=September 2018}} as the cause of their own woes through their idleness. Charities tended to oppose the provision of welfare by the state, due to the perceived [[moral hazard|demoralizing effect]]. Although minimal state involvement was the dominant philosophy of the period, there was still significant government involvement in the shape of statutory regulation and even limited funding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stgeorgeintheeast.withtank.com/|title=st george-in-the-east - St George-in-the-East PCC - Charity Number 1133761|website=stgeorgeintheeast.withtank.com|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n[[Philanthropy]] became a very fashionable activity among the expanding middle classes in Britain and America. [[Octavia Hill]] (1838-1912) and [[John Ruskin]] (1819-1900) were an important force behind the development of [[social housing]], and [[Andrew Carnegie]] (1835-1919) exemplified the large-scale philanthropy of the newly rich in industrialized America.

In 2002, the federal government established an inquiry into the definition of a charity. The inquiry proposed a statutory definition of a charity, based on the principles developed through case law. This resulted in the ''Charities Bill 2003'', which included limitations on involvement of charities in political campaigning, which many charities saw as an unwelcome departure from the case law. The government appointed a Board of Taxation inquiry to consult with charities on the bill. As a result of widespread criticism from charities, the government abandoned the bill.\n\nThe government then introduced what became the ''Extension of Charitable Purpose Act 2004'', which did not attempt to codify the definition of a charitable purpose, but merely sought to clarify that certain purposes were charitable, whose charitable status had been subject to legal doubts. These purposes included childcare, self-help groups, and closed/contemplative religious orders.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd164.pdf| title=Extension of Charitable Purpose Bill 2004 (Bills Digest, no. 164, 2003-04)| publisher=Department of Parliamentary Services| location=Australia| accessdate=2009-07-25| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329054436/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd164.pdf| archivedate=2009-03-29}}</ref>\n\nTo publicly raise funds, a charity in Australia must register in each Australian jurisdiction in which it intends to raise funds.

In ''Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v. Pemsel'' (1891), Lord McNaughten identified four categories of charity which could be extracted from the Charitable Uses Act and which were the accepted definition of charity prior to the Charities Act 2006.\n# the relief of [[poverty]],\n# the advancement of [[education]],\n# the advancement of [[religion]], and\n# other purposes considered beneficial to the community.\n\nCharities in England and Wales \u2013 such as Age UK, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ([[RSPB]]) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rspb.org.uk/|title=The RSPB Wildlife Charity: Nature Reserves & Wildlife Conservation|website=The RSPB|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> and the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals ([[RSPCA]]) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rspca.org.uk|title=Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals - RSPCA|author=|date=|website=RSPCA.org.uk|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref> \u2013 must comply with the 2011 Act regulating matters such as charity reports and accounts and fundraising.\n\n=====Structures=====\n{{As of|2011}}, there are a number of types of legal structure for a charity in England and Wales.\n* Unincorporated association\n* Trust\n* Company limited by guarantee\n* Another incorporation, such as by royal charter\n* [[Charitable incorporated organization]]\n\nThe [[unincorporated association]] is the most common form of organization within the voluntary sector in England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seniorsnetwork.co.uk/constitution/unincorporated.htm/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=Seniors Network - Unincorporated Association |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014307/http://www.seniorsnetwork.co.uk/constitution/unincorporated.htm |archivedate=April 23, 2008 }}</ref> This is essentially a contractual arrangement between individuals who have agreed to come together to form an organization for a particular purpose. An unincorporated association will normally have as its governing document a constitution or set of rules, which will deal with such matters as the appointment of office bearers, and the rules governing membership. The organization is not though a separate legal entity, so it cannot start legal action, it cannot borrow money, and it cannot enter into contracts in its own name. Its officers can be personally liable if the charity is sued or has debts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/askncvo/index.asp?id=107/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=NCVO - Legal structures for voluntary organizations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206100622/http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/askncvo/index.asp?id=107%2F |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nA [[Trust law|trust]] is essentially a relationship among three parties: the donor of some assets, the trustees who hold the assets, and the beneficiaries (those people who are eligible to benefit from the charity). When the trust has charitable purposes, and is a charity, the trust is known as a charitable trust. The governing document is the trust deed or declaration of trust, which comes into operation once it is signed by all the trustees. The main disadvantage of a trust is that, as with an unincorporated association, it does not have a separate legal entity and the trustees must themselves own property and enter into contracts. The trustees are also liable if the charity is sued or incurs liability.\n\nA company limited by guarantee is a private limited company where the liability of members is limited. A guarantee company does not have a share capital, but instead has members who are guarantors instead of shareholders. In the event of the company being wound up, the members agree to pay a nominal sum which can be as little as \u00a31. A company limited by guarantee is a useful structure for a charity where it is desirable for the trustees to have the protection of limited liability. Also, the charity has legal personality, and so can enter into contracts, such as employment contracts in its own name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsgo.com/guaranteecompany.asp/ |access-date=2008-08-24 |title=Guarantee Company - Not for Profit Companies - Charities |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915081559/http://www.sfsgo.com/guaranteecompany.asp |archivedate=September 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA small number of charities are incorporated by [[royal charter]], a document which creates a corporation with legal personality (or, in some instances, transforms a charity incorporated as a company into a charity incorporated by royal charter). The charter must be approved by the [[Privy Council]] before receiving royal assent. Although the nature of the charity will vary depending on the clauses enacted, generally a royal charter will offer a charity the same limited liability as a company and the ability to enter into contracts.\n\nThe Charities Act 2006 legislated for a new legal form of incorporation designed specifically for charities, the [[charitable incorporated organization]], with powers similar to a company but without the need to register as a company. Becoming a CIO was only made possible in 2013, with staggered introduction dates, with the charities with highest turnover eligible first.\n\nThe word ''foundation'' is not generally used in England and Wales. Occasionally, a charity will use the word as part of its name, e.g. [[British Heart Foundation]], but this has no legal significance and does not provide any information about either the work of the charity or how it is legally structured. The structure of the organization will be one of the types of structure described above.\n\n=====Registration=====\nCharitable organizations that have an income of more than \u00a35,000, and for whom the law of England and Wales applies, must register with the [[Charity Commission|Charity Commission for England and Wales]], unless they are an \"exempt\" or \"excepted\" charity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exempt-charities-cc23|title=Exempt charities (CC23)|work=www.gov.uk |date = 1 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excepted-charities|title=Excepted charities|work=www.gov.uk|date = 11 June 2014}}</ref> For companies, the law of England and Wales will normally apply if the company itself is registered in England and Wales.

It can, however, register as a charity with [[HM Revenue and Customs]] for tax purposes only.  With the rise in mandatory registration level, to \u00a35,000 by The Charities Act 2006, smaller charities can be reliant upon HMRC recognition to evidence their charitable purpose and confirm their not-for-profit principles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/charities/tax/recognition.htm|title=Charities and tax|work=hmrc.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nSome charities which are called [[Exempt charity|exempt charities]] are not required to register with the Charity Commission and are not subject to any of the Charity Commission's supervisory powers. These charities include most universities and national museums and some other educational institutions. Other charities are excepted from the need to register, but are still subject to the supervision of the Charity Commission. The regulations on excepted charities have however been changed by the Charities Act 2006.

These include reliefs and exemptions in relation to income tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, stamp duty land tax and value added tax.  These tax exemptions have led to criticisms that private schools are able to use charitable status as a [[tax avoidance]] technique rather than because they offer a genuine charitable good.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sparrow|first=Andrew|title=Labour could strip private schools of charitable status, says Stephen Twigg|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jul/19/twigg-private-schools-lose-charitable-status|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], a charitable organization is an organization operated for purposes that are beneficial to the [[public interest]].<ref name=\"IRS document P557\"/> There are different types of charitable organizations. Every U.S. and foreign charity that qualifies as [[tax-exempt]] under Section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] is considered a \"[[private foundation]]\" ''unless'' it demonstrates to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] that it falls into another category. Generally, any organization that is not a private foundation (i.e.,&nbsp;it qualifies as something else) is usually a public charity as described in Section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.<ref name=fdncenFAQ>FoundationCenter.org, [http://foundationcenter.org/getstarted/faqs/html/pfandpc.html What is the difference between a private foundation and a public charity?], accessed 2009-06-20</ref>\n\nIn addition, a private foundation usually derives its principal funding from an individual, family, corporation, or some other single source and is more often than not a [[grantmaker]] and does not solicit funds from the public. In contrast, a [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] or public charity generally receives grants from individuals, government, and private foundations, and while some public charities engage in [[grantmaking]] activities, most conduct direct service or other tax-exempt activities. Foundations that are generally grantmakers (i.e. they use their [[Financial endowment|endowment]] to make grants to other organizations, which in turn carry out the goals of the foundation indirectly) are usually called \"grantmaker\" or \"non-operating\" foundations.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe requirements and procedures for forming charitable organizations vary from state to state, as do the registration and filing requirements for charitable organizations that conduct charitable activities, solicit charitable contributions, or hire professional fundraisers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasconet.org |title=NASCO National Association of State Charity Officials|access-date=2008-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/authority/attorney-general-charities.php |title=U.S. List of Charitable Solicitation Authorities by State |access-date=2014-01-27}}</ref> In practice, the detailed definition of \"charitable organization\" is determined by the requirements of state law where the charitable organization operates, and the requirements for federal tax relief by the IRS.\n\nResources exist to provide information, even rankings, of US charities.<ref>Adriene Hill, \"[http://www.marketplace.org/topics/your-money/worst-charities-get-information-you-make-donation The worst charities: Get information before you make a donation]\", ''Marketplace'', [[NPR]], June 14, 2013</ref>\n\n====Federal tax relief====\nFederal tax law provides tax benefits to nonprofit organizations recognized as exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The benefits of 501(c)(3) status include exemption from federal income tax as well as eligibility to receive tax deductible charitable contributions. To qualify for 501(c)(3) status most organizations must apply to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for such status.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4220.pdf |title=Applying for 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status: Publication P4220|accessdate=|publisher = IRS|date = March 2018}}</ref>\n\nSeveral requirements must be met for a charitable organization to obtain 501(c)(3) status. These include the organization being organized as a corporation, trust, or unincorporated association, and the organization's organizing document (such as the articles of incorporation, trust documents, or articles of association) must limit its purposes to being charitable, and permanently dedicate its assets to charitable purposes. The organization must refrain from undertaking a number of other activities such as participating in the political campaigns of candidates for local, state or federal office, and must ensure that its earnings do not benefit any individual.<ref name=\"IRS document P557\"/>  Most tax exempt organizations are required to file annual financial reports ([[IRS Form 990]]) at the state and federal level. A tax exempt organization's 990 and some other forms are required to be made available to public scrutiny.\n\nThe types of charitable organization that are considered by the IRS to be organized for the public benefit include those that are organized for:\n* Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged\n* Advancement of religion\n* Advancement of education or science\n* Construction or maintenance of public buildings, monuments, or works\n* Lessening the burdens of government\n* Lessening of neighborhood tensions\n* Elimination of prejudice and discrimination\n* Defense of human and civil rights secured by law\n* Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.<ref name=\"IRS document P557\">\"[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf Publication 557: Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization]\".
