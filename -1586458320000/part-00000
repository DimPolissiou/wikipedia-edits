At the end of the day, we couldn't get the schedule to work... so, regrettably, I never got to screen test, I never got to put the suit on.\" Upon completion of filming for season four of ''True Blood'', he shot an episode of [[USA Network|USA]]'s ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'' with his former drama school classmate [[Matt Bomer]], and then shot the film adaptation of the best selling book ''[[What to Expect When You're Expecting (film)|What To Expect When You're Expecting]]'' before returning to Los Angeles to shoot an episode of ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' with [[Ashton Kutcher]].\n\n===''Magic Mike''===\nManganiello was cast as Big Dick Richie in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Magic Mike]]'', the story of a young stripper in [[Tampa]], [[Florida]], played by actor [[Channing Tatum]]. ''Magic Mike'' would go on to become a cultural and box office phenomenon spawning its 2015 sequel ''[[Magic Mike XXL]]''.\n\nIn between ''Magic Mike'' films and finishing out his last two seasons of ''True Blood'', Manganiello branched out in a multitude of different ways. He shot [[David Ayer]]'s ''[[Sabotage (2014 film)|Sabotage]]'' with his childhood idol [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who would go on to become a friend and mentor to Manganiello, penning the foreword to his book ''Evolution'' which was released through Simon & Schuster's Gallery Books in the fall of 2013. That autumn also saw Manganiello's return to the stage once again as [[Stanley Kowalski]] ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' but this time for the prestigious [[Yale Repertory Theater]] in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nA few months later Manganiello would take his documentary film ''La Bare'', which he financed, directed, and produced under his new production company banner 3:59 with his brother Nick, to Park City, Utah for the [[Slamdance Film Festival]]. He received multiple offers from distributors in the lobby after the first screening and within 24 hours sold the International and Domestic rights, including sales to [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and [[Netflix]]. Manganiello was given the Triple Threat Award, from the Maui International Film Festival later that year for his work on the film.\n\n===After ''True Blood''===\n\nIn August 2016, test footage of [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson/Deathstroke]] on the set of some unnamed film was posted to Twitter by [[Ben Affleck]]. In September 2016, [[Geoff Johns]], who was DC Comics' President and CCO, and who is signed on to both co-run the DCEU and co-write/co-produce the solo Batman film with Affleck, confirmed that Deathstroke will appear in the shared film universe, with Manganiello portraying the character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/09/08/joe-manganiello-will-play-deathstroke-in-ben-afflecks-batman-movie/ |title=Joe Manganiello Will Play Deathstroke in Ben Affleck\u2019s Batman Movie - Speakeasy - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2016-09-08 |accessdate=2019-01-15}}</ref> It has since been confirmed that he will appear in the Ben Affleck Batman movie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/09/09/joe-manganiello-will-play-batman-villain-deathstroke-which-could-transform-his-career/|title=Joe Manganiello will play Batman villain Deathstroke, which could transform his career - The Washington Post|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Manganiello won an Emmy as the narrator of the documentary ''Pittsburgh is Home: The Story of the Penguins'', which documented the first 50 years of history of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] hockey team.\n\n==Personal life==\nManganiello is a fan of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the [[Wests Tigers]].<ref name=\"Cousins\">{{Cite news |first=Wayne |last=Cousins |title=Joe Manganiello finds plenty to cheer about |date=July 2013 |magazine=Nil |url=http://www.weststigers.com.au/news-display/Joe-Manganiello-finds-plenty-to-cheer-about/80598 |accessdate=August 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805055038/http://www.weststigers.com.au/news-display/Joe-Manganiello-finds-plenty-to-cheer-about/80598 |archivedate=August 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He directed and produced the 2007 short documentary ''DieHardz'' about Steelers fans who meet up at bars in [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref name=\"Randall\">{{Cite news |first=Reese |last=Randall |title=Not Your Average Joe |date=June 2010 |magazine=[[Pittsburgh Magazine]] |url=http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Pittsburgh-Magazine/June-2010/Not-Your-Average-Joe/ |accessdate=June 25, 2010 }}</ref> Manganiello is also a noted [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] fan and hosted the 2017 NHL Awards and the [[2017 NHL Expansion Draft]].<ref>[https://www.russianmachineneverb reaks.com/2017/06/07/noted-penguins-fan-joe-mangani ello-to-host-nhl-awards-and-nhl-expansion-draft/]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nManganiello was once a [[roadie]] for the band [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]] and is friends with lead singer [[John Feldmann]]; he toured internationally with the group as a member of their security.<ref name=\"movieline\"/>\n\nIn July 2014, it was reported that Manganiello had begun dating actress [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Carolyn |last=Hiblen |title=T since the.

Recorded and released in 1967, it was their first album recorded after becoming a quartet with [[Jimmy Page]] as the sole guitarist and [[Chris Dreja]] switching to bass.  It was also the only Yardbirds album produced by [[Mickie Most]].\n\nAlthough the new lineup was becoming more experimental with longer, improvised concert performances, the Yardbirds' record company brought in successful singles producer Most to coax out more commercial product. However, neither material that properly presented their new approach nor hit singles were forthcoming. ''Little Games'' became the Yardbirds' final studio album, although Most continued to produce singles for the group. These were later collected and released with the original album along with outtakes and alternate mixes on an expanded edition titled '''''Little Games Sessions & More''''' in 1992.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the commercially and critically successful Yardbirds' albums ''[[Having a Rave Up with The Yardbirds]]'' (1965) and ''[[Yardbirds (album)|Yardbirds/Over Under Sideways Down]]'' aka ''Roger the Engineer'' (1966), founder member and bassist/musical director [[Paul Samwell-Smith]] left the group to pursue a career as a record producer. He was replaced on bass by studio guitarist Jimmy Page, whom the Yardbirds had originally approached to replace [[Eric Clapton]]. Page's position as bassist was temporary and within a short while he switched to second lead guitarist alongside [[Jeff Beck]], with rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja taking over on bass. In 1966, the Beck/Page dual lead guitar line-up produced the psychedelic \"[[Happenings Ten Years Time Ago]]\", \"Psycho Daisies\" and \"Stroll On\", the updated remake of \"[[The Train Kept A-Rollin']]\" for their appearance in [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s film ''[[Blow-Up]]''. However, by the end of 1966, Beck was fired from the band due to an illness that was preventing him from playing gigs while on tour in the US, and they continued as a quartet with Page as the sole guitarist.\n\nDuring 1966 and 1967, much of the rock audience began to shift interest from Top 40 singles to albums and concert presentations. During this period, the Yardbirds toured the US extensively, with frequent shows at popular counterculture venues such as [[the Fillmore]]. They became more experimental, with longer, improvised sets including light shows, film clips, and audio samples. Their material became more varied and introduced songs such as \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]\", the Jimmy Page solo-guitar piece \"[[White Summer]]\", [[the Velvet Underground]]'s \"[[I'm Waiting for the Man]]\", and extended medleys with re-worked versions of \"[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm a Man]]\" and \"[[Smokestack Lightning]]\".\n\nDespite this change in direction, Mickie Most, best known for producing hits for [[Herman's Hermits]] and [[Donovan]], was brought in by [[EMI]] as the Yardbirds' new record producer. Most was not current with new music trends and although Page had worked earlier for Most as a session guitarist, he was reportedly displeased with Most taking on the production duties.{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=47}}<ref>Although another biographer seems to indicate that Page welcomed Most's participation.{{harvnb|Clayson|2002|p=112}}</ref> According to biographer Gregg Russo, \"the upshot of Most's involvement was that the Yardbirds' stage personality ended up becoming vastly different than their recording persona\".{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=47}}\n\n==Recording and production==\nThe first Mickie Most-involved recordings took place at [[Olympic Studios]] in London on 5 March 1967. This session produced the single \"Little Games\" backed with \"Puzzles\". Although Dreja and drummer [[Jim McCarty]] were present to record \"Little Games\", Most used studio musicians [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass and cello arrangement) and Dougie Wright (drums) for their parts to cut down on studio time. The remainder of the songs for ''Little Games'' were recorded during a three-day session at London's [[De Lane Lea Studios]] from 29 April to 1 May 1967 and session musicians were used, including Jones (bass on \"No Excess Baggage\") and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano on \"Drinking Muddy Water\"). One song, an acoustic guitar instrumental titled \"White Summer\" is a Jimmy Page solo piece. It uses a \"DADGAD\" guitar tuning, giving it an Eastern music sound, which is enhanced with Indian-percussion [[tabla]] played by [[Chris Karan]] and an oboe melody line. Another instrumental, \"Glimpses\", features guitar parts with Page using a [[wah-wah pedal]] and sampled train station and children's playground sounds after a voice-manipulated reading of a poem. Page's guitar is also prominent on \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor\", where he introduced his guitar-bowing technique; \"Drinking Muddy Water\", which uses a slide-guitar part to follow the vocal line (later used to greater effect on [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[You Shook Me]]\"); and the instrumental breaks on \"Smile on Me\", including a wah-wah guitar coda.\n\nThe recording schedule was so hurried that the group often did not even hear the playbacks. Page recalled, \"It was just so bloody rushed. Everything was done in one take because Mickie Most was basically interested in singles and didn't believe it was worth the time to do the tracks right on the album\".{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=52}} Yardbirds' chronicler Gregg Russo notes the result was that \"many [of the songs] have a demo quality that time shortages would not allow them to change\".{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=48}} In fact one song, the pop-ish \"Little Soldier Boy\" was issued with McCarty's rough vocal guide providing the part intended for a trumpet.\n\nThe three subsequent singles recorded by the Yardbirds and later released on the expanded ''Little Games Sessions & More'' were given a similar treatment. Only singer [[Keith Relf]] appears on the cover version of \"Ha! Ha! Said the Clown\" (with [[Al Gorgoni]] on guitar, [[Cheap Trick]]'s [[Rick Nielsen]] on organ, Joe Macho on bass and [[Bobby Gregg]] on drums, recorded at Columbia Studios New York on 13 June 1967 and [[Abbey Road Studios]] on 19 June 1967). Two more cover songs, \"[[Ten Little Indians (Harry Nilsson song)|Ten Little Indians]]\" (Jones on bass and orchestral arrangement and [[Clem Cattini]] on drums, Olympic Studios on 25 September 1967) and \"Goodnight Sweet Josephine\" ([[Nicky Hopkins]] on piano, Jones on bass and Cattini on drums, De Lane Lea in March 1968) also use session musicians. Only the B-side to their last single, the proto-heavy metal \"Think About It\", was recorded by the entire group.  The song includes a guitar solo that Page had been using in the group's concert performances of \"Dazed and Confused\" (which he carried over, with some different lyrics, to Led Zeppelin).\n\n==Writing and composition==\nUnlike the Yardbirds' three previous charting singles (\"[[Shapes of Things]]\", \"[[Over Under Sideways Down]]\" and \"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\"), \"Little Games\" was not written by group members. Composed by [[Harold Spiro]] and [[Phil Wainman]], its lyrics are echoed in Led Zeppelin's \"[[Good Times Bad Times]]\". Another pop song recorded was \"No Excess Baggage\", by the [[Brill Building]] songwriters Roger Atkins and Carl D'Errico, who composed [[the Animals]] Top 40 hit \"[[It's My Life (The Animals song)|It's My Life]]\". Page adapted \"[[White Summer]]\" from [[Davy Graham]]'s version of the Irish folk song \"[[She Moved Through the Fair]]\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nThe remaining album songs are credited to the band members and include \"Drinking Muddy Water\", an interpretation of the blues classic \"[[Rollin' and Tumblin']]\" and nominally a tribute to bluesman [[Muddy Waters]], and \"Smile on Me\", a re-working of [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s \"Shake for Me\" (which Wolf later re-worked for his \"[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]\" which Led Zeppelin adapted for \"[[The Lemon Song]]\").{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|00=17\u201318}} The Yardbirds also recorded \"[[Stealin'|Stealing Stealing]]\", a [[Jug band|jug-band]]-style song that has been traced back to [[Gus Cannon]]'s Jug Stompers and the [[Memphis Jug Band]].{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nRusso describes the four and a half minute instrumental collage \"Glimpses\" as a \"brilliant piece of psychedelic imagery [that] revealed the Yardbirds at their most experimental and inspired\".{{sfn|Russo|1998|pp=50\u201351}} It features multiple-guitar tracks, with [[effects unit|effects]] and bowing, and an electric sitar-backing propelled along by a 6/8 beat and bass riff by McCarty and Dreja. Relf adds several tracks of chanting vocals, reminiscent of the Yardbirds' 1965 song \"Still I'm Sad\".

While it reached number 51 in the US, it failed to chart in the UK. As a result, EMI chose to issue the ''Little Games'' album only for the American market, where it was released by [[Epic Records]] July 10{{sfn|Russo|1992|p=8}}{{sfn|Koda|2001|p=45}} or 24,{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=97}}{{sfn|Clayson|2002|p=187}} 1967. Compared to the Yardbirds' prior Epic albums, ''Little Games'' made a relatively weak showing in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart, peaking at number 80 during a two-month run in the chart.  A \"Pop Spotlight\" review in the 29 July 1967 ''Billboard'' magazine was generic, predicting that the album \"should reach the charts in short order\", but noted \"Drinking Muddy Water\" and \"Smile On Max {{sic}}\", the album's two guitar-heavy blues-rock songs, as \"standouts\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=29 July 1967 |title=Album Reviews |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=79 |issue=30 |page=68 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> To put it into context, the magazine's album chart for the week included [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Flowers (The Rolling Stones album)|Flowers]]'', [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s ''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]'' and the self-titled debut albums ''[[The Doors (album)|The Doors]]'' and ''[[The Grateful Dead (album)|The Grateful Dead]]''. ''[[The Yardbirds Greatest Hits]]'', released in March 1967, was also in the chart where it remained into 1968 and placed at number 73 in the 100 best selling albums of 1967.\n\nMore recent reviews have generally found fault with ''Little Games''. [[AllMusic]]'s Bruce Eder gave it three out of five stars and wrote \"If almost any group other than the Yardbirds had released ''Little Games'', it would be considered a flawed but prime late-'60s psychedelic/hard rock artifact instead of a serious step backward, and even a disappointment\".<ref name=\"Eder\"/> An AllMusic review by [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] of the expanded edition ''Little Games Sessions & More'' began \"the day producer Mickie Most moved in on the Yardbirds was the day the Yardbirds' own values moved out. The union was a lousy idea from the start\".<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' writer also gave the album three out of five stars, calling it \"a disastrous attempt at conventional pop\".{{sfn|Brackett|2004|pp=893\u2013894}}  The Yardbirds themselves were just as critical \u2013 Page reportedly regarded ''Little Games'' as \"horrible\"{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=52}} and Jim McCarty described Mickie Most as \"a protagonist in our downfall\".{{sfn|Clayson|2002|p=112}}\n\nThe subsequent Most-produced singles were further unsuccessful attempts to reach the pop market. ''Little Games'' soon went out of print, but after Led Zeppelin rose to stardom and Page became a focus of attention, fans and collectors sought out copies of the album and drove up prices, resulting in counterfeit copies being introduced (see Printing errors below). The scarcity of the last singles also led to the 1975 bootleg collection ''[[Golden Eggs]]'', which was widely circulated and successful for its time. However, ''Little Games'', along with singles, outtakes, alternate mixes was released by EMI as the two-CD expanded edition ''Little Games Sessions & More'' in 1992.\n\nOf the last singles and tracks from ''Little Games'', the only songs incorporated into the Yardbirds concert repertoire were \"Drinking Muddy Water\", the Jimmy Page showcase \"White Summer\" (later featured in Led Zeppelin concerts in a medley with \"[[Black Mountain Side]]\"), and the psychedelic \"Glimpses\", which was soon replaced by \"Dazed and Confused\" as a concert highlight.\n\n==Track listing==\n===Original 1967 album===\n{{track listing\n| headline        =Side one\n| title1          = Little Games\n| writer1         = [[Harold Spiro]], [[Phil Wainman]]\n| length1         = 2:25\n| title2          = Smile on Me\n| writer2         = [[Chris Dreja]], [[Jim McCarty]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Keith Relf]]\n| length2         = 3:16\n| title3          = [[White Summer]]\n| writer3         = Page\n| length3         = 3:56\n| title4          = Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor\n| writer4         = Page, McCarty\n| length4         = 2:49\n| title5          = Glimpses\n| writer5         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length5         = 4:24\n}}\n\n{{track listing\n| headline        = Side two\n| title1          = Drinking Muddy Water\n| writer1         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length1         = 2:53\n| title2          = No Excess Baggage\n| writer2         = Roger Atkins, Carl D'Errico\n| length2         = 2:32\n| title3          = [[Stealin'|Stealing Stealing]]\n| writer3         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf<ref>[[Gus Cannon]] is usually credited with writing \"[[Stealin']]\" in the 1920s</ref>\n| length3         = 2:42\n| title4          = Only the Black Rose\n| writer4         = Relf\n| length4         = 2:52\n| title5          = Little Soldier Boy\n| writer5         = McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length5         = 2:39\n}}\n\n====Epic album printing errors====\nEpic Records, having made several printing errors with Yardbirds material in the past, made yet several more with ''Little Games''. Chris Dreja's surname for the songwriting credits (previously misspelled as \"Drega\" on the previous album ''Over Under Sideways Down'') was misprinted yet again on the album record labels as \"Ereja\". This error also appears on the Epic \"Drinking Muddy Water\" single and the tracks \"Smile on Me\" and \"Drinking Muddy Water\" included on the 1970 American compilation ''The Yardbirds Featuring Performances By Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page''.  The US \"Little Games\" single (written by Harold Spiro and Phil Wainman), only lists the latter writer, misspelled as \"Wienman\".\n\nEpic also mistakenly released a number of stereo versions of ''Little Games'' in mono version sleeves and pressed with mono LP labels. The three-letter prefix of the master numbers on the record labels and in the LP trail-out grooves properly identify the versions. \"XEM\" indicates genuine mono copies; if it shows \"XSB\" (even on the labels, despite the mono catalog number and no indication of STEREO under the Epic logo), it's a stereo pressing. Copies of ''Little Games'' has also been counterfeited \u2014 authentic copies have deep, dark purple album covers, while the counterfeits have brighter or \"bleached\" purple covers.\n\n===1992 expanded edition===\nThe expanded edition of ''Little Games'', titled ''Little Games Sessions & More'', was released by EMI America as a two-disc set featuring the original album, plus the singles \"Ha Ha Said the Clown\", \"Ten Little Indians\" and \"Goodnight Sweet Josephine\". Also included are several outtakes and alternate takes/mixes. A solo acoustic guitar mix of \"White Summer\" without the percussion and horn is included along with a version of \"Glimpses\" with different overdubs. The Yardbirds' final group single recording and one of the strongest with the Page lineup, \"Think About It\", also makes its first official album release here.  Additionally, three songs recorded by the Keith Relf/Jim McCarty folk-duo Together and a fourth, credited to Relf and McCarty, are also included.\n\n{{track listing\n| headline        = Disc one\n| title1          = Little Games \n| note1           = stereo mix\n| writer1         = [[Harold Spiro]], [[Phil Wainman]]\n| length1         = 2:37\n| title2          = Smile on Me\n| writer2         = [[Chris Dreja]], [[Jim McCarty]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Keith Relf]]\n| length2         = 3:15\n| title3          = [[White Summer]]\n| note3           = 1967 LP version\n| writer3         = Page\n| length3         = 3:57\n| title4          = Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor \n| note4           = 1967 LP version\n| writer4         = Page, McCarty\n| length4         = 2:51\n| title5          = Glimpses\n| note5           = 1967 LP version\n| writer5         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length5         = 4:21\n| title6          = Drinking Muddy Water \n| note6           = stereo mix\n| writer6         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length6         = 2:51\n| title7          = No Excess Baggage\n| writer7         = Roger Atkins, Carl D'Errico\n| length7         = 2:36\n| title8          = [[Stealin'|Stealing Stealing]]\n| writer8         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length8         = 2:33\n| title9          = Only the Black Rose\n| writer9         = Relf\n| length9         = 2:48\n| title10         = Little Soldier Boy\n| writer10        = McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length10        = 2:41\n| title11         = Puzzles\n| writer11        = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length11        = 2:08\n| title12         = I Remember the Night\n| writer12        = Anthony Pirollo\n| length12        = 3:01\n| title13         = Ha Ha Said the Clown\n| note13          = mono\n| writer13        = [[Tony Hazzard]]\n| length13        = 2:26\n| title14         = [[Ten Little Indians (Harry Nilsson song)|Ten Little Indians]] \n| note14          = single version, mono\n| writer14        = [[Harry Nilsson]]\n| length14        = 2:13\n| title15         = Goodnight Sweet Josephine \n| note15          = single version, mono\n| writer15        = Hazzard\n| length15        = 2:43\n| title16         = Think About It\n| note16          = mono\n| writer16        = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length16        = 3:46\n}}\n\n{{track listing\n| headline        = Disc two\n| title1          = Little Games \n| note1           = mono mix\n| writer1         = Spiro, Wainman\n| length1         = 2:22\n| title2          = You Stole My Love\n| note2           = instrumental demo\n| writer2         = [[Graham Gouldman]]\n| length2         = 2:55\n| title3          = [[White Summer]]\n| note3           = without accompaniment\n| writer3         = Page\n| length3         = 3:51\n| title4          = Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor \n| note4           = instrumental version\n| writer4         = Page, McCarty\n| length4         = 2:51\n| title5          = L.S.D.\n| note5           = instrumental demo\n| writer5         = Dreja, McCarty, Page\n| length5         = 1:00\n| title6          = Drinking Muddy Water \n| note6           = mono mix\n| writer6         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length6         = 2:50\n| title7          = De Lane Lea Lee\n| note7           = instrumental demo\n| writer7         = Dreja, McCarty, Page\n| length7         = 2:33\n| title8          = Glimpses\n| note8           = version w/different overdubs\n| writer8         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length8         = 4:18\n| title9          = Never Mind\n| note9           = instrumental demo\n| writer9         = Dreja, McCarty, Page\n| length9         = 2:46\n| title10         = Ten Little Indians\n| note10          = instrumental version\n| writer10        = Nilsson\n| length10        = 2:15\n| title11         = Goodnight Sweet Josephine\n| note11          = UK demo version w/entire group\n| writer11        = Hazzard\n| length11        = 2:42\n| title12         = Henry's Coming Home\n| note12          = by Together\n| writer12        = McCarty, Relf\n| length12        = 2:57\n| title13         = Love Mum and Dad\n| note13          = by Together\n| writer13        = McCarty, Relf\n| length13        = 3:48\n| title14         = Together Now\n| note14          = by Together\n| writer14        = McCarty, Relf\n| length14        = 3:02\n| title15         = Shining Where the Sun Has Been\n| note15          = by McCarty and Relf\n| writer15        = McCarty, Relf\n| length15        = 2:52\n| title16         = Great Shakes\n| note16          = U.S. radio advertisement \n| length16        = 1:01\n}}\n\n==Chart positions==\n===Album===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1967)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak position\n|-album/\n| US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]{{sfn|Koda|2001|p=51}}\n|align=\"center\"|80\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

band [[the Yardbirds]]. Recorded and released in 1967, it was their first album recorded after becoming a quartet with [[Jimmy Page]] as the sole guitarist and [[Chris Dreja]] switching to bass.  It was also the only Yardbirds album produced by [[Mickie Most]].\n\nAlthough the new lineup was becoming more experimental with longer, improvised concert performances, the Yardbirds' record company brought in successful singles producer Most to coax out more commercial product. However, neither material that properly presented their new approach nor hit singles were forthcoming. ''Little Games'' became the Yardbirds' final studio album, although Most continued to produce singles for the group. These were later collected and released with the original album along with outtakes and alternate mixes on an expanded edition titled '''''Little Games Sessions & More''''' in 1992.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the commercially and critically successful Yardbirds' albums ''[[Having a Rave Up with The Yardbirds]]'' (1965) and ''[[Yardbirds (album)|Yardbirds/Over Under Sideways Down]]'' aka ''Roger the Engineer'' (1966), founder member and bassist/musical director [[Paul Samwell-Smith]] left the group to pursue a career as a record producer. He was replaced on bass by studio guitarist Jimmy Page, whom the Yardbirds had originally approached to replace [[Eric Clapton]]. Page's position as bassist was temporary and within a short while he switched to second lead guitarist alongside [[Jeff Beck]], with rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja taking over on bass. In 1966, the Beck/Page dual lead guitar line-up produced the psychedelic \"[[Happenings Ten Years Time Ago]]\", \"Psycho Daisies\" and \"Stroll On\", the updated remake of \"[[The Train Kept A-Rollin']]\" for their appearance in [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s film ''[[Blow-Up]]''. However, by the end of 1966, Beck was fired from the band due to an illness that was preventing him from playing gigs while on tour in the US, and they continued as a quartet with Page as the sole guitarist.\n\nDuring 1966 and 1967, much of the rock audience began to shift interest from Top 40 singles to albums and concert presentations. During this period, the Yardbirds toured the US extensively, with frequent shows at popular counterculture venues such as [[the Fillmore]]. They became more experimental, with longer, improvised sets including light shows, film clips, and audio samples. Their material became more varied and introduced songs such as \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]\", the Jimmy Page solo-guitar piece \"[[White Summer]]\", [[the Velvet Underground]]'s \"[[I'm Waiting for the Man]]\", and extended medleys with re-worked versions of \"[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm a Man]]\" and \"[[Smokestack Lightning]]\".\n\nDespite this change in direction, Mickie Most, best known for producing hits for [[Herman's Hermits]] and [[Donovan]], was brought in by [[EMI]] as the Yardbirds' new record producer. Most was not current with new music trends and although Page had worked earlier for Most as a session guitarist, he was reportedly displeased with Most taking on the production duties.{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=47}}<ref>Although another biographer seems to indicate that Page welcomed Most's participation.{{harvnb|Clayson|2002|p=112}}</ref> According to biographer Gregg Russo, \"the upshot of Most's involvement was that the Yardbirds' stage personality ended up becoming vastly different than their recording persona\".{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=47}}\n\n==Recording and production==\nThe first Mickie Most-involved recordings took place at [[Olympic Studios]] in London on 5 March 1967. This session produced the single \"Little Games\" backed with \"Puzzles\". Although Dreja and drummer [[Jim McCarty]] were present to record \"Little Games\", Most used studio musicians [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] (bass and cello arrangement) and Dougie Wright (drums) for their parts to cut down on studio time. The remainder of the songs for ''Little Games'' were recorded during a three-day session at London's [[De Lane Lea Studios]] from 29 April to 1 May 1967 and session musicians were used, including Jones (bass on \"No Excess Baggage\") and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano on \"Drinking Muddy Water\"). One song, an acoustic guitar instrumental titled \"White Summer\" is a Jimmy Page solo piece. It uses a \"DADGAD\" guitar tuning, giving it an Eastern music sound, which is enhanced with Indian-percussion [[tabla]] played by [[Chris Karan]] and an oboe melody line. Another instrumental, \"Glimpses\", features guitar parts with Page using a [[wah-wah pedal]] and sampled train station and children's playground sounds after a voice-manipulated reading of a poem. Page's guitar is also prominent on \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor\", where he introduced his guitar-bowing technique; \"Drinking Muddy Water\", which uses a slide-guitar part to follow the vocal line (later used to greater effect on [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[You Shook Me]]\"); and the instrumental breaks on \"Smile on Me\", including a wah-wah guitar coda.\n\nThe recording schedule was so hurried that the group often did not even hear the playbacks. Page recalled, \"It was just so bloody rushed. Everything was done in one take because Mickie Most was basically interested in singles and didn't believe it was worth the time to do the tracks right on the album\".{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=52}} Yardbirds' chronicler Gregg Russo notes the result was that \"many [of the songs] have a demo quality that time shortages would not allow them to change\".{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=48}} In fact one song, the pop-ish \"Little Soldier Boy\" was issued with McCarty's rough vocal guide providing the part intended for a trumpet.\n\nThe three subsequent singles recorded by the Yardbirds and later released on the expanded ''Little Games Sessions & More'' were given a similar treatment. Only singer [[Keith Relf]] appears on the cover version of \"Ha! Ha! Said the Clown\" (with [[Al Gorgoni]] on guitar, [[Cheap Trick]]'s [[Rick Nielsen]] on organ, Joe Macho on bass and [[Bobby Gregg]] on drums, recorded at Columbia Studios New York on 13 June 1967 and [[Abbey Road Studios]] on 19 June 1967). Two more cover songs, \"[[Ten Little Indians (Harry Nilsson song)|Ten Little Indians]]\" (Jones on bass and orchestral arrangement and [[Clem Cattini]] on drums, Olympic Studios on 25 September 1967) and \"Goodnight Sweet Josephine\" ([[Nicky Hopkins]] on piano, Jones on bass and Cattini on drums, De Lane Lea in March 1968) also use session musicians. Only the B-side to their last single, the proto-heavy metal \"Think About It\", was recorded by the entire group.  The song includes a guitar solo that Page had been using in the group's concert performances of \"Dazed and Confused\" (which he carried over, with some different lyrics, to Led Zeppelin).\n\n==Writing and composition==\nUnlike the Yardbirds' three previous charting singles (\"[[Shapes of Things]]\", \"[[Over Under Sideways Down]]\" and \"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\"), \"Little Games\" was not written by group members. Composed by [[Harold Spiro]] and [[Phil Wainman]], its lyrics are echoed in Led Zeppelin's \"[[Good Times Bad Times]]\". Another pop song recorded was \"No Excess Baggage\", by the [[Brill Building]] songwriters Roger Atkins and Carl D'Errico, who composed [[the Animals]] Top 40 hit \"[[It's My Life (The Animals song)|It's My Life]]\". Page adapted \"[[White Summer]]\" from [[Davy Graham]]'s version of the Irish folk song \"[[She Moved Through the Fair]]\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nThe remaining album songs are credited to the band members and include \"Drinking Muddy Water\", an interpretation of the blues classic \"[[Rollin' and Tumblin']]\" and nominally a tribute to bluesman [[Muddy Waters]], and \"Smile on Me\", a re-working of [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s \"Shake for Me\" (which Wolf later re-worked for his \"[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]\" which Led Zeppelin adapted for \"[[The Lemon Song]]\").{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|00=17\u201318}} The Yardbirds also recorded \"[[Stealin'|Stealing Stealing]]\", a [[Jug band|jug-band]]-style song that has been traced back to [[Gus Cannon]]'s Jug Stompers and the [[Memphis Jug Band]].{{sfn|Shadwick|2005|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nRusso describes the four and a half minute instrumental collage \"Glimpses\" as a \"brilliant piece of psychedelic imagery [that] revealed the Yardbirds at their most experimental and inspired\".{{sfn|Russo|1998|pp=50\u201351}} It features multiple-guitar tracks, with [[effects unit|effects]] and bowing, and an electric sitar-backing propelled along by a 6/8 beat and bass riff by McCarty and Dreja. Relf adds several tracks of chanting vocals, reminiscent of the Yardbirds' 1965 song \"Still I'm Sad\". A barely-understandable truncated mechanical-sounding voice recites:\n{{poemquote|Glimpses of clouds in a forest\nCan review well within us\nAnd never to linger on one is life\nEnergy radiates from the source\nThe life around us is but a reflection of our own\nFlowing within never-ending boundless infinity\nTime is just a cumular limit\nWhich with one glimpse can overcome\nCan overcome{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=50}}<ref>Compiler Greg Russo may have misheard the phrase in the penultimate line of Relf's \"Glimpses\" recitation as \"cumular limit\" (which he used for the title of a Yardbirds compilation). The phrase may be \"human limit,\" but it is distorted by the wavering effect added to the recitation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nThe psychedelic folk-style song \"Only the Black Rose\" is credited to Relf and features his vocal with acoustic guitar accompaniment by Page and some subdued percussion effects. Described as \"reflective\" and \"emotive\" by Russo, it foreshadows the future Relf/McCarty acoustic folk collaborations Together and [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]].{{sfn|Russo|1998|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nAs with \"Little Games\" and unlike their previous hits, the Yardbirds' subsequent singles were written by others: [[Tony Hazzard]] composed \"Ha Ha Said the Clown\" (a pop hit for [[Manfred Mann]]) and the similarly pop-ish \"Good Night Sweet Josephine\" and [[Harry Nilsson]] supplied \"[[Ten Little Indians (Harry Nilsson song)|Ten Little Indians]]\", written in the style of a nursery rhyme.\n\n==Release and critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]] \u2013 ''Little Games'' \n|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Eder\">{{cite web |last=Eder |first=Bruce |title=Little Games \u2013 Album Review |website=[[AllMusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22417|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>\n|rev2 = AllMusic \u2013 ''Little Games Sessions & More''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Thompson (author) |title=Little Games Sessions & More \u2013 Album Review |website=[[AllMusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/little-games-sessions-mw0001230760 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' \u2013 ''Little Games''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3|5}}{{sfn|Brackett|2004|pp=893\u2013894}}\n}}\n\n\"Little Games\" was released as a single on 24 March 1967 in the US and 21 April in the UK. While it reached number 51 in the US, it failed to chart in the UK. As a result, EMI chose to issue the ''Little Games'' album only for the American market, where it was released by [[Epic Records]] July 10{{sfn|Russo|1992|p=8}}{{sfn|Koda|2001|p=45}} or 24,{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=97}}{{sfn|Clayson|2002|p=187}} 1967. Compared to the Yardbirds' prior Epic albums, ''Little Games'' made a relatively weak showing in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart, peaking at number 80 during a two-month run in the chart.  A \"Pop Spotlight\" review in the 29 July 1967 ''Billboard'' magazine was generic, predicting that the album \"should reach the charts in short order\", but noted \"Drinking Muddy Water\" and \"Smile On Max {{sic}}\", the album's two guitar-heavy blues-rock songs, as \"standouts\".<ref>{{cite journal |date=29 July 1967 |title=Album Reviews |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=79 |issue=30 |page=68 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> To put it into context, the magazine's album chart for the week included [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Flowers (The Rolling Stones album)|Flowers]]'', [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s ''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]'' and the self-titled debut albums ''[[The Doors (album)|The Doors]]'' and ''[[The Grateful Dead (album)|The Grateful Dead]]''. ''[[The Yardbirds Greatest Hits]]'', released in March 1967, was also in the chart where it remained into 1968 and placed at number 73 in the 100 best selling albums of 1967.\n\nMore recent reviews have generally found fault with ''Little Games''. [[AllMusic]]'s Bruce Eder gave it three out of five stars and wrote \"If almost any group other than the Yardbirds had released ''Little Games'', it would be considered a flawed but prime late-'60s psychedelic/hard rock artifact instead of a serious step backward, and even a disappointment\".<ref name=\"Eder\"/> An AllMusic review by [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] of the expanded edition ''Little Games Sessions & More'' began \"the day producer Mickie Most moved in on the Yardbirds was the day the Yardbirds' own values moved out. The union was a lousy idea from the start\".<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' writer also gave the album three out of five stars, calling it \"a disastrous attempt at conventional pop\".{{sfn|Brackett|2004|pp=893\u2013894}}  The Yardbirds themselves were just as critical \u2013 Page reportedly regarded ''Little Games'' as \"horrible\"{{sfn|Russo|1998|p=52}} and Jim McCarty described Mickie Most as \"a protagonist in our downfall\".{{sfn|Clayson|2002|p=112}}\n\nThe subsequent Most-produced singles were further unsuccessful attempts to reach the pop market. ''Little Games'' soon went out of print, but after Led Zeppelin rose to stardom and Page became a focus of attention, fans and collectors sought out copies of the album and drove up prices, resulting in counterfeit copies being introduced (see Printing errors below). The scarcity of the last singles also led to the 1975 bootleg collection ''[[Golden Eggs]]'', which was widely circulated and successful for its time. However, ''Little Games'', along with singles, outtakes, alternate mixes was released by EMI as the two-CD expanded edition ''Little Games Sessions & More'' in 1992.\n\nOf the last singles and tracks from ''Little Games'', the only songs incorporated into the Yardbirds concert repertoire were \"Drinking Muddy Water\", the Jimmy Page showcase \"White Summer\" (later featured in Led Zeppelin concerts in a medley with \"[[Black Mountain Side]]\"), and the psychedelic \"Glimpses\", which was soon replaced by \"Dazed and Confused\" as a concert highlight.\n\n==Track listing==\n===Original 1967 album===\n{{track listing\n| headline        =Side one\n| title1          = Little Games\n| writer1         = [[Harold Spiro]], [[Phil Wainman]]\n| length1         = 2:25\n| title2          = Smile on Me\n| writer2         = [[Chris Dreja]], [[Jim McCarty]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Keith Relf]]\n| length2         = 3:16\n| title3          = [[White Summer]]\n| writer3         = Page\n| length3         = 3:56\n| title4          = Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor\n| writer4         = Page, McCarty\n| length4         = 2:49\n| title5          = Glimpses\n| writer5         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length5         = 4:24\n}}\n\n{{track listing\n| headline        = Side two\n| title1          = Drinking Muddy Water\n| writer1         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length1         = 2:53\n| title2          = No Excess Baggage\n| writer2         = Roger Atkins, Carl D'Errico\n| length2         = 2:32\n| title3          = [[Stealin'|Stealing Stealing]]\n| writer3         = Dreja, McCarty, Page, Relf<ref>[[Gus Cannon]] is usually credited with writing \"[[Stealin']]\" in the 1920s</ref>\n| length3         = 2:42\n| title4          = Only the Black Rose\n| writer4         = Relf\n| length4         = 2:52\n| title5          = Little Soldier Boy\n| writer5         = McCarty, Page, Relf\n| length5         = 2:39\n}}\n\n====Epic album printing errors====\nEpic Records, having made several printing errors with Yardbirds material in the past, made yet several more with ''Little Games''. Chris Dreja's surname for the songwriting credits (previously misspelled as \"Drega\" on the previous album ''Over Under Sideways Down'') was misprinted yet again on the album record labels as \"Ereja\". This error also appears on the Epic \"Drinking Muddy Water\" single and the tracks \"Smile on Me\" and \"Drinking Muddy Water\" included on the 1970 American compilation ''The Yardbirds Featuring Performances By Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page''.  The US \"Little Games\" single (written by Harold Spiro and Phil Wainman), only lists the latter writer, misspelled as \"Wienman\".\n\nEpic also mistakenly released a number of stereo versions of ''Little Games'' in mono version sleeves and pressed with mono LP labels. The three-letter prefix of the master numbers on the record labels and in the LP trail-out grooves properly identify the versions. \"XEM\" indicates genuine mono copies; if it shows \"XSB\" (even on the labels, despite the mono catalog number and no indication of STEREO under the Epic logo), it's a stereo pressing. Copies of ''Little Games'' has also been counterfeited \u2014 authentic copies have deep, dark purple album covers, while the counterfeits have brighter or \"bleached\" purple covers.\n\n===1992 expanded edition===\nThe expanded edition of ''Little Games'', titled ''Little Games Sessions & More'', was released by EMI America as a two-disc set featuring the original album, plus the singles \"Ha Ha Said the Clown\", \"Ten Little Indians\" and \"Goodnight Sweet Josephine\". Also included are several outtakes and alternate takes/mixes. A solo acoustic guitar mix of \"White Summer\" without the percussion and horn is included along with a version of \"Glimpses\" with different overdubs. The Yardbirds' final group single recording and one of the strongest with the Page lineup, \"Think About It\", also makes its first official album release here.

More specifically it is used to describe the expeditionary campaigns of the [[British Army]] in the Kingdom of Kandy in 1803 and 1815.\n\n==Background==\nFrom 1638\u201358, the [[Dutch East India company]] had intervened in the [[Sinhalese\u2013Portuguese War]], capturing all the [[Portuguese Ceylon|Portuguese possessions on the island]] of [[Ceylon]] (now called Sri Lanka). They established the colony of [[Dutch Ceylon]], controlling the coasts and lowlands, whilst the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] maintained their independence in the mountainous eastern interior. In 1795 the [[Dutch Republic]] was [[Batavian Revolution|overthrown with French assistance]], forming the [[Batavian Republic]] as a [[puppet state]]. Britain, which was [[War of the First Coalition|at war with France]], feared that influence would result in French control or use of the strategically important port of [[Trincomalee]] and others on the island. Following the [[Kew Letters]] of 1795, the [[Invasion of Ceylon (1795)|British occupied Dutch possessions]] in Sri Lanka. These included not only Trincomalee but [[Batticaloa]], [[Galle]], and [[Jaffna]], as well as the entirety of Sri Lanka's lowlying coastal areas. The new colony of [[British Ceylon]] was determined to expand and control the entirety of the island, and had reformed traditional social structures like the caste system and the ''rajakariya'' (lit. \"kingwork\", labour and or tithes owed to the Kandyan king). This added to the tension between them and the still independent Kingdom of Kandy.\n\nMountainous central Sri Lanka remained independent, having resisted 250 years of European attempts to control Ceylon. Kandy was now under the rule of the [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty|Nayaka]] kings of [[Kandy|Senkadagala]]. Early British attempts at securing a treaty with mountainous kingdom were rejected.<ref>{{citation |last=Coddrington |first=Humphrey Eilliam |title=A Short History of Lanka |chapter=10 |year=1926 |publisher=Macmillan & Co |location=London |url=http://lakdiva.org/codrington/chap10.html}}. Retrieved on 23&nbsp;August 2008.</ref> The internal stability of Kandy was shaky, as king [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]] found himself being constantly undermined and intrigued against by powerful [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] nobles. He also faced a potential usurper in the form of Muttusami, brother-in-law of the previous king Rajadhirajasingha, who had fled to British controlled lands in the early 19th century and had been agitating against the beleaguered king ever since.<ref name=\"san.beck.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.san.beck.org/2-10-Marathas1707-1818.html|title=''san.beck.org''|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest British garrison numbered about 6,000 which was increased through the recruitment of local sepoys, and the forces of the Empire further enjoyed exclusive access to the sea. Kandy, in contrast, had the advantage of being situated in difficult, mountainous terrain, and could also draw on four hundred years of experience resisting European colonists.\n\n==First war (1803\u20131805)==\n[[Image:Central province1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Terrain near Kandy; much of the Kingdom was mountainous, thickly forested and malarial, and the routes to Kandy were kept secret and well-guarded.]]\n\nThe first Kandyan war was precipitated by the intrigues of a minister of [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], Pilimatalawe, who defected to the British and offered to show them the way through central Sri Lanka's winding mountain passes to the [[Kandy|capital city]]. Enraged, the [[King of Kandy]] had the minister's family executed.\n\nThe British dispatched two separate forces into Kandyan territory - one, under Major-General [[Hay MacDowall]], from [[Colombo]], and another, under a Colonel Barbut, from Trincomalee. These included [[King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry|51st Regiment of Foot]], the [[Green Howards|19th Regiment of Foot]], the Malay (Muslim) 1st Ceylon Regiment, the all-Sinhalese 2nd Ceylon, and the mixed Sinhalese Malay 3rd Ceylon. In the Kandyan army, at least one contingent was under the command of a Malay (and hence Muslim) prince called 'Sangunglo',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~lkawgw/malays1.htm |title=Malays |publisher=Rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> an interesting commentary on the multiethnic nature of the mountainous kingdom. After fierce fighting the British force found Senkadagala deserted in February 1803. They swiftly established a garrison, crowned Muttusami as the new, puppet, king of Kandy, and set about subduing the remainder of the kingdom.\n\nDespite these early successes the army soon suffered a number of setbacks. The Chief Minister responsible for guiding the British into Kandy had greatly inflated the extent of the king's unpopularity, and resistance proved fierce. The Kandyans resorted to fighting a guerilla war (much the same tactic as they had adopted against the Portuguese and the Dutch) and proved difficult to dislodge. Disease ravaged the garrison left behind in Senkadagala to secure the capital. Perhaps most worrying for them, a number of native sepoys defected to the Kandyans, including a soldier of Malay descent called 'William O'Deen' or 'Odeen', who years later became the first Sri Lankan exiled to Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=805&sid=ed9e35ac4c934a2cb5636328ff7cab3b |title=LANKALIBRARY FORUM \u2022 View topic - Malayan Drum Major Odeen -1st Ceylonese Soldier in Australia |publisher=Lankalibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/06/29/fea14.html |title=Online edition of Sunday Observer - Business |publisher=Sundayobserver.lk |date=2003-06-29 |accessdate=2012-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205003329/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/06/29/fea14.html |archivedate=2012-02-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe Kandyans counter-attacked in March and seized Senkadagala. Barbut was taken prisoner and executed, and the British garrison wiped out; only one man, Corporal George Barnsley of the 19th Infantry, survived to tell the tale (though other sources put the number of survivors at four).<ref name=\"answers.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/kandian-wars |title=Toolserver:Homepage |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> In the meanwhile the retreating British army was defeated on the banks of the flooding [[Mahaweli River|Mahaveli river]], leaving only four survivors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenhowards.org.uk/html-files/friends-newsletters/issue16.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615200130/http://greenhowards.org.uk/html-files/friends-newsletters/issue16.htm |archivedate=2006-06-15 }}</ref>\n\nDespite this setback the British still remained unquestioned masters of the lands they possessed, as the disastrous Kandyan counter-campaign later in the year proved. Equipped with a handful of captured six-pound cannon, the Kandyan army advanced through the mountain passes as far as the city of [[Hanwella]].<ref name=\"spur.asn.au\">[http://www.spur.asn.au/British.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212152621/http://www.spur.asn.au/British.htm |date=February 12, 2006 }}</ref> Here the army was utterly routed by superior British firepower, forcing Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe to flee back into the mountains. A general rebellion that had erupted in British occupied territory on hearing of the Kandyan invasion was suppressed.\n\n[[Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford|Frederick North]], governor of Ceylon from 1798\u20131805, maintained pressure on the Kandyan frontier with numerous attacks, in 1804 dispatched a force under Captain Arthur Johnston towards Senkadagala. In a pattern that had become clear over the past two hundred or so years, the Kandyans once again defeated the British in the mountainous territory they called home. In 1805, emboldened by their successes, they captured Katuwana, a frontier town. This and the 1803 victory at the Battle of the Mahaveli, were to be Kandy's last, meaningful military successes.\n\nThough no treaty was signed officially ending the First Kandyan War, the appointment of General [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]] as governor of Ceylon in 1805 is generally accepted as the end of this first phase of open hostilities.\n\n==Interbellum (1805\u20131815)==\nEvents in the ten years between the end of the First Kandyan War and the Second were such that the complexion of the second conflict was quite different from the first. Whereas in 1805 the British had been forced to contend with a largely hostile native nobility, in 1815 it was this same nobility who essentially invited the British into Kandy and supported their overthrow of Sri Vikrama Rajasingha.\n\nGovernor Thomas Maitland, in British Ceylon, initiated extensive legal and social reforms to further entrench and strengthen British power. These included the reform of the civil service to eliminate corruption, and the creation of a Ceylonese High Court based on caste law. The Catholic population was enfranchised whilst the Dutch Reformed church lost its privileged position. Maitland also worked to undermine Buddhist authority and sought to attract Europeans to the island by allowing grants of up to 4000 acres (16&nbsp;km\u00b2) on the island.<ref name=san.beck.org /> He was replaced in 1812/1813 by Sir Robert Brownrigg,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/robert-brownrigg |title=Robert Brownrigg: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date=2009-12-27 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> who largely continued these policies.\n\nIn contrast, an increasingly paranoid Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe categorically alienated Kandy's powerful nobility and volatile commoners. The construction of Kandy Lake was completed in 1807. Despite its beauty it was a deeply unpopular project, as it served no practical purpose - central Senkadagala had no paddy fields that required irrigation, the traditional cause for the construction of such hydraulic monuments.

Discontent with British activities soon boiled over into open rebellion, commencing in the duchy of Uva in 1817. Generally called the 'Uva Rebellion', it is also known as the [[Third Kandyan War]]. In many ways the third name is more appropriate, as the rebellion (which soon developed into a guerilla war of the kind the Kandyans had fought against European powers for some time) was centred on the Kandyan nobility and their unhappiness with developments under British rule since 1815. However it is the last uprising of this kind and Britain's response essentially liquidated the old aristocracy and ensured future rebellions would take on a much more subdued character.\n\nThe [[Ceylon Medal]] was instituted by the Ceylonese Government in 1819, the only gallantry medal struck for the Kandyan Wars.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Robin|title=16 June 1818: deaths of Private James Sutherland and Private William Chandler (73rd Regt)|url=https://www.mq.edu.au/macquarie-archive/under/documents/1818/4july.html|website=Under a Tropical Sun|publisher=Macquarie University|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe British capture of the kingdom of Kandy marked not only the end of the 400-year-old Kingdom of Kandy, but also of all native political independence. Kandy, as a result of its geographical and political isolation, had developed unique cultural and social structures that were now subject to the intense pressures of subjugation and underwent immense upheaval and change.\n\nBefore 1815, much of Kandy's territory had been underdeveloped with unreliable dirt-track roads for access, apart from a few 'royal roads'. The British proceeded to transform the hill country by constructing roads across previously inaccessible terrain (such as the [[Kadugannawa_Pass#History|Kadugannawa Pass]]), and, in 1867, building the first railway. The other big transformation was the introduction of [[Ceylon tea|tea]] to central Sri Lanka in 1867 and the massive settlement of Tamils in the region. Central Sri Lanka is now dominated by the vast tea estates that helped make Sri Lanka the world's biggest exporter of tea for a while, and were still owned by British companies in 1971.\n\nA lasting legacy of the same war in [[Ireland]] is the traditional anti-war and anti-recruiting song \"[[Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye]]\", depicting a soldier from [[Athy]], [[County Kildare]] who comes home horribly mutilated from the war in \"Sulloon\" (Ceylon).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Matale rebellion]]\n* [[Kandyan Convention]]\n* [[Colonial history of Sri Lanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation |last=Powell |first=Geoffrey |title=The Kandyan Wars |location=London |year=1973}}\n* {{citation |last=Pieris |first=Ralph |title=Sinhalese Social Organization: The Kandyan Period |location=Colombo |year=1956}}\n* {{citation |last=Wickremesekara |first=Channa |title=Military Organisation in Pre-Modern Sri Lanka: The Army of the Kandyan Kings |year=2004 |journal=The Journal of South Asian Studies |volume=XXVII |number=2&nbsp;August 2004 |pages=133\u2013151 |doi=10.1080/1479027042000236616}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{British colonial campaigns}}\n{{Armed Conflicts Involving Sri Lanka}}\n{{Kandyan period topics}}\n{{British Ceylon period topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kandyan Wars}}\n[[Category:Kandyan period]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:19th-century military history of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:18th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:19th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Kandy]]\n[[Category:History of Kandy]]\n[[Category:British Ceylon]]\n[[Category:19th century in Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:18th century in Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:1790s in Asia]]\n[[Category:1800s in Asia]]\n[[Category:1815 in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British Army expeditionary campaigns}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{cleanup|reason=Terms and text like \"intrigues\", \"command of a Malay (and hence Muslim)\" \"Perhaps most worrying\" may have been OK for the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, but not for 2017 Wikipedia|date=May 2017}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=May 2017}}\n}}\n{{infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Kandyan Wars\n| partof      =\n| image       = Hindoostanmap1812.jpg\n| image_size  = 250px\n| caption     = The Indian subcontinent on the eve of the Second Kandyan War; the entirety of Sri Lanka is shown as being under British control, when in fact the kingdom of Kandy endured in the mountainous interior.\n| date        = 1796\u20131818\n| place       = [[Kingdom of Kandy]]\n| coordinates =\n| map_type    =\n| latitude    =\n| longitude   =\n| map_size    =\n| map_caption =\n| map_label   =\n| territory   =\n| result      = British victory\n* End of 2,357 years of Sinhalese independence<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Arnold|title=Twentieth century impressions of Ceylon: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources|year=1999|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1335-5|page=65|edition=2 (illustrated)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUF_rS8FEoIC&dq=Twentieth+century+impressions+of+Ceylon:+its+history,+people,+commerce&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref>\n| status      =\n| combatant1  = [[File:King of Kandy.svg|25px]] [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandy]]\n| combatant2  = {{flag|British Empire}}\n| combatant3  =\n| commander1  = King [[Vikrama Rajasinha]]\nDissawa [[Lewke]]\n| commander2  ={{flagicon|Kingdom of Great Britain}}[[Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford]]<br>\n{{flagicon|Kingdom of Great Britain}} [[Hay MacDowall]]<br>{{flagicon|Kingdom of Great Britain}} [[Adam Davy (soldier)|Adam Davy]]<br>{{flagicon|Kingdom of Great Britain}} [[B.

More specifically it is used to describe the expeditionary campaigns of the [[British Army]] in the Kingdom of Kandy in 1803 and 1815.\n\n==Background==\nFrom 1638\u201358, the [[Dutch East India company]] had intervened in the [[Sinhalese\u2013Portuguese War]], capturing all the [[Portuguese Ceylon|Portuguese possessions on the island]] of [[Ceylon]] (now called Sri Lanka). They established the colony of [[Dutch Ceylon]], controlling the coasts and lowlands, whilst the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] maintained their independence in the mountainous eastern interior. In 1795 the [[Dutch Republic]] was [[Batavian Revolution|overthrown with French assistance]], forming the [[Batavian Republic]] as a [[puppet state]]. Britain, which was [[War of the First Coalition|at war with France]], feared that influence would result in French control or use of the strategically important port of [[Trincomalee]] and others on the island. Following the [[Kew Letters]] of 1795, the [[Invasion of Ceylon (1795)|British occupied Dutch possessions]] in Sri Lanka. These included not only Trincomalee but [[Batticaloa]], [[Galle]], and [[Jaffna]], as well as the entirety of Sri Lanka's lowlying coastal areas. The new colony of [[British Ceylon]] was determined to expand and control the entirety of the island, and had reformed traditional social structures like the caste system and the ''rajakariya'' (lit. \"kingwork\", labour and or tithes owed to the Kandyan king). This added to the tension between them and the still independent Kingdom of Kandy.\n\nMountainous central Sri Lanka remained independent, having resisted 250 years of European attempts to control Ceylon. Kandy was now under the rule of the [[Madurai Nayak Dynasty|Nayaka]] kings of [[Kandy|Senkadagala]]. Early British attempts at securing a treaty with mountainous kingdom were rejected.<ref>{{citation |last=Coddrington |first=Humphrey Eilliam |title=A Short History of Lanka |chapter=10 |year=1926 |publisher=Macmillan & Co |location=London |url=http://lakdiva.org/codrington/chap10.html}}. Retrieved on 23&nbsp;August 2008.</ref> The internal stability of Kandy was shaky, as king [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]] found himself being constantly undermined and intrigued against by powerful [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] nobles. He also faced a potential usurper in the form of Muttusami, brother-in-law of the previous king Rajadhirajasingha, who had fled to British controlled lands in the early 19th century and had been agitating against the beleaguered king ever since.<ref name=\"san.beck.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.san.beck.org/2-10-Marathas1707-1818.html|title=''san.beck.org''|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest British garrison numbered about 6,000 which was increased through the recruitment of local sepoys, and the forces of the Empire further enjoyed exclusive access to the sea. Kandy, in contrast, had the advantage of being situated in difficult, mountainous terrain, and could also draw on four hundred years of experience resisting European colonists.\n\n==First war (1803\u20131805)==\n[[Image:Central province1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Terrain near Kandy; much of the Kingdom was mountainous, thickly forested and malarial, and the routes to Kandy were kept secret and well-guarded.]]\n\nThe first Kandyan war was precipitated by the intrigues of a minister of [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], Pilimatalawe, who defected to the British and offered to show them the way through central Sri Lanka's winding mountain passes to the [[Kandy|capital city]]. Enraged, the [[King of Kandy]] had the minister's family executed.\n\nThe British dispatched two separate forces into Kandyan territory - one, under Major-General [[Hay MacDowall]], from [[Colombo]], and another, under a Colonel Barbut, from Trincomalee. These included [[King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry|51st Regiment of Foot]], the [[Green Howards|19th Regiment of Foot]], the Malay (Muslim) 1st Ceylon Regiment, the all-Sinhalese 2nd Ceylon, and the mixed Sinhalese Malay 3rd Ceylon. In the Kandyan army, at least one contingent was under the command of a Malay (and hence Muslim) prince called 'Sangunglo',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~lkawgw/malays1.htm |title=Malays |publisher=Rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> an interesting commentary on the multiethnic nature of the mountainous kingdom. After fierce fighting the British force found Senkadagala deserted in February 1803. They swiftly established a garrison, crowned Muttusami as the new, puppet, king of Kandy, and set about subduing the remainder of the kingdom.\n\nDespite these early successes the army soon suffered a number of setbacks. The Chief Minister responsible for guiding the British into Kandy had greatly inflated the extent of the king's unpopularity, and resistance proved fierce. The Kandyans resorted to fighting a guerilla war (much the same tactic as they had adopted against the Portuguese and the Dutch) and proved difficult to dislodge. Disease ravaged the garrison left behind in Senkadagala to secure the capital. Perhaps most worrying for them, a number of native sepoys defected to the Kandyans, including a soldier of Malay descent called 'William O'Deen' or 'Odeen', who years later became the first Sri Lankan exiled to Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lankalibrary.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=805&sid=ed9e35ac4c934a2cb5636328ff7cab3b |title=LANKALIBRARY FORUM \u2022 View topic - Malayan Drum Major Odeen -1st Ceylonese Soldier in Australia |publisher=Lankalibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/06/29/fea14.html |title=Online edition of Sunday Observer - Business |publisher=Sundayobserver.lk |date=2003-06-29 |accessdate=2012-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205003329/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2003/06/29/fea14.html |archivedate=2012-02-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe Kandyans counter-attacked in March and seized Senkadagala.

Equipped with a handful of captured six-pound cannon, the Kandyan army advanced through the mountain passes as far as the city of [[Hanwella]].<ref name=\"spur.asn.au\">[http://www.spur.asn.au/British.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212152621/http://www.spur.asn.au/British.htm |date=February 12, 2006 }}</ref> Here the army was utterly routed by superior British firepower, forcing Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe to flee back into the mountains. A general rebellion that had erupted in British occupied territory on hearing of the Kandyan invasion was suppressed.\n\n[[Frederick North, 5th Earl of Guilford|Frederick North]], governor of Ceylon from 1798\u20131805, maintained pressure on the Kandyan frontier with numerous attacks, in 1804 dispatched a force under Captain Arthur Johnson towards Senkadagala. In a pattern that had become clear over the past two hundred or so years, the Kandyans once again defeated the British in the mountainous territory they called home. In 1805, emboldened by their successes, they captured Katuwana, a frontier town. This and the 1803 victory at the Battle of the Mahaveli, were to be Kandy's last, meaningful military successes.\n\nThough no treaty was signed officially ending the First Kandyan War, the appointment of General [[Thomas Maitland (British Army officer)|Thomas Maitland]] as governor of Ceylon in 1805 is generally accepted as the end of this first phase of open hostilities.\n\n==Interbellum (1805\u20131815)==\nEvents in the ten years between the end of the First Kandyan War and the Second were such that the complexion of the second conflict was quite different from the first. Whereas in 1805 the British had been forced to contend with a largely hostile native nobility, in 1815 it was this same nobility who essentially invited the British into Kandy and supported their overthrow of Sri Vikrama Rajasingha.\n\nGovernor Thomas Maitland, in British Ceylon, initiated extensive legal and social reforms to further entrench and strengthen British power. These included the reform of the civil service to eliminate corruption, and the creation of a Ceylonese High Court based on caste law. The Catholic population was enfranchised whilst the Dutch Reformed church lost its privileged position. Maitland also worked to undermine Buddhist authority and sought to attract Europeans to the island by allowing grants of up to 4000 acres (16&nbsp;km\u00b2) on the island.<ref name=san.beck.org /> He was replaced in 1812/1813 by Sir Robert Brownrigg,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/robert-brownrigg |title=Robert Brownrigg: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date=2009-12-27 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> who largely continued these policies.\n\nIn contrast, an increasingly paranoid Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe categorically alienated Kandy's powerful nobility and volatile commoners. The construction of Kandy Lake was completed in 1807. Despite its beauty it was a deeply unpopular project, as it served no practical purpose - central Senkadagala had no paddy fields that required irrigation, the traditional cause for the construction of such hydraulic monuments.

Later in 1815 the heads of the Buddhist monasteries at Malwatte and Asgiriya both met Governor Brownrigg and extracted guarantee that Buddhism would not be compromised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~lkawgw/kandycon.html |title=The 1815 Kandyan Convention at the Audience Hall |publisher=Rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This included a ban on proselytising and mission schools.\n\n==Third war (1817\u20131818)==\n{{main article|Uva Rebellion}}\n\nIt took the ruling families of Kandy less than two years to realise that the authority of the British government was a fundamentally different beast to that of the (deposed) Nayakkar monarchy. Discontent with British activities soon boiled over into open rebellion, commencing in the duchy of Uva in 1817. Generally called the 'Uva Rebellion', it is also known as the [[Third Kandyan War]]. In many ways the third name is more appropriate, as the rebellion (which soon developed into a guerilla war of the kind the Kandyans had fought against European powers for some time) was centred on the Kandyan nobility and their unhappiness with developments under British rule since 1815. However it is the last uprising of this kind and Britain's response essentially liquidated the old aristocracy and ensured future rebellions would take on a much more subdued character.\n\nThe [[Ceylon Medal]] was instituted by the Ceylonese Government in 1819, the only gallantry medal struck for the Kandyan Wars.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Walsh|first1=Robin|title=16 June 1818: deaths of Private James Sutherland and Private William Chandler (73rd Regt)|url=https://www.mq.edu.au/macquarie-archive/under/documents/1818/4july.html|website=Under a Tropical Sun|publisher=Macquarie University|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe British capture of the kingdom of Kandy marked not only the end of the 400-year-old Kingdom of Kandy, but also of all native political independence. Kandy, as a result of its geographical and political isolation, had developed unique cultural and social structures that were now subject to the intense pressures of subjugation and underwent immense upheaval and change.\n\nBefore 1815, much of Kandy's territory had been underdeveloped with unreliable dirt-track roads for access, apart from a few 'royal roads'. The British proceeded to transform the hill country by constructing roads across previously inaccessible terrain (such as the [[Kadugannawa_Pass#History|Kadugannawa Pass]]), and, in 1867, building the first railway. The other big transformation was the introduction of [[Ceylon tea|tea]] to central Sri Lanka in 1867 and the massive settlement of Tamils in the region. Central Sri Lanka is now dominated by the vast tea estates that helped make Sri Lanka the world's biggest exporter of tea for a while, and were still owned by British companies in 1971.\n\nA lasting legacy of the same war in [[Ireland]] is the traditional anti-war and anti-recruiting song \"[[Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye]]\", depicting a soldier from [[Athy]], [[County Kildare]] who comes home horribly mutilated from the war in \"Sulloon\" (Ceylon).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Matale rebellion]]\n* [[Kandyan Convention]]\n* [[Colonial history of Sri Lanka]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation |last=Powell |first=Geoffrey |title=The Kandyan Wars |location=London |year=1973}}\n* {{citation |last=Pieris |first=Ralph |title=Sinhalese Social Organization: The Kandyan Period |location=Colombo |year=1956}}\n* {{citation |last=Wickremesekara |first=Channa |title=Military Organisation in Pre-Modern Sri Lanka: The Army of the Kandyan Kings |year=2004 |journal=The Journal of South Asian Studies |volume=XXVII |number=2&nbsp;August 2004 |pages=133\u2013151 |doi=10.1080/1479027042000236616}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{British colonial campaigns}}\n{{Armed Conflicts Involving Sri Lanka}}\n{{Kandyan period topics}}\n{{British Ceylon period topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kandyan Wars}}\n[[Category:Kandyan period]]\n[[Category:Wars involving Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:19th-century military history of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:18th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:19th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Kandy]]\n[[Category:History of Kandy]]\n[[Category:British Ceylon]]\n[[Category:19th century in Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:18th century in Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:1790s in Asia]]\n[[Category:1800s in Asia]]\n[[Category:1815 in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Prodesse", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected \"Captain Arthur Johnson\" to correct name, Johnston", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandyan_Wars"}

Starting from 1874, some classes of Literature, Law and Applied Sciences were given at the building of [[Galatasaray High School]], which continued regularly until 1881. On 1 September 1900, the school was renamed and reorganized as the ''Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbn-u \u015eah\u00e2ne'' (Imperial House of Multiple Sciences) with courses on Mathematics, Literature and Theology. On 20 April 1912, the school was renamed as the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' (Istanbul House of Multiple Sciences) while the number of courses were increased and the curricula were modernized with the establishment of the Schools of Medicine, Law, Applied Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), Literature and Theology.\n\nOn 21 April 1924, the [[Republic of Turkey]] recognized the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' as a state school, and on 7 October 1925, the administrative autonomy of ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was recognized while the ''Schools'' (within the old Medrese system) became modern ''Faculties''.\n\nOn 1 August 1933, ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was reorganized as ''\u0130stanbul \u00dcniversitesi'' (Istanbul University) following the [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|educational reforms]] of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]].

There is no obligation on product developers or vendors to adopt the standards developed by the association.\n\n== History ==\nBy the early 1990s, the major UNIX system vendors had begun to realize that the standards rivalries (often called the \"[[Unix wars]]\") were causing all participants more harm than good, leaving the UNIX industry open to emerging competition from [[Microsoft]].  The [[Common Open Software Environment|COSE]] initiative in 1993 can be considered to be the first unification step, and the merger of the [[Open Software Foundation]] (OSF) and [[X/Open]] in 1996 as the ultimate step, in the end of those skirmishes. OSF had previously merged with [[UNIX International]] in 1994, meaning that the new entity effectively represented all elements of the Unix community of the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050601125916588 |title=The Daemon, the GNU and the Penguin|last=Salus|first=Peter H.|authorlink=Peter H.

In 1999, X.Org was formed to manage the X Window System, with management services provided by The Open Group. The X.Org members made a number of releases up to and including X11R6.8 while The Open Group provided management services. In 2004, X.Org and The Open Group worked together to establish the newly formed [[X.Org Foundation]] which then took control of the x.org domain name, and the stewardship of the X Window System. (See [[X Window System#History|history of the X Window System]].)\n\n== Programs ==\n\n=== Certification ===\nThe Open Group's best-known services are their certification programs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/certifications/ |title=Certifications |publisher=The Open Group |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> including certification for products and best practices: [[POSIX]], [[Lotteries in the United States|North American State Lotteries Association]] (NASPL)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opengroup.org/certifications/services-to-consortia |title=Certification For Consortia and Associations |publisher=The Open Group |accessdate=2014-01-11 }}</ref> and [[UNIX]].\n\nThe Open Group offers certifications for IT professionals. In addition to [[TOGAF]] certification which covers tools, services and people certification, The Open Group also administers the Open Group Certified Architect (Open CA)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.opengroup.org/certifications/professional/open-ca |title=Certified Architect (Open CA) Program |publisher=The Open Group |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> program and the Open Group Certified IT Specialist (Open CITS)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.opengroup.org/certifications/professional/open-cits |title=Certified IT Specialist (Open CITS) Program |publisher=The Open Group |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> certification program; the latter are skills and experience based certification programs.\nThe Open Group also offers certification for [[ArchiMate]] tools and people, as well as people certification for Open FAIR and [[IT4IT]].\n\n=== Member forums ===\n\nThe Open Group provides a platform for its members to discuss their requirements, and work jointly on development and adoption of industry standards, to facilitate enterprise integration.

The [[Common Open Software Environment|COSE]] initiative in 1993 can be considered to be the first unification step and the merger of the [[Open Software Foundation]] (OSF) and [[X/Open]] in 1996 as the ultimate step in the end of those skirmishes. OSF had previously merged with [[UNIX International]] in 1994, meaning that the new entity effectively represented all elements of the Unix community of the time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050601125916588 |title=The Daemon, the GNU and the Penguin|last=Salus|first=Peter H.|authorlink=Peter H.

The X.Org members made a number of releases up to and including X11R6.8 while The Open Group provided management services. In 2004, X.Org and The Open Group worked together to establish the newly formed [[X.Org Foundation]] which then took control of the x.org domain name, and the stewardship of the X Window System.

It is no. 470 in the edition by Muhammad Qazvini and Qasem Ghani (1941). In this poem, Hafez describes the torments of his desire for love and calls for wine to assuage his pain. In verses 3 and 5\u20137, a spiritual adviser reminds Hafez that such torments are a necessary stage on the path of love.\n\nThe ode has aroused the interest of commentators because of its clearly [[Sufism|Sufic]] language, and has been compared with the more famous [[Hafez's Shirazi Turk|Shirazi Turk]]  ''ghazal'' (no. 3 in the collection) for the light which it may throw on the interpretation of that poem. The mention of the \"Samarkandi Turk\" in this ode (a possible reference to the conqueror [[Timur|Tamerlane]]) has also been debated by scholars.\n\n==The metre==\n{{see|Persian metres}}\nThe metre is known as ''ramal'', based on the foot ''f\u0101'il\u0101tun, f\u0101'il\u0101tun, f\u0101'il\u0101tun, f\u0101'ilun''; it is a [[catalectic]] line, since the 4th foot of the pattern is shortened by one syllable. In Elwell-Sutton's classification, this metre is classified as 2.4.15. It is used in 39 of Hafez's 530 poems.<ref>Elwell-Sutton, (1976), p. 150.</ref> Here \"\u2013\" indicates a long, and \"u\" a short syllable in the metre.\n\n:| \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 |\n\nThe 11-syllable version of this metre, following its use in [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]]'s ''Manteqo-t-Teyr'' (''[[Conference of the Birds]]'') (12th century) and [[Rumi]]'s ''[[Masnavi|Mystical Masnavi]]'' (13th century), became one of the standard metres of mystical poetry in Persian.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 129.</ref>\n\n:| \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 |\n\nIn the transcription, \"overlong\" syllables, which take the place of a long + a short syllable in the metre, are underlined.\n\n==The poem==\nThe text given below is that of Muhammad Qazvini and Qasem Ghani (1941), which is the one most often quoted. Different manuscripts have different textual variants, however; for a list of these, see Bashiri (1979).

Works such as the translation of Hafez by H. Wilberforce Clarke (1891), in which every line is interpreted as having a mystical or allegorical meaning, are regarded with disfavour today.<ref>Yarshater (2006).</ref> \n\nHowever, for some scholars at least, ''Sine malamal'' cannot be understood except in terms of Sufism. In an article comparing this poem with the better-known [[Hafez's Shirazi Turk|Shirazi Turk]] ode, Iraj Bashiri (1979) argues that both poems describe the five stages in the path of Love, in Sufic tradition: loss of heart ({{lang|fa-Latn|foqd\u0101n-e del}}), regret ({{lang|fa-Latn|ta'assof}}), ecstasy ({{lang|fa-Latn|wajd}}), loss of patience ({{lang|fa-Latn|b\u012bsabr\u012b}}), and the ardour of love ({{lang|fa-Latn|sab\u0101bat}} or loss of consciousness {{lang|fa-Latn|b\u012bh\u016bsh\u012b}}). The true devotee who follows this path sacrifices himself and becomes annihilated in the Godhead.\n\nThere are themes in common between the two poems. In both, the poet calls for wine to soothe the pain of his love-sickness; in both, an elder advises Hafez that the world is too perplexing to understand; in both, the poet describes his lack of patience ({{lang|fa-Latn|sabr}}) and complains that the beloved pays no attention to his condition. However, in the second half of the poems the correspondence in themes is less obvious.\n\n==Notes on individual verses==\n===Verse 4===\nIn verse 4, \"I burnt in the well of patience\" is a reference to the story of [[Bijan and Manijeh]] in [[Ferdowsi]]'s epic poem, the [[Shahnameh]]. The young warrior, [[Bizhan (Shahnameh)|Bijan]], falls in love with a princess, Manijeh, but her father, Afrasiyab, the king of the Turanians, imprisons him in a well. Later he is rescued from the well by his grandfather, Rostam.\n\nThe same story is alluded to in ghazal 345, verse 5:<ref>Ganjoor [https://ganjoor.net/hafez/ghazal/sh345/ Ghazal 345].</ref><ref>Clarke (1891), [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.62301/page/n115/mode/2up vol. 2, p. 649].</ref>\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0634\u0627\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0686\u0648 \u067e\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u0647 \u0686\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u062e\u062a}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0633\u062a\u06af\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0631 \u0646\u0634\u0648\u062f \u0644\u0637\u0641 \u062a\u0647\u0645\u062a\u0646 \u0686\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u0645}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|\u0161\u0101h-e Tork\u0101n \u010do pasand\u012bd o be \u010d\u0101h-am 'and\u0101xt}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>dast</u>-g\u012br ar na\u0161avad lotf-e Tahamtan, \u010de konam?}}\n\n:Since it pleased the king of the Turks to throw me into a well,\n:if the favour of Tahamtan (= Rostam) doesn't come to my aid, what am I to do?\n\nThe story is also referred to in the narrative poem ''Il\u0101h\u012b-N\u0101ma'' or ''El\u0101h\u012b-N\u0101me'' of the 12th/13th-century Sufi poet [[Attar of Nishapur]], who gives it an allegorical interpretation. Attar explains that the situation of Bijan refers to the journey of the soul as it overcomes the evil forces within itself and travels from the sensual world to the spiritual one. Rostam represents the spiritual guide ({{lang|fa-Latn|p\u012br}}) who will help the troubled soul.<ref>Nematollahi (2018), p. 6.</ref> The guide will\n\n:\"Turn thy face from the deceitful Turkestan of nature towards the Iran of the Holy Law,\n:Guide thee to the [[Kay Khosrow]] of the soul and then place in thy hand the [[Cup of Jamshid|goblet of Jamshid]],<ref>For the cup of Jamshid, see [[S\u0101lh\u0101 del]], verse 1.</ref> \n:In order that in that goblet thou mayst see for ever with thy own eyes every single atom as clear as the sun.\"<ref>Translated by J.

Bashiri interprets this phrase as referring to the Beloved. The corresponding verse in [[Shirazi Turk]] similarly describes the ''y\u0101r'' (\"Beloved\") as having no need for Hafez's imperfect love.\n\n===Verse 6===\nIn verse 6, the word {{lang|fa-Latn|rend\u012b}} (\"libertinism\") is the abstract noun derived from {{lang|fa-Latn|rend}}. In his essay \"Hafez and ''rendi''\", [[Franklin Lewis]] writes:<ref>Lewis (2002).</ref>\n:\"{{lang|fa-Latn|Rend}}, variously translated in English as \u201crake, ruffian, pious rogue, brigand, libertine, lout, debauchee,\u201d etc., is the very antithesis of establishment propriety. The word originally signified something like a thug or mercenary gangster, and during the era of Hafez neighborhood warlords in Shiraz, commanding local urban militias of {{lang|fa-Latn|ronud}} (pl. of {{lang|fa-Latn|rend}}), played an influential role in stabilizing or destabilizing the ruler.\"\n\nIn Hafez's poetry the {{lang|fa-Latn|rend}} is always mentioned in an approving way. It is a person who \"may lack the piety of the piety-minded but is nevertheless more rightly-guided than they\" (Lewis). He represents the opposite of those figures that Hafez despises, the hypocritical preacher, the judge, and the sham Sufi.\n\nAs with other aspects of Hafez's poetry, it has been debated how far Hafez should be taken as literally praising a life of hedonism and wine-drinking, and how far his statements about wine, sin, music and pleasure are to be interpreted in a metaphorical or mystic sense.<ref>Lewis (2002), paragraphs 1\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Verse 8===\nIn verse 8 some scholars have suggested that the Samarkandi Turk is a reference to the conqueror [[Timur|Tamerlane]], whose capital was established at [[Samarkand]] in 1370; others take it in a metaphorical sense, referring to the Beloved. There is also some uncertainty as the original wording of this verse, and its position in the poem, since in some manuscripts it is the 3rd verse.\n\nIn the form which it comes here, the phrase {{lang|fa-Latn|b\u016by-e j\u016by-\u0113 M\u016bliy\u0101n \u0101yad ham\u012b}} is a direct quotation from the opening of a famous poem by the 9th/10th century poet [[Rudaki]]. However, this variant is only found in two out of 24 manuscripts which, according to Ingenito, \"are not philologically more relevant than the rest of the manuscript tradition\".<ref>Ingenito (2018), p. 24.</ref> There are in fact 12 variants of this line in the manuscripts. 11 of the manuscripts contain the word {{lang|fa-Latn|x\u016bn}} \"blood\" instead of {{lang|fa-Latn|j\u016by}} \"stream\", making it possible that the line originally read either:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06a9\u0632 \u0644\u0628\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0644\u0628\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0628\u0648\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|k-az lab\u0101n-a\u0161 b\u016by-e x\u016bn-\u0113 '\u0101\u0161eq\u0101n \u0101yad ham\u012b}}\n\n:\"since from his lips the smell of the blood of lovers comes continually\"\n\nor:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06a9\u0632 \u0646\u0633\u06cc\u0645\u0634 \u0628\u0648\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|k-az nas\u012bm-a\u0161 b\u016by-e x\u016bn-\u0113 M\u016bliy\u0101n \u0101yad ham\u012b}}\n\n:\"since from his breeze the smell of the blood of the Muliyan comes continually\"\n\nThe phrase {{lang|fa-Latn|x\u0101ter deh\u012bm}} is variously translated: \"Let us give our heart to\" (Clarke); \"Let us preoccupy ourselves with\" (Bashiri); \"Let us offer our devotion to\" (Ingenito); and others are possible.\n\nIf the \"Samarkandi Turk\" refers to [[Timur|Tamerlane]], Hafez is here complaining of the bloodshed of his conquests in the north, particularly his devastation of [[Khwarazm]] in 1379. Ingenito draws a parallel with another ''ghazal''<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/hafez/ghazal/sh440/ Ghazal 440 (Ganjoor)]; cf. Ingenito (2018), p. 25.</ref> where, according to a 15th-century commentator, Hafez made a change as a result of Tamerlane's conquest of Khwarazm.

For Bashiri, the Samarkandi Turk is simply another expression for the Beloved and the reference to blood refers to the sacrifice that takes place before the seeker is united with God.\n\nIf the variant where this verse is the third one is correct, the words {{lang|fa-Latn|\u012bn ah<u>w\u0101l</u> b\u012bn}} \"see these conditions\" would naturally refer to the political situation described.

In [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]]'s mystical allegorical poem ''Manteqo-t-Teyr'' ([[Conference of the Birds]]), completed in 1177, the Valley of Detachment ({{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0648\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0646\u0627}} {{lang|fa-Latn|v\u0101di-ye esteqn\u0101}}) is the fourth of the seven valleys that the birds must pass through in their mystic quest for union with God.<ref>Browne, E.

''A Literary History of Persia'' vol 2, p. 513.</ref>\n\nHafez's statement that, compared with the sea of God's love, the Seven Seas appear but a drop of dew recalls Attar's description of the Valley of Detachment in that poem:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/attar/manteghotteyr/vadi-esteghna/sh1 Attar, Valley of Detachment verse 3.]</ref>\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0647\u0641\u062a \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0634\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u062f}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0647\u0641\u062a \u0627\u062e\u06af\u0631 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0634\u0631\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u062f}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>haft</u> dary\u0101 yek \u0161amar '\u012bnj\u0101 bovad}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>haft</u> 'axgar yek \u0161arar '\u012bnj\u0101 bovad}}\n\n:\"Here (in the Valley of Detachment) the Seven Seas are but a small pool;\n:Here the Seven Pits of Hell are but a spark.\"\n\nInstead of {{lang|fa-Latn|esteqn\u0101-ye 'e\u0161q}} \"the self-sufficiency of (God's) love\" in this verse, some manuscripts have {{lang|fa-Latn|esteqn\u0101-ye d\u016bst}} \"the self-sufficiency of the Beloved\". In the Shirazi Turk poem, the adjectival form {{lang|fa-Latn|mostaqn\u012b}} \"self-sufficient\" is used to describe the indifference of the Beloved to Hafez's imperfect love.\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bashiri, Iraj (1979).

It is no. 470 in the edition by Muhammad Qazvini and Qasem Ghani (1941). In it, the poet sings of the torments of his desire for love and calls for wine to assuage his pain. In verses 3 and 5\u20137, a spiritual adviser reminds Hafez that such torments are a necessary stage on the path of love.\n\nThe ode has aroused the interest of commentators because of its clearly [[Sufism|Sufic]] language, and has been compared with the more famous [[Hafez's Shirazi Turk|Shirazi Turk]]  ''ghazal'' (no. 3 in the collection) for the light which it may throw on the interpretation of that poem. The mention of the \"Samarkandi Turk\" in this ode (a possible reference to the conqueror [[Timur|Tamerlane]]) has also been debated by scholars.\n\nAmong performers who have set the poem to music is the well-known singer in the classical style, [[Mohammad-Reza Shajarian]].\n\n==The metre==\n{{see|Persian metres}}\nThe metre is known as ''ramal'', based on the foot ''f\u0101'il\u0101tun, f\u0101'il\u0101tun, f\u0101'il\u0101tun, f\u0101'ilun''; it is a [[catalectic]] line, since the 4th foot of the pattern is shortened by one syllable. In Elwell-Sutton's classification, this metre is classified as 2.4.15. It is used in 39 of Hafez's 530 poems.<ref>Elwell-Sutton, (1976), p. 150.</ref> Here \"\u2013\" indicates a long, and \"u\" a short syllable in the metre.\n\n:| \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 |\n\nThe 11-syllable version of this metre, following its use in [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]]'s ''Manteqo-t-Teyr'' (''[[Conference of the Birds]]'') (12th century) and [[Rumi]]'s ''[[Masnavi|Mystical Masnavi]]'' (13th century), became one of the standard metres of mystical poetry in Persian.<ref>Thiesen (1982), p. 129.</ref>\n\n:| \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u \u2013 |\n\nIn the transcription, \"overlong\" syllables, which take the place of a long + a short syllable in the metre, are underlined.\n\n==The poem==\nThe text given below is that of Muhammad Qazvini and Qasem Ghani (1941), which is the one most often quoted. Different manuscripts have different textual variants, however; for a list of these, see Bashiri (1979).

Works such as the translation of Hafez by H. Wilberforce Clarke (1891), in which every line is interpreted as having a mystical or allegorical meaning, are regarded with disfavour today.<ref>Yarshater (2006).</ref> \n\nHowever, for some scholars at least, ''Sine malamal'' cannot be understood except in terms of Sufism. In an article comparing this poem with the better-known [[Hafez's Shirazi Turk|Shirazi Turk]] ode, Iraj Bashiri (1979) argues that both poems describe the five stages in the path of Love, in Sufic tradition: loss of heart ({{lang|fa-Latn|foqd\u0101n-e del}}), regret ({{lang|fa-Latn|ta'assof}}), ecstasy ({{lang|fa-Latn|wajd}}), loss of patience ({{lang|fa-Latn|b\u012bsabr\u012b}}), and the ardour of love ({{lang|fa-Latn|sab\u0101bat}} or loss of consciousness {{lang|fa-Latn|b\u012bh\u016bsh\u012b}}). The true devotee who follows this path sacrifices himself and becomes annihilated in the Godhead.\n\nThere are themes in common between the two poems. In both, the poet calls for wine to soothe the pain of his love-sickness; in both, an elder advises Hafez that the world is too perplexing to understand; in both, the poet describes his lack of patience ({{lang|fa-Latn|sabr}}) and complains that the beloved pays no attention to his condition. However, in the second half of the poems the correspondence in themes is less obvious.\n\n==Notes on individual verses==\n===Verse 4===\nIn verse 4, \"I burnt in the well of patience\" is a reference to the story of [[Bijan and Manijeh]] in [[Ferdowsi]]'s epic poem, the [[Shahnameh]]. The young warrior, [[Bizhan (Shahnameh)|Bijan]], falls in love with a princess, Manijeh, but her father, Afrasiyab, the king of the Turanians, imprisons him in a well. Later he is rescued from the well by his grandfather, Rostam.\n\nThe same story is alluded to in ghazal 345, verse 5:<ref>Ganjoor [https://ganjoor.net/hafez/ghazal/sh345/ Ghazal 345].</ref><ref>Clarke (1891), [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.62301/page/n115/mode/2up vol. 2, p. 649].</ref>\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0634\u0627\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0686\u0648 \u067e\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u0647 \u0686\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u062e\u062a}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0633\u062a\u06af\u06cc\u0631 \u0627\u0631 \u0646\u0634\u0648\u062f \u0644\u0637\u0641 \u062a\u0647\u0645\u062a\u0646 \u0686\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u0645}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|\u0161\u0101h-e Tork\u0101n \u010do pasand\u012bd o be \u010d\u0101h-am 'and\u0101xt}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>dast</u>-g\u012br ar na\u0161avad lotf-e Tahamtan, \u010de konam?}}\n\n:Since it pleased the king of the Turks to throw me into a well,\n:if the favour of Tahamtan (= Rostam) doesn't come to my aid, what am I to do?\n\nThe story is also found earlier in the narrative poem ''Il\u0101h\u012b-N\u0101ma'' or ''El\u0101h\u012b-N\u0101me'' of the 12th/13th-century Sufi poet [[Attar of Nishapur]]. In his allegorical interpretation, Attar explains that the situation of Bijan refers to the journey of the soul as it overcomes the evil forces within itself and travels from the sensual world to the spiritual one, all with the help of a master. The seeker is told:<ref>Nematollahi (2018), p. 6.</ref>\n\n:\"Turn thy face from the deceitful Turkestan of nature towards the Iran of the Holy Law,\n:Guide thee to the [[Kay Khosrow]] of the soul and then place in thy hand the [[Cup of Jamshid|goblet of Jamshid]],<ref>For the cup of Jamshid, see [[S\u0101lh\u0101 del]], verse 1.</ref> \n:In order that in that goblet thou mayst see for ever with thy own eyes every single atom as clear as the sun.\"<ref>Translated by J. S. Boyle (1976), The Il\u0101h\u012b-N\u0101ma or Book of God of Farid al-Din Attar, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nChegel is the name of a Turkish people in Central Asia known in Persian poetry for the extraordinary beauty of their youths.<ref>Yusofi (1990).</ref> The image of a candle to which a moth is drawn is another familiar metaphor of Persian poetry; so the \"candle of Chegel\" refers to a beautiful youth.\n\nImmediately after describing his loss of patience, Hafez complains that the \"King of the Turks\" is paying no attention to his state. Bashiri interprets this phrase as referring to the Beloved. The corresponding verse in [[Shirazi Turk]] similarly describes the ''y\u0101r'' (\"Beloved\") as having no need for Hafez's imperfect love.\n\n===Verse 6===\nIn verse 6, the word {{lang|fa-Latn|rend\u012b}} (\"libertinism\") is the abstract noun derived from {{lang|fa-Latn|rend}}. In his essay \"Hafez and ''rendi''\", [[Franklin Lewis]] writes:<ref>Lewis (2002).</ref>\n:\"{{lang|fa-Latn|Rend}}, variously translated in English as \u201crake, ruffian, pious rogue, brigand, libertine, lout, debauchee,\u201d etc., is the very antithesis of establishment propriety. The word originally signified something like a thug or mercenary gangster, and during the era of Hafez neighborhood warlords in Shiraz, commanding local urban militias of {{lang|fa-Latn|ronud}} (pl. of {{lang|fa-Latn|rend}}), played an influential role in stabilizing or destabilizing the ruler.\"\n\nIn Hafez's poetry the {{lang|fa-Latn|rend}} is always mentioned in an approving way. It is a person who \"may lack the piety of the piety-minded but is nevertheless more rightly-guided than they\" (Lewis). He represents the opposite of those figures that Hafez despises, the hypocritical preacher, the judge, and the sham Sufi.\n\nAs with other aspects of Hafez's poetry, it has been debated how far Hafez should be taken as literally praising a life of hedonism and wine-drinking, and how far his statements about wine, sin, music and pleasure are to be interpreted in a metaphorical or mystic sense.<ref>Lewis (2002), paragraphs 1\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Verse 8===\nIn verse 8 some scholars have suggested that the Samarkandi Turk is a reference to the conqueror [[Timur|Tamerlane]], whose capital was established at [[Samarkand]] in 1370; others take it in a metaphorical sense, referring to the Beloved. There is also some uncertainty as the original wording of this verse, and its position in the poem, since in some manuscripts it is the 3rd verse.\n\nIn the form which it comes here, the phrase {{lang|fa-Latn|b\u016by-e j\u016by-\u0113 M\u016bliy\u0101n \u0101yad ham\u012b}} is a direct quotation from the opening of a famous poem by the 9th/10th century poet [[Rudaki]]. However, this variant is only found in two out of 24 manuscripts which, according to Ingenito, \"are not philologically more relevant than the rest of the manuscript tradition\".<ref>Ingenito (2018), p. 24.</ref> There are in fact 12 variants of this line in the manuscripts. 11 of the manuscripts contain the word {{lang|fa-Latn|x\u016bn}} \"blood\" instead of {{lang|fa-Latn|j\u016by}} \"stream\", making it possible that the line originally read either:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06a9\u0632 \u0644\u0628\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0644\u0628\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0628\u0648\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|k-az lab\u0101n-a\u0161 b\u016by-e x\u016bn-\u0113 '\u0101\u0161eq\u0101n \u0101yad ham\u012b}}\n\n:\"since from his lips the smell of the blood of lovers comes continually\"\n\nor:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06a9\u0632 \u0646\u0633\u06cc\u0645\u0634 \u0628\u0648\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06cc}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|k-az nas\u012bm-a\u0161 b\u016by-e x\u016bn-\u0113 M\u016bliy\u0101n \u0101yad ham\u012b}}\n\n:\"since from his breeze the smell of the blood of the Muliyan comes continually\"\n\nThe phrase {{lang|fa-Latn|x\u0101ter deh\u012bm}} is variously translated: \"Let us give our heart to\" (Clarke); \"Let us preoccupy ourselves with\" (Bashiri); \"Let us offer our devotion to\" (Ingenito); and others are possible.\n\nIf the \"Samarkandi Turk\" refers to [[Timur|Tamerlane]], Hafez is here complaining of the bloodshed of his conquests in the north, particularly his devastation of [[Khwarazm]] in 1379. Ingenito draws a parallel with another ''ghazal''<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/hafez/ghazal/sh440/ Ghazal 440 (Ganjoor)]; cf. Ingenito (2018), p. 25.</ref> where, according to a 15th-century commentator, Hafez made a change as a result of Tamerlane's conquest of Khwarazm. According to this commentator, the original last verse in that poem was as follows:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u0647 \u0634\u0639\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0632 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0631\u0642\u0635\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0646\u0627\u0632\u0646\u062f}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0633\u06cc\u0647 \u0686\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0634\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0648 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0631\u0642\u0646\u062f\u06cc}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|be \u0161e'r-\u0113 H\u0101fez-\u0113 \u0160\u012b<u>r\u0101z</u> m\u012braqsand o m\u012bn\u0101zand}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|siah-\u010desm\u0101n-e Ka\u0161m\u012br\u012b vo Tork\u0101n-\u0113 Samarqand\u012b}}\n\n:\"To the poetry of Hafez of Shiraz dance and play the coquette\n:the Kashmiri dark-eyed ones and the Samarkandi Turks.\"\n\nBut fourteen of the 33 oldest manuscripts have a different version of this verse:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0644 \u0646\u062f\u0647 \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 \u060c \u0628\u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0622\u0646 \u0628\u06cc \u0648\u0641\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0647\u0627}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646\u062f\u060c \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0631\u0642\u0646\u062f\u06cc}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|be x\u016bb\u0101n del madeh, H\u0101fez! beb\u012bn \u0101n b\u012b-vaf\u0101'\u012bh\u0101}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|ke b\u0101 X\u0101razmi\u0101n kar<u>dand</u> Tork\u0101n-\u0113 Samarqand\u012b}}\n\n:\"Do not give your heart to beautiful ones, Hafez!

For Bashiri, the Samarkandi Turk is simply another expression for the Beloved and the reference to blood refers to the sacrifice that takes place before the seeker is united with God.\n\nIf the variant where this verse is the third one is correct, the words {{lang|fa-Latn|\u012bn ah<u>w\u0101l</u> b\u012bn}} \"see these conditions\" would naturally refer to the political situation described. Otherwise they refer to Hafez's love-sick state of mind.\n\n===Verse 9===\nIn the 9th verse, the Arabic word  {{lang|fa-Latn|esteqn\u0101}} ({{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0646\u0627}}) \"detachment, self-sufficiency, independence, abundance\", describing the vastness of God's love, has a special meaning in Sufism. In [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]]'s mystical allegorical poem ''Manteqo-t-Teyr'' ([[Conference of the Birds]]), completed in 1177, the Valley of Detachment ({{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0648\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0646\u0627}} {{lang|fa-Latn|v\u0101di-ye esteqn\u0101}}) is the fourth of the seven valleys that the birds must pass through in their mystic quest for union with God.<ref>Browne, E. G. (1906). ''A Literary History of Persia'' vol 2, p. 513.</ref>\n\nHafez's statement that, compared with the sea of God's love, the Seven Seas appear but a drop of dew recalls Attar's description of the Valley of Detachment in that poem:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/attar/manteghotteyr/vadi-esteghna/sh1 Attar, Valley of Detachment verse 3.]</ref>\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0647\u0641\u062a \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0634\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u062f}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0647\u0641\u062a \u0627\u062e\u06af\u0631 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0634\u0631\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0628\u0648\u062f}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>haft</u> dary\u0101 yek \u0161amar '\u012bnj\u0101 bovad}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|<u>haft</u> 'axgar yek \u0161arar '\u012bnj\u0101 bovad}}\n\n:\"Here (in the Valley of Detachment) the Seven Seas are but a small pool;\n:Here the Seven Pits of Hell are but a spark.\"\n\nInstead of {{lang|fa-Latn|esteqn\u0101-ye 'e\u0161q}} \"the self-sufficiency of (God's) love\" in this verse, some manuscripts have {{lang|fa-Latn|esteqn\u0101-ye d\u016bst}} \"the self-sufficiency of the Beloved\". In the Shirazi Turk poem, the adjectival form {{lang|fa-Latn|mostaqn\u012b}} \"self-sufficient\" is used to describe the indifference of the Beloved to Hafez's imperfect love.\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bashiri, Iraj (1979).
