[[William John Murphy]], a native of [[New Hartford, New York]], who resided in the town of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] in what was then known as the territory of Arizona, was in charge of building a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[Arizona Canal]] from Granite Reef to New River for the Arizona Canal Company. In 1885, he completed the canal, which would bring water to the desert land.<ref name=\"M\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=30433|title=William J.

His objective was to sell the land and water rights south of the canal. Murphy had to raise capital from out of state sources in order to meet payroll and construction expenses.<ref name=\"SLRP\"/> Murphy decided to refer to this land as \"Glendale\". In order to develop and interest potential investors and settlers in this new town, Murphy decided to provide a better way of access from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] to Glendale and ending in the town of [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]] by building an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} diagonal road which he named Grand Avenue.\n\nIn 1891, Burgess Hadsell worked with Murphy to bring 70 Brethren and River Brethren families to Glendale to form a temperance colony. Soon settlers, attracted by the town's ban on alcoholic beverages, continued to arrive. In 1895, Murphy platted the original town site and amended the plat to include a town park and some business lots.  It was bounded by Lamar Road on the south, 55th Avenue on the east, Myrtle Avenue on the north, and 59th Avenue on the west.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.glendaleaz.com/economicdevelopment/documents/CCMP.pdf|title=Glendale City Center Master Plan|publisher=glendaleaz.com}}</ref> The construction of a railroad from Prescott to Phoenix was made possible with an exchange of the right-of-way made by Murphy along Grand Avenue.<ref name=\"M\"/>  The railroad allowed Glendale settlers to transport goods to the north and easily receive building materials.\n\nThe construction and commercial applications of the Beet Sugar Factory in 1906, also contributed to the growth of Glendale. Though the operations of the factory only lasted until 1913, it played an important role in the increase of immigrant and migrant settlers in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://molokane.org/molokan/Locations/Americas/Arizona/Noon.htm|title=Beet Sugar Factory History, Glendale, Arizona|website=molokane.org}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nGlendale is located at {{Coord|33|32|19|N|112|11|11|W|type:city}} (33.538654, \u2212112.186261).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Phoenix weatherbox}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|55.8|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|55.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.13%) is water.\nHOT\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 1000\n|1920= 2737\n|1930= 3665\n|1940= 4855\n|1950= 8179\n|1960= 15893\n|1970= 36228\n|1980= 97172\n|1990= 147864\n|2000= 218812\n|2010= 226721\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=250702\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 226,710 people, 79,114 households, and 54,721 families residing in the city.

Both venues are part of the Glendale Sports and Entertainment District development plan, meant to spur growth in the sparsely inhabited Yucca district. Both venues are owned by the City of Glendale.\n\nState Farm Stadium has been the home field of the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in the [[National Football League]] since 2006, and the annual [[Fiesta Bowl]] college football game since 2007. Both the Cardinals and bowl game moved from [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the [[Arizona State University]] campus in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]. Since opening, the facility has brought two [[Super Bowl]]s, three college football national championship games, the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four]], [[WrestleMania XXVI]] and [[International Champions Cup]] soccer to Glendale. Designed by architect Peter Eisenman, the stadium was featured on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] TV series, ''[[Modern Marvels]]'' because of its roll-out natural grass field.\n\n[[Gila River Arena]] (formerly Glendale Arena, then Jobing.com Arena) and [[Westgate City Center]] is adjacent to State Farm Stadium, and is the home of the [[Arizona Coyotes]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). It was also the home of the now defunct [[Arizona Sting]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] (NLL). The inaugural [[Street League Skateboarding]] event was held in the summer of 2010 in Glendale at the Gila River Arena. This street skateboarding competition returns to Glendale annually.\n\nIn 2009, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[Chicago White Sox]]  of [[Major League Baseball]] began to share the new  [[Camelback Ranch|Camelback Ranch-Glendale]] spring training complex and stadium in Glendale owned and operated by the City of Glendale.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Glendale-1917 Nash Fire Truck.jpg|thumb|right|This 1917 Nash Fire Truck was the first motorized fire truck of the Glendale Fire Department.

[[William John Murphy]], a native of [[New Hartford, New York]], who resided in the town of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] in what was then known as the territory of Arizona, was in charge of building a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[Arizona Canal]] from Granite Reef to New River for the Arizona Canal Company. In 1885, he completed the canal, which would bring water to the desert land.<ref name=\"M\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=30433|title=William J. Murphy Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref> Murphy was deep in debt, since he had agreed to be paid in Arizona Canal Company stock and bonds and land instead of cash.<ref name=\"SLRP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.waterhistory.org/histories/reclamation/saltriver/|title=WaterHistory.org|website=www.waterhistory.org}}</ref>\n[[File:William John Murphy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William John Murphy \u2013 Founder of Glendale]]\nIn 1887, Murphy formed the Arizona Improvement Company. His objective was to sell the land and water rights south of the canal. Murphy had to raise capital from out of state sources in order to meet payroll and construction expenses.<ref name=\"SLRP\"/> Murphy decided to refer to this land as \"Glendale\". In order to develop and interest potential investors and settlers in this new town, Murphy decided to provide a better way of access from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] to Glendale and ending in the town of [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]] by building an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} diagonal road which he named Grand Avenue.\n\nIn 1891, Burgess Hadsell worked with Murphy to bring 70 Brethren and River Brethren families to Glendale to form a temperance colony. Soon settlers, attracted by the town's ban on alcoholic beverages, continued to arrive.

European colonisation commenced in 1793 with the issue of land grants in the area of Liberty Plains. In 1808, a grant was made to James Wilshire, which forms the largest part of the current suburb of Strathfield.  In 1867, this grant was subdivided and sold as the 'Redmire Estate', which promoted the residential development of the district under the suburb name of 'Redmire'. By 1885, sufficient numbers of people resided in the district to enable incorporation of its own local government.  The suburb of Redmire was renamed Strathfield c.1886.  The suburb was named after a house called 'Strathfield House', which was originally called ''Stratfield Saye''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Cathy|title=Origin of the name of Strathfield|url=http://strathfieldheritage.org/placenames/strathfield/origin-of-the-name-strathfield/|publisher=Strathfield Heritage Website|accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref> In 1885, Strathfield Council was incorporated.\n\n===Birth of Strathfield===\n[[File:Strathfield railway station estate.jpg|150px|right|thumb|On 31 October 1903 a subdivision of the Redmyre Estate was auctioned.

Ownership was transferred in 1824 to ex-convict Samuel Terry. The land became known as the Redmire Estate, which Michael Jones says could either be named after his home town in [[Yorkshire]] or could be named after the \"red clay of the Strathfield area\".<ref>Jones, Michael (1985). ''Oasis in the West: Strathfield's first hundred years.'' North Sydney: Allen & Unwin Australia. {{ISBN|0-86861-407-6}}.</ref> Subdivision of the land commenced in 1867. An early buyer was one-time Mayor of Sydney, Walter Renny who built in 1868 a house they called ''Stratfieldsaye'', possibly after the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington's]] mansion near [[Reading, Berkshire]]. It may have also been named after the transport ship of the same name that transported many immigrants \u2013 including [[Sir Henry Parkes]] \u2013 to Australia, though the transport ship was probably also named after the Duke's mansion as it was built soon after his death and was likely named in his honour. A plaque marking the location of ''Stratfield Saye'' can be found in the footpath of Strathfield Avenue, marking the approximate location of the original house [though some of the wording on the plaque is incorrect]. According to local historian Cathy Jones, \"ownership of [''Stratfieldsaye''] was transferred several times including to Davidson Nichol, who shortened the name to 'Strathfield House', then 'Strathfield'.\"<ref>\n Jones, Cathy (2004).

It is likely that the region was named Strathfield to neutralise the rivalry between Homebush and Redmire.  {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Strathfield Council===\n{{Main|Municipality of Strathfield}}\nStrathfield Council was incorporated in 1885 and included the suburbs of Redmire, Homebush and Druitt Town.  The adjoining area of Flemington was unincorporated and was annexed to Strathfield Council in 1892, which increased the size of the Council area by about 50%. The Council formed three wards \u2013 Flemington,Homebush and Strathfield \u2013 and Aldermen was elected to represent their ward at Council. Wards were abolished in 1916.<ref>Reps, John W.

Many styles of architecture have been employed over past decades, with dwellings having been constructed in [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Federation architecture|Federation]], [[Interwar period]] architecture, [[Californian Bungalow]] and contemporary periods. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} One of the oldest surviving houses built in the 1870s is Fairholm which is now a retirement village called [[Strathfield Gardens]].\n\nPrimarily these have been replaced by modern, multimillion-dollar mansions, although Strathfield has retained its wide avenues and most of the extensive natural vegetation. Streets such as Victoria Street, Llandillo Avenue and Kingsland Road predominantly feature older mansions, while Agnes Street, Newton Road and Barker Road are common locations for new homes.\n\nThe \"Golden Mile\" in Strathfield refers to a pocket within the suburb that houses some of the most desirable and highly sought-after real estate in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Strathfield \u2013 The Golden Mile|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/homes-in-strathfields-golden-mile-sell-for-more-than-2-million/story-fnd91nhy-1226924031456}}</ref> The Golden Mile is bounded by Hunter Street, Carrington Avenue,  Homebush Road and The Boulevarde.

A large proportion of Strathfield's population now dwells in apartments with the area immediately surrounding Strathfield railway station dominated by high rise residential towers.

European colonisation commenced in 1793 with the issue of land grants in the area of Liberty Plains. In 1808, a grant was made to James Wilshire, which forms the largest part of the current suburb of Strathfield.  In 1867, this grant was subdivided and sold as the 'Redmire Estate', which promoted the residential development of the district under the suburb name of 'Redmire'. By 1885, sufficient numbers of people resided in the district to enable incorporation of its own local government.  The suburb of Redmire was renamed Strathfield c.1886.  The suburb was named after a house called 'Strathfield House', which was originally called ''Stratfield Saye''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Cathy|title=Origin of the name of Strathfield|url=http://strathfieldheritage.org/placenames/strathfield/origin-of-the-name-strathfield/|publisher=Strathfield Heritage Website|accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref> In 1885, Strathfield Council was incorporated.\n\n===Birth of Strathfield===\n[[File:Strathfield railway station estate.jpg|150px|right|thumb|On 31 October 1903 a subdivision of the Redmyre Estate was auctioned.

Ownership was transferred in 1824 to ex-convict Samuel Terry. The land became known as the Redmire Estate, which Michael Jones says could either be named after his home town in [[Yorkshire]] or could be named after the \"red clay of the Strathfield area\".<ref>Jones, Michael (1985). ''Oasis in the West: Strathfield's first hundred years.'' North Sydney: Allen & Unwin Australia. {{ISBN|0-86861-407-6}}.</ref> Subdivision of the land commenced in 1867. An early buyer was one-time Mayor of Sydney, Walter Renny who built in 1868 a house they called ''Stratfieldsaye'', possibly after the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington's]] mansion near [[Reading, Berkshire]]. It may have also been named after the transport ship of the same name that transported many immigrants \u2013 including [[Sir Henry Parkes]] \u2013 to Australia, though the transport ship was probably also named after the Duke's mansion as it was built soon after his death and was likely named in his honour. A plaque marking the location of ''Stratfield Saye'' can be found in the footpath of Strathfield Avenue, marking the approximate location of the original house [though some of the wording on the plaque is incorrect]. According to local historian Cathy Jones, \"ownership of [''Stratfieldsaye''] was transferred several times including to Davidson Nichol, who shortened the name to 'Strathfield House', then 'Strathfield'.\"<ref>\n Jones, Cathy (2004).

In other words, totally normal scientific practice...This account was corroborated by the Chairman of the IPCC and by all of the other authors of the chapters. In fact, over 40 scientists were co-authors of this chapter. This letter was signed by Santer and 40 others and published in ''The Wall Street Journal'' in June 1996.

Negotiations occur over wording to ensure accuracy, balance, clarity of message, and relevance to understanding and policy. The IPCC process is dependent on the good will of the participants in producing a balanced assessment. However, in Shanghai, it appeared that there were attempts to blunt, and perhaps obfuscate, the messages in the report, most notably by Saudi Arabia. This led to very protracted debates over wording on even bland and what should be uncontroversial text... The most contentious paragraph in the IPCC (2001) SPM was the concluding one on attribution. After much debate, the following was carefully crafted: \"In the light of new evidence, and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Journal of the Forum for Environmental Law, Science, Engineering, and Finance|year=2001|issue=8\u201326|first=Kevin|last=Trenberth|authorlink=Kevin E.

The intimate relationships between text and image is enhanced when author and artist are one and the same person and engage in an inter-art discourse that leads to creations that are truly unified works of art. An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer. The work of Alexey Parygin have common features that are not accidental as the books were created at more or less the same time.\u201d<ref>Grigoryants El.

The intimate relationships between text and image is enhanced when author and artist are one and the same person and engage in an inter-art discourse that leads to creations that are truly unified works of art. An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer.
