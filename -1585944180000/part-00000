The university's iconic buildings act as symbols of wider Aberdeen, particularly Marischal College in the city centre and the [[crown steeple]] of King's College in [[Old Aberdeen]]. There are two campuses; the predominantly utilised King's College campus dominates the section of the city known as [[Old Aberdeen]], which is approximately two miles north of the city centre. Although the original site of the university's foundation, most academic buildings apart from the King's College Chapel and Quadrangle were constructed in the 20th century during a period of significant expansion. The university's [[Foresterhill]] campus is next to [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]] and houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine and Dentistry|School of Medicine and Dentistry]] as well as the School of Medical Sciences. Together these buildings comprise one of Europe's largest health campuses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-aberdeen/courses/medicine|title=Medicine - University of Aberdeen|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}</ref> The annual income of the institution for 2017\u201318 was \u00a3219.5&nbsp;million of which \u00a356.1&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of \u00a3226.8&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"accounts\"/>\n\nAberdeen has {{HESA student population|INSTID=0170}} students from undergraduate to doctoral level (as of {{HESA year}}), including many international students. An abundant range of disciplines are taught at the university, with 650 undergraduate degree programmes offered in the 2012\u201313 academic year. Many important figures in the field of theology were educated at the university, particularly in its earlier history, giving rise to the [[Aberdeen doctors]] in the 17th century and the prolific [[Scottish Enlightenment|enlightenment]] philosopher [[Thomas Reid]] in the 18th.

It is said to have been founded in 1157 by Edward, Bishop of Aberdeen, and although, according to Boece, it still existed at the period when King's College was founded, it is probable that it had in some way ceased to answer the purposes which it must have been designed to serve, since King James IV., in his letter to Pope Alexander VI., requesting him to found a University in Old Aberdeen, mentions as the chief motive for the undertaking, the profound ignorance of the inhabitants of the north of Scotland, and the great deficiency of properly educated men to fill the clerical office in that part of his kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gregory|first=William|title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland (1845)|publisher=|year=1845|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe first university in Aberdeen, [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], formally '''The University and King's College of Aberdeen (Collegium Regium Abredonense)''', was founded on 10th February 1494 by [[William Elphinstone]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]], [[Chancellor]] of Scotland, and a graduate of the [[University of Glasgow]] drafting a request on behalf of [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] to [[Pope Alexander VI]] resulting in a [[Papal Bull]] being issued.<ref name=\"foundation\" /> It seems that James was keen to ensure that Scotland had as many universities as England at the time, and it was to possess all the privileges enjoyed by those of Paris and Bologna, two of the most highly favoured in Europe.The university, modelled on that of the [[University of Paris]] and intended principally as a [[law school]], soon became the most famous and popular of the Scots seats of learning, largely due to the prestige of Elphinstone and his friend, [[Hector Boece]], the first principal appointed in 1500. Its aim was to train doctors, teachers and clergy who would serve the communities of northern Scotland, as well as lawyers and administrators for the Scottish Crown. It was a collegiate foundation with 36 full-time staff and students and walls protecting it from the outside world, and in 1497 it established the first chair of medicine in the English-speaking world. \n\nFollowing the [[Scottish Reformation]] in 1560, King's College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but in other respects was largely resistant to change. [[George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal|George Keith]], the fifth [[Earl Marischal]] was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of [[Peter Ramus]] and [[Andrew Melville]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |title=This Noble College: Building on the European tradition |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=20 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508105123/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In April 1593 he founded a second university in the city, [[Marischal College]]. It is also possible the founding of another college in nearby [[Fraserburgh]] by Sir Alexander Fraser, a business rival of Keith, was instrumental in its creation. Aberdeen was highly unusual at this time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century University prospectuses observed, Aberdeen had the same number as existed in England at the time (the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]]).\n[[File:Kings College, Aberdeen about 1661. Wellcome M0008087.jpg|alt=|thumb|An illustration of King's College in 1661.]]\nInitially, Marischal College offered the Principal of King's College a role in selecting its academics, but this was refused - the first blow in a developing rivalry. Marischal College, in the commercial heart of the city (rather than the ancient but much smaller collegiate enclave of Old Aberdeen), was quite different in nature and outlook. For example, it was more integrated into the life of the city, such as allowing students to live outwith the College. The two rival colleges often clashed, sometimes in court, but also in brawls between students on the streets of Aberdeen. [[Duncan Liddell]] endowed the first chair in mathematics at Marischal in 1613, but the first professor wasn't appointed until 1826.\n\nAs the institutions put aside their differences, a process of attempted (but unsuccessful) mergers began in the 17th century. During this time, both colleges made notable intellectual contributions to the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. Both colleges supported the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebellion and following the defeat of the [[1715 rising]] were largely purged by the authorities of their academics and officials.\n\n===King Charles' University (1641-61) and the merger of the two Colleges (1860)===\n[[File:Marischal College, Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 1548676.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College]]\nThe nearest the two colleges had come to full union was as the \"Caroline University of Aberdeen\", a merger initiated by [[Charles I of England|Charles I of Scotland]] in 1641, which united the two colleges for twenty years. Following the civil conflicts of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], a more complete unification was attempted following the ratification of Parliament by [[Oliver Cromwell]] during the [[English Interregnum|interregnum]] in 1654. This united university survived until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] whereby all laws made during this period were rescinded by [[Charles II of Scotland|Charles II]] and the two colleges reverted to independent status.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/statistical/kings.htm |title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland - Account of the University and King's College of Aberdeen |publisher=Electricscotland.com |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Charles I is still recognised as one of the university's founders, due to his part in creating the Caroline University and his benevolence towards King's College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/archive/2004/pr1311.hti |publisher=Public Relations, University of Aberdeen, pubrel@abdn.ac.uk |title=Founders' Day Service |date=9 November 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Further unsuccessful suggestions for union were brought about throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\" /> The evolving examination system now required much higher academic standards from the students. The two colleges in Aberdeen merged on 15 September 1860 in accordance with the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]], which also created a new medical school at Marischal College. The 1858 [[Act of Parliament]] stated the \"''united University shall take rank among the Universities of Scotland as from the date of erection of King's College and University.''\" The university is thus Scotland's third oldest and the United Kingdom's fifth oldest University.\n\n===The modern university===\nThe relationship of the two ex-college campuses has changed over the years. While at the time of unification each had approximately equal numbers of students, buildings at Marischal College began to be expanded in the late-19th century with a significant rebuilding effort completed in 1906. In the 20th century, the university expanded greatly, particularly at King's College. New buildings were constructed on the land around King's College throughout the 20th century. Initially, these were built to match the ancient buildings (e.g. the New King's lecture rooms and Elphinstone Hall), but later ones from the 1960s onward were constructed in [[Brutalism|brutalist]] style. Meanwhile, the Foresterhill campus began to train medical students in the 1930s next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n[[File:Sir Duncan Rice Library 2018-04-21.jpg|alt=|thumb|192x192px|Fa\u00e7ade of the Sir Duncan Rice Library in Old Aberdeen]]\nDuring the mid-20th century departments which had been at Marischal College moved into one of these new buildings (most at King's College) and by the late 20th-century Marischal College had been abandoned by all but the Anatomy Department, a graduation hall and the Marischal Museum ([[Marischal College]] has now been restored as the headquarters of Aberdeen City Council, which is leasing a portion of the complex from the university). Following extensive fundraising, a \u00a357 million new university library (the [[Sir Duncan Rice Library]]) opened in autumn 2011 at the King's College campus to replace the outgrown Queen Mother Library<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/library/about/main/|title=The Sir Duncan Rice Library |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> and was officially opened by the Queen in September 2012.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19707174|title=Queen opens new library at Aberdeen University|publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> Today, most students spend most of their time in modern buildings which provide up-to-date facilities for teaching, research and other activities such as dining. However, the old buildings at King's College are still in use as lecture and tutorial rooms and accommodation for various academic departments.\n\nIn February 2020, the [[Scottish Funding Council]] (SFC) found that in approving a financial settlement agreement with the former Principal [[Ian Diamond|Professor Sir Ian Diamond]], the university failed to make best use of public funds or exercise good governance. As a result of the investigation, the university was ordered to repay \u00a3119,000 of grant finance to the SFC and undertake an externally-facilitated examination of its governance and culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/aberdeen-told-repay-ps119k-over-ex-heads-gardening-leave|title=Aberdeen told to repay \u00a3119K over ex-head\u2019s \u2018gardening leave\u2019|last=Grove|first=Jack|date=18 February 2020|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\nThe original buildings of both colleges which united to form the university are much admired architectural features of Aberdeen. The main campus is now at King's College, where the original buildings are still in use in addition to many newer buildings of largely [[modernist]] style. A second campus at [[Foresterhill]] houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]].<ref name=\"estates\"/> In addition, there are smaller facilities at other sites such as the [[Royal Cornhill Hospital]] to the west of the city centre, and the [[Rowett Research Institute|Rowett Institute]] in [[Bucksburn]].\n\n===King's College===\n{{See also|King's College, Aberdeen}}\n[[File:AberdeenKingsCollegeChapel 2013-08.jpg|alt=|thumb|King's College quad|left]]\nThe King's College campus covers an area of some 35 hectares around the ancient [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] buildings and the High Street. It hosts around two-thirds of the university's built estate and most student facilities, and lies 2 miles north of [[Aberdeen]] city centre.<ref name=\"estates\"/> The university does not own all the buildings on the \"campus\" which also include private houses, shops and businesses (although many of these rely heavily on custom from the university community) and it is best thought of as a district of the city dominated by the university. It can be reached from the city centre by bus routes 1, 2, 13, 19 and 20 operated by [[First Aberdeen]] and from northern Aberdeenshire or the bus station at Union Square by various routes operated by [[Stagecoach Bluebird]].\n[[File:New King's, Old Aberdeen. - geograph.org.uk - 115911.jpg|alt=|thumb|New Building, King's College (\"New Kings\")]]\nThe historic King's College buildings form a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with interior court, two sides of which have been rebuilt and expanded with a library wing in the 19th century. The Crown Tower and the Chapel, the oldest parts, date from around 1500. The original foundation contained the Chapel, the Great Hall and living accommodation, with its own kitchen and brewery, a well in the quadrangle, and a college garden to provide herbs and vegetables. The Grammar School was just outside the walls, in front of the College. The Crown Tower is surmounted by a structure about 40&nbsp;ft (12 m) high, consisting of a six-sided lantern and Imperial crown, both sculptured, and resting on the intersections of two arched ornamental slips rising from the four corners of the top of the tower. This crown, also known as the \"Crown of Kings\", frequently acts as a symbol of the university. The [[choir]] of the chapel contains original oak-canopied stalls, miserere seats, and lofty open screens in the French flamboyant style. They were preserved by the college's Principal during the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], who fought off local barons who had attacked the nearby [[St Machar's Cathedral]].  The Cromwell Tower, created between 1658-1662 opposite the Crown Tower, was originally built as residential accommodation, but an observatory was built on top in 1826.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/nph120/astro/cto/histcrom.htm|title=History of the Cromwell Tower Observatory|last=|first=|date=|website=Aberdeen University History|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The library wing was converted into an exhibition and conference venue in the 1990s and today also houses the university's Business School.\nThe first of the modern age of construction in the King's campus began with the construction in 1913 of the New Building (now known as ''\"New King's\"''), largely in a similar architectural style to the old buildings. New King's groups to form a yet larger quadrangle-like green for the campus also bordered by the High Street, King's and [[Elphinstone Hall]], a traditional 1930 replacement for the Great Hall. The Elphinstone Hall was subsequently used as a dining facility but is now used for graduations, examinations, fairs, and other large university events.\n\nHowever, most students and staff spend relatively little time in these historic buildings, with a large number of modern ones housing most facilities and academic departments. Most date from the second half of the 20th century. Some of these echo the existing architecture of [[Old Aberdeen]], such as the Fraser Noble Building with its distinctive concrete crown designed to resemble the one adorning King's College. Other buildings were constructed of stone in the 1950s (e.g. the Taylor Building and Meston Building). A number of other buildings are designed in the [[Brutalism|brutalist style]], such as the Arts Lecture Theatre and adjoining William Guild Building, opened in 1969 to house the School of Psychology. Also on the site is the [[Cruickshank Botanic Garden]] which was presented to the university in 1899 and is open to the public.\n\n[[File:Aberdeen University Library interior atrium, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK.JPG|thumb|Atrium of the main Sir Duncan Rice Library at King's College campus, looking up]]The most recent building on campus is the Sir Duncan Rice Library, completed in 2011 and designed by Danish architects [[Schmidt Hammer Lassen]]. It was officially opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in September 2012 and named after [[Duncan Rice]], a previous Principal of the university.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\" /> This seven-storey tower, clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass, replaced the smaller Queen Mother Library as the university's main library and can be seen prominently from the entire campus and much of the city. It is open to the public and outstanding views of the city and coastline are available from the upper floors. In addition to expanded facilities it also houses public exhibition space and the university's historic collections, comprising more than a quarter of a million ancient and priceless books and manuscripts collected over five centuries since the university's foundations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/release.php?id=530|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=13 August 2009|title=Press Release: 'Flagship library project to match academic ambitions' leads next phase of University\u2019s infrastructure investment}}</ref> Other libraries are in the Taylor Building on the same campus (for law books and materials) and at Foresterhill (for medicine and medical sciences). The university's library service (i.e. including all libraries) holds over one million books.\n\n===Marischal College===\n{{See also|Marischal College}}\n[[File:Marischal College - panoramio (1).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College (following restoration in 2011)]]\n[[Marischal College]] is a [[neo-Gothic]] building, having been rebuilt in 1836\u201341, and greatly extended several years later. Formerly an open three-sided court, the college now forms a quadrangle as additions to the buildings were opened by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1906 and form the current facade from Broad Street. The building is widely considered to be one of the best examples of neo-Gothic [[architecture]] in Great Britain; the architect, [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]] was a native of Aberdeen as well as an alumnus of the university. The Mitchell Tower at the rear is named for the benefactor (Dr [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]]) who paid for the graduation hall. The opening of this tower in 1895 was part of celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the university.\n\nUntil 1996, Marischal College housed the Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Biomedical Sciences, which had been there for many decades. From 1996, the departments moved to Kings College campus and Foresterhill campus.  Teaching no longer takes place at Marischal College, with many of the departments formerly based there having moved to King's College some decades previously. While graduations and other events (e.g. concerts) took place in the cathedral-like Mitchell Hall in the north wing, for many years much of the building (including the frontage to the street) was derelict. A restoration project was completed in 2011 and restored the building and its ornamentation. The Broad Street frontage is now on long-term lease to [[Aberdeen City Council]] and forms the administrative headquarters for the city, replacing the ageing St. Nicholas House across the street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/about/campus/marischal-college-394.php|title=Marischal College {{!}} About {{!}} The University of Aberdeen|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> The project provided modernized public facilities and office accommodation for the Council as well as cosmetic rejuvenation, and involved the demolition and reconstruction of internal spaces while retaining and restoring the outer walls and windows. The university controls the north wing of the building containing the Marischal Museum and Mitchell Hall which was used in the past for graduation and other academic ceremonies.<ref name=\"estates\"/> Graduations take place at [[Elphinstone Hall]] at King's College.\n\n===Other campuses===\n====Doha, Qatar====\nA new state of the art campus has been established in Doha, Qatar since May 2017. They have expanded their School of Business to Qatar. The courses currently offered are Accounting & finance and Business Management. The first batch started on 10 September 2017.\nThe university requirements are the same as those in the Kings College Campus which are A<sup>*</sup>ABB to AAAB. These students will be the first ones to graduate at a campus abroad.\nThe current dean of the college is Brian Buckley. The Provost is Dr Karen Foster.\n\n[[File:Kingscollegeaberdeen2.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to King's College Quadrangle]]\n\n====Foresterhill====\nThe Foresterhill site contains the university's [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]], Medical Library and associated modern buildings for teaching and research. The School includes the Rowett Institute of Nutrition, the Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, Institute of Dentistry, and Institute of Education for Medical & Dental Sciences. It is at Foresterhill, in Aberdeen's West End. It became part of the university's holdings in 1938 following the move of the Medical School and forms part of a modern teaching hospital complex alongside the [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]]. The 41 hectare site is split between the university (owning around a third) and [[NHS Scotland|NHS Grampian]].<ref name=\"estates\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/estates/strategy.shtml|publisher=University Estates Office|accessdate=13 August 2009|title=Estate Strategy 2002-2007}}</ref>\n\n====Hilton====\nA small campus at Hilton became part of the university estate following a merger in 2001 between the university and the Aberdeen campus of the Northern College, and temporarily became home to the university's Faculty of Education.

This gives the university a tripartite constitution comprising the [[General Council (Scottish university)|General Council]] of senior academics and graduates, the [[University Court]] responsible for finances and administration, and the [[Academic Senate]] (''Senatus Academicus'')--the university's supreme academic body.\n[[File:Elphinstone Hall Wiki.jpg|left|thumb|Elphinstone Hall]]\nThere are correspondingly three main officers of the university. It is nominally headed by the [[University Chancellor|Chancellor]], a largely ceremonial position traditionally held by the [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] but divorced from the see as a result of the [[Scottish Reformation]] and holders are now elected for life by the General Council. There is also a [[Rector of the University of Aberdeen|rector of the university]], who chairs the University Court and is elected by the students for a three-year term to represent their interests. There are also four Assessors, ten Masters, including the Principal and Vice Principal, and the factor or Procurator.\n\nThe administrative head and [[chief executive]] of the university is its [[University Principal|principal and vice chancellor]]. The principal acts as chair of the ''Senatus Academicus'', and his status as [[vice chancellor]] enables him to perform the functions reserved to the chancellor in the latter's absence, such as the awarding of degrees.\n\n====Chancellor====\n[[File:Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall - ABr 1831JC143a.jpg|thumb|150x150px|[[Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay]]]]\nThe [[Chancellor (university)|chancellor]] is the nominal head of the university.

Academic dress is usually worn only at formal occasions, such as at graduation, Founder's Day, or academic processions which take place for ceremonial reasons. For undergraduate degrees (e.g. MA, BSc, LLB etc.), a long black gown is worn with a hood of black silk and lined with silk in a colour which varies depending on discipline. For example, the lining is white silk for all [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degrees, green silk for [[Bachelor of Science]] in pure sciences, and crimson silk for [[MBChB]]. A black mortarboard is also worn. For master's degrees (e.g. [[MSc]], MLitt etc.) a long black gown is worn, with a white silk hood lined in a colour that varies by discipline.

There are two campuses; the predominantly utilised King's College campus dominates the section of the city known as [[Old Aberdeen]], which is approximately two miles north of the city centre. Although the original site of the university's foundation, most academic buildings apart from the King's College Chapel and Quadrangle were constructed in the 20th century during a period of significant expansion. The university's [[Foresterhill]] campus is next to [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]] and houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine and Dentistry|School of Medicine and Dentistry]] as well as the School of Medical Sciences. Together these buildings comprise one of Europe's largest health campuses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-aberdeen/courses/medicine|title=Medicine - University of Aberdeen|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}</ref> The annual income of the institution for 2017\u201318 was \u00a3219.5&nbsp;million of which \u00a356.1&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of \u00a3226.8&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"accounts\"/>\n\nAberdeen has {{HESA student population|INSTID=0170}} students from undergraduate to doctoral level (as of {{HESA year}}), including many international students. An abundant range of disciplines are taught at the university, with 650 undergraduate degree programmes offered in the 2012\u201313 academic year. Many important figures in the field of theology were educated at the university, particularly in its earlier history, giving rise to the [[Aberdeen doctors]] in the 17th century and the prolific [[Scottish Enlightenment|enlightenment]] philosopher [[Thomas Reid]] in the 18th.

It is said to have been founded in 1157 by Edward, Bishop of Aberdeen, and although, according to Boece, it still existed at the period when King's College was founded, it is probable that it had in some way ceased to answer the purposes which it must have been designed to serve, since King James IV., in his letter to Pope Alexander VI., requesting him to found a University in Old Aberdeen, mentions as the chief motive for the undertaking, the profound ignorance of the inhabitants of the north of Scotland, and the great deficiency of properly educated men to fill the clerical office in that part of his kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gregory|first=William|title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland (1845)|publisher=|year=1845|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe first university in Aberdeen, [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], formally '''The University and King's College of Aberdeen (Collegium Regium Abredonense)''', was founded in February 1495 by [[William Elphinstone]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]], [[Chancellor]] of Scotland, and a graduate of the [[University of Glasgow]] drafting a request on behalf of [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] to [[Pope Alexander VI]] resulting in a [[Papal Bull]] being issued.<ref name=\"foundation\" /> It seems that James was keen to ensure that Scotland had as many universities as England at the time. The university, modelled on that of the [[University of Paris]] and intended principally as a [[law school]], soon became the most famous and popular of the Scots seats of learning, largely due to the prestige of Elphinstone and his friend, [[Hector Boece]], the first principal appointed in 1500. Its aim was to train doctors, teachers and clergy who would serve the communities of northern Scotland, as well as lawyers and administrators for the Scottish Crown. It was a collegiate foundation with 36 staff and students and walls protecting it from the outside world, and in 1497 it established the first chair of medicine in the English-speaking world. \n\nFollowing the [[Scottish Reformation]] in 1560, King's College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but in other respects was largely resistant to change. [[George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal|George Keith]], the fifth [[Earl Marischal]] was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of [[Peter Ramus]] and [[Andrew Melville]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |title=This Noble College: Building on the European tradition |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=20 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508105123/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In April 1593 he founded a second university in the city, [[Marischal College]]. It is also possible the founding of another college in nearby [[Fraserburgh]] by Sir Alexander Fraser, a business rival of Keith, was instrumental in its creation. Aberdeen was highly unusual at this time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century University prospectuses observed, Aberdeen had the same number as existed in England at the time (the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]]).\n[[File:Kings College, Aberdeen about 1661. Wellcome M0008087.jpg|alt=|thumb|An illustration of King's College in 1661.]]\nInitially, Marischal College offered the Principal of King's College a role in selecting its academics, but this was refused - the first blow in a developing rivalry. Marischal College, in the commercial heart of the city (rather than the ancient but much smaller collegiate enclave of Old Aberdeen), was quite different in nature and outlook. For example, it was more integrated into the life of the city, such as allowing students to live outwith the College. The two rival colleges often clashed, sometimes in court, but also in brawls between students on the streets of Aberdeen. [[Duncan Liddell]] endowed the first chair in mathematics at Marischal in 1613, but the first professor wasn't appointed until 1826.\n\nAs the institutions put aside their differences, a process of attempted (but unsuccessful) mergers began in the 17th century. During this time, both colleges made notable intellectual contributions to the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. Both colleges supported the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebellion and following the defeat of the [[1715 rising]] were largely purged by the authorities of their academics and officials.\n\n===King Charles' University (1641-61) and the merger of the two Colleges (1860)===\n[[File:Marischal College, Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 1548676.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College]]\nThe nearest the two colleges had come to full union was as the \"Caroline University of Aberdeen\", a merger initiated by [[Charles I of England|Charles I of Scotland]] in 1641, which united the two colleges for twenty years. Following the civil conflicts of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], a more complete unification was attempted following the ratification of Parliament by [[Oliver Cromwell]] during the [[English Interregnum|interregnum]] in 1654. This united university survived until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] whereby all laws made during this period were rescinded by [[Charles II of Scotland|Charles II]] and the two colleges reverted to independent status.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/statistical/kings.htm |title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland - Account of the University and King's College of Aberdeen |publisher=Electricscotland.com |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Charles I is still recognised as one of the university's founders, due to his part in creating the Caroline University and his benevolence towards King's College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/archive/2004/pr1311.hti |publisher=Public Relations, University of Aberdeen, pubrel@abdn.ac.uk |title=Founders' Day Service |date=9 November 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Further unsuccessful suggestions for union were brought about throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\" /> The two colleges in Aberdeen merged on 15 September 1860 in accordance with the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]], which also created a new medical school at Marischal College. The 1858 [[Act of Parliament]] stated the \"''united University shall take rank among the Universities of Scotland as from the date of erection of King's College and University.''\" The university is thus Scotland's third oldest and the United Kingdom's fifth oldest University.\n\n===The modern university===\nThe relationship of the two ex-college campuses has changed over the years. While at the time of unification each had approximately equal numbers of students, buildings at Marischal College began to be expanded in the late-19th century with a significant rebuilding effort completed in 1906. In the 20th century, the university expanded greatly, particularly at King's College. New buildings were constructed on the land around King's College throughout the 20th century. Initially, these were built to match the ancient buildings (e.g. the New King's lecture rooms and Elphinstone Hall), but later ones from the 1960s onward were constructed in [[Brutalism|brutalist]] style. Meanwhile, the Foresterhill campus began to train medical students in the 1930s next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n[[File:Sir Duncan Rice Library 2018-04-21.jpg|alt=|thumb|192x192px|Fa\u00e7ade of the Sir Duncan Rice Library in Old Aberdeen]]\nDuring the mid-20th century departments which had been at Marischal College moved into one of these new buildings (most at King's College) and by the late 20th-century Marischal College had been abandoned by all but the Anatomy Department, a graduation hall and the Marischal Museum ([[Marischal College]] has now been restored as the headquarters of Aberdeen City Council, which is leasing a portion of the complex from the university). Following extensive fundraising, a \u00a357 million new university library (the [[Sir Duncan Rice Library]]) opened in autumn 2011 at the King's College campus to replace the outgrown Queen Mother Library<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/library/about/main/|title=The Sir Duncan Rice Library |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> and was officially opened by the Queen in September 2012.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19707174|title=Queen opens new library at Aberdeen University|publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> Today, most students spend most of their time in modern buildings which provide up-to-date facilities for teaching, research and other activities such as dining. However, the old buildings at King's College are still in use as lecture and tutorial rooms and accommodation for various academic departments.\n\nIn February 2020, the [[Scottish Funding Council]] (SFC) found that in approving a financial settlement agreement with the former Principal [[Ian Diamond|Professor Sir Ian Diamond]], the university failed to make best use of public funds or exercise good governance. As a result of the investigation, the university was ordered to repay \u00a3119,000 of grant finance to the SFC and undertake an externally-facilitated examination of its governance and culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/aberdeen-told-repay-ps119k-over-ex-heads-gardening-leave|title=Aberdeen told to repay \u00a3119K over ex-head\u2019s \u2018gardening leave\u2019|last=Grove|first=Jack|date=18 February 2020|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\nThe original buildings of both colleges which united to form the university are much admired architectural features of Aberdeen. The main campus is now at King's College, where the original buildings are still in use in addition to many newer buildings of largely [[modernist]] style. A second campus at [[Foresterhill]] houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]].<ref name=\"estates\"/> In addition, there are smaller facilities at other sites such as the [[Royal Cornhill Hospital]] to the west of the city centre, and the [[Rowett Research Institute|Rowett Institute]] in [[Bucksburn]].\n\n===King's College===\n{{See also|King's College, Aberdeen}}\n[[File:AberdeenKingsCollegeChapel 2013-08.jpg|alt=|thumb|King's College quad|left]]\nThe King's College campus covers an area of some 35 hectares around the ancient [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] buildings and the High Street. It hosts around two-thirds of the university's built estate and most student facilities, and lies 2 miles north of [[Aberdeen]] city centre.<ref name=\"estates\"/> The university does not own all the buildings on the \"campus\" which also include private houses, shops and businesses (although many of these rely heavily on custom from the university community) and it is best thought of as a district of the city dominated by the university. It can be reached from the city centre by bus routes 1, 2, 13, 19 and 20 operated by [[First Aberdeen]] and from northern Aberdeenshire or the bus station at Union Square by various routes operated by [[Stagecoach Bluebird]].\n[[File:New King's, Old Aberdeen. - geograph.org.uk - 115911.jpg|alt=|thumb|New Building, King's College (\"New Kings\")]]\nThe historic King's College buildings form a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with interior court, two sides of which have been rebuilt and expanded with a library wing in the 19th century. The Crown Tower and the Chapel, the oldest parts, date from around 1500. The original foundation contained the Chapel, the Great Hall and living accommodation, with its own kitchen and brewery, a well in the quadrangle, and a college garden to provide herbs and vegetables. The Grammar School was just outside the walls, in front of the College. The Crown Tower is surmounted by a structure about 40&nbsp;ft (12 m) high, consisting of a six-sided lantern and Imperial crown, both sculptured, and resting on the intersections of two arched ornamental slips rising from the four corners of the top of the tower. This crown, also known as the \"Crown of Kings\", frequently acts as a symbol of the university. The [[choir]] of the chapel contains original oak-canopied stalls, miserere seats, and lofty open screens in the French flamboyant style. They were preserved by the college's Principal during the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], who fought off local barons who had attacked the nearby [[St Machar's Cathedral]].  The Cromwell Tower, created between 1658-1662 opposite the Crown Tower, was originally built as residential accommodation, but an observatory was built on top in 1826.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/nph120/astro/cto/histcrom.htm|title=History of the Cromwell Tower Observatory|last=|first=|date=|website=Aberdeen University History|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The library wing was converted into an exhibition and conference venue in the 1990s and today also houses the university's Business School.\nThe first of the modern age of construction in the King's campus began with the construction in 1913 of the New Building (now known as ''\"New King's\"''), largely in a similar architectural style to the old buildings. New King's groups to form a yet larger quadrangle-like green for the campus also bordered by the High Street, King's and [[Elphinstone Hall]], a traditional 1930 replacement for the Great Hall. The Elphinstone Hall was subsequently used as a dining facility but is now used for graduations, examinations, fairs, and other large university events.\n\nHowever, most students and staff spend relatively little time in these historic buildings, with a large number of modern ones housing most facilities and academic departments. Most date from the second half of the 20th century. Some of these echo the existing architecture of [[Old Aberdeen]], such as the Fraser Noble Building with its distinctive concrete crown designed to resemble the one adorning King's College. Other buildings were constructed of stone in the 1950s (e.g. the Taylor Building and Meston Building). A number of other buildings are designed in the [[Brutalism|brutalist style]], such as the Arts Lecture Theatre and adjoining William Guild Building, opened in 1969 to house the School of Psychology. Also on the site is the [[Cruickshank Botanic Garden]] which was presented to the university in 1899 and is open to the public.\n\n[[File:Aberdeen University Library interior atrium, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK.JPG|thumb|Atrium of the main Sir Duncan Rice Library at King's College campus, looking up]]The most recent building on campus is the Sir Duncan Rice Library, completed in 2011 and designed by Danish architects [[Schmidt Hammer Lassen]]. It was officially opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in September 2012 and named after [[Duncan Rice]], a previous Principal of the university.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\" /> This seven-storey tower, clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass, replaced the smaller Queen Mother Library as the university's main library and can be seen prominently from the entire campus and much of the city. It is open to the public and outstanding views of the city and coastline are available from the upper floors. In addition to expanded facilities it also houses public exhibition space and the university's historic collections, comprising more than a quarter of a million ancient and priceless books and manuscripts collected over five centuries since the university's foundations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/release.php?id=530|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=13 August 2009|title=Press Release: 'Flagship library project to match academic ambitions' leads next phase of University\u2019s infrastructure investment}}</ref> Other libraries are in the Taylor Building on the same campus (for law books and materials) and at Foresterhill (for medicine and medical sciences). The university's library service (i.e. including all libraries) holds over one million books.\n\n===Marischal College===\n{{See also|Marischal College}}\n[[File:Marischal College - panoramio (1).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College (following restoration in 2011)]]\n[[Marischal College]] is a [[neo-Gothic]] building, having been rebuilt in 1836\u201341, and greatly extended several years later. Formerly an open three-sided court, the college now forms a quadrangle as additions to the buildings were opened by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1906 and form the current facade from Broad Street. The building is widely considered to be one of the best examples of neo-Gothic [[architecture]] in Great Britain; the architect, [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]] was a native of Aberdeen as well as an alumnus of the university. The Mitchell Tower at the rear is named for the benefactor (Dr [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]]) who paid for the graduation hall. The opening of this tower in 1895 was part of celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the university.\n\nUntil 1996, Marischal College housed the Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Biomedical Sciences, which had been there for many decades. From 1996, the departments moved to Kings College campus and Foresterhill campus.  Teaching no longer takes place at Marischal College, with many of the departments formerly based there having moved to King's College some decades previously. While graduations and other events (e.g. concerts) took place in the cathedral-like Mitchell Hall in the north wing, for many years much of the building (including the frontage to the street) was derelict. A restoration project was completed in 2011 and restored the building and its ornamentation. The Broad Street frontage is now on long-term lease to [[Aberdeen City Council]] and forms the administrative headquarters for the city, replacing the ageing St. Nicholas House across the street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/about/campus/marischal-college-394.php|title=Marischal College {{!}} About {{!}} The University of Aberdeen|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> The project provided modernized public facilities and office accommodation for the Council as well as cosmetic rejuvenation, and involved the demolition and reconstruction of internal spaces while retaining and restoring the outer walls and windows. The university controls the north wing of the building containing the Marischal Museum and Mitchell Hall which was used in the past for graduation and other academic ceremonies.<ref name=\"estates\"/> Graduations take place at [[Elphinstone Hall]] at King's College.\n\n===Other campuses===\n====Doha, Qatar====\nA new state of the art campus has been established in Doha, Qatar since May 2017. They have expanded their School of Business to Qatar. The courses currently offered are Accounting & finance and Business Management. The first batch started on 10 September 2017.\nThe university requirements are the same as those in the Kings College Campus which are A<sup>*</sup>ABB to AAAB. These students will be the first ones to graduate at a campus abroad.\nThe current dean of the college is Brian Buckley. The Provost is Dr Karen Foster.\n\n[[File:Kingscollegeaberdeen2.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to King's College Quadrangle]]\n\n====Foresterhill====\nThe Foresterhill site contains the university's [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]], Medical Library and associated modern buildings for teaching and research. The School includes the Rowett Institute of Nutrition, the Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, Institute of Dentistry, and Institute of Education for Medical & Dental Sciences. It is at Foresterhill, in Aberdeen's West End. It became part of the university's holdings in 1938 following the move of the Medical School and forms part of a modern teaching hospital complex alongside the [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]]. The 41 hectare site is split between the university (owning around a third) and [[NHS Scotland|NHS Grampian]].<ref name=\"estates\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/estates/strategy.shtml|publisher=University Estates Office|accessdate=13 August 2009|title=Estate Strategy 2002-2007}}</ref>\n\n====Hilton====\nA small campus at Hilton became part of the university estate following a merger in 2001 between the university and the Aberdeen campus of the Northern College, and temporarily became home to the university's Faculty of Education.

This gives the university a tripartite constitution comprising the [[General Council (Scottish university)|General Council]] of senior academics and graduates, the [[University Court]] responsible for finances and administration, and the [[Academic Senate]] (''Senatus Academicus'')--the university's supreme academic body.\n[[File:Elphinstone Hall Wiki.jpg|left|thumb|Elphinstone Hall]]\nThere are correspondingly three main officers of the university. It is nominally headed by the [[University Chancellor|Chancellor]], a largely ceremonial position traditionally held by the [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] but divorced from the see as a result of the [[Scottish Reformation]] and holders are now elected for life by the General Council. There is also a [[Rector of the University of Aberdeen|rector of the university]], who chairs the University Court and is elected by the students for a three-year term to represent their interests.\n\nThe administrative head and [[chief executive]] of the university is its [[University Principal|principal and vice chancellor]]. The principal acts as chair of the ''Senatus Academicus'', and his status as [[vice chancellor]] enables him to perform the functions reserved to the chancellor in the latter's absence, such as the awarding of degrees.\n\n====Chancellor====\n[[File:Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall - ABr 1831JC143a.jpg|thumb|150x150px|[[Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay]]]]\nThe [[Chancellor (university)|chancellor]] is the nominal head of the university.

For undergraduate degrees (e.g. MA, BSc, LLB etc.), a long black gown is worn with a hood of black silk and lined with silk in a colour which varies depending on discipline. For example, the lining is white silk for all [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degrees, green silk for [[Bachelor of Science]] in pure sciences, and crimson silk for [[MBChB]]. A black mortarboard is also worn. For master's degrees (e.g. [[MSc]], MLitt etc.) a long black gown is worn, with a white silk hood lined in a colour that varies by discipline. For [[PhD]], the doctor's scarlet robe is worn with black facings and sleeve lining, along with a black \"John Knox\" cap. For other doctoral degrees (e.g. EdD, LLD etc.), the scarlet robe has facings and sleeve linings in a different colour.\n\n==Academic profile==\n\n===Rankings and reputation===\n\n{{Infobox UK university rankings\n| ARWU_N = 21-28\n| ARWU_W = 201-300\n| QS_N = 23=\n| QS_W = 194\n| THE_N = 28\n| THE_W = 168\n| LEIDEN_W = 107\n| LINE_1 = 0\n| Complete = 29\n| The_Guardian = 34\n| Times/Sunday_Times = 27\n}}\n{{further|Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom}}Aberdeen is consistently ranked among the top 200 universities in the world<ref name=\":0\" /> and is ranked within the top 30 universities in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> In the 2019 ''Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings'', Aberdeen was ranked 31st in the world for impact on society.<ref name=\":3\" /> Aberdeen was also named the 2019 Scottish University of the Year by The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its highest internationally ranked subject is Divinity and Religious Studies, which is ranked at 34th in the world<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2019/theology-divinity-religious-studies|title=Theology, Divinity & Religious Studies|date=15 February 2019|website=Top Universities|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> and joint 7th in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nuk-tnl-deck-prod-static.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/a57d48399922b03419153a9760c5ce53.html|title=University Guide 2016 - The Times|website=nuk-tnl-deck-prod-static.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> It also has an excellent reputation for medical research and many of its subjects are ranked in top 10 in the UK, including Accounting & Finance (ranked 10th in the UK, [[Complete University Guide|Complete 2020]]), Civil Engineering (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Dentistry (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Education (8th in the UK, Complete 2020), General Engineering (7th in the UK, Complete 2020), Law (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Linguistics (3rd in the UK, Complete 2020) and Sports Science (2nd in the UK, Complete 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings|title=Top UK University League Tables and Rankings 2020|website=www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> Aberdeen also has great reputation for economics with leading graduate prospect in the country.

It acts as the HQ of the Students' Association and provides a wide range of student facilities, but due to city council licensing regulations there is no bar. Facilities at the Butchart Centre include a large cafe, second-hand bookstore, facilities for student societies and offices.

The creation of the Union in 1895 provided a new debating chamber in Marischal College and the society's first permanent home. The chamber beneath Mitchell Hall in Marischal College is Scotland's oldest purpose-built debating chamber.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nEach year a student-led torcher parade is held.
