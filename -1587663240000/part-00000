He was awarded an [[OBE]] in the [[2016 New Year Honours]].\n\n== Career summary ==\n{{main|Professional snooker career of Ronnie O'Sullivan}}\n\nO'Sullivan began playing snooker at age 7 and soon became a noted amateur competitor, winning his first [[Billiard room|club]] tournament at age 9, making his first competitive [[century break]] at age 10, and winning the British Under-16 Championship at age 13. At the 1991 [[English Amateur Championship]], at the age of 15 years and 98 days, he made his first competitive [[maximum break]], then the youngest player ever to do so in a recognised tournament. In the same year, he won the [[IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship]] and [[1991 Junior Pot Black|Junior Pot Black]].\n\nAfter turning professional in 1992 at the age of 16, he won 74 of his first 76 qualifying matches, including a record 38 consecutive professional victories. He qualified for the televised stages of the [[1993 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] in his first professional season, making his Crucible debut on 18 April 1993, aged 17 years and 134 days. He remains the third youngest player ever to compete at the venue, behind [[Luca Brecel]] and [[Stephen Hendry]]. He claimed his first ranking title later that year, winning the [[1993 UK Championship (snooker)|1993 UK Championship]] seven days before his 18th birthday to become the youngest ever winner of a ranking tournament, a record he still holds. The following season, he won the [[1995 Masters (snooker)|1995 Masters]] aged 19 years and 69 days. He remains the youngest ever Masters champion.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1999, O'Sullivan reached three world semifinals in four years. At the [[1997 World Snooker Championship|1997 World Championship]], he achieved his first [[maximum break]] in professional competition; compiled in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds, it remains the fastest competitive maximum break in snooker history. He won his second [[1997 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] later that year. Despite these successes, his career became increasingly marred by controversy in the later 1990s. During the [[1996 World Snooker Championship|1996 World Championship]], he assaulted assistant press officer Michael Ganley, for which the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|WPBSA]] gave him a suspended two-year ban and a \u00a320,000 fine.<ref name=Independent07012010>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ronnie-osullivan-i-still-let-my-demons-get-the-better-of-me-1859989.html |title=Ronnie O'Sullivan: 'I still let my demons get the better of me' |date=7 January 2010 |first=Adam |last=Hulme |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=4 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190904153337/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ronnie-osullivan-i-still-let-my-demons-get-the-better-of-me-1859989.html |archive-date=4 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> After winning the [[1998 Irish Masters]], he was stripped of his title and prize money when a post-match drug test found evidence of cannabis in his system.<ref>{{cite news|title=O'Sullivan stripped of Irish title|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/o-sullivan-stripped-of-irish-title-1.170751|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=7 July 1998|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nHe reached his first world final in [[2001 World Snooker Championship|2001]], where he defeated [[John Higgins]] 18\u201314 to claim his first world title and reach number two in the world rankings.

With veteran world champion [[Ray Reardon]] acting as his coach and mentor, he won his second world title in [[2004 World Snooker Championship|2004]], defeating [[Graeme Dott]] 18\u20138 in the final, after which he held the number one ranking for the next two seasons. He added his second Masters title in [[2005 Masters (snooker)|2005]], ten years after his first. However, his behaviour became notably erratic in the mid-2000s as he battled [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]]. During the [[2005 World Snooker Championship|2005 World Championship]], he shaved his head mid-tournament and exhibited what ''[[The Independent]]'' called a \"public emotional disintegration\" while losing 11 of the last 14 frames in his quarterfinal against [[Peter Ebdon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/snooker-ronnie-osullivan-tortured-genius-526560.html|title=Snooker: Ronnie O'Sullivan: Tortured genius|date=2005-04-29|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> At the [[2005 UK Championship]], he sat with a wet towel draped over his head during his match against [[Mark King (snooker player)|Mark King]].

Hendry was awarded the match 9\u20131 and the WPBSA fined O'Sullivan \u00a320,800 over the incident.<ref name=Independent07012010 />\n\nIn 2007, O'Sullivan won his third [[2007 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] title and his fourth [[2007 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]], his first ranking title in almost three years. He won his third world title in [[2008 World Snooker Championship|2008]], defeating [[Ali Carter]] 18\u20138 in the final, after which he held the world number one ranking for the next two seasons. He added his fourth Masters title in [[2009 Masters (snooker)|2009]]. After two disappointing seasons that saw him fall out of the top ten in the world rankings, he began working with sports psychologist [[Steve Peters (psychiatrist)|Steve Peters]] in 2011. A resurgent O'Sullivan captured his fourth World Championship in [[2012 World Snooker Championship|2012]], again defeating Carter in the final, after which he paid tribute to Peters's work with him. The following season, he took an extended break from the professional tour. Despite having played only one competitive match all season, he returned to the Crucible for the [[2013 World Snooker Championship]] and successfully defended his world title, defeating [[Barry Hawkins]] 18\u201312 in the final. In 2014, he won his fifth [[2014 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] title, beating defending champion [[Mark Selby]] 10\u20134 in the final, and went on to reach a third consecutive World Championship final, where he again faced Selby. Despite taking a 10\u20135 lead, he lost 14\u201318, his first ever defeat in a world final. Later that year he won his fifth [[2014 UK Championship|UK Championship]], beating [[Judd Trump]] 10\u20139 in the final, although he declined to defend his UK title the following year, citing debilitating insomnia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/snooker/ronnie-o-sullivan-i-m-under-doctor-s-orders.-insomnia-makes-it-difficult-for-me-to-make-a-20-break_sto4952359/story.shtml|title=Ronnie O'Sullivan: I'm listening to my doctor.

At the [[2019 Tour Championship]] he won his 36th ranking title, equalling Hendry's record and giving him the world number one ranking for the first time since May 2010. His other career highlights include four [[Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]] titles, four [[Shanghai Masters (snooker)|Shanghai Masters]] titles, three [[Champion of Champions (snooker)|Champion of Champions]] titles, two [[China Open (snooker)|China Open]] titles, and a record 15 maximum breaks in professional competition.\n\n== Criticisms of the sport ==\nDuring the 2010s, O'Sullivan became a vocal critic of World Snooker Tour chairman [[Barry Hearn]]. In interviews and on social media, he voiced his unhappiness with many of Hearn's decisions affecting how the professional tour is run. He took issue with increased travel expectations, flat 128 draws that required top professionals to play more rounds against lower ranked opponents, reduced prize money for 147 breaks, and what he saw as inadequate tournament venues. He accused snooker's governing body of bullying and intimidating him, stated that Hearn was running a \"dictatorship,\" and threatened in 2018 to form a breakaway snooker tour akin to the [[split in darts]]. Hearn responded by criticising some of O'Sullivan's remarks as immature and characterising his breakaway threat as damaging to the sport.\n\n== Playing style ==\nO'Sullivan plays in a fast and attacking manner. He is a prolific breakbuilder and solid tactical player. He has stated his disdain for long, drawn-out games, saying that it harms the game of snooker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/aug/21/snooker.gdnsport3|title=Ding breaks test limits of O'Sullivan's patience|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 May 2007|date=21 August 2006|location=London|first=Alan|last=David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203211817/http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/aug/21/snooker.gdnsport3|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> He is regarded by many other professionals as an excellent [[front-runner]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/22386595|title=World Snooker Championship 2013: Hawkins beats Walden|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=4 May 2013|quote=We all know how good a front-runner Ronnie is, he just keeps pounding and pounding and pounding and over a two-day match, it's tough.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505195234/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/22386595|archive-date=5 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In previous years, he could become demoralized by being behind and not playing well, and was liable to lose several consecutive frames.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/4038633.stm|title=How to beat Ronnie O'Sullivan|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=1 May 2007|date=21 February 2005|first=Willie|last=Thorne|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406065231/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/4038633.stm|archive-date=6 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> He is right-handed but can play to a very high standard with his left hand and routinely alternates where needed.

In the same year, he won the [[IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship]] and [[1991 Junior Pot Black|Junior Pot Black]].\n\nAfter turning professional in 1992 at the age of 16, he won 74 of his first 76 qualifying matches, including a record 38 consecutive professional victories. He qualified for the televised stages of the [[1993 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] in his first professional season, making his Crucible debut on 18 April 1993, aged 17 years and 134 days. He remains the third youngest player ever to compete at the venue, behind [[Luca Brecel]] and [[Stephen Hendry]]. He claimed his first ranking title later that year, winning the [[1993 UK Championship (snooker)|1993 UK Championship]] seven days before his 18th birthday to become the youngest ever winner of a ranking tournament, a record he still holds. The following season, he won the [[1995 Masters (snooker)|1995 Masters]] aged 19 years and 69 days. He remains the youngest ever Masters champion.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1999, O'Sullivan reached three world semifinals in four years. At the [[1997 World Snooker Championship|1997 World Championship]], he achieved his first [[maximum break]] in professional competition; compiled in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds, it remains the fastest competitive maximum break in snooker history. He won his second [[1997 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] later that year. Despite these successes, his career became increasingly marred by controversy in the later 1990s. During the [[1996 World Snooker Championship|1996 World Championship]], he assaulted assistant press officer Michael Ganley, for which the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|WPBSA]] gave him a suspended two-year ban and a \u00a320,000 fine.<ref name=Independent07012010>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ronnie-osullivan-i-still-let-my-demons-get-the-better-of-me-1859989.html |title=Ronnie O'Sullivan: 'I still let my demons get the better of me' |date=7 January 2010 |first=Adam |last=Hulme |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=4 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190904153337/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ronnie-osullivan-i-still-let-my-demons-get-the-better-of-me-1859989.html |archive-date=4 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> After winning the [[1998 Irish Masters]], he was stripped of his title and prize money when a post-match drug test found evidence of cannabis in his system.<ref>{{cite news|title=O'Sullivan stripped of Irish title|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/o-sullivan-stripped-of-irish-title-1.170751|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=7 July 1998|accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref> \n\nHe reached his first world final in [[2001 World Snooker Championship|2001]], where he defeated [[John Higgins]] 18\u201314 to claim his first world title and reach number two in the world rankings. He won his third UK title later in [[2001 UK Championship (snooker)|2001]], which helped him attain the [[List of world number one snooker players|world number one]] ranking for the first time in the [[Snooker world rankings 2002/2003|2002/2003 season]]. With veteran world champion [[Ray Reardon]] acting as his coach and mentor, he won his second world title in [[2004 World Snooker Championship|2004]], defeating [[Graeme Dott]] 18\u20138 in the final, after which he held the number one ranking for the next two seasons. He added his second Masters title in [[2005 Masters (snooker)|2005]], ten years after his first. However, his behaviour became notably erratic in the mid-2000s as he battled [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]]. During the [[2005 World Snooker Championship|2005 World Championship]], he shaved his head mid-tournament and exhibited what ''[[The Independent]]'' called a \"public emotional disintegration\" while losing 11 of the last 14 frames in his quarterfinal against [[Peter Ebdon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/snooker-ronnie-osullivan-tortured-genius-526560.html|title=Snooker: Ronnie O'Sullivan: Tortured genius|date=2005-04-29|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> At the [[2005 UK Championship]], he sat with a wet towel draped over his head during his match against [[Mark King (snooker player)|Mark King]].

Hendry was awarded the match 9\u20131 and the WPBSA fined O'Sullivan \u00a320,800 over the incident.<ref name=Independent07012010 />\n\nIn 2007, O'Sullivan won his third [[2007 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] title and his fourth [[2007 UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]], his first ranking title in almost three years. He won his third world title in [[2008 World Snooker Championship|2008]], defeating [[Ali Carter]] 18\u20138 in the final, after which he held the world number one ranking for the next two seasons. He added his fourth Masters title in [[2009 Masters (snooker)|2009]]. After two disappointing seasons that saw him fall out of the top ten in the world rankings, he began working with sports psychologist [[Steve Peters (psychiatrist)|Steve Peters]] in 2011. A resurgent O'Sullivan captured his fourth World Championship in [[2012 World Snooker Championship|2012]], again defeating Carter in the final, after which he paid tribute to Peters's work with him. The following season, he took an extended break from the professional tour. Despite having played only one competitive match all season, he returned to the Crucible for the [[2013 World Snooker Championship]] and successfully defended his world title, defeating [[Barry Hawkins]] 18\u201312 in the final. In 2014, he won his fifth [[2014 Masters (snooker)|Masters]] title, beating defending champion [[Mark Selby]] 10\u20134 in the final, and went on to reach a third consecutive World Championship final, where he again faced Selby. Despite taking a 10\u20135 lead, he lost 14\u201318, his first ever defeat in a world final. Later that year he won his fifth [[2014 UK Championship|UK Championship]], beating [[Judd Trump]] 10\u20139 in the final, although he declined to defend his UK title the following year, citing debilitating insomnia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosport.co.uk/snooker/ronnie-o-sullivan-i-m-under-doctor-s-orders.-insomnia-makes-it-difficult-for-me-to-make-a-20-break_sto4952359/story.shtml|title=Ronnie O'Sullivan: I'm listening to my doctor.

At the [[2019 Tour Championship]] he won his 36th ranking title, equalling Hendry's record and giving him the world number one ranking for the first time since May 2010. His other career highlights include four [[Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]] titles, four [[Shanghai Masters (snooker)|Shanghai Masters]] titles, three [[Champion of Champions (snooker)|Champion of Champions]] titles, two [[China Open (snooker)|China Open]] titles, and a record 15 maximum breaks in professional competition.\n\n== Criticisms of the sport ==\nDuring the 2010s, O'Sullivan became a vocal critic of World Snooker Tour chairman [[Barry Hearn]]. In interviews and on social media, he voiced his unhappiness with many of Hearn's decisions affecting how the professional tour is run. He took issue with increased travel expectations, flat 128 draws that required top professionals to play more rounds against lower ranked opponents, reduced prize money for 147 breaks, and what he saw as inadequate tournament venues. He accused snooker's governing body of bullying and intimidating him, stated that Hearn was running a \"dictatorship,\" and threatened in 2018 to form a breakaway snooker tour akin to the [[split in darts]]. Hearn responded by criticising some of O'Sullivan's remarks as immature and characterising his breakaway threat as damaging to the sport.\n\n== Playing style ==\nO'Sullivan plays in a fast and attacking manner. He is a prolific breakbuilder and solid tactical player. He has stated his disdain for long, drawn-out games, saying that it harms the game of snooker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/aug/21/snooker.gdnsport3|title=Ding breaks test limits of O'Sullivan's patience|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 May 2007|date=21 August 2006|location=London|first=Alan|last=David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203211817/http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/aug/21/snooker.gdnsport3|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> He is regarded by many other professionals as an excellent [[front-runner]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/22386595|title=World Snooker Championship 2013: Hawkins beats Walden|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=4 May 2013|quote=We all know how good a front-runner Ronnie is, he just keeps pounding and pounding and pounding and over a two-day match, it's tough.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505195234/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/22386595|archive-date=5 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In previous years, he could become demoralized by being behind and not playing well, and was liable to lose several consecutive frames.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/4038633.stm|title=How to beat Ronnie O'Sullivan|work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=1 May 2007|date=21 February 2005|first=Willie|last=Thorne|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406065231/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/4038633.stm|archive-date=6 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> He is right-handed but can play to a very high standard with his left hand and routinely alternates where needed.

It stars [[Michael Cera]] as [[List of Scott Pilgrim characters#Scott Pilgrim|Scott Pilgrim]], a slacker musician who must win a competition to get a record deal and battle the seven evil exes of his newest girlfriend [[List of Scott Pilgrim characters#Ramona Flowers|Ramona Flowers]], played by [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]. It also stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Brandon Routh]] and [[Mae Whitman]] as some of the evil exes, [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Kieran Culkin]] and [[Alison Pill]] as some of Scott's friends, and [[Brie Larson]] as Scott's own evil ex. [[Jason Schwartzman]] plays Gideon, Ramona's most recent ex and the competition's record producer.\n\nA film adaptation of the comics was proposed following the release of the first volume. Wright became attached to the project early on, with filming beginning several years later in March 2009 in [[Toronto]]. The film premiered after a panel discussion at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] on July 22, 2010, and received a [[wide release]] in North America on August 13, 2010.\n\nIt notably uses famous features of its Toronto setting, as well as video game and comic book imagery and a matching style. Using a [[battle of the bands]] plot, it also uses different real bands as a basis for each fictional group, including [[Beck]] and [[Metric (band)|Metric]], with the actors in the film performing themselves. It contains extensive visual effects, using a combination of digital and physical methods to create the image, with the title sequence and some of the fight scenes incorporating music into the graphics.\n\nThe film was a [[box-office bomb]] but received positive reviews from critics, who particularly noted the film's visual style and humor; it eventually garnered a [[cult following]]. It has made several Top Ten lists and [[List of accolades received by Scott Pilgrim vs. the World|received over 70 awards and nominations]]. It was shortlisted for the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] category at the [[83rd Academy Awards]]. In scholarly analysis, it has been widely discussed as a [[transmedia narrative]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- see WP:FILMPLOT before adding/removing text -->\nIn Toronto, 22-year-old Scott Pilgrim is a [[bass guitar|bassist]] in Sex Bob-Omb, a floundering [[garage band]]. He is dating Knives Chau, a 17-year-old high-school student, to the disapproval of his friends in the band, his roommate Wallace Wells, and his younger sister Stacey Pilgrim. Scott meets an American [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] delivery girl, [[Ramona Flowers]], after having first seen her in a dream. He loses interest in Knives, but doesn't break up with her before pursuing Ramona. When Sex Bob-Omb plays in a [[battle of the bands]] sponsored by record executive Gideon Graves, Scott is attacked by Ramona's ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel. Scott defeats Patel and learns that, in order to date Ramona, he must defeat her remaining six evil exes.\n\nScott finally breaks up with Knives, who blames Ramona and swears to win him back. Meanwhile, Scott proceeds to get attacked by, and defeats, the next three of Ramona's exes: Hollywood actor and skateboarder Lucas Lee, super-powered [[vegan]] Todd Ingram, and [[lesbian]] ninja Roxy Richter, while also confronting his own ex, pop star Envy Adams. However, Scott grows frustrated during the process, and after an outburst regarding Ramona's dating history, she breaks up with him.\n\nAt the next battle of the bands, Sex Bob-Omb defeats Ramona's fifth and sixth evil exes, twins Kyle and Ken Katayanagi, earning Scott an [[1-up|extra life]]. Despite this, Ramona appears to get back with her seventh evil ex, Gideon. Sex Bob-Omb accepts Gideon's [[recording contract|record deal]], except for Scott, who quits the band in protest. Gideon invites Scott to his venue, the Chaos Theater, where Sex Bob-Omb is playing. Resolving to win Ramona back, Scott challenges Gideon to a fight for her affection, earning the \"Power of Love\" sword. Knives interrupts the battle, attacking Ramona, and Scott is forced to reveal that he cheated on both of them. Gideon kills Scott and Ramona visits him in [[limbo]] to reveal that Gideon has implanted her with a [[mind control]] device.\n\nScott uses his 1-up and re-enters the Chaos Theater. He makes peace with his friends and challenges Gideon again, this time for himself, gaining the \"Power of Self-Respect\" sword. After apologizing to Ramona and Knives for cheating on them, and accepting his own faults, Scott and Knives join forces to defeat Gideon.\n\nFree from Gideon's control, Ramona prepares to leave. Knives accepts that her relationship with Scott is over and, at her encouragement, he leaves with Ramona to \"try again.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Scott Pilgrim characters}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Michael Cera]] as Scott Pilgrim\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Ramona Flowers\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Wallace Wells\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Lucas Lee\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Stacey Pilgrim\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Natalie V. \"Envy\" Adams\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Kim Pine\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Julie Powers\n* [[Brandon Routh]] as Todd Ingram\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as Gideon Graves\n* [[Johnny Simmons]] as \"Young\" Neil Nordegraf\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as Stephen Stills\n* [[Mae Whitman]] as Roxy Richter\n* [[Ellen Wong]] as Knives Chau\n* [[Satya Bhabha]] as Matthew Patel\n* {{ill|Shota Saito (actor)|lt=Shota Saito|ja|\u6589\u85e4\u7965\u592a}} as Kyle Katayanagi\n* {{ill|Keita Saito (actor)|lt=Keita Saito|ja|\u6589\u85e4\u6176\u592a}} as Ken Katayanagi\n* [[Nelson Franklin]] as Michael Comeau\n* [[Bill Hader]] as The Voice\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' was produced by several international companies: [[Marc Platt Productions]] (United States), [[Big Talk Productions|Big Talk Films]] (United Kingdom), Closed On Mondays Entertainment (United States), and [[Dentsu]] (Japan).{{sfn|Grierson|2010}}\n\n===Development===\n{{image frame|content={{Photomontage\n |photo1a=Edgar Wright by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n |photo1b=Bryan Lee O'Malley by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n |size=250\n |spacing=2\n |color=\n |color_border=\n |border=\n}}|width=255|align=left|caption=Edgar Wright and Bryan Lee O'Malley at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic-Con International]]|max-width=}}\nAfter artist [[Bryan Lee O'Malley]] completed the first volume of ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'', his publisher [[Oni Press]] contacted producer [[Marc E.

They don't make any attempt to make it look realistic. Mario Bava's composition and staging has a real try-anything attitude.\"{{sfn|Huddleston}} Bacall said that he wanted to write the ''Scott Pilgrim'' film because he felt strongly about its story and empathized with its characters.{{sfn|AP|2010}} Wright said that O'Malley was \"very involved\" with the script of the film from the start, contributing lines and adding polish. Due to the long development, several lines from various scripts written by Wright and Bacall were used in later ''Scott Pilgrim'' comics.{{sfn|Dan|2010}} The screenplay's second draft, which O'Malley said \"became the main draft for the film\", was submitted right at midnight on the night the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers' Strike]] was supposed to begin in October 2007.{{sfn|Down|2010}} No material from ''Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour'', the sixth ''Scott Pilgrim'' volume, appeared in the film, as the comic was not complete at the time of the film's production; O'Malley contributed suggestions for the film's ending and gave the producers his notes for the sixth volume,{{sfn|Winning|2010b}} but stated that the film's ending was \"their ending\".{{sfn|Sciretta|2009}} Some ideas for the film's ending were cut before production, including that Scott would turn out to be a serial killer who fantasized the gaming aspects{{sfn|Campbell|2010}} and that Gideon would turn into a [[Transformers]]-style robot.{{sfn|Wigler|2010}}\n\nThe film takes on elements of style from the graphic novels, including the use of comic book text-as-graphic (e.g. sound effect onomatopoeia), which is described by Wright and O'Malley as \"merely the internal perspective of how Scott understands himself and the world\".{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} It has been described as both a video game and a comic book film.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\n[[Casting (performing arts)|Casting]] of the principal characters began in June 2008.{{sfn|Villeneuve|2009}} Test shoots began in July 2008, with Wright saying that there was a year of preparation before shooting began. He also stopped working on his ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' screenplay for two years during the production of ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World''.{{sfn|Leader|2010}} By 2009, casting had been completed and the film was titled ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World''.{{sfn|Kit|2009}} The cast spent two months in fight training together before filming, with [[Brad Allan]] and Peng Zhang of the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]];{{sfn|Leader|2010}}{{sfn|Comic Con|2010a}} Michael Cera said that he \"got kicked in the throat during the training\" and \"expected it to be excruciating, but it didn\u2019t hurt at all, which was really confusing.\"{{sfn|Collis|2010}} [[Principal photography]] began in March 2009 in [[Toronto]]{{sfn|Wright|2009a}}{{sfn|Scott Pilgrim The Movie|2009}} and wrapped as scheduled in August.{{sfn|Villeneuve|2009}}{{sfn|Wright|2009b}} In the film's original ending, written before the release of the final ''Scott Pilgrim'' book, Scott gets back together with Knives. After the final book in the series, in which Scott and Ramona get back together, was released, and with divided audience reaction to the film's original ending, a new ending was filmed to match the books, with Scott and Ramona getting back together.{{sfn|Lussier|2010a}} This was shot three months before the film was released;{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Wright says that it is his \"preferred ending\".{{sfn|Wigler|2010}} The film was given a production budget of $85\u201390&nbsp;million, an amount offset by tax rebates that resulted in a final cost of around $60&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Box Office Mojo}} [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] fronted $60&nbsp;million of the pre-rebate budget.{{sfn|Corliss|2010}} O'Malley's [[Audio commentary|commentary track]] was recorded on August 14, 2010, one day after the film's theatrical release.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}}\n\n===Setting===\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical\n|image1=Bloor_Street_West_&_Bathurst_Street_(22727323996).jpg|caption1=The intersection at Bathurst Street, with the Bloor Street West Pizza Pizza, used in the film{{sfn|Movie Locations}}\n|image2=Artscape_Wychwood_Barns_(22529716870).jpg|caption2=The Artscape Wychwood Barns venue is used as the nightclub for the after party where Scott fights Roxy{{sfn|Movie Locations}}\n|image3=Lee's palace mural 2005.png|caption3=Lee's Palace entrance mural pre-2010}}\nOne of the producers, Miles Dale, said that the film is \"the biggest movie ever identifiably set in [[Toronto]].\"{{sfn|Schneller|2012}} The film features notable Toronto locations <!--Only use examples stated in the sources.-->[[Casa Loma]], [[St. Michael's College School]], Sonic Boom, the [[Toronto Public Library]] Wychwood Library, a [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]] location on St. Clair West, a [[Second Cup]], a [[Pizza Pizza]], [[Lee's Palace]], and [[Wychwood Barns|Artscape Wychwood Barns]].<!--Only use examples stated in the sources.-->{{sfn|Movie Locations}}{{sfn|Schneller|2012}}{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The production planned to set the series in Toronto because, in Dale's words, \"the books are super-specific in their local details\" and director Wright wanted to use the imagery from the books, so Universal Studios had no plans to alter the setting.{{sfn|Schneller|2012}} Dale stated that \"[[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]] is practically the cerebral cortex of Scott Pilgrim\".{{sfn|Schneller|2012}} David Fleischer of ''[[Torontoist]]'' wrote that though films set in [[New York City]] show off all the major landmarks, \"Scott Pilgrim revels in the simplicity\" of everyday locations that are still identifiably Toronto, like the Bathurst/Bloor intersection and a single Pizza Pizza restaurant.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}}\n\nDirector Wright, who lived in the city for a year before making the film, said that \"as a British filmmaker making [his] first film outside the UK, [he] wouldn't want anyone to give [him] demerits for getting the location wrong\", sticking to the real Toronto and \"shooting even the most banal of locations\" in the comic.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} Wright said that the first thing he did when he arrived in Toronto was to tour all of the locations with O'Malley, saying that this gave him a \"kind of touch down at the real locations [that] just made everything feel right\", though O'Malley could not remember the exact spots of some and so they drove around using his comic reference photos to find them.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The production was allowed to film in Second Cup and Pizza Pizza locations, with Wright saying that using them instead of [[Starbucks]] \"just felt right\" because \"it means something to Canadian audiences and people in international audiences just think [they] made [Pizza Pizza] up [them]selves. It sounds like a cute movie brand\".{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}}\n\nWright said that he took pride in having been able to record the original Lee's Palace mural before it was taken down; he also had the old bar reconstructed on a set for interior scenes, which was positively received when the bands consulting for the film visited. Wright suggested that \"they wanted it preserved as a museum piece\".{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} Another reconstruction was the Rock It club, which no longer existed, with the interior built on a sound stage.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The Sonic Boom store had been changed from how it appeared in the comics, but allowed its interior to be restored to the previous look for filming.{{sfn|Movie Locations}}{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The backgrounds were also changed for the film: many landscapes were simplified in [[post-production]] to emulate the drawing style in the comics, including removing a lot of trees from the scenes shot at [[Hillcrest Park]] and Turner Road.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}}\n\nThe Casa Loma has served as a movie set for many different productions, and so appearing in ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' as itself being a movie set was described as \"very trippy\".{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The scene of the Casa Loma also shows the [[CN Tower]] and [[Baldwin Steps]], with [[Don McKellar]] (who played the director in the scene) reporting that \"people were going crazy\" at opening night in Toronto when it played.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The Casa Loma fight is in the original comic book, but the moment when Lucas Lee is pushed through a [[matte painting]] generic cityscape to reveal the CN Tower was only added for the film. In his chapter, '\"Scott Pilgrim Gets It Together\": The Cultural Crossovers of Bryan Lee O'Malley', Mark Berninger calls this reveal \"an ironic reference to the specific filmic location\" and says that it is \"entirely in line with O'Malley's use of metafictional commentary to stress transnational hybridity precisely by highlighting Canadian identity\".{{sfn|Berninger|2013}}\n\n===Casting===\nCasting took place between 2008 and 2010.{{sfn|Villeneuve|2009}}{{sfn|Kit|2009}} Cera was cast in March 2008{{sfn|Whaley|2008a}} and Winstead in May that year.{{sfn|Whaley|2008b}} By the end of 2008, Whitman, Wong and Kendrick were cast; in January 2009, Routh, Evans, and Larson were announced together with Webber, Pill, Simmons, and Bhabha.{{sfn|Parsons|2009}} Extras casting in Toronto began in February 2009.{{sfn|Kumar|2009}}\n\nDirector Wright felt confident with his casting in the film, saying that \"like with ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' [when they] had great people in every single tiny part, it's the same with this. What's great with this is that there's people [like] Michael [Cera] and Jason [Schwartzman], and [...] people who are up and coming, like Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza and Brie Larson, and then there's complete unknowns as well\".{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} [[Collider (website)|''Collider'']] noted that the less-known actors fit their roles well, with Wright confirming that they did not have as much pressure to find lots of big names, adding that \"Universal never really gave [him] any problems about casting bigger people, because in a way Michael [Cera] has starred in two $100 million-plus movies, and also a lot of the other people, though they're not the biggest names, people certainly know who they are.\"{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} He also noted that while some of the actors were more famous when they auditioned, like Schwartzman and Evans, others became more well-known over the time the film was in development, saying that \"Anna Kendrick did her first audition for it before she shot the first ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]''. And Aubrey Plaza got the part in ''Scott Pilgrim'' before she did ''[[Funny People]]'' or ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', which is crazy. It shows you how long this film has taken to get made.\"{{sfn|Collis|2010}}\n\nWright ran all his casting decisions by O'Malley during a casting session;{{sfn|Winning|2010b}} O'Malley was not in the room but was shown all of the tapes.{{sfn|Down|2010}} Wright said that he planned on casting Cera while he was writing ''Hot Fuzz'', after watching episodes of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'',{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} also saying that he needed an actor that \"audiences will still follow even when the character is being a bit of an ass.\"{{sfn|Miller|2010}} Cera said he was equally excited to work with Wright, \"because [he] was a big fan of his\".{{sfn|Collis|2010}} Wright explained that though Cera is a talented musician, they were not particularly looking for people who could already play instruments, with the cast members who could not subsequently learning for the film.{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} Like Cera, Wright already had in mind Mary Elizabeth Winstead as his choice for Ramona Flowers, thinking of her for the part two years before filming had started because \"she has a very sunny disposition as a person, so it was interesting to get her to play a version of herself that was broken inside. She's great in the film because she causes a lot of chaos but remains supernaturally grounded.\"{{sfn|Swerdloff|2010}}\n\nEllen Wong, a little-known Toronto actress,{{sfn|Villeneuve|2009}} auditioned for the part of Knives Chau three times. On her second audition, Wright learned that Wong has a green belt in [[taekwondo]], and says he found himself intrigued by this \"sweet-faced young lady being a secret badass\".{{sfn|Swerdloff|2010}} The actors playing Lucas Lee's [[stunt double]]s are the actual stunt doubles for Evans.{{sfn|Marshall|2010}} Aubrey Plaza, who has a supporting role as Julie Powers, said that \"there's a lot of weird, perfectly casted people\", citing Michael Cera and Alison Pill as particularly matching their characters.{{sfn|Wigler|2009}}\n\nWright says that one thing he is particularly happy with is that the film, unlike many comedies, including his own, has \"a lot of funny women in it\", recalling a particular scene he dubbed \"the funny lady relay race,\" because it \"starts with Anna Kendrick, then switches to Aubrey Plaza, then switches to Mary [Elizabeth Winstead], then switches to Brie Larson, and it's just Michael [Cera] being attacked from all sides from all the different women in the film.\"{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Anchor|Music|Soundtrack|Score}}\n{{See also|Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (soundtrack)}}\nThe film is not only physically set in Toronto, but also, according to Allan Weiss,<!--Not the Allan Weiss with an article under that name, please don't link--> culturally and temporally located within \"the [[The Annex|Annex]] and Wychwood neigborhoods [of Toronto] during the [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] era\", the time and place of a very specific music scene that the film \"embed[s] [itself] into [...] not only via Scott's fictional band[,] but also by the appearance of such clubs as the now defunct Rockit[, and] the film's indie rock soundtrack\"; Weiss asserts that the film \"marks the mythologizing of the cool Annex scene, the transformation of Toronto indie rock [...] into the stuff of adventure\", as \"nearly all of the major events [...] are connected in some way to this music scene.\"{{sfn|Weiss|2014}}\n\nThe soundtrack features contributions by [[Radiohead]] producer [[Nigel Godrich]], [[Beck]], [[Metric (band)|Metric]], [[Broken Social Scene]], [[Cornelius (musician)|Cornelius]], [[Dan the Automator]], [[Kid Koala]], and [[David Campbell (arranger/composer)|David Campbell]].{{sfn|Hasty|2010}}{{sfn|Martens|2010b}}{{sfn|Carlick|2010}}{{sfn|Wright|2010a}}{{sfn|Music From Film}} O'Malley had written up playlists for each of the comics in the back of the books, introducing Wright to other Canadian bands during development. Building on this, Wright said that the production \"tried to [...] find a real band for each of the fictional bands, because usually in music films you have one composer who does everything\".{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} Wright and Godrich met with and scouted bands to write for the film for two years.{{sfn|Collis|2010}} Godrich scored the film, as his first [[film score]].{{sfn|Leader|2010}} Before Godrich became involved with the film, early scripts had the running joke that \"you never heard the bands [...] You heard the intro, and then it would cut to the next scene, and somebody would be going, 'Oh my God, that's the best song ever.' That was a joke for a long time\", according to Wright.{{sfn|Martens|2010c}}\n\nWebber, Pill, and Simmons as the members of Sex Bob-omb all had to learn to play their respective instruments, and spent time rehearsing as a band with Cera (who already played bass) before filming began.{{sfn|Universal Pictures|2010}} [[Chris Murphy (Canadian musician)|Chris Murphy]] of the band [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]] was the guitar coach for the actors in the film.{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} The actors also sing on the film's soundtrack.{{sfn|AllMusic|2010}} Beck wrote and composed the music played by Sex Bob-omb in the film.{{sfn|Empire|2010a}} The songs took two days to write and record, with Beck saying that \"it needed to be underthought, [...] they had to be funny, but [he] also wanted them to sound raw, like demos.\"{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2010}} [[Brian LeBarton]] plays drums and bass for the band on the film's score and soundtrack. Two unreleased songs can also be heard in the teaser trailer.{{sfn|Empire|2010a}}\n\nBrendan Canning and Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene wrote all the songs for Crash and the Boys. The tracks were sung by [[Erik Knudsen]], who plays Crash in the film. Drew stated that the reason behind this was that \"[he] knew that [Knudsen] didn't need to be a singer to pull [it] off\" because the songs were \"so quick and punk and fast\" and \"it needed to be the character's voice.\"{{sfn|Warner|2010}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left | direction = | width =\n| image1 = Emily Haines (Metric).jpg | caption1 =\n| image2 = Envy Adams performance Scott Pilgrim vs. the World image.png | caption2 =\n| image3 = Metric live at Washington, DC 2006.jpg | caption3 =\n| footer = Emily Haines performing (left and right), and Brie Larson as Envy Adams (center) | total_width = 280 }}\nMetric is the inspiration for the film's band The Clash at Demonhead, and contributed the song \"Black Sheep\" to the film,{{sfn|Rayner|2009}} by request of Godrich.{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2009}} The clothing, performance and style of Metric's lead singer, [[Emily Haines]], is also the basis for the lead singer of The Clash at Demonhead, Envy Adams.{{sfn|Rayner|2009}}{{sfn|Diaz Pino|2015}} Brie Larson, who portrays Envy Adams, said that she \"had no idea [her] body could move that way\" when talking about her stage performance of the song at the UK premiere.{{sfn|Den of Geek|2010}} The music journalist Janelle Sheetz wrote that \"Larson's performance is similar enough to [Haines's] but with an attitude appropriate for [Envy Adams]\".{{sfn|Sheetz|2019}} Envy Adams' film fashion also reverse-influenced the comics: the last graphic novel was in development while the film was being made, and O'Malley said that though he \"would try and distance [him]self from [the actors' interpretations]\", he also \"gave Envy Adams one of Brie Larson's actual outfits\" in the comic.{{sfn|Down|2010}}\n\nLarson as Envy Adams provides the vocals for \"Black Sheep\" in the film, while the soundtrack features a version of the song with Haines as lead singer{{sfn|Goldberg|2010b}} per the band's request;{{sfn|Wright|2019}} Larson was a professional singer and has performed in some of her other films.{{sfn|Jeunesse|2019}} Metric had been performing the song at their concerts since 2007, but had not released it before the film.{{sfn|TIFF Originals|2018}} Todd Martens of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that \"Envy is a caricature of Haines\" and likewise, according to Haines, that \"'Black Sheep' is essentially a caricature of Metric\", like a song emulating their most distinct aspects.{{sfn|Martens|2010c}} Godrich agreed, and added that it \"was perfect for this film [because] it's not Metric. It's a shadow of Metric.\"{{sfn|Martens|2010c}} Routh, who plays The Clash at Demonhead's bass player Todd Ingram, said that \"[he] can play [\"Black Sheep\"] really well\" but that the film did not use his instrumental, only Larson's vocals over Metric,{{sfn|Leader|2010}} who had re-recorded the track to make it more sinister.{{sfn|Martens|2010c}} Routh spent \"three or four months\" learning to play bass for the film.{{sfn|Leader|2010}}\n\nThe song performed by Matthew Patel was written by [[Dan the Automator]] and performed by Satya Bhabha in the film. Bhabha said that they \"[recorded] it at [[Capitol Records Building|Capitol Records]] Studio 2, which is where [[Frank Sinatra]] recorded a lot of his stuff. And there was [[Ray Charles]]' piano in the room\", explaining that the musical history helped him to finish the recording.{{sfn|Leader|2010}}\n\nWright said that the film's tonal changes in line with representing the different book parts, and for its fight scenes, were treated like a [[musical film]], saying:{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} \n{{Quote|text=We thought it should play out like a musical in a way in terms of the fights are not dissimilar to the songs. I always thought there were a lot of martial arts films that were like musicals, so we wanted to take that further. Ya know, in a [[Gene Kelly]] film when he performs an amazing routine, at the end of the scene no one goes, 'Oh my god, that was fucking amazing!' The song is about something, and then there might be some dialogue at the end that is also about that theme. And that's kind of how this works where people have these huge fights \u2013 and it's kind of like how it is in the books \u2013 where everything goes back to normal, and there's a little reaction to what just happened, but there's no sort of mourn the dead.}}\n\nHe also said that some [[music video]]s were made of song performances, including some of Sex Bob-omb and the sole The Clash at Demonhead performance, shooting the entire song even though they would not be used in complete form in the film; he said that they were so good he wanted to get them all recorded so that they had it.{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} The [[Blu-ray]] home release includes special features, with music videos of the complete performances of Sex Bob-omb's \"Garbage Truck\", \"Threshold\", and \"Summertime\", and The Clash at Demonhead's \"Black Sheep\".{{sfn|Tyner|2010}} The music video of \"Black Sheep\" had also been included as a bonus feature with the soundtrack pre-order on [[iTunes]].{{sfn|Cinema Blend|2010}}\n\nMusic from the ''[[The Legend of Zelda|Legend of Zelda]]'' video game series is used to open the film, in sound effects,{{sfn|Hunt|2010a}} and in a dream sequence. To get permission to use the music, Edgar Wright sent a clip of the film and wrote a letter to [[Nintendo of America]] that described the music as \"like nursery rhymes to a generation.\"{{sfn|Miller|2010}} There are other sound effects and clips from other video games used in the film.{{sfn|Hunt|2010a}}{{sfn|Rockotier|2018}} Zeitlin Wu writes that the film pushes the graphic novel's video game elements to the limit by being able to include such sound effects.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\n===Visual effects===\n<!--In some parts of this section, Edgar Wright and Oscar Wright are referred to by their full names to prevent confusion. 'Wright' refers to Edgar.-->\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Whenever the image flashes in the finished shots \u2013 every punch, sword clash or something \u2013 those were actually flashes that we had on-set with [[Flash bulb|photo flashbulbs]].

He noted that some of the work was more complex because of a shooting ethic of Wright's: that there should be a physical representation of any post-production effects.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}}\n\nChurchill described the first fight (Scott vs. Matthew Patel) as \"the most challenging\".{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} He says this was because of the technical elements involved, like the [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[Bollywood]] dance and requiring [[Chroma key|blue screen]] work, matte painting and a lot of stunts. The scene also incorporates the video game [[scrolling]] background effect, which was filmed by a [[second unit]] over a full day. Churchill added that one moment in particular took a lot of work: \"When Scott jumps off the stage into that manga-esque vortex, that's made up of motion picture photography done on-set, digital still photography, and graphics and speed lines drawn by hand from what [Oscar Wright] gave us\".{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} [[Storyboard artist]] Oscar Wright (also brother of director Edgar Wright) noted that the introduction of Patel was used \"to convey the kind of energy [they] wanted, and explore how [they] would introduce the 2D graphic elements\".{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nThe third fight (Scott vs. Todd Ingram) had to be adapted from the comic material more creatively, as Todd's superpowers are shown in print by rings, which was handled by the VFX team. Churchill explains that they took inspiration from the old [[RKO Pictures]] logo of a transmitting tower. To imitate this they \"made the rings feel uneven and have these optical aberrations with color bursts\".{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} In this fight, Scott also gets punched through several walls, which was achieved with camera set-ups. The movement away from Todd is shown from [[Close-up|tight]] and [[Long shot|wide]] camera shots, with Cera as Scott being pulled on a rig in the room. The image of Cera was then merged with a digital Scott and a stunt double, who do go through walls.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}}\n\nThe disappearing superpower used by Roxy in the film was achieved by a blue screen, with actress Whitman being digitally erased, but there was white smoke and flashbulbs used on the set to mark the appearances. Black smoke was added in digitally, while [[lens flare]]s were done manually by \"just flashing different lights at the camera\" for a day to create material.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} Roxy appears in the fourth fight, where she uses a bladed weapon. Churchill says that Whitman learned how to [[Ribbon (rhythmic gymnastics)|ribbon dance]] and used a pink ribbon in the choreography, which was digitally replaced with the weapon.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}}\n\n[[File:Scott_Pilgrim_Katayanagis_fight_storyboard.jpg|left|thumb|Some of the storyboard for the Scott vs. the Katayanagi Twins fight]]\nA new piece of software was written to produce elements of the fifth fight (Scott vs. the Katayanagi Twins); [[Andrew Whitehurst]] developed what Churchill called the \"Wave Form Generator\", and the visual effects team worked with music producer Godrich so they could transform different elements of the music into animations and create visual music.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} Churchill explained that \"the software would convert these sound stems into animation data, so when the band is playing, the graphics and the dragons are moving in time with the music.\"{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} This fight was storyboarded by Oscar Wright without any comic reference as the film overtook the publication of the books.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} The 'audio demons', fighting monsters powered by the music in the film, were then created on-set by Churchill using [[weather balloon]]s.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}}\n\nFor the climax fight against Gideon, a pyramid tower resembling one from [[Super Mario Bros.]] was filmed on for a week, with Churchill saying it often got hot due to the light effects being used, including the flashbulbs and red lights to represent fire on Scott's sword. The scene also used blue screen and lots of stunt performers. Oscar Wright storyboarded the entire sequence except for Gideon's [[glitching]] at the end, which Edgar Wright thought of during editing and was created entirely in post-production.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} Edgar Wright also noted that the pyramid tower fight scene was the slowest piece he had ever filmed, saying: \"So we were raring along at this amazing pace. And then there was this final set piece on a pyramid. Suddenly, we slowed down to doing ten shots in a day, which is very slow for me. I sat there on top of this pyramid, looking down at these enormous platforms being maneuvered around and I thought, 'Who's idea was this?' And it was mine!\"{{sfn|Collis|2010}}\n\nBefore directing fight scenes with visual effects, Wright consulted with director friends with more experience, including [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], and [[Sam Raimi]].{{sfn|Collis|2010}}\n\n===Title sequence===\n<!--In this section, Edgar Wright and Oscar Wright are both referred to with their full names to prevent confusion. In the rest of the article, 'Wright' will refer to Edgar.-->\n[[File:Scott_Pilgrim_title_sequence_frames.jpg|thumb|right|Frames from the title sequence]]\nThe opening [[title sequence]] was designed by Richard Kenworthy of [[Shynola]], and was inspired by [[drawn-on-film animation]]. The sequence also begins with an [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] version of the Universal title slate and music, which [[Art of the Title]] calls the film's \"[[amuse-bouche]]\" and which was designed by Oscar Wright.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nOscar Wright says the 8-bit Universal logo idea was an early decision in production, and that he treated it \"like some crappy low-res, low frame-rate [[Full motion video|FMV]] you might find at the start of some of those games\" from the start.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} Creating the title slate involved separating the letters of 'Universal' and making them appear pixelated, using a matching spinning globe graphic by film animators VooDooDog, and reducing the [[frame rate]] to four seconds (rather than one) so that it appeared \"steppy\"; an 8-bit version of the accompanying music was also added, which Oscar Wright said \"really seals the deal\".{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nEdgar Wright got the idea to have the sequence from Quentin Tarantino after screening an early cut of the film for him. Tarantino told him that the film \"needed a title sequence at the start to let people settle in and hint more about what we were about to see\".{{sfn|Lussier|2011}} The original opening sequence had the film's title shown over the long living room band shot that comes before the title sequence, which Edgar Wright said was one of the first scenes to be storyboarded, with the cast credits at [[Closing credits|the end of the film]].{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} After an early mockup of the title sequence on [[Media Composer|AVID]], they approached Shynola to create it,{{sfn|Lussier|2011}} as the film's graphic artists (Oscar Wright and [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]) were too occupied with the other effects in the film at this point in production and Edgar Wright was familiar with their work.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nThe AVID [[animatic]], a black-and-white sketch animation with [[waveform graphics]], was described by Edgar Wright as already \"giving the film more of a sense of occasion and a very distinct break between the prologue and the first scene that moves the story forward\".{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} At this stage, they had also chosen Beck's \"loudest soundtrack song\" to play over the title sequence.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nKenworthy spoke of his references for the design:{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\n{{Quote|You can't study animation and not be well-versed in [[Len Lye]], [[Oskar Fischinger]], [[Stan Brakhage]], and [[Norman McLaren]]. We went back and re-watched those films and they were still full of life. We got excited about projecting such vivid imagery on the big screen, in front of an audience who most likely hadn't experienced that work.}}\n\nShynola was also given a selection of references from Edgar Wright, who described the brief as \"[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001'']] meets ''[[Sesame Street]]''\" and showed them the title sequence of ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]'', which used [[Graphical sound|drawn-on optical tracks]].{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} As with traditional drawn-on-film animation, Kenworthy traced and painted the images.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} Wright provided musical references as well, saying that they \"wanted to visualize the music and have every graphic, symbol, and subliminal image in time with the music \u2014 a hypnotic barrage of colour, light, and music. The idea was to have it as if the animation is a manifestation of how cool the music is in Knives' head. That's why [they] end the sequence on her watching, the titles are like her brain is exploding with how cool the track is.\"{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nThe brief also requested that the opening sequence not use any of the comic artwork, to not spoil the film, so Kenworthy pitched \"an 8-bit epileptic eye-fight\" and created a [[Mood board|mood film]] using geometric patterns and visual effects from manga; Edgar Wright requested that it should have less overt video game references.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} Shynola then worked with the music concept, Kenworthy saying that they \"hit on making a visual representation of [Sex Bob-omb's] slightly amateurish, raw, garage-y sound. Something that had the feel of a live performance. A lively, colourful, in-your-face scratch film seemed a perfect fit.\"{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} Working with Edgar Wright more, they chose to have a visual representation of each character, and to scratch the appropriate number of 'X' marks for those characters.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nBased on the film nearing completion, Shynola had a short time frame to finish the title sequence, so worked on syncing the sequence and the music digitally at first, visualizing final adjustments before scratching onto sheets of [[acetate film]]. From each sheet of acetate, one second of footage was produced.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} Kenworthy said that after producing the images, they would \"deliberately kick [each sheet] around the floor a bit to pick up a lot of dirt, scratches, and hairs\".{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nPrinting the sequence involved putting each sheet into a high resolution negative scanner and cutting them down into individual frames before printing onto [[35 mm movie film]]. There was also difficulty with the color printing, with most of the colors they wanted to use being \"illegal\".{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} During the printing process, Kenworthy added parts of a scratch film he had made at college, which had been used when scanning to check color accuracy.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\n[[ComicsAlliance]] calls the title sequence \"just the first in a memorable series of seamless mash-ups of graphics, film and animation that beautifully translate the spirit of Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novels to the screen\".{{sfn|Khouri|2011}} Art of the Title describes the sequence as \"visual napalm\",{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} with [[Bleeding Cool]] saying it is \"quite wonderful\".{{sfn|Connelly|2011}} Jade Budowski of [[Decider (website)|''Decider'']] writes that \"with its rapid-fire introductory scene and the ensuing vibrant animated title sequence, [the film] wastes no time in sucking you into [its] world\".{{sfn|Budowski|2018}}\n\n=== Easter eggs ===\n[[File:Plumtreelogo.png|thumb|The Plumtree logo, which Scott wears on a t-shirt in the film]]\nThe film includes several [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] alluding to the comics or for [[foreshadowing]]. Fleischer noted that though the comic and film have Scott and Wallace's apartment at 65A Albert Avenue (filmed at 65 Alberta Avenue), there is a reference to O'Malley's own old apartment at 27 Alberta Avenue as the address on the Amazon delivery slip Scott signs.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} Fleischer also points out the blinking 'L' on a [[Flight Centre Canada]] sign on Manning Avenue, which he writes is a warning that a fight is about to happen.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} Wright said, before the film came out, that a t-shirt of [[Plumtree (band)|Plumtree]], the band that originated the name 'Scott Pilgrim', would feature in the film.{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} Other t-shirts Scott wears include one for [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], a band sharing his initials;{{sfn|Rockotier|2018}} one with the bass guitar logo from the ''[[Rock Band]]'' game series;{{sfn|Riviello|2017a}} and one that references [[Fantastic Four]], which he wears after defeating Lucas, played by Evans, who at the time was best known for his role as the [[Human Torch]] in the [[Fantastic Four in film|Fantastic Four movies]].{{sfn|Hunt|2010a}} Scott's changing t-shirts often match Ramona's changing hair color through the film.{{sfn|Rockotier|2018}}\n\nThere are also references to other media, particularly gaming and comics, with ''[[Den of Geek]]''<nowiki/>'s James Hunt compiling a list of several, including Scott's [[X-Men]] patch seen as he rips it from his coat; the ''Legend of Zelda'' [[Triforce]] represented by Gideon's initials in the film and title sequence ([[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World#Title sequence|shown above]]) and the [[Dark Link]]-inspired Nega-Scott; Envy's band being named after the 1990 game ''The Clash at Demonhead'' (as well as [[The Clash]]); Kim dressing in [[Lolita (term)|Japanese Gothic Lolita]] fashion for the final battle as a point of humor; the scene that was shot, performed, and edited entirely like a ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode; and using the \"this is a league game\" line from ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''.{{sfn|Hunt|2010a}} ''[[/Film]]'' notes that slow-motion broken glass falling and reflecting Ramona and Roxy as they fight resembles the character selection screen of ''[[Street Fighter]]'', and that the Chaos Theater and Sex Bob-omb's forced labor is a reference to ''[[EarthBound]]''.{{sfn|Riviello|2017b}}\n\nLike The Clash at Demonhead, the other band names reference video games: Sex Bob-omb to the [[Bob-omb]]s in Mario franchise games, and Crash and the Boys to a game called ''[[Crash 'n' the Boys: Street Challenge]]''. According to actress Larson, ''The Clash at Demonhead'' was the first game that comic author O'Malley ever had.{{sfn|Rockotier|2018}}\n\nScott playing the bassline of what he calls \"[[Final Fantasy|Final Fantasy 2]]\" is also considered an easter egg; he plays the bassline from the game ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', but this game was known as ''Final Fantasy 2'' outside of Japan in the 1990s because the second and third installments had not been released internationally at the time.{{sfn|Rockotier|2018}}\n\nIn her adaptation discussion, Zeitlin Wu notes that in the graphic novel, the fourth fight (Scott vs. Roxy Richter) was a frame-for-frame recreation of the introduction to [[Ninja Gaiden]], and in the film this same frame-for-frame remake is used as the introduction of the final fight against Gideon.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Michael Cera as Captain America by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Cera dressed as [[Captain America]] at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con ''Scott Pilgrim'' panel, in reference to Chris Evans' absence due to commitments for ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''{{sfn|Comic Con|2010b}}]]\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| width  = 315px\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh2-p8hzRj8 Comic Con 2010: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Panel - Part 1] \u2013 via YouTube\n| video2 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llA25X9mPtE Comic Con 2010: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Panel - Part 2] \u2013 via YouTube\n| video3 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvI5WqwZkhU Comic Con 2010: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Panel - Part 3] \u2013 via YouTube\n| video4 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArkDWrHmmXI Black Sheep (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Comic-Con Performance)] on Metric [[Vevo]] \u2013 via YouTube\n}}\nA ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' panel was featured in Hall H{{sfn|Comic Con|2010b}} at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] on July 22, 2010; after the panel, Wright invited selected members of the audience for a screening of the film, which was followed by a performance of \"Black Sheep\" by Metric.{{sfn|Lang|2010}}{{sfn|Joyce|2010}} Three of the [[ensemble cast]] members, Evans, Simmons and Larson, were missing from the Comic-Con panel; Edgar Wright's frequent collaborators [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Nick Frost]] made brief appearances, with Wright joking about them not being in this film.{{sfn|Comic Con|2010b}} The film was then shown at the [[Fantasia Festival]] in [[Montreal]] on July 27, 2010,{{sfn|Fantasia|2010}} and was also featured at Movie-Con III in London on August 15, 2010.{{sfn|Dinning|2009}}\n\nThe film premiered in Canada in Toronto on August 13, 2010; Plumtree, who had broken up years earlier, got back together for a show at the event.{{sfn|Down|2010}}{{sfn|McMahon|2010}} In Japan, the film premiered during the [[Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival]] on February 26, 2011 as an official selection.

Bodner gives the examples of: the \"[graphic text] 'a&nbsp;b&nbsp;o&nbsp;u&nbsp;t t&nbsp;o e&nbsp;x&nbsp;p&nbsp;l&nbsp;o&nbsp;d&nbsp;e' appearing as an agitated Scott enters the after-party\" that \"[prefigures] a (nonphysical) fight with Ramona\" as a form of label that \"externalizes subjective perspectives\"; the use of O'Malley's typical ironic [[authorial voice]] appearing when a commentary box \"helpfully appears to inform [the audience]\" that Todd, after seemingly rhetorically saying he doesn't know the meaning of incorrigible, \"really doesn't\" know the meaning; and the use of onomatopoeia text graphics as sound effects.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Zeitlin Wu notes that the film \"is one of the only adaptations to incorporate text in such a way that conveys the hybrid text/image construction of comics in cinematic form, pushing their transmediality to the next level\", and ultimately destabilizes formal boundaries.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\nRegarding the onomatopoeia used, Bodner notes that only once does such text-as-graphic actually replace a sound effect (Todd's hair deflating, paired with the word \"SAG\"), with the approximately 40 other instances having both sound and the onomatopoeia representing it.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} The function of the comic book technique in these cases is said to be an act of denaturalizing the film form and, per Robert S. Peterson, \"to slow the reader down and create greater visual depth and texture to the scene\".{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Zeitlin Wu instead suggests that this was done to further incorporate the comic book nature into the film form, with sound and image perfectly synchronized, saying that \"the result is an illusionistic synthesis of image, text, and sound in which words have their own materiality. Each font seems to have its own personality and substance; 'DING DONG' dissolves ephemerally, whereas the letters in 'BLAM!' rapidly fall out of the frame one by one, like a row of dominoes\".{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} Bodner adds that marks used in the film illustrate both sound and eye-line, things that can be shown in film without marks, and so are also used to denaturalize the scenes they appear in.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Burke writes further on the use of written sound effects, saying that \"there are areas in which comics' visualized sound trumps cinema's soundtrack\", engaging with [[Robert C. Harvey]] to agree that \"word and picture can be coupled to reveal the hero's cheery bravado even in the very midst of thundering action\".{{sfn|Burke|2015}}\n\n[[File:Sex_Bob-Omb_split_screen.png|left|thumb|An example of spatial remediation in the film to simulate comic book panels, with three simultaneous but not spatially-continuous images shown and framed with black \"gutters\" (as in {{sfn|Bodner|2019}}{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}})]]\nAnother technique that Bodner describes as giving the film its [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] reading{{sfn|Grant|Henderson|2019}} is how Wright seems to alter the film form to reflect elements inherent to comic book sequences, specifically that \"[Wright] consistently but judiciously [quotes] panel content throughout the film \u2013 generally [...] using the illusion of stasis in film to mirror the illusion of movement in comics\".{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} In terms of form, Bodner writes that Wright transcodes the \"construction of comic panels\" into the film; Wright himself has said that \"a lot of people have mentioned [...] how it feel[s] like reading a comic book\",{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} a sentiment echoed by Zeitlin Wu.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} Bodner suggests that this is created by [[Transition (film)|transition]] techniques, and that the techniques that produce this are Wright's own, building from his work in ''Shaun of the Dead'' and ''Hot Fuzz'', adding that they work by \"replicating [the panel's] companion \u2013 the '[[Gutter (typography)|gutter]]'.\"{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Wright is said to recreate this element of outside space in comics in the film form by making \"cuts that are exceedingly quick or that open into shots that displace conventional temporal logic ([[Continuity editing|anticontinuity editing]]), or with cuts that utilize a purposefully barely visible [[Wipe (transition)|wipe]] effect\",{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} and by using \"blackouts, which function as brief moments of dead space\" between certain frames.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\nDiscussing the comic book translation in her writing on the process of the film's adaptation, Zeitlin Wu notes that \"many storyboards [for the film] were taken directly from the comics\", saying that one method of overcoming the temporal-spatial and illustrative-representative differences in graphic novel and film media is to combine the comic panel and storyboard grid.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} Within ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'', she writes that the comic panel-storyboarded sequences \"convey a sense of fragmentation, rather than the usual illusion of cinematic continuity\" and that \"the most effective use of comics as storyboard is in Scott's dream sequences, which facilitate his encounters with Ramona as she travels through 'subspace'.\"{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} In the first of the [[dream sequence]]s, \"Wright maintains the fragmentation of the comics medium by retaining the divisions between the original panels: the screen fades to black after each frame, an attempt to mimic the simultaneously [[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic and synchronic]] experience of reading comics\".{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} In another example of film panel use, Bodner notes that the static frame shows Scott at the computer ordering a package, the next shot is of Wallace, and the next of Scott sat in front of the door, waiting; Bodner explains that the temporality of these images on screen is not naturalistic, and that they better represent comic panels where temporality can be otherwise deduced by the reader. He adds that, as [[pastiche]], this scene serves a dual function to foreshadow the [[magical realism]] that will appear.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}}\n\nIn a similar form-bending way, there are two scenes (\"the first battle of the bands and Lucas Lee's 'grind' down the rail\") where Wright uses high-volume noise to recreate the silent form of comic books, as in a film the loudness drowns out any other sound and requires the use of text in the same way that the purely visual comic book form does.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Burke also notes the benefit of visual text when sound would otherwise be \"muted by ambient noise\", and how (other) \"film adaptations often render comics' most loquacious characters mute\".{{sfn|Burke|2015}}\n\nIn his chapter \"Tell It Like a Game: Scott Pilgrim and Performative Media Rivalry\", Jeff Thoss writes on the various transmedial cues, saying that \"the film attempts to outdo the comic book series in its emulation of video game features both on the level of the storyworld and on the level of its representation. But as neither of these two works emerges victorious, their so-called rivalry appears less as a real competition than as a way to illuminate the specific narrative affordances and limitations of comics, films, and computer games\".{{sfn|Ryan|Thon|2014}} Building on Thoss, Fehrle examines the [[Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)#Remediation|remediation]] ([[Jay David Bolter|Bolter]] and [[Richard Grusin|Grusin]]), or use of imitation, of video game signifiers. Looking particularly at the Scott vs. Matthew Patel fight, he writes that there is \"not only [the] remediation of arcade fighting and beat 'em up video games, [...] but also a TV aesthetic [...] as well as a play with some iconic film genres [...] and finally a strong link to the theater as a fifth medium thrown into the mix when we see Ramona on a Shakespearean balcony placed at the center of an extremely conspicuous spotlight\".{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} He continues technically analyzing the scene by noting the [[Split screen (video production)|split screen]]; Fehrle first sees the technique as \"more recently associated primarily with the [[MTV]]-aesthetics of 1990s TV\", noting that it is \"an 'unnatural' editing technique, foregrounding the mediality of film by making visible the impact of an editor, a role which in the dominant continuity editing system is regarded as one that should be kept hidden\".{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} Fehrle describes the rest of the sequence featuring Matthew Patel as a parody of music videos, including the \"tap dance, which is highlighted by the camera's framing of only his feet, as well as his willfully over-acted ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''-inspired pose\", while also mentioning its [[Spaghetti Western]]-inspired \"through-the-legs duel shot\".{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}}\n\nHowever, he also joins Zeitlin Wu in describing it as a comic and video game element,{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} likewise noting the \"strong spatiality of the comics medium through its panel layout\" represented in the film, especially the \"black gutter-like division between the three 'panels'\" in the scene.{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} Fehrle adds further that its video game referent for the [[Split screen (video games)|split screen]] is that of \"console video games' multiplayer modes\", with other video game elements informing the sequence including \"an 8-bit arcade 'bling' sound playing when Patel lands[,] as well as the excessive echo and slight delay on Wallace's voice as he screams 'fight', [and] superimposed text [...] which dramatically juxtaposes the opponents, instructs the player what to do or explains the (health or energy) status of characters or helps players interpret what is happening\".{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} He adds that a more obvious remediation of comic books is seen in the O'Malley-like graphic novel drawings that appear to illustrate Ramona and Matthew's backstory. From this multitude of referents, Fehrle describes the film and the ''Scott Pilgrim'' franchise as \"[[Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)#Remediation|hypermediated]]\".{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}}\n\nThe sequence following Scott breaking up with Knives is analyzed in different ways. Maria J. Ortiz looks at [[mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]] and narrative meaning with the scene, writing that when Scott \"tells [Knives] that he wants to break off the relationship, the next shot of her is against a dark background without a realistic reason\" and so introduces metaphors that inform the story: \"good is bright/bad is dark\" and that \"the change of background [is] a metaphor for the change produced in the state of the relationship\", resulting in the idea that a bad change is a literal dark place here.{{sfn|Ortiz|2014}} Bodner looks at the transmediality of the framing used when Scott walks away, matching the graphic novel, with a tree and streetcar bracketing the frame to introduce a solitude of Scott and Knives, particularly with a static camera that represents the panel. In the film, this is followed by characters passing in front of Scott to lead into a wipe, which Bodner says \"is common in the film and acts as the inked line that makes the panel border\".{{sfn|Bodner|2019}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a score of 81% based on 264 reviews and is certified fresh, with the site's consensus saying that \"Its script may not be as dazzling as its eye-popping visuals, but ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' is fast, funny, and inventive\".{{sfn|Rotten Tomatoes}} [[Metacritic]] gave the film an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 69 out of 100, based on 38 reviews, indicating a \"generally favorable\" response.{{sfn|Metacritic}}\n\n{{Anchor|Critics}}Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review, referring to the film as \"an example of attention-deficit filmmaking at both its finest and its most frustrating\", saying that it was economical with its storytelling and successfully incorporated the many big fight set pieces, but that it missed opportunities to build Scott and Ramona's relationship.{{sfn|Debruge|2010}} [[David Edelstein]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine also gives a mixed review, agreeing that Scott \"hardly seems worthy of Winstead's Ramona\", though he did think that \"the parade of super-villain exes [...] is like a forced march; [he] felt [he]'d had [his] fill of the fights and there were still five exes to go\".{{sfn|Edelstein|2010}} [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] gives a generally positive review, but does agree that the number of fights holds the film back, writing that \"Seven sounds like a lot. It is, in fact, two or three too many.\"{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gives a largely negative review, thinking that the film is \"a discouragingly limp movie in which nothing is at stake. A character can 'die,' then simply rewind video and come back to life. Or change his mind about his true love and then change it again. Scott Pilgrim's battle isn't against the world; it's against an erratic moral compass.\"{{sfn|Honeycutt|2010}} Cindy White at [[IGN]] gives a positive review, praising Wright and the film's style extensively, though does mention that \"the middle drags a bit and the ending isn't all [she] hoped it would be.\"{{sfn|White|2010}}\n\n[[A. O. Scott]], who made the film a [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] \"critics pick\", also reviewed it positively, suggesting it was \"the best video game movie ever\".{{sfn|Scott|2010}} ''[[Slant Magazine]]''<nowiki/>'s Nick Schager also gave the film a positive review, of 3.5 stars out of 4,{{sfn|Schager|2010}} with colleague Simon Abrams calling it \"the most visually exciting, funny, and emotionally involving studio-produced film of the year\" and awarding 4 stars out of 5 in his DVD review.{{sfn|Abrams|2010}}\n\n{{image frame|content={{Photomontage\n |photo1a=Brie Larson cropped.jpg\n |photo1b=Kieran Culkin by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n |size=250\n |spacing=2\n |color=\n |color_border=\n |border=\n}}|width=255|align=right|caption=Brie Larson (pictured at the film's UK premiere) and Kieran Culkin (pictured at the San Diego Comic-Con panel) have been described as the film's \"scene stealers\", while reception to lead Michael Cera was mixed|max-width=}}\n<!--Actors-->Debruge praised the ensemble cast and Wright's directing skills that make each of the many characters distinctive. However, he criticized Cera's performance, saying that \"his comic timing is impeccable, [but] he's finally played the wilty wallflower one too many times\".{{sfn|Debruge|2010}} Edelstein found the film's biggest issue to be Cera's acting, saying that \"a different lead might have kept you laughing and engaged. Cera doesn't come alive in the fight scenes the way [[Stephen Chow]] does in [...] surreal martial-arts comedies [like] ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]''\",{{sfn|Edelstein|2010}} with Honeycutt dissecting the storytelling and determining that \"Cera doesn't give a performance that anchors the nonsense\" of the film.{{sfn|Honeycutt|2010}} Conversely, A. O. Scott wrote that \"somehow [Cera and Winstead] make it work\" in selling the relationship without being a clich\u00e9,{{sfn|Scott|2010}} and Abrams said that the actors had \"never looked this good, especially Cera\", noting that \"[his] performance is knowingly affected and self-absorbed throughout scenes depicting Scott and Knives's awkward dating\" as the film deliberately plays up Scott's initial narcissism.{{sfn|Abrams|2010}} Cera's delivery of the particular line \"I was thinking we should break up, or whatever\" has been reviewed as amusing{{sfn|Edelstein|2010}} and awkwardly realistic.{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} White wrote that the actors playing Ramona's exes \"all [seem] to be having a blast in their scenes\".{{sfn|White|2010}} Brie Larson and Kieran Culkin have been frequently described as the film's [[scene stealer]]s for their performances as Scott's ex, rock star Envy Adams, and Scott's roommate, gay Wallace Wells.{{sfn|Collis|2010}}{{sfn|Debruge|2010}}{{sfn|Travers|2010}}{{sfn|Aziz|2010}}{{sfn|Zhong|2013}}{{sfn|Bond|2016}}{{sfn|Foster|2018}} Chris Evans and Brandon Routh have also been called scene stealers in some reviews.{{sfn|Reynolds|2010}}{{sfn|Hunt|2010b}}{{sfn|O'Hara|2010}}\n\n<!--Audience-->As a negative, Debruge added that \"anyone over 25 is likely to find [the film] exhausting, like playing chaperone at a party full of oversexed college kids\",{{sfn|Debruge|2010}} remarks echoed by Honeycutt, who called the film \"juvenile\" and thought that \"a wider audience among older or international viewers seems unlikely.\"{{sfn|Honeycutt|2010}} White gave the film a positive rating of 8/10, saying that it is \"best suited for the wired generation and those of us who grew up on [[Nintendo]] and MTV. Its kinetic nature and quirky sensibilities might be a turnoff for some.\"{{sfn|White|2010}} Scott also found the youth elements appealing, writing that \"there are some movies about youth that just make you feel old, even if you aren't [but] ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' has the opposite effect. Its speedy, funny, happy-sad spirit is so infectious that the movie makes you feel at home in its world even if the landscape is, at first glance, unfamiliar.\"{{sfn|Scott|2010}} Abrams opened his review lamenting that \"the sad thing about ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' is that people assumed that because it embraced its niche-oriented demographic's interests, in its ad campaign and in its content, that it was destined for cult status and nothing more.\"{{sfn|Abrams|2010}}\n\n<!--Style and Comics-->Schager wrote that Edgar Wright is an \"inspired mash-up artist, and ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' may be his finest hybridization to date\", saying the film has become a \"m\u00eal\u00e9e-heavy video game\".{{sfn|Schager|2010}} Debruge also said that \"style [...] becomes the level at which we must appreciate Wright's work\", particularly noting the 8-bit Universal logo and the ''Seinfeld'' scene.{{sfn|Debruge|2010}} White explains that though the video game style and structure is non-realistic, \"even the most outlandish elements flow naturally from the storytelling\".{{sfn|White|2010}} The style was also compared to the comics. According to Phillips, \"Edgar Wright understands the appeal of the original Bryan Lee O'Malley graphic novels [...] O'Malley's manga-inspired books combine utter [[wikt:banal|banality]] with [[superhero film|superhero]] [[hyperbole]], [and] Wright, who is British, has taken it on and won. [The film] lives and breathes the style of the original books, with animated squiggles and hearts and stars filling out the frame in many individual shots.\"{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} Edelstein opened his review by saying \"Yes, this is how you bring a graphic novel to life onscreen!\", elaborating that \"[Wright takes the] Canadian mangas (in which the mundane meets the superheroic) and concocts a syntax all his own: part comic panel, part arcade video game\"{{sfn|Edelstein|2010}} Honeycutt also agrees that \"Director/producer/co-writer Edgar Wright [...] has successfully reproduced the imagery and worldview of Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novel, itself a mash-up of ordinary characters lost in a world of manga, video games, music videos and comic book iconography.\"{{sfn|Honeycutt|2010}} White writes that the elements of mash-up in the film's style creates \"a pop-culture cocktail that is fun, funny and deliciously offbeat\", praising Wright for \"[making the comic book elements] work in the translation to live action, and [having] enough respect for O'Malley's work in the first place to try to capture that spirit;{{sfn|White|2010}} Scott agrees, saying that the success comes from its ingenuity in bringing the video game to the player's world, rather than the other way around, and so \"the line between fantasy and reality is not so much blurred as erased, because the filmmakers create an entirely coherent, perpetually surprising universe\".{{sfn|Scott|2010}} Abrams also notes that some of the comic elements work better in the film, like when Scott wakes up, followed by Wallace and Other Scott, because of the timing of the medium. He opines that Wright has also managed to include additional scenes that further inform Scott's characterization and add humor to moments from the comics.{{sfn|Abrams|2010}}\n\n=== Popular response ===\nAfter seeing the film at a test screening, the American director [[Kevin Smith]] said he was impressed by it, and that \"it's spellbinding and nobody is going to understand what the fuck just hit them\", and that Wright \"is bringing a comic book to life.\"{{sfn|The Film Stage|2010}} Smith also said that fellow directors Quentin Tarantino and [[Jason Reitman]] were \"really into it\".{{sfn|The Film Stage|2010}} Carla Gillis, a writer for ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' and former lead singer for the band Plumtree, also commented on the film, as her band's song \"[[Plumtree (band)#Scott Pilgrim|Scott Pilgrim]]\" was the inspiration for O'Malley to create the series; Gillis felt the film carried the same positive yet bittersweet tone of the song.{{sfn|Kaplan|2010}} Several notable video game, film, and [[anime]] industry personalities also praised the film after it premiered in Japan, among them [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], [[Goichi Suda]], [[Miki Mizuno]], [[Tomohiko It\u014d (director)|Tomohiko It\u014d]] and [[Takao Nakano]].{{sfn|Wright|2011}}\n\nIn June 2013, O'Malley, who is of Korean and white Canadian parentage, stated that he regretted the fact that the film's cast was predominantly white, and that there were not enough roles for minorities.{{sfn|O'Malley|2013}}\n\nIn an editorial for Rotten Tomatoes, [[Nathan Rabin]] wrote that the film has a cult following,{{sfn|Rabin|2017}} and in a 2015 [[Met Film School]] feature, Danny Kelly listed it as one of the six most underrated films ever, saying it is \"a crime\" that more people did not go to see it.{{sfn|Kelly|2015}}\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Scott Pilgrim vs. the World}}\n''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' has received many awards and nominations.

It stars [[Michael Cera]] as [[List of Scott Pilgrim characters#Scott Pilgrim|Scott Pilgrim]], a slacker musician who must win a competition to get a record deal and battle the seven evil exes of his newest girlfriend [[List of Scott Pilgrim characters#Ramona Flowers|Ramona Flowers]], played by [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]. It also stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Brandon Routh]] and [[Mae Whitman]] as some of the evil exes, [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Kieran Culkin]] and [[Alison Pill]] as some of Scott's friends, and [[Brie Larson]] as Scott's own evil ex. [[Jason Schwartzman]] plays Gideon, Ramona's most recent ex and the competition's record producer.\n\nA film adaptation of the comics was proposed following the release of the first volume. Wright became attached to the project early on, with filming beginning several years later in March 2009 in [[Toronto]]. The film premiered after a panel discussion at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] on July 22, 2010, and received a [[wide release]] in North America on August 13, 2010.\n\nIt notably uses famous features of its Toronto setting, as well as video game and comic book imagery and a matching style. Using a [[battle of the bands]] plot, it also uses different real bands as a basis for each fictional group, including [[Beck]] and [[Metric (band)|Metric]], with the actors in the film performing themselves. It contains extensive visual effects, using a combination of digital and physical methods to create the image, with the title sequence and some of the fight scenes incorporating music into the graphics.\n\nThe film was a [[box-office bomb]] but received positive reviews from critics, who particularly noted the film's visual style and humor; it eventually garnered a [[cult following]]. It has made several Top Ten lists and [[List of accolades received by Scott Pilgrim vs. the World|received over 70 awards and nominations]]. It was shortlisted for the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] category at the [[83rd Academy Awards]]. In scholarly analysis, it has been widely discussed as a [[transmedia narrative]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- see WP:FILMPLOT before adding/removing text -->\nIn Toronto, 22-year-old Scott Pilgrim is a [[bass guitar|bassist]] in Sex Bob-Omb, a floundering [[garage band]]. He is dating Knives Chau, a 17-year-old high-school student, to the disapproval of his friends in the band, his roommate Wallace Wells, and his younger sister Stacey Pilgrim. Scott meets an American [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] delivery girl, [[Ramona Flowers]], after having first seen her in a dream. He loses interest in Knives, but doesn't break up with her before pursuing Ramona. When Sex Bob-Omb plays in a [[battle of the bands]] sponsored by record executive Gideon Graves, Scott is attacked by Ramona's ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel. Scott defeats Patel and learns that, in order to date Ramona, he must defeat her remaining six evil exes.\n\nScott finally breaks up with Knives, who blames Ramona and swears to win him back. Meanwhile, Scott proceeds to get attacked by, and defeats, the next three of Ramona's exes: Hollywood actor and skateboarder Lucas Lee, super-powered [[vegan]] Todd Ingram, and [[lesbian]] ninja Roxy Richter, while also confronting his own ex, pop star Envy Adams. However, Scott grows frustrated during the process, and after an outburst regarding Ramona's dating history, she breaks up with him. \n\nAt the next battle of the bands, Sex Bob-Omb defeats Ramona's fifth and sixth evil exes, twins Kyle and Ken Katayanagi, earning Scott an [[1-up|extra life]]. Despite this, Ramona appears to get back with her seventh evil ex, Gideon. Sex Bob-Omb accepts Gideon's [[recording contract|record deal]], except for Scott, who quits the band in protest. Gideon invites Scott to his venue, the Chaos Theater, where Sex Bob-Omb is playing. Resolving to win Ramona back, Scott challenges Gideon to a fight for her affection, earning the \"Power of Love\" sword. Knives interrupts the battle, attacking Ramona, and Scott is forced to reveal that he cheated on both of them. Gideon kills Scott and Ramona visits him in [[limbo]] to reveal that Gideon has implanted her with a [[mind control]] device.\n\nScott uses his 1-up and re-enters the Chaos Theater. He makes peace with his friends and challenges Gideon again, this time for himself, gaining the \"Power of Self-Respect\" sword. After apologizing to Ramona and Knives for cheating on them, and accepting his own faults, Scott and Knives join forces to defeat Gideon.\n\nFree from Gideon's control, Ramona prepares to leave. Knives accepts that her relationship with Scott is over and, at her encouragement, he leaves with Ramona to \"try again.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Scott Pilgrim characters}}\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Michael Cera]] as Scott Pilgrim\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Ramona Flowers\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Wallace Wells\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Lucas Lee\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Stacey Pilgrim\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Natalie V. \"Envy\" Adams\n* [[Alison Pill]] as Kim Pine\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Julie Powers\n* [[Brandon Routh]] as Todd Ingram\n* [[Jason Schwartzman]] as Gideon Graves\n* [[Johnny Simmons]] as \"Young\" Neil Nordegraf\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as Stephen Stills\n* [[Mae Whitman]] as Roxy Richter\n* [[Ellen Wong]] as Knives Chau\n* [[Satya Bhabha]] as Matthew Patel\n* {{ill|Shota Saito (actor)|lt=Shota Saito|ja|\u6589\u85e4\u7965\u592a}} as Kyle Katayanagi\n* {{ill|Keita Saito (actor)|lt=Keita Saito|ja|\u6589\u85e4\u6176\u592a}} as Ken Katayanagi\n* [[Nelson Franklin]] as Michael Comeau\n* [[Bill Hader]] as The Voice\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' was produced by several international companies: [[Marc Platt Productions]] (United States), [[Big Talk Productions|Big Talk Films]] (United Kingdom), Closed On Mondays Entertainment (United States), and [[Dentsu]] (Japan).{{sfn|Grierson|2010}}\n\n===Development===\n{{image frame|content={{Photomontage\n |photo1a=Edgar Wright by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n |photo1b=Bryan Lee O'Malley by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n |size=250\n |spacing=2\n |color=\n |color_border=\n |border=\n}}|width=255|align=left|caption=Edgar Wright and Bryan Lee O'Malley at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic-Con International]]|max-width=}}\nAfter artist [[Bryan Lee O'Malley]] completed the first volume of ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'', his publisher [[Oni Press]] contacted producer [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]] to propose a [[film adaptation]].{{sfn|Winning|2010a}} O'Malley originally had mixed feelings about a film adaptation, stating that he \"expected them to turn it into a full-on action comedy with some actor that [he] hated\", though he also \"didn't even care\", admitting: \"I was a starving artist, and I was like, 'Please, just give me some money.'\"{{sfn|Martens|2010a}} [[Universal Studios]] contracted director [[Edgar Wright]], who had just finished the 2004-released ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and agreed to adapt the ''Scott Pilgrim'' comics.{{sfn|Winning|2010a}}{{sfn|Snyder|2005}} Wright had first become interested in making the film when given a pre-release copy of the first graphic novel during the ''Shaun of the Dead'' press tour,{{sfn|Collis|2010}} later saying that \"everything that [he] found interesting about the book, and why it felt fresh and unique, was irresistible to adapt.\"{{sfn|Leader|2010}} In May 2005, the studio signed [[Michael Bacall]] to co-write the screenplay.{{sfn|Snyder|2005}} \n\nWright cited [[Mario Bava]]'s 1968 film ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'' as an influence on his approach to ''Scott Pilgrim'', describing it by saying that he took an \"Italian influence, a sense of completely unbridled imagination. They don't make any attempt to make it look realistic. Mario Bava's composition and staging has a real try-anything attitude.\"{{sfn|Huddleston}} Bacall said that he wanted to write the ''Scott Pilgrim'' film because he felt strongly about its story and empathized with its characters.{{sfn|AP|2010}} Wright said that O'Malley was \"very involved\" with the script of the film from the start, contributing lines and adding polish. Due to the long development, several lines from various scripts written by Wright and Bacall were used in later ''Scott Pilgrim'' comics.{{sfn|Dan|2010}} The screenplay's second draft, which O'Malley said \"became the main draft for the film\", was submitted right at midnight on the night the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers' Strike]] was supposed to begin in October 2007.{{sfn|Down|2010}} No material from ''Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour'', the sixth ''Scott Pilgrim'' volume, appeared in the film, as the comic was not complete at the time of the film's production; O'Malley contributed suggestions for the film's ending and gave the producers his notes for the sixth volume,{{sfn|Winning|2010b}} but stated that the film's ending was \"their ending\".{{sfn|Sciretta|2009}} Some ideas for the film's ending were cut before production, including that Scott would turn out to be a serial killer who fantasized the gaming aspects{{sfn|Campbell|2010}} and that Gideon would turn into a [[Transformers]]-style robot.{{sfn|Wigler|2010}}\n\nThe film takes on elements of style from the graphic novels, including the use of comic book text-as-graphic (e.g. sound effect onomatopoeia), which is described by Wright and O'Malley as \"merely the internal perspective of how Scott understands himself and the world\".{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} It has been described as both a video game and a comic book film.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\n[[Casting (performing arts)|Casting]] of the principal characters began in June 2008.{{sfn|Villeneuve|2009}} Test shoots began in July 2008, with Wright saying that there was a year of preparation before shooting began. He also stopped working on his ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' screenplay for two years during the production of ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World''.{{sfn|Leader|2010}} By 2009, casting had been completed and the film was titled ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World''.{{sfn|Kit|2009}} The cast spent two months in fight training together before filming, with [[Brad Allan]] and Peng Zhang of the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]];{{sfn|Leader|2010}}{{sfn|Comic Con|2010a}} Michael Cera said that he \"got kicked in the throat during the training\" and \"expected it to be excruciating, but it didn\u2019t hurt at all, which was really confusing.\"{{sfn|Collis|2010}} [[Principal photography]] began in March 2009 in [[Toronto]]{{sfn|Wright|2009a}}{{sfn|Scott Pilgrim The Movie|2009}} and wrapped as scheduled in August.{{sfn|Villeneuve|2009}}{{sfn|Wright|2009b}} In the film's original ending, written before the release of the final ''Scott Pilgrim'' book, Scott gets back together with Knives. After the final book in the series, in which Scott and Ramona get back together, was released, and with divided audience reaction to the film's original ending, a new ending was filmed to match the books, with Scott and Ramona getting back together.{{sfn|Lussier|2010a}} This was shot three months before the film was released;{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Wright says that it is his \"preferred ending\".{{sfn|Wigler|2010}} The film was given a production budget of $85\u201390 million, an amount offset by tax rebates that resulted in a final cost of around $60 million.{{sfn|Box Office Mojo}} [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] fronted $60 million of the pre-rebate budget.{{sfn|Corliss|2010}} O'Malley's [[Audio commentary|commentary track]] was recorded on August 14, 2010, one day after the film's theatrical release.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}}\n\n===Setting===\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical\n|image1=Bloor_Street_West_&_Bathurst_Street_(22727323996).jpg|caption1=The intersection at Bathurst Street, with the Bloor Street West Pizza Pizza, used in the film{{sfn|Movie Locations}}\n|image2=Artscape_Wychwood_Barns_(22529716870).jpg|caption2=The Artscape Wychwood Barns venue is used as the nightclub for the after party where Scott fights Roxy{{sfn|Movie Locations}}\n|image3=Lee's palace mural 2005.png|caption3=Lee's Palace entrance mural pre-2010}}\nOne of the producers, Miles Dale, said that the film is \"the biggest movie ever identifiably set in [[Toronto]].\"{{sfn|Schneller|2012}} The film features notable Toronto locations <!--Only use examples stated in the sources.-->[[Casa Loma]], [[St. Michael's College School]], Sonic Boom, the [[Toronto Public Library]] Wychwood Library, a [[Goodwill Industries|Goodwill]] location on St. Clair West, a [[Second Cup]], a [[Pizza Pizza]], [[Lee's Palace]], and [[Wychwood Barns|Artscape Wychwood Barns]].<!--Only use examples stated in the sources.-->{{sfn|Movie Locations}}{{sfn|Schneller|2012}}{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The production planned to set the series in Toronto because, in Dale's words, \"the books are super-specific in their local details\" and director Wright wanted to use the imagery from the books, so Universal Studios had no plans to alter the setting.{{sfn|Schneller|2012}} Dale stated that \"[[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst Street]] is practically the cerebral cortex of Scott Pilgrim\".{{sfn|Schneller|2012}} David Fleischer of ''[[Torontoist]]'' wrote that though films set in [[New York City]] show off all the major landmarks, \"Scott Pilgrim revels in the simplicity\" of everyday locations that are still identifiably Toronto, like the Bathurst/Bloor intersection and a single Pizza Pizza restaurant.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}}\n\nDirector Wright, who lived in the city for a year before making the film, said that \"as a British filmmaker making [his] first film outside the UK, [he] wouldn't want anyone to give [him] demerits for getting the location wrong\", sticking to the real Toronto and \"shooting even the most banal of locations\" in the comic.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} Wright said that the first thing he did when he arrived in Toronto was to tour all of the locations with O'Malley, saying that this gave him a \"kind of touch down at the real locations [that] just made everything feel right\", though O'Malley could not remember the exact spots of some and so they drove around using his comic reference photos to find them.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The production was allowed to film in Second Cup and Pizza Pizza locations, with Wright saying that using them instead of [[Starbucks]] \"just felt right\" because \"it means something to Canadian audiences and people in international audiences just think [they] made [Pizza Pizza] up [them]selves. It sounds like a cute movie brand\".{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}}\n\nWright said that he took pride in having been able to record the original Lee's Palace mural before it was taken down; he also had the old bar reconstructed on a set for interior scenes, which was positively received when the bands consulting for the film visited. Wright suggested that \"they wanted it preserved as a museum piece\".{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} Another reconstruction was the Rock It club, which no longer existed, with the interior built on a sound stage.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The Sonic Boom store had been changed from how it appeared in the comics, but allowed its interior to be restored to the previous look for filming.{{sfn|Movie Locations}}{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The backgrounds were also changed for the film: many landscapes were simplified in [[post-production]] to emulate the drawing style in the comics, including removing a lot of trees from the scenes shot at [[Hillcrest Park]] and Turner Road.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}}\n\nThe Casa Loma has served as a movie set for many different productions, and so appearing in ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' as itself being a movie set was described as \"very trippy\".{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The scene of the Casa Loma also shows the [[CN Tower]] and [[Baldwin Steps]], with [[Don McKellar]] (who played the director in the scene) reporting that \"people were going crazy\" at opening night in Toronto when it played.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} The Casa Loma fight is in the original comic book, but the moment when Lucas Lee is pushed through a [[matte painting]] generic cityscape to reveal the CN Tower was only added for the film. In his chapter, '\"Scott Pilgrim Gets It Together\": The Cultural Crossovers of Bryan Lee O'Malley', Mark Berninger calls this reveal \"an ironic reference to the specific filmic location\" and says that it is \"entirely in line with O'Malley's use of metafictional commentary to stress transnational hybridity precisely by highlighting Canadian identity\".{{sfn|Berninger|2013}}\n\n===Casting===\nCasting took place between 2008 and 2010.{{sfn|Villeneuve|2009}}{{sfn|Kit|2009}} Cera was cast in March 2008{{sfn|Whaley|2008a}} and Winstead in May that year.{{sfn|Whaley|2008b}} By the end of 2008, Whitman, Wong and Kendrick were cast; in January 2009, Routh, Evans, and Larson were announced together with Webber, Pill, Simmons, and Bhabha.{{sfn|Parsons|2009}} Extras casting in Toronto began in February 2009.{{sfn|Kumar|2009}}\n\nDirector Wright felt confident with his casting in the film, saying that \"like with ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' [when they] had great people in every single tiny part, it's the same with this. What's great with this is that there's people [like] Michael [Cera] and Jason [Schwartzman], and [...] people who are up and coming, like Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza and Brie Larson, and then there's complete unknowns as well\".{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} [[Collider (website)|''Collider'']] noted that the less-known actors fit their roles well, with Wright confirming that they did not have as much pressure to find lots of big names, adding that \"Universal never really gave [him] any problems about casting bigger people, because in a way Michael [Cera] has starred in two $100 million-plus movies, and also a lot of the other people, though they're not the biggest names, people certainly know who they are.\"{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} He also noted that while some of the actors were more famous when they auditioned, like Schwartzman and Evans, others became more well-known over the time the film was in development, saying that \"Anna Kendrick did her first audition for it before she shot the first ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]''. And Aubrey Plaza got the part in ''Scott Pilgrim'' before she did ''[[Funny People]]'' or ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', which is crazy. It shows you how long this film has taken to get made.\"{{sfn|Collis|2010}}\n\nWright ran all his casting decisions by O'Malley during a casting session;{{sfn|Winning|2010b}} O'Malley was not in the room but was shown all of the tapes.{{sfn|Down|2010}} Wright said that he planned on casting Cera while he was writing ''Hot Fuzz'', after watching episodes of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'',{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} also saying that he needed an actor that \"audiences will still follow even when the character is being a bit of an ass.\"{{sfn|Miller|2010}} Cera said he was equally excited to work with Wright, \"because [he] was a big fan of his\".{{sfn|Collis|2010}} Wright explained that though Cera is a talented musician, they were not particularly looking for people who could already play instruments, with the cast members who could not subsequently learning for the film.{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} Like Cera, Wright already had in mind Mary Elizabeth Winstead as his choice for Ramona Flowers, thinking of her for the part two years before filming had started because \"she has a very sunny disposition as a person, so it was interesting to get her to play a version of herself that was broken inside. She's great in the film because she causes a lot of chaos but remains supernaturally grounded.\"{{sfn|Swerdloff|2010}}\n\nEllen Wong, a little-known Toronto actress,{{sfn|Villeneuve|2009}} auditioned for the part of Knives Chau three times. On her second audition, Wright learned that Wong has a green belt in [[taekwondo]], and says he found himself intrigued by this \"sweet-faced young lady being a secret badass\".{{sfn|Swerdloff|2010}} The actors playing Lucas Lee's [[Stunt double|stunt doubles]] are the actual stunt doubles for Evans.{{sfn|Marshall|2010}} Aubrey Plaza, who has a supporting role as Julie Powers, said that \"there's a lot of weird, perfectly casted people\", citing Michael Cera and Alison Pill as particularly matching their characters.{{sfn|Wigler|2009}}\n\nWright says that one thing he is particularly happy with is that the film, unlike many comedies, including his own, has \"a lot of funny women in it\", recalling a particular scene he dubbed \"the funny lady relay race,\" because it \"starts with Anna Kendrick, then switches to Aubrey Plaza, then switches to Mary [Elizabeth Winstead], then switches to Brie Larson, and it's just Michael [Cera] being attacked from all sides from all the different women in the film.\"{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Anchor|Music|Soundtrack|Score}}\n{{See also|Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (soundtrack)}}\nThe film is not only physically set in Toronto, but also, according to Allan Weiss,<!--Not the Allan Weiss with an article under that name, please don't link--> culturally and temporally located within \"the [[The Annex|Annex]] and Wychwood neigborhoods [of Toronto] during the [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] era\", the time and place of a very specific music scene that the film \"embed[s] [itself] into [...] not only via Scott's fictional band[,] but also by the appearance of such clubs as the now defunct Rockit[, and] the film's indie rock soundtrack\"; Weiss asserts that the film \"marks the mythologizing of the cool Annex scene, the transformation of Toronto indie rock [...] into the stuff of adventure\", as \"nearly all of the major events [...] are connected in some way to this music scene.\"{{sfn|Weiss|2014}}\n\nThe soundtrack features contributions by [[Radiohead]] producer [[Nigel Godrich]], [[Beck]], [[Metric (band)|Metric]], [[Broken Social Scene]], [[Cornelius (musician)|Cornelius]], [[Dan the Automator]], [[Kid Koala]], and [[David Campbell (arranger/composer)|David Campbell]].{{sfn|Hasty|2010}}{{sfn|Martens|2010b}}{{sfn|Carlick|2010}}{{sfn|Wright|2010a}}{{sfn|Music From Film}} O'Malley had written up playlists for each of the comics in the back of the books, introducing Wright to other Canadian bands during development. Building on this, Wright said that the production \"tried to [...] find a real band for each of the fictional bands, because usually in music films you have one composer who does everything\".{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} Wright and Godrich met with and scouted bands to write for the film for two years.{{sfn|Collis|2010}} Godrich scored the film, as his first [[film score]].{{sfn|Leader|2010}} Before Godrich became involved with the film, early scripts had the running joke that \"you never heard the bands [...] You heard the intro, and then it would cut to the next scene, and somebody would be going, 'Oh my God, that's the best song ever.' That was a joke for a long time\", according to Wright.{{sfn|Martens|2010c}}\n\nWebber, Pill, and Simmons as the members of Sex Bob-omb all had to learn to play their respective instruments, and spent time rehearsing as a band with Cera (who already played bass) before filming began.{{sfn|Universal Pictures|2010}} [[Chris Murphy (Canadian musician)|Chris Murphy]] of the band [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]] was the guitar coach for the actors in the film.{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} The actors also sing on the film's soundtrack.{{sfn|AllMusic|2010}} Beck wrote and composed the music played by Sex Bob-omb in the film.{{sfn|Empire|2010a}} The songs took two days to write and record, with Beck saying that \"it needed to be underthought, [...] they had to be funny, but [he] also wanted them to sound raw, like demos.\"{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2010}} [[Brian LeBarton]] plays drums and bass for the band on the film's score and soundtrack. Two unreleased songs can also be heard in the teaser trailer.{{sfn|Empire|2010a}}\n\nBrendan Canning and Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene wrote all the songs for Crash and the Boys. The tracks were sung by [[Erik Knudsen]], who plays Crash in the film. Drew stated that the reason behind this was that \"[he] knew that [Knudsen] didn't need to be a singer to pull [it] off\" because the songs were \"so quick and punk and fast\" and \"it needed to be the character's voice.\"{{sfn|Warner|2010}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left | direction = | width =\n| image1 = Emily Haines (Metric).jpg | caption1 =\n| image2 = Envy Adams performance Scott Pilgrim vs. the World image.png | caption2 =\n| image3 = Metric live at Washington, DC 2006.jpg | caption3 =\n| footer = Emily Haines performing (left and right), and Brie Larson as Envy Adams (center) | total_width = 280 }}\nMetric is the inspiration for the film's band The Clash at Demonhead, and contributed the song \"Black Sheep\" to the film,{{sfn|Rayner|2009}} by request of Godrich.{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2009}} The clothing, performance and style of Metric's lead singer, [[Emily Haines]], is also the basis for the lead singer of The Clash at Demonhead, Envy Adams.{{sfn|Rayner|2009}}{{sfn|Diaz Pino|2015}} Brie Larson, who portrays Envy Adams, said that she \"had no idea [her] body could move that way\" when talking about her stage performance of the song at the UK premiere.{{sfn|Den of Geek|2010}} The music journalist Janelle Sheetz wrote that \"Larson's performance is similar enough to [Haines's] but with an attitude appropriate for [Envy Adams]\".{{sfn|Sheetz|2019}} Envy Adams' film fashion also reverse-influenced the comics: the last graphic novel was in development while the film was being made, and O'Malley said that though he \"would try and distance [him]self from [the actors' interpretations]\", he also \"gave Envy Adams one of Brie Larson's actual outfits\" in the comic.{{sfn|Down|2010}} \n\nLarson as Envy Adams provides the vocals for \"Black Sheep\" in the film, while the soundtrack features a version of the song with Haines as lead singer{{sfn|Goldberg|2010b}} per the band's request;{{sfn|Wright|2019}} Larson was a professional singer and has performed in some of her other films.{{sfn|Jeunesse|2019}} Metric had been performing the song at their concerts since 2007, but had not released it before the film.{{sfn|TIFF Originals|2018}} Todd Martens of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that \"Envy is a caricature of Haines\" and likewise, according to Haines, that \"'Black Sheep' is essentially a caricature of Metric\", like a song emulating their most distinct aspects.{{sfn|Martens|2010c}} Godrich agreed, and added that it \"was perfect for this film [because] it's not Metric. It's a shadow of Metric.\"{{sfn|Martens|2010c}} Routh, who plays The Clash at Demonhead's bass player Todd Ingram, said that \"[he] can play [\"Black Sheep\"] really well\" but that the film did not use his instrumental, only Larson's vocals over Metric,{{sfn|Leader|2010}} who had re-recorded the track to make it more sinister.{{sfn|Martens|2010c}} Routh spent \"three or four months\" learning to play bass for the film.{{sfn|Leader|2010}}\n\nThe song performed by Matthew Patel was written by [[Dan the Automator]] and performed by Satya Bhabha in the film. Bhabha said that they \"[recorded] it at [[Capitol Records Building|Capitol Records]] Studio 2, which is where [[Frank Sinatra]] recorded a lot of his stuff. And there was [[Ray Charles]]' piano in the room\", explaining that the musical history helped him to finish the recording.{{sfn|Leader|2010}}\n\nWright said that the film's tonal changes in line with representing the different book parts, and for its fight scenes, were treated like a [[musical film]], saying:{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} \n{{Quote|text=We thought it should play out like a musical in a way in terms of the fights are not dissimilar to the songs. I always thought there were a lot of martial arts films that were like musicals, so we wanted to take that further. Ya know, in a [[Gene Kelly]] film when he performs an amazing routine, at the end of the scene no one goes, 'Oh my god, that was fucking amazing!' The song is about something, and then there might be some dialogue at the end that is also about that theme. And that's kind of how this works where people have these huge fights \u2013 and it's kind of like how it is in the books \u2013 where everything goes back to normal, and there's a little reaction to what just happened, but there's no sort of mourn the dead.}}\n\nHe also said that some [[Music video|music videos]] were made of song performances, including some of Sex Bob-omb and the sole The Clash at Demonhead performance, shooting the entire song even though they would not be used in complete form in the film; he said that they were so good he wanted to get them all recorded so that they had it.{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} The [[Blu-ray]] home release includes special features, with music videos of the complete performances of Sex Bob-omb's \"Garbage Truck\", \"Threshold\", and \"Summertime\", and The Clash at Demonhead's \"Black Sheep\".{{sfn|Tyner|2010}} The music video of \"Black Sheep\" had also been included as a bonus feature with the soundtrack pre-order on [[iTunes]].{{sfn|Cinema Blend|2010}}\n\nMusic from the ''[[The Legend of Zelda|Legend of Zelda]]'' video game series is used to open the film, in sound effects,{{sfn|Hunt|2010a}} and in a dream sequence. To get permission to use the music, Edgar Wright sent a clip of the film and wrote a letter to [[Nintendo of America]] that described the music as \"like nursery rhymes to a generation.\"{{sfn|Miller|2010}} There are other sound effects and clips from other video games used in the film.{{sfn|Hunt|2010a}}{{sfn|Rockotier|2018}} Zeitlin Wu writes that the film pushes the graphic novel's video game elements to the limit by being able to include such sound effects.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\n===Visual effects===\n<!--In some parts of this section, Edgar Wright and Oscar Wright are referred to by their full names to prevent confusion.

He noted that some of the work was more complex because of a shooting ethic of Wright's: that there should be a physical representation of any post-production effects.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}}\n\nChurchill described the first fight (Scott vs. Matthew Patel) as \"the most challenging\".{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} He says this was because of the technical elements involved, like the [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[Bollywood]] dance and requiring [[Chroma key|blue screen]] work, matte painting and a lot of stunts. The scene also incorporates the video game [[scrolling]] background effect, which was filmed by a [[second unit]] over a full day. Churchill added that one moment in particular took a lot of work: \"When Scott jumps off the stage into that manga-esque vortex, that's made up of motion picture photography done on-set, digital still photography, and graphics and speed lines drawn by hand from what [Oscar Wright] gave us\".{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} [[Storyboard artist]] Oscar Wright (also brother of director Edgar Wright) noted that the introduction of Patel was used \"to convey the kind of energy [they] wanted, and explore how [they] would introduce the 2D graphic elements\".{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nThe third fight (Scott vs. Todd Ingram) had to be adapted from the comic material more creatively, as Todd's superpowers are shown in print by rings, which was handled by the VFX team. Churchill explains that they took inspiration from the old [[RKO Pictures]] logo of a transmitting tower. To imitate this they \"made the rings feel uneven and have these optical aberrations with color bursts\".{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} In this fight, Scott also gets punched through several walls, which was achieved with camera set-ups. The movement away from Todd is shown from [[Close-up|tight]] and [[Long shot|wide]] camera shots, with Cera as Scott being pulled on a rig in the room. The image of Cera was then merged with a digital Scott and a stunt double, who do go through walls.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}}\n\nThe disappearing superpower used by Roxy in the film was achieved by a blue screen, with actress Whitman being digitally erased, but there was white smoke and flashbulbs used on the set to mark the appearances. Black smoke was added in digitally, while [[lens flare]]s were done manually by \"just flashing different lights at the camera\" for a day to create material.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} Roxy appears in the fourth fight, where she uses a bladed weapon. Churchill says that Whitman learned how to [[Ribbon (rhythmic gymnastics)|ribbon dance]] and used a pink ribbon in the choreography, which was digitally replaced with the weapon.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}}\n\n[[File:Scott_Pilgrim_Katayanagis_fight_storyboard.jpg|left|thumb|Some of the storyboard for the Scott vs. the Katayanagi Twins fight]]\nA new piece of software was written to produce elements of the fifth fight (Scott vs. the Katayanagi Twins); [[Andrew Whitehurst]] developed what Churchill called the \"Wave Form Generator\", and the visual effects team worked with music producer Godrich so they could transform different elements of the music into animations and create visual music.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} Churchill explained that \"the software would convert these sound stems into animation data, so when the band is playing, the graphics and the dragons are moving in time with the music.\"{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} This fight was storyboarded by Oscar Wright without any comic reference as the film overtook the publication of the books.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} The 'audio demons', fighting monsters powered by the music in the film, were then created on-set by Churchill using [[weather balloon]]s.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}}\n\nFor the climax fight against Gideon, a pyramid tower resembling one from [[Super Mario Bros.]] was filmed on for a week, with Churchill saying it often got hot due to the light effects being used, including the flashbulbs and red lights to represent fire on Scott's sword. The scene also used blue screen and lots of stunt performers. Oscar Wright storyboarded the entire sequence except for Gideon's [[glitching]] at the end, which Edgar Wright thought of during editing and was created entirely in post-production.{{sfn|Ditzian|2010}} Edgar Wright also noted that the pyramid tower fight scene was the slowest piece he had ever filmed, saying: \"So we were raring along at this amazing pace. And then there was this final set piece on a pyramid. Suddenly, we slowed down to doing ten shots in a day, which is very slow for me. I sat there on top of this pyramid, looking down at these enormous platforms being maneuvered around and I thought, 'Who's idea was this?' And it was mine!\"{{sfn|Collis|2010}}\n\nBefore directing fight scenes with visual effects, Wright consulted with director friends with more experience, including [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], and [[Sam Raimi]].{{sfn|Collis|2010}}\n\n===Title sequence===\n<!--In this section, Edgar Wright and Oscar Wright are both referred to with their full names to prevent confusion. In the rest of the article, 'Wright' will refer to Edgar.-->\n[[File:Scott_Pilgrim_title_sequence_frames.jpg|thumb|right|Frames from the title sequence]]\nThe opening [[title sequence]] was designed by Richard Kenworthy of [[Shynola]], and was inspired by [[drawn-on-film animation]]. The sequence also begins with an [[8-bit computing|8-bit]] version of the Universal title slate and music, which [[Art of the Title]] calls the film's \"[[amuse-bouche]]\" and which was designed by Oscar Wright.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nOscar Wright says the 8-bit Universal logo idea was an early decision in production, and that he treated it \"like some crappy low-res, low frame-rate [[Full motion video|FMV]] you might find at the start of some of those games\" from the start.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} Creating the title slate involved separating the letters of 'Universal' and making them appear pixelated, using a matching spinning globe graphic by film animators VooDooDog, and reducing the [[frame rate]] to four seconds (rather than one) so that it appeared \"steppy\"; an 8-bit version of the accompanying music was also added, which Oscar Wright said \"really seals the deal\".{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nEdgar Wright got the idea to have the sequence from Quentin Tarantino after screening an early cut of the film for him. Tarantino told him that the film \"needed a title sequence at the start to let people settle in and hint more about what we were about to see\".{{sfn|Lussier|2011}} The original opening sequence had the film's title shown over the long living room band shot that comes before the title sequence, which Edgar Wright said was one of the first scenes to be storyboarded, with the cast credits at [[Closing credits|the end of the film]].{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} After an early mockup of the title sequence on [[Media Composer|AVID]], they approached Shynola to create it,{{sfn|Lussier|2011}} as the film's graphic artists (Oscar Wright and [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]) were too occupied with the other effects in the film at this point in production and Edgar Wright was familiar with their work.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nThe AVID [[animatic]], a black-and-white sketch animation with [[waveform graphics]], was described by Edgar Wright as already \"giving the film more of a sense of occasion and a very distinct break between the prologue and the first scene that moves the story forward\".{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} At this stage, they had also chosen Beck's \"loudest soundtrack song\" to play over the title sequence.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nKenworthy spoke of his references for the design:{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\n{{Quote|You can't study animation and not be well-versed in [[Len Lye]], [[Oskar Fischinger]], [[Stan Brakhage]], and [[Norman McLaren]]. We went back and re-watched those films and they were still full of life. We got excited about projecting such vivid imagery on the big screen, in front of an audience who most likely hadn't experienced that work.}}\n\nShynola was also given a selection of references from Edgar Wright, who described the brief as \"[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001'']] meets ''[[Sesame Street]]''\" and showed them the title sequence of ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]'', which used [[Graphical sound|drawn-on optical tracks]].{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} As with traditional drawn-on-film animation, Kenworthy traced and painted the images.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} Wright provided musical references as well, saying that they \"wanted to visualize the music and have every graphic, symbol, and subliminal image in time with the music \u2014 a hypnotic barrage of colour, light, and music. The idea was to have it as if the animation is a manifestation of how cool the music is in Knives' head. That's why [they] end the sequence on her watching, the titles are like her brain is exploding with how cool the track is.\"{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nThe brief also requested that the opening sequence not use any of the comic artwork, to not spoil the film, so Kenworthy pitched \"an 8-bit epileptic eye-fight\" and created a [[Mood board|mood film]] using geometric patterns and visual effects from manga; Edgar Wright requested that it should have less overt video game references.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} Shynola then worked with the music concept, Kenworthy saying that they \"hit on making a visual representation of [Sex Bob-omb's] slightly amateurish, raw, garage-y sound. Something that had the feel of a live performance. A lively, colourful, in-your-face scratch film seemed a perfect fit.\"{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} Working with Edgar Wright more, they chose to have a visual representation of each character, and to scratch the appropriate number of 'X' marks for those characters.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nBased on the film nearing completion, Shynola had a short time frame to finish the title sequence, so worked on syncing the sequence and the music digitally at first, visualizing final adjustments before scratching onto sheets of [[acetate film]]. From each sheet of acetate, one second of footage was produced.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} Kenworthy said that after producing the images, they would \"deliberately kick [each sheet] around the floor a bit to pick up a lot of dirt, scratches, and hairs\".{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\nPrinting the sequence involved putting each sheet into a high resolution negative scanner and cutting them down into individual frames before printing onto [[35 mm movie film]]. There was also difficulty with the color printing, with most of the colors they wanted to use being \"illegal\".{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} During the printing process, Kenworthy added parts of a scratch film he had made at college, which had been used when scanning to check color accuracy.{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}}\n\n[[ComicsAlliance]] calls the title sequence \"just the first in a memorable series of seamless mash-ups of graphics, film and animation that beautifully translate the spirit of Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novels to the screen\".{{sfn|Khouri|2011}} Art of the Title describes the sequence as \"visual napalm\",{{sfn|Art of the Title|2011}} with [[Bleeding Cool]] saying it is \"quite wonderful\".{{sfn|Connelly|2011}} Jade Budowski of [[Decider (website)|''Decider'']] writes that \"with its rapid-fire introductory scene and the ensuing vibrant animated title sequence, [the film] wastes no time in sucking you into [its] world\".{{sfn|Budowski|2018}}\n\n=== Easter eggs ===\n[[File:Plumtreelogo.png|thumb|The Plumtree logo, which Scott wears on a t-shirt in the film]]\nThe film includes several [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] alluding to the comics or for [[foreshadowing]]. Fleischer noted that though the comic and film have Scott and Wallace's apartment at 65A Albert Avenue (filmed at 65 Alberta Avenue), there is a reference to O'Malley's own old apartment at 27 Alberta Avenue as the address on the Amazon delivery slip Scott signs.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} Fleischer also points out the blinking 'L' on a [[Flight Centre Canada]] sign on Manning Avenue, which he writes is a warning that a fight is about to happen.{{sfn|Fleischer|2010}} Wright said, before the film came out, that a t-shirt of [[Plumtree (band)|Plumtree]], the band that originated the name 'Scott Pilgrim', would feature in the film.{{sfn|Goldberg|2010a}} Other t-shirts Scott wears include one for [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], a band sharing his initials;{{sfn|Rockotier|2018}} one with the bass guitar logo from the ''[[Rock Band]]'' game series;{{sfn|Riviello|2017a}} and one that references [[Fantastic Four]], which he wears after defeating Lucas, played by Evans, who at the time was best known for his role as the [[Human Torch]] in the [[Fantastic Four in film|Fantastic Four movies]].{{sfn|Hunt|2010a}} Scott's changing t-shirts often match Ramona's changing hair color through the film.{{sfn|Rockotier|2018}}\n\nThere are also references to other media, particularly gaming and comics, with ''[[Den of Geek]]''<nowiki/>'s James Hunt compiling a list of several, including Scott's [[X-Men]] patch seen as he rips it from his coat; the ''Legend of Zelda'' [[Triforce]] represented by Gideon's initials in the film and title sequence ([[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World#Title sequence|shown above]]) and the [[Dark Link]]-inspired Nega-Scott; Envy's band being named after the 1990 game ''The Clash at Demonhead'' (as well as [[The Clash]]); Kim dressing in [[Lolita (term)|Japanese Gothic Lolita]] fashion for the final battle as a point of humor; the scene that was shot, performed, and edited entirely like a ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode; and using the \"this is a league game\" line from ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''.{{sfn|Hunt|2010a}} ''[[/Film]]'' notes that slow-motion broken glass falling and reflecting Ramona and Roxy as they fight resembles the character selection screen of ''[[Street Fighter]]'', and that the Chaos Theater and Sex Bob-omb's forced labor is a reference to ''[[EarthBound]]''.{{sfn|Riviello|2017b}} \n\nLike The Clash at Demonhead, the other band names reference video games: Sex Bob-omb to the [[Bob-omb|Bob-ombs]] in Mario franchise games, and Crash and the Boys to a game called ''[[Crash 'n' the Boys: Street Challenge]]''. According to actress Larson, ''The Clash at Demonhead'' was the first game that comic author O'Malley ever had.{{sfn|Rockotier|2018}} \n\nScott playing the bassline of what he calls \"[[Final Fantasy|Final Fantasy 2]]\" is also considered an easter egg; he plays the bassline from the game ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', but this game was known as ''Final Fantasy 2'' outside of Japan in the 1990s because the second and third installments had not been released internationally at the time.{{sfn|Rockotier|2018}}\n\nIn her adaptation discussion, Zeitlin Wu notes that in the graphic novel, the fourth fight (Scott vs. Roxy Richter) was a frame-for-frame recreation of the introduction to [[Ninja Gaiden]], and in the film this same frame-for-frame remake is used as the introduction of the final fight against Gideon.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Michael Cera as Captain America by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Cera dressed as [[Captain America]] at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con ''Scott Pilgrim'' panel, in reference to Chris Evans' absence due to commitments for ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''{{sfn|Comic Con|2010b}}]]\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| width  = 315px\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh2-p8hzRj8 Comic Con 2010: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Panel - Part 1] \u2013 via YouTube\n| video2 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llA25X9mPtE Comic Con 2010: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Panel - Part 2] \u2013 via YouTube\n| video3 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvI5WqwZkhU Comic Con 2010: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Panel - Part 3] \u2013 via YouTube\n| video4 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArkDWrHmmXI Black Sheep (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Comic-Con Performance)] on Metric [[Vevo]] \u2013 via YouTube\n}}\nA ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' panel was featured in Hall H{{sfn|Comic Con|2010b}} at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] on July 22, 2010; after the panel, Wright invited selected members of the audience for a screening of the film, which was followed by a performance of \"Black Sheep\" by Metric.{{sfn|Lang|2010}}{{sfn|Joyce|2010}} Three of the [[ensemble cast]] members, Evans, Simmons and Larson, were missing from the Comic-Con panel; Edgar Wright's frequent collaborators [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Nick Frost]] made brief appearances, with Wright joking about them not being in this film.{{sfn|Comic Con|2010b}} The film was then shown at the [[Fantasia Festival]] in [[Montreal]] on July 27, 2010,{{sfn|Fantasia|2010}} and was also featured at Movie-Con III in London on August 15, 2010.{{sfn|Dinning|2009}}\n\nThe film premiered in Canada in Toronto on August 13, 2010; Plumtree, who had broken up years earlier, got back together for a show at the event.{{sfn|Down|2010}}{{sfn|McMahon|2010}} In Japan, the film premiered during the [[Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival]] on February 26, 2011 as an official selection.

It was released for [[PlayStation Network]] on August 10, 2010 and on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] on August 25, being met with mostly positive reviews.{{sfn|Goldstein|Hatfield|Miller|2010}}{{sfn|Metacritic|2010}} The game is published by [[Ubisoft]] and developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and Ubisoft Chengdu, featuring animation by Paul Robertson and original music by [[Anamanaguchi]].{{sfn|Ubisoft|2009}}{{sfn|Vore|2010}}\n\n==Analysis==\n''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' has been widely discussed as invoking a [[transmedia narrative]], using the graphic novel platform, and video game and comic book conventions, within the film.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}{{sfn|Ryan|Thon|2014}}{{sfn|Grant|Henderson|2019}}{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} John Bodner explains that \"the film becomes an adaptation of a text that is, in many ways, itself a cultural adaptation calling attention to its own source material in its overt employment of many techniques derived from the aesthetic of comic books\".{{sfn|Grant|Henderson|2019}} Zeitlin Wu writes how the film \"[pays] homage to comics, video games, and the overlaps between the two\", and notes that its process of adaptation is unique in how it has made a comic book movie that is not realistic, staying true to the original form.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} In his chapter, \"Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Texts: Adaptation, Form, and Transmedia Co-creation\", Bodner notes several elements that create the film as transmedial, describing its references to the comic book and video game media.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}}\n\nBodner, Zeitlin Wu, and Burke also note that Wright, with the film, became one of the only directors since the 1960s to use, in Bodner's words, \"the comment box, [[Motion lines|marks (action lines)]], and onomatopoeia text as sound effects\" in a filmic work, using such techniques both conventionally (labeling time and place) and unconventionally for the medium.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Burke describes the use as \"self-reflexive\".{{sfn|Burke|2015}} Zeitlin Wu says that \"unlike the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', the use of visual onomatopoeia in ''Scott Pilgrim'' seamlessly merges reality and illusion, which seems apt for a storyline in which the two are indistinguishable\", using the comic book words within the film as part of the story rather than alongside it.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\nIn the unconventional use, Wright disrupts the realism and [[diegesis]] of the film with comic book markers. Bodner gives the examples of: the \"[graphic text] 'a&nbsp;b&nbsp;o&nbsp;u&nbsp;t t&nbsp;o e&nbsp;x&nbsp;p&nbsp;l&nbsp;o&nbsp;d&nbsp;e' appearing as an agitated Scott enters the after-party\" that \"[prefigures] a (nonphysical) fight with Ramona\" as a form of label that \"externalizes subjective perspectives\"; the use of O'Malley's typical ironic [[authorial voice]] appearing when a commentary box \"helpfully appears to inform [the audience]\" that Todd, after seemingly rhetorically saying he doesn't know the meaning of incorrigible, \"really doesn't\" know the meaning; and the use of onomatopoeia text graphics as sound effects.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Zeitlin Wu notes that the film \"is one of the only adaptations to incorporate text in such a way that conveys the hybrid text/image construction of comics in cinematic form, pushing their transmediality to the next level\", and ultimately destabilizes formal boundaries.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\nRegarding the onomatopoeia used, Bodner notes that only once does such text-as-graphic actually replace a sound effect (Todd's hair deflating, paired with the word \"SAG\"), with the approximately 40 other instances having both sound and the onomatopoeia representing it.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} The function of the comic book technique in these cases is said to be an act of denaturalizing the film form and, per Robert S. Peterson, \"to slow the reader down and create greater visual depth and texture to the scene\".{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Zeitlin Wu instead suggests that this was done to further incorporate the comic book nature into the film form, with sound and image perfectly synchronized, saying that \"the result is an illusionistic synthesis of image, text, and sound in which words have their own materiality. Each font seems to have its own personality and substance; 'DING DONG' dissolves ephemerally, whereas the letters in 'BLAM!' rapidly fall out of the frame one by one, like a row of dominoes\".{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} Bodner adds that marks used in the film illustrate both sound and eye-line, things that can be shown in film without marks, and so are also used to denaturalize the scenes they appear in.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Burke writes further on the use of written sound effects, saying that \"there are areas in which comics' visualized sound trumps cinema's soundtrack\", engaging with [[Robert C. Harvey]] to agree that \"word and picture can be coupled to reveal the hero's cheery bravado even in the very midst of thundering action\".{{sfn|Burke|2015}}\n\n[[File:Sex_Bob-Omb_split_screen.png|left|thumb|An example of spatial remediation in the film to simulate comic book panels, with three simultaneous but not spatially-continuous images shown and framed with black \"gutters\" (as in {{sfn|Bodner|2019}}{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}})]]\nAnother technique that Bodner describes as giving the film its [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] reading{{sfn|Grant|Henderson|2019}} is how Wright seems to alter the film form to reflect elements inherent to comic book sequences, specifically that \"[Wright] consistently but judiciously [quotes] panel content throughout the film \u2013 generally [...] using the illusion of stasis in film to mirror the illusion of movement in comics\".{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} In terms of form, Bodner writes that Wright transcodes the \"construction of comic panels\" into the film; Wright himself has said that \"a lot of people have mentioned [...] how it feel[s] like reading a comic book\",{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} a sentiment echoed by Zeitlin Wu.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} Bodner suggests that this is created by [[Transition (film)|transition]] techniques, and that the techniques that produce this are Wright's own, building from his work in ''Shaun of the Dead'' and ''Hot Fuzz'', adding that they work by \"replicating [the panel's] companion \u2013 the '[[Gutter (typography)|gutter]]'.\"{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Wright is said to recreate this element of outside space in comics in the film form by making \"cuts that are exceedingly quick or that open into shots that displace conventional temporal logic ([[Continuity editing|anticontinuity editing]]), or with cuts that utilize a purposefully barely visible [[Wipe (transition)|wipe]] effect\",{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} and by using \"blackouts, which function as brief moments of dead space\" between certain frames.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}\n\nDiscussing the comic book translation in her writing on the process of the film's adaptation, Zeitlin Wu notes that \"many storyboards [for the film] were taken directly from the comics\", saying that one method of overcoming the temporal-spatial and illustrative-representative differences in graphic novel and film media is to combine the comic panel and storyboard grid.{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} Within ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'', she writes that the comic panel-storyboarded sequences \"convey a sense of fragmentation, rather than the usual illusion of cinematic continuity\" and that \"the most effective use of comics as storyboard is in Scott's dream sequences, which facilitate his encounters with Ramona as she travels through 'subspace'.\"{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} In the first of the [[Dream sequence|dream sequences]], \"Wright maintains the fragmentation of the comics medium by retaining the divisions between the original panels: the screen fades to black after each frame, an attempt to mimic the simultaneously [[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic and synchronic]] experience of reading comics\".{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}} In another example of film panel use, Bodner notes that the static frame shows Scott at the computer ordering a package, the next shot is of Wallace, and the next of Scott sat in front of the door, waiting; Bodner explains that the temporality of these images on screen is not naturalistic, and that they better represent comic panels where temporality can be otherwise deduced by the reader. He adds that, as [[pastiche]], this scene serves a dual function to foreshadow the [[magical realism]] that will appear.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} \n\nIn a similar form-bending way, there are two scenes (\"the first battle of the bands and Lucas Lee's 'grind' down the rail\") where Wright uses high-volume noise to recreate the silent form of comic books, as in a film the loudness drowns out any other sound and requires the use of text in the same way that the purely visual comic book form does.{{sfn|Bodner|2019}} Burke also notes the benefit of visual text when sound would otherwise be \"muted by ambient noise\", and how (other) \"film adaptations often render comics' most loquacious characters mute\".{{sfn|Burke|2015}}\n\nIn his chapter \"Tell It Like a Game: Scott Pilgrim and Performative Media Rivalry\", Jeff Thoss writes on the various transmedial cues, saying that \"the film attempts to outdo the comic book series in its emulation of video game features both on the level of the storyworld and on the level of its representation. But as neither of these two works emerges victorious, their so-called rivalry appears less as a real competition than as a way to illuminate the specific narrative affordances and limitations of comics, films, and computer games\".{{sfn|Ryan|Thon|2014}} Building on Thoss, Fehrle examines the [[Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)#Remediation|remediation]] ([[Jay David Bolter|Bolter]] and [[Richard Grusin|Grusin]]), or use of imitation, of video game signifiers. Looking particularly at the Scott vs. Matthew Patel fight, he writes that there is \"not only [the] remediation of arcade fighting and beat 'em up video games, [...] but also a TV aesthetic [...] as well as a play with some iconic film genres [...] and finally a strong link to the theater as a fifth medium thrown into the mix when we see Ramona on a Shakespearean balcony placed at the center of an extremely conspicuous spotlight\".{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} He continues technically analyzing the scene by noting the [[Split screen (video production)|split screen]]; Fehrle first sees the technique as \"more recently associated primarily with the [[MTV]]-aesthetics of 1990s TV\", noting that it is \"an 'unnatural' editing technique, foregrounding the mediality of film by making visible the impact of an editor, a role which in the dominant continuity editing system is regarded as one that should be kept hidden\".{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} Fehrle describes the rest of the sequence featuring Matthew Patel as a parody of music videos, including the \"tap dance, which is highlighted by the camera's framing of only his feet, as well as his willfully over-acted ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''-inspired pose\", while also mentioning its [[Spaghetti Western]]-inspired \"through-the-legs duel shot\".{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}}\n\nHowever, he also joins Zeitlin Wu in describing it as a comic and video game element,{{sfn|Zeitlin Wu|2016}}{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} likewise noting the \"strong spatiality of the comics medium through its panel layout\" represented in the film, especially the \"black gutter-like division between the three 'panels'\" in the scene.{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} Fehrle adds further that its video game referent for the [[Split screen (video games)|split screen]] is that of \"console video games' multiplayer modes\", with other video game elements informing the sequence including \"an 8-bit arcade 'bling' sound playing when Patel lands[,] as well as the excessive echo and slight delay on Wallace's voice as he screams 'fight', [and] superimposed text [...] which dramatically juxtaposes the opponents, instructs the player what to do or explains the (health or energy) status of characters or helps players interpret what is happening\".{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}} He adds that a more obvious remediation of comic books is seen in the O'Malley-like graphic novel drawings that appear to illustrate Ramona and Matthew's backstory. From this multitude of referents, Fehrle describes the film and the ''Scott Pilgrim'' franchise as \"[[Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)#Remediation|hypermediated]]\".{{sfn|Fehrle|2015}}\n\nThe sequence following Scott breaking up with Knives is analyzed in different ways. Maria J. Ortiz looks at [[mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]] and narrative meaning with the scene, writing that when Scott \"tells [Knives] that he wants to break off the relationship, the next shot of her is against a dark background without a realistic reason\" and so introduces metaphors that inform the story: \"good is bright/bad is dark\" and that \"the change of background [is] a metaphor for the change produced in the state of the relationship\", resulting in the idea that a bad change is a literal dark place here.{{sfn|Ortiz|2014}} Bodner looks at the transmediality of the framing used when Scott walks away, matching the graphic novel, with a tree and streetcar bracketing the frame to introduce a solitude of Scott and Knives, particularly with a static camera that represents the panel. In the film, this is followed by characters passing in front of Scott to lead into a wipe, which Bodner says \"is common in the film and acts as the inked line that makes the panel border\".{{sfn|Bodner|2019}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a score of 81% based on 264 reviews and is certified fresh, with the site's consensus saying that \"Its script may not be as dazzling as its eye-popping visuals, but ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' is fast, funny, and inventive\".{{sfn|Rotten Tomatoes}} [[Metacritic]] gave the film an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 69 out of 100, based on 38 reviews, indicating a \"generally favorable\" response.{{sfn|Metacritic}}\n\n{{Anchor|Critics}}Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review, referring to the film as \"an example of attention-deficit filmmaking at both its finest and its most frustrating\", saying that it was economical with its storytelling and successfully incorporated the many big fight set pieces, but that it missed opportunities to build Scott and Ramona's relationship.{{sfn|Debruge|2010}} [[David Edelstein]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine also gives a mixed review, agreeing that Scott \"hardly seems worthy of Winstead's Ramona\", though he did think that \"the parade of super-villain exes [...] is like a forced march; [he] felt [he]'d had [his] fill of the fights and there were still five exes to go\".{{sfn|Edelstein|2010}} [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] gives a generally positive review, but does agree that the number of fights holds the film back, writing that \"Seven sounds like a lot. It is, in fact, two or three too many.\"{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gives a largely negative review, thinking that the film is \"a discouragingly limp movie in which nothing is at stake. A character can 'die,' then simply rewind video and come back to life. Or change his mind about his true love and then change it again. Scott Pilgrim's battle isn't against the world; it's against an erratic moral compass.\"{{sfn|Honeycutt|2010}} Cindy White at [[IGN]] gives a positive review, praising Wright and the film's style extensively, though does mention that \"the middle drags a bit and the ending isn't all [she] hoped it would be.\"{{sfn|White|2010}}\n\n[[A.

Scott wrote that \"somehow [Cera and Winstead] make it work\" in selling the relationship without being a clich\u00e9,{{sfn|Scott|2010}} and Abrams said that the actors had \"never looked this good, especially Cera\", noting that \"[his] performance is knowingly affected and self-absorbed throughout scenes depicting Scott and Knives's awkward dating\" as the film deliberately plays up Scott's initial narcissism.{{sfn|Abrams|2010}} Cera's delivery of the particular line \"I was thinking we should break up, or whatever\" has been reviewed as amusing{{sfn|Edelstein|2010}} and awkwardly realistic.{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} White wrote that the actors playing Ramona's exes \"all [seem] to be having a blast in their scenes\".{{sfn|White|2010}} Brie Larson and Kieran Culkin have been frequently described as the film's [[scene stealer]]s for their performances as Scott's ex, rock star Envy Adams, and Scott's roommate, gay Wallace Wells.{{sfn|Collis|2010}}{{sfn|Debruge|2010}}{{sfn|Travers|2010}}{{sfn|Aziz|2010}}{{sfn|Zhong|2013}}{{sfn|Bond|2016}}{{sfn|Foster|2018}} Chris Evans and Brandon Routh have also been called scene stealers in some reviews.{{sfn|Reynolds|2010}}{{sfn|Hunt|2010b}}{{sfn|O'Hara|2010}}\n\n<!--Audience-->As a negative, Debruge added that \"anyone over 25 is likely to find [the film] exhausting, like playing chaperone at a party full of oversexed college kids\",{{sfn|Debruge|2010}} remarks echoed by Honeycutt, who called the film \"juvenile\" and thought that \"a wider audience among older or international viewers seems unlikely.\"{{sfn|Honeycutt|2010}} White gave the film a positive rating of 8/10, saying that it is \"best suited for the wired generation and those of us who grew up on [[Nintendo]] and MTV. Its kinetic nature and quirky sensibilities might be a turnoff for some.\"{{sfn|White|2010}} Scott also found the youth elements appealing, writing that \"there are some movies about youth that just make you feel old, even if you aren't [but] ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' has the opposite effect. Its speedy, funny, happy-sad spirit is so infectious that the movie makes you feel at home in its world even if the landscape is, at first glance, unfamiliar.\"{{sfn|Scott|2010}} Abrams opened his review lamenting that \"the sad thing about ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' is that people assumed that because it embraced its niche-oriented demographic's interests, in its ad campaign and in its content, that it was destined for cult status and nothing more.\"{{sfn|Abrams|2010}}\n\n<!--Style and Comics-->Schager wrote that Edgar Wright is an \"inspired mash-up artist, and ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' may be his finest hybridization to date\", saying the film has become a \"m\u00eal\u00e9e-heavy video game\".{{sfn|Schager|2010}} Debruge also said that \"style [...] becomes the level at which we must appreciate Wright's work\", particularly noting the 8-bit Universal logo and the ''Seinfeld'' scene.{{sfn|Debruge|2010}} White explains that though the video game style and structure is non-realistic, \"even the most outlandish elements flow naturally from the storytelling\".{{sfn|White|2010}} The style was also compared to the comics. According to Phillips, \"Edgar Wright understands the appeal of the original Bryan Lee O'Malley graphic novels [...] O'Malley's manga-inspired books combine utter [[wikt:banal|banality]] with [[superhero film|superhero]] [[hyperbole]], [and] Wright, who is British, has taken it on and won. [The film] lives and breathes the style of the original books, with animated squiggles and hearts and stars filling out the frame in many individual shots.\"{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} Edelstein opened his review by saying \"Yes, this is how you bring a graphic novel to life onscreen!\", elaborating that \"[Wright takes the] Canadian mangas (in which the mundane meets the superheroic) and concocts a syntax all his own: part comic panel, part arcade video game\"{{sfn|Edelstein|2010}} Honeycutt also agrees that \"Director/producer/co-writer Edgar Wright [...] has successfully reproduced the imagery and worldview of Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novel, itself a mash-up of ordinary characters lost in a world of manga, video games, music videos and comic book iconography.\"{{sfn|Honeycutt|2010}} White writes that the elements of mash-up in the film's style creates \"a pop-culture cocktail that is fun, funny and deliciously offbeat\", praising Wright for \"[making the comic book elements] work in the translation to live action, and [having] enough respect for O'Malley's work in the first place to try to capture that spirit;{{sfn|White|2010}} Scott agrees, saying that the success comes from its ingenuity in bringing the video game to the player's world, rather than the other way around, and so \"the line between fantasy and reality is not so much blurred as erased, because the filmmakers create an entirely coherent, perpetually surprising universe\".{{sfn|Scott|2010}} Abrams also notes that some of the comic elements work better in the film, like when Scott wakes up, followed by Wallace and Other Scott, because of the timing of the medium. He opines that Wright has also managed to include additional scenes that further inform Scott's characterization and add humor to moments from the comics.{{sfn|Abrams|2010}}\n\n=== Popular response ===\nAfter seeing the film at a test screening, the American director [[Kevin Smith]] said he was impressed by it, and that \"it's spellbinding and nobody is going to understand what the fuck just hit them\", and that Wright \"is bringing a comic book to life.\"{{sfn|The Film Stage|2010}} Smith also said that fellow directors Quentin Tarantino and [[Jason Reitman]] were \"really into it\".{{sfn|The Film Stage|2010}} Carla Gillis, a writer for ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' and former lead singer for the band Plumtree, also commented on the film, as her band's song \"[[Plumtree (band)#Scott Pilgrim|Scott Pilgrim]]\" was the inspiration for O'Malley to create the series; Gillis felt the film carried the same positive yet bittersweet tone of the song.{{sfn|Kaplan|2010}} Several notable video game, film, and [[anime]] industry personalities also praised the film after it premiered in Japan, among them [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], [[Goichi Suda]], [[Miki Mizuno]], [[Tomohiko It\u014d (director)|Tomohiko It\u014d]] and [[Takao Nakano]].{{sfn|Wright|2011}}\n\nIn June 2013, O'Malley, who is of Korean and white Canadian parentage, stated that he regretted the fact that the film's cast was predominantly white, and that there were not enough roles for minorities.{{sfn|O'Malley|2013}}\n\nIn an editorial for Rotten Tomatoes, [[Nathan Rabin]] wrote that the film has a cult following,{{sfn|Rabin|2017}} and in a 2015 [[Met Film School]] feature, Danny Kelly listed it as one of the six most underrated films ever, saying it is \"a crime\" that more people did not go to see it.{{sfn|Kelly|2015}}\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Scott Pilgrim vs. the World}}\n''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' has received many awards and nominations. It also made the final shortlist of seven films for nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] category at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], but did not receive a nomination.{{sfn|Fernandez|2011}} It won the Audience Award at the 2010 [[Lund International Fantastic Film Festival]].{{sfn|Lund IFFF|2010}}{{sfn|Bergson|2011}}\n\nThe film has been placed on several Top Ten Films of 2010 lists, including as number 1 by [[Harry Knowles]],{{sfn|Knowles|2011}} and on several lists by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''.{{sfn|Empire|2010b}}{{sfn|Empire|2010c}}{{sfn|Empire|2010d}}{{sfn|Empire|2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n;Audio-visual media\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n<!--A-->\n*{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt1aQKwRHZU|title='Scott Pilgrim' Gets a New Life on DVD|author=AP|author-link=Associated Press|accessdate=December 5, 2010|date=November 11, 2010|via=[[YouTube]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210113641/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt1aQKwRHZU&gl=US&hl=enonion/_static/images/loading.gif|archive-date=December 10, 2019|ref=harv}}\n<!--C-->\n*{{Citation|title=Comic Con 2010: SCOTT PILGRIM VS.

However, by the 1230s, Trier's influence near the [[Rhine]] and Lahn had strengthened enough to oust Nassau from the majority of the Archbishopric's vogtships.<ref name=\"Reuling\" /> The Archbishop had reinforced Montabaur around 1217 in order to protect his possessions on the right bank of the Rhine from Nassau.\n\nIn 1224, Henry found support from [[Engelbert II of Berg|Engelbert II]], the Archbishop of [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Cologne]], who made Henry his ''[[Hofmarschall]]'' and ''Schenk'' (an honorary title that originally meant \"[[cup-bearer]]\").<ref name=\"Thiele\" />  However, in exchange for his protection from the Archbishops of Mainz and Trier, Henry had to cede half of [[Siegen]] to Cologne. Unaffected by this division of rule, however, Nassau retained its sovereign rights in Siegerland (the region surrounding Siegen), where the important High Jurisdiction (''hohe Gerichtsbarkeit'') and Hunting Ban (''[[Wildbann]]'') explicitly survived to 1259.<ref name=\"Reuling\" />\n\nDuring his reign, Henry fought out numerous feuds, especially with the nobles von Willnsdorf over Siegen, and von Merenberg over the ''Landgericht Rucheslo'' in the old ''Erdehegaue''.<ref name=\"joachim\" /> In the Siegerland, Henry built Ginsburg Castle during his reign.<ref name=\"vorsterman\" /><ref>Becker (1983), p. 9.</ref>\n\nHenry\u2019s brother, Rupert, had joined the [[Teutonic Order]] in 1230. On his death in 1239, Rupert bequeathed his legacy to the Order. Henry continuously disputed any division of his realm with the Teutonic Order.\n\nHenry also held the Upper Vogtship over the Diocese of St. George in [[Limburg an der Lahn]] during the construction of the [[Limburg Cathedral]]. In 1239 he transferred, at the request of his vassal Friedrich vom Hain, the income of the [[Netphen]] parishes to the [[Premonstratensian]] Keppel Abbey near [[Hilchenbach]]. His descendants took over the patronage of the monastery.<ref>[http://www.stiftkeppel.de/stift/main_st.htm History of Stift Keppel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208211614/http://www.stiftkeppel.de/stift/main_st.htm |date=2009-02-08 }}. {{in lang|de}}.

Around 1240, Henry built [[Dillenburg Castle]]<ref name=\"dek\" /> to better subjugate the dissidents. By 1248, the century-long [[Dernbacher Feud]] had already begun, involving [[Hesse]] as well in the context of the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]], because of a feud started by Henry with [[Sophie of Thuringia, Duchess of Brabant|Sophia of Thuringia]] and her son [[Henry I, Landgrave of Hesse|Henry I \"the Child\" of Hesse]] over the Herborner Mark, which burdened the Nassau-Hessian relationships beyond his death for centuries.\n\nThe necrology of [[Arnstein Abbey]] documented the death of ''\u2018Henrici comitis de Nassauwe, qui contulit nobis ecclesiam in Diffenbach inferiori ...\u2019'' on 26 April.<ref name=\"cawley\" /> Henry is still mentioned in a charter from 1247 and is listed as deceased in a charter from 25 January 1251. This means that he died on 26 April in either 1247, 1248, 1249 or 1250. He was succeeded by his sons [[Walram II, Count of Nassau|Walram II]] and [[Otto I, Count of Nassau|Otto I]].\n\n== Marriage and children ==\nHenry married before 11 December 1215<ref>Cawley quotes from a charter dated 11 December 1215, in which ''\u2018Heinricus und Roppertus comites de Nassovva\u2019'' with the consent of ''\u2018uxorum nostrarum Methildis et Gertrudis\u2019'' bought property from Mainz cathedral.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist theory]],<ref name=\"Haidt2001\" /> where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through post-hoc moral reasoning.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\n====Moral Foundations Theory====\n{{Main|Moral foundations theory}}\nMoral foundations theory, first proposed in 2004 by Jonathan Haidt and Craig Joseph,<ref name=\"Haidt2004\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|author2=Craig Joseph|title=Intuitive ethics: how innately prepared intuitions generate culturally variable virtues|journal=Daedalus|date=Fall 2004|volume=133|issue=4|pages=55\u201366|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.joseph.2004.intuitive-ethics.pub035.pdf|doi=10.1162/0011526042365555|access-date=2012-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909124829/http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.joseph.2004.intuitive-ethics.pub035.pdf|archive-date=2016-09-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> attempts to explain the origins of and variation in human moral reasoning on the basis of innate, modular foundations.

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThe five psychological foundations are:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that \"morality is about protecting individuals\" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity).<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Their research found that \"justice and related virtues\u2026make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives\".<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.\n\n===Moral virtues===\nPiaget and Kohlberg both developed stages of development to understand the timing and meaning of moral decisions. They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality.

In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification|Social cognitive theory of morality}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt2001\" /> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G. S.|last2=Skitka|first2=L. J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist theory]],<ref name=\"Haidt2001\" /> where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through post-hoc moral reasoning.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\n====Moral Foundations Theory====\n{{Main|Moral foundations theory}}\nMoral foundations theory, first proposed in 2004 by Jonathan Haidt and Craig Joseph,<ref name=\"Haidt2004\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|author2=Craig Joseph|title=Intuitive ethics: how innately prepared intuitions generate culturally variable virtues|journal=Daedalus|date=Fall 2004|volume=133|issue=4|pages=55\u201366|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.joseph.2004.intuitive-ethics.pub035.pdf|doi=10.1162/0011526042365555|access-date=2012-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909124829/http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.joseph.2004.intuitive-ethics.pub035.pdf|archive-date=2016-09-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> attempts to explain the origins of and variation in human moral reasoning on the basis of innate, modular foundations.

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThe five psychological foundations are:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that \"morality is about protecting individuals\" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity).<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Their research found that \"justice and related virtues\u2026make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives\".<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.\n\n===Moral virtues===\nPiaget and Kohlberg both developed stages of development to understand the timing and meaning of moral decisions. They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are \"fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape\" and that over time, people develop greater \"moral expertise\".{{Sfn|Lapsley|Narvaez|2004|p=197}}\n\n==== Triune ethics theory ====\n{{Main|Triune ethics Meta-theory}}\nThe triune ethics meta-theory (TEM) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a [[metatheory]] that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of [[biological inheritance]] (including human evolutionary [[adaptations]]), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|date=March 1, 2008|title=Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/TriuneEthicsWord.htm|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=95\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008|issn=0732-118X|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.152.4926}}</ref> TET proposes three basic mindsets that shape ethical behavior: self-protectionism (a variety of types), engagement, and imagination (a variety of types that are fueld by protectionism or engagement).

He focused on moral development as one's progression in the capacity to reason about justice. Kohlberg's interview method included hypothetical moral dilemmas or conflicts of interest (most notably, the [[Heinz dilemma]]). He proposed six stages and three levels of development (claiming that \"anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1984|isbn=978-0-06-064761-2|series=Essays on Moral Developent|volume=2|location=|pages=195}}</ref> At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation.

The justice perspective draws attention to inequality and oppression, while striving for reciprocal rights and equal respect for all. The care perspective draws attention to the ideas of detachment and abandonment, while striving for attention and response to people who need it. Care Orientation is relationally based.

In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification|Social cognitive theory of morality}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt2001\" /> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt2001\" />\n\nFollowing the publication of a landmark fMRI study in 2001,<ref name=\"Greene2001\" /> [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] proposed his [[Dual process theory (moral psychology)|dual process theory of moral judgment]], according to which intuitive/emotional and deliberative processes respectively give rise to characteristically deontological and consequentialist moral judgments. A \"[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35\u201380|chapter=The secret joke of Kant\u2019s Soul|oclc=750463100}}</ref> Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing).

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G. S.|last2=Skitka|first2=L. J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

She found success in competitive curling from an early age, playing skip for the [[St. Patrick's High School (Halifax)|St. Patrick's High School]] curling team. She was only 19 years old when she won the first of her 16 Nova Scotia curling titles. That led to competing in the Canadian championships, where she finished second. Jones graduated from [[Dalhousie University]] and went to work in broadcasting in her native Halifax.\n\nIn 1982 she became the youngest skip, at age 22, ever to win the Canadian women's curling championship but career, marriage and a family slowed down her competitive curling. She joined [[CBC Television]] as a reporter in 1986 and went on to cover numerous summer and winter [[Olympic Games]]. She continues to work for the CBC, and is currently a reporter for CBC Nova Scotia.\n\n==Broadcasting career==\nJones began her broadcasting career in radio sports at [[CHUM (AM)|CHUM]] radio in 1982. She made the switch to television broadcasting in 1984 at CTV, and joined the CBC in 1986.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/programguide/personality/colleen_jones CBC Personalities - Colleen Jones]</ref> Beginning in 1993, Jones has been the weather presenter and sports reporter for [[CBC Morning News]] on [[CBC Newsworld]] (now [[CBC News Network]]). At the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Torino Olympics]], she did CBC segments about curling. Jones provided curling commentary for [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]]'s coverage of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]].\n\nJones starred in a [[public service announcement]] about the [[Canada 2006 Census]]. Jones appeared in the January 15, 2008 episode of ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' for a skit titled MVC ''Most Valuable Curler''.\n\n==Curling career==\n\n===1999\u20132006===\nIn 1999, with her new team of [[Kim Kelly]], [[Mary-Anne Arsenault|Mary Anne Waye (later Arsenault)]] and [[Nancy Delahunt]], Jones won the Canadian curling title for the second time. The team repeated this in 2001 and they went on to win the [[List of women's World Curling champions|World Curling Championship]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. They followed this up with another Canadian championship in 2002 and then won it for a record-setting fifth time at the [[2004 Scott Tournament of Hearts]]. This made Jones the first skip to win four straight Canadian titles. From there the team went on to win their second World Curling Championship.\n\nTheir return at the [[2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts]] was not as stellar. The team finished the round-robin at 6-5 and lost in a tie-breaker to Sandy Comeau of [[New Brunswick]]. When this happened, the team got a standing ovation, which even halted play in the other game that was occurring two sheets over. The following year, the team was back in form, but bowed out in the semi-finals to [[Jennifer Jones (curler)|Jennifer Jones]]. At the end of the 2006 season, the team broke up. Jones joined the team of fellow Haligonian [[Kay Zinck]], as her third. The rest of the team got a new skip in [[Laine Peters]].

For the 2007/2008 season she would add Olympic bronze medallist [[Georgina Wheatcroft]] to her team along with [[Kate Hamer]] and [[Darah Provencal]].

She was only 19 years old when she won the first of her 16 Nova Scotia curling titles. That led to competing in the Canadian championships, where she finished second. Jones graduated from [[Dalhousie University]] and went to work in broadcasting in her native Halifax.\n\nIn 1982 she became the youngest skip, at age 22, ever to win the Canadian women's curling championship but career, marriage and a family slowed down her competitive curling. She joined [[CBC Television]] as a reporter in 1986 and went on to cover numerous summer and winter [[Olympic Games]]. She continues to work for the CBC, and is currently a reporter for CBC Nova Scotia.\n\n==Broadcasting career==\nJones began her broadcasting career in radio sports at [[CHUM (AM)|CHUM]] radio in 1982.

The team repeated this in 2001 and they went on to win the [[List of women's World Curling champions|World Curling Championship]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. They followed this up with another Canadian championship in 2002 and then won it for a record-setting fifth time at the [[2004 Scott Tournament of Hearts]]. This made Jones the first skip to win four straight Canadian titles. From there the team went on to win their second World Curling Championship.\n\nTheir return at the [[2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts]] was not as stellar. The team finished the round-robin at 6-5 and lost in a tie-breaker to Sandy Comeau of [[New Brunswick]]. When this happened, the team got a standing ovation, which even halted play in the other game that was occurring two sheets over. The following year, the team was back in form, but bowed out in the semi-finals to [[Jennifer Jones (curler)|Jennifer Jones]]. At the end of the 2006 season, the team broke up. Jones joined the team of fellow Haligonian [[Kay Zinck]], as her third. The rest of the team got a new skip in [[Laine Peters]].
