{"title_page": "Ewen MacPherson of Cluny", "text_new": "{{For|the physician|Cluny Macpherson (physician) }}\n\n'''Ewen MacPherson of Cluny''', also known as '''\"Cluny Macpherson\"''' (11 February 1706 \u2013 30 June 1764), was the chief of the [[Clan MacPherson]] at the time of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite Rising of 1745]]. He took part as a supporter of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] and after the rebellion was crushed he went into hiding.\n\n== Early life ==\nEwan MacPherson (called Cluny) was born on 11 February 1706. He was the first born son of Lachlan MacPherson of Nuide (1674-1746). His mother was Jean Cameron, daughter of Sir Ewan Cameron of Lochiel.\n\nCluny grew up to be a respected individual.  His father-in-law, [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]], described him as \"a thorrow good natur\u2019d, even temper\u2019d, honest gentleman\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macpherson|title=A Day's March to Ruin|date=1996|page=39}}</ref> Physically he was described as \"of a low stature, very square, and a dark brown complection\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macpherson|title=A Day's March to Ruin|date=1996|page=39}}</ref>\n\n== Clan MacPherson ==\nThe territory of the [[Clan Macpherson|Clan MacPherson]] covered [[Badenoch]], south-east of Loch Ness, but the Macphersons were also part of a federation of other clans, called the [[Chattan Confederation]] (also called Clan Chattan). This alliance, which dated back to the 13th century, included the [[Clan Mackintosh|Mackintoshes]], [[Clan MacGillivray|MacGillivrays]], [[Clan Davidson|Davidsons]], [[Clan Schaw|Shaws]] and others. A meeting of these allied clans in 1724 established that leadership was with the Mackintoshes.\n\n== 1742 ==\n[[File:DonaldCameronOfLochiel.jpg|thumb|Donald Cameron of Lochiel]]\nThe year 1742 marked his arrival into the interconnected world of Scottish affairs. On marrying [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat's]] daughter Jean (Jenny) in 1742, Cluny took over management of his father's estate. At the request of the Duke of Gordon (the clan's feudal superior), he undertook to protect a wide area of land from cattle thieving.\n\nAlso in 1742, he signed a Bond of Friendship with his father-in-law [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Simon Fraser]] (Chief of Clan Fraser) and with his cousin, [[Donald Cameron of Lochiel|Donald Cameron]] (Chief of Clan Cameron), \u2018binding themselves and their followers to stand by and support each other\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lenman|title=The Jacobite Clans of the Great Glen|date=1984|page=151}}</ref> This was an attempt to loosen the tie to the [[Clan Mackintosh|Mackintoshes]], and may have been a factor in his later recruitment to the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause.\n\n== The '45 ==\nIn August 1745, with rumours of a Jacobite uprising circulating, the government offered Cluny command of an independent company in [[John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun|Lord Loudon's]] regiment. This required swearing an oath of allegiance to George II.  Once [[Charles Edward Stuart]] raised his standard at [[Glenfinnan]] in that same month, Cluny was in a bind. His clan had been [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] in 1715, but not all were similarly inclined thirty years later. A historian has noted that he \u2018had no particular reason, economic, political or religious, strong enough to propel him into the Jacobite camp\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lenman|title=The Jacobite Clans of the Great Glen|date=1984|page=171}}</ref> Moreover, his wife Jenny wanted her husband to remain faithful to the government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macpherson|title=A Day's March to Ruin|date=1996|page=41}}</ref>\n\nCluny did remain loyal to the government, to the extent of turning up with his company to assist the Government general [[John Cope (British Army officer)|John Cope]] on his march north in August 1745 to head off the Jacobite army. However, as it was understrength, he was sent back by [[John Cope (British Army officer)|Cope]] to raise more troops. Then, whilst home in Cluny Castle on the night of 28 August, he was taken prisoner by a Jacobite raiding party composed of Camerons (his mother's family). To some extent, he may have wanted to be taken prisoner. Taken to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], he emerged within two weeks as a newly minted colonel in the Jacobite army. \n[[File:Battle culloden.JPG|thumb|Battle of Culloden]]\nHe went north to raise troops for the Jacobite cause, but needed to use both persuasion and threats of violence to raise about 300 men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macpherson|title=A Day's March to Ruin|date=1996|page=71}}</ref> He was present at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]] on 21 September, when Cope's forces were routed in a 15-minute battle. He met Bonnie Prince Charlie at [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood House]] in [[Edinburgh]] in late October. In December he took part in an attack on the Duke of Cumberland's cavalry, at the [[Clifton Moor Skirmish|Skirmish of Clifton Moor]], near Penrith. He was also present at the [[Battle of Falkirk]] in January 1746.  By February, with the Jacobite army retreating northwards, Cluny was sent ahead to raise more men, \u2018burning the houses and killing the cattle of any reluctant to serve\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lenman|title=The Jacobite Clans of the Great Glen|date=1996|page=156}}</ref> Overall, his contribution to the Jacobite cause could be described (as it was by [[Lord George Murray (general)|Lord George Murray]] in March) as \u2018indefatigable\u2019.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Duffy|title=The '45|date=2003|page=472}}</ref>\n\nHe was not present at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in April, and went on the run after the Jacobite defeat there.

Lameness is a common veterinary problem in [[racehorse]]s, [[sport horse]]s, and pleasure horses. It is one of the most costly health problems for the equine industry, both monetarily for the cost of diagnosis and treatment, and for the cost of time off resulting in loss-of-use.<ref>Seitzinger AH, Traub-Dargatz JL, Kane AJ, Kopral CA, Morley PS, Garber LP, Losinger WC, & Hill GW. \"Comparison of the Economic Costs of Equine Lameness, Colic, and Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis (EPM)\".

Horses are predisposed to orthopedic lameness by conformational flaws, poor hoof balance, working on poor footing, repetitive movements, poor conditioning for a given activity, and competing at a very high athletic level.<ref name=\"MVM Online\"/>\n\n'''Metabolic''' causes of lameness include [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (equine)|hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] (HYPP) and [[Equine polysaccharide storage myopathy|polysaccharide storage myopathy]], which directly affect muscular function.\n\n'''Circulatory''' causes of lameness occur when blood flow to an area is compromised.  This may be due to abnormal blood clotting, as in the case of aortic-iliac [[thrombosis]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maxie | first1 = MG | last2 = Physick-Sheard | first2 = PW | year = 1985 | title = Aortic-Iliac Thrombosis in Horses | url = | journal = Vet.

These include problems such as [[cellulitis]], hoof abscesses, and [[septic arthritis]].\n\n===Mechanical lameness===\nMechanical lameness is caused by a physical abnormality, such as scar tissue, that prevents normal motion of a limb. Mechanical lameness does not cause pain. Classic examples of mechanical lameness include upward fixation of the patella and fibrotic myopathy, but any type of adhesion (often secondary to scarring during healing post-injury) or fibrosis can cause mechanical lameness.\n* Upward fixation of the patella occurs when the normal locking mechanism of the stifle, which allows the horse to \"lock\" its hind legs into a fixed position so it may stand with minimal effort, engages at inappropriate times such as when the horse is walking. It results in an inability to flex the stifle, so the horse must walk with an extended hind leg. It is associated with straight hind limb [[equine conformation|conformation]] (post leg), poor muscling of the hind limb, stifle trauma, and genetics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tnibar | first1 = M.

Neurologic causes of lameness include:\n\n* Cervical vertebral stenotic myopathy ([[Wobbler disease#Wobbler disease in horses|Wobbler disease]]): compression of the spinal cord in the cervical (neck) region results in lameness, ataxia, and change in gait, especially in the hind legs, and neck stiffness or pain.\n* [[Stringhalt]]: caused by damage to the long digital extensor muscle, or from eating the weed [[Hypochaeris radicata]]; it produces a gait characterized by rapid, spasmodic hyperflexion of the hind limbs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Huntington | first1 = P.

Radial nerve paralysis will cause a dropped elbow and make it difficult to extend the affected limb. Suprascapular nerve damage will lead to atrophy of the main muscles of the shoulder (sweeny). Femoral nerve paralysis causes hyperflexion of the stifles, hocks, and fetlocks and the horse usually walks on the toe of the hind foot.<ref>DYSON, S., TAYLOR, P. and WHITWELL, K.

Those that commonly alter gait include [[tetanus]], [[botulism]], [[Lyme disease]], [[equine protozoal myeloencephalitis]] (EPM), [[rabies]], [[West Nile virus]], [[eastern equine encephalitis virus|equine encephalitis virus]], and [[equine herpesvirus 1]].\n* [[Neoplasia|Neoplasic]] (cancerous) changes in the brain or around the spinal cord may also cause alterations in gait.\n\n==Signs of lameness==\nManifestations of lameness include any alteration in gait from what is normal for the horse. In general, it is harder to detect hind limb lameness when compared to lameness in a front limb when using visual cues.\n\n===Identifying a front limb lameness===\nThe classic sign of lameness in a front leg is a prominent \"head bob.\" Viewed from the side, the horse raises its head and neck when the lame leg hits the ground, which helps to unload the lame leg. This is sometimes remembered by the adage \"down on sound.\" A head bob is usually easy to see when one leg is lame, but can be subtle in very mild unilateral lameness, or in the case of bilateral front limb lameness.<ref name=MEL/> A horse may also try to reduce impact on a lame front leg by tensing of the muscles of the shoulder. In this case, it will stiffen the limb just before it hits the ground, a sign that may be noticed by an astute observer.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Identifying a hind limb lameness===\nEvaluation of hind limb lameness can be difficult. Generally, the viewer watches the hip, sacrum, gluteal muscles, or hemi-pelvis (pelvis of one side of the body) when examining lameness in the hind end. Examination should be performed both watching the horse from behind while trotting away from the examiner, and from the side as the horse passes.\n\nWhen watching from behind, the viewer often looks for a \"hip hike\" or \"pelvic hike.\" This occurs when the horse raises the pelvis on the lame side as it is bearing weight, trying to shift weight off of the painful leg in a manner similar to raising of the head in front limb lameness. This is a sudden, short upward motion of the hemi-pelvis or gluteal muscles. The hip of the lame leg does not always rise above the level of the hip of the sound leg, which can be confusing to those looking for a \"hip hike.\" Instead, it is an exaggerated upward movement that is watched for during weight bearing. Additionally, horses with a hind limb lameness will tend to reduce the degree of leg use. To do so, some horses will reduce the contraction time of the gluteals on the side of the lame leg, leading to a \"hip roll\" or \"hip dip\" and appearance that the hip drops a greater degree on the side of the lame leg.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nThese apparently contradictory statements (\"hip hike\" vs \"hip drop\" on the lame leg) can be explained by when the horse perceives pain during the stride. If the pain is perceived during the early stance phase of the stride, the horse will try to unweight the leg and produce a \"hip hike.\" If the pain is perceived during the pushoff phase of the stride, the horse does not push with as much force, subsequently reducing the height the pelvis is raised, and leading to a \"dipping\" motion during the swing phase of the stride as the horse brings the limb forward. In some cases, both a hip hike and a hip drop can be seen in the same horse.<ref name=Keegan>Keegan KG. Head Nods and Hip Hikes. Western Veterinary Conference 2013. {{cite web |url=http://www.wvc.org/images/session_notes_2013/2013_EQ21.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229010842/http://www.wvc.org/images/session_notes_2013/2013_EQ21.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-29 }}</ref> Some practitioners simply look for the side with the greater overall deviation, which occurs in the lame leg<ref name=\"MVM Online\"/><ref name=MEL/>\n\nAnother method to detecting hind limb lameness requires watching the pelvis from the side. The entire pelvis is evaluated, and its relative position vertically (relative to the ground) is compared at various points in the stride. The pelvis normally rises and falls with each step. Horses with pain during the early stance phase of the trot will not allow the pelvis to drop as much when the lame leg is weighted, trying to avoid extra weight on the painful leg. Subsequently, the pelvis will not fall as much downward when the lame leg is bearing weight as when the sound leg is bearing weight. When viewed from behind, this is seen as a \"hip hike.\" If the horse is more painful as it is pushing off a limb, it will not push off with as much force, and the pelvis will rise less on the lame side relative to the same point of the stride when the sound leg is on the ground. This is seen as the \"hip roll\" when viewed from behind.<ref name=Keegan/>\n\nOther signs that indicate hind limb lameness include \"plaiting\" with the hind feet, which can be seen in cases of sacro-iliac pain,<ref name=\"SI lesions\"/> carrying the hindquarters to one side or drifting in one direction,<ref name=MEL/><ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\">Dyson SJ.

One method is to look at the relative time a leg spends in the cranial (forward) phase of the stride. For a front leg, this is when the lower leg is in front of the horse, i.e. angled forward, while the caudal phase is when the leg is underneath the horse, i.e. angled backward. For a hind leg, the cranial phase occurs when the lower leg is under the body of the horse, and the caudal phase is when the limb is out behind the body of the horse.\n\nA normal horse with have a cranial phase and a caudal phase of equal length: the horse will bring the leg as far forward as it does backward. In a lame horse, the cranial phase will be shorter when compared to the caudal phase, so it appears to spend more time with the leg backward than it does forward. A shortened cranial phase is most commonly seen in cases of bilateral lameness, lameness of the upper limb (such as shoulder or hip pain), and osteoarthritis of the hocks.<ref name=MEL/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S | year = 1986 | title = Shoulder lameness in horses: An analysis of 58 suspected cases | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 29\u201336 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-3306.1986.tb03531.x }}</ref><ref>Wright, I.M.

Again, this is because the horse is landing with less force as it tries to avoid weighting the painful leg.\n\nLastly, behavioral changes and decreased performance may indicate pain, even if obvious clinical lameness is not evident.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/>\n\n==The lameness evaluation==\nA lameness exam is used to try to pinpoint the cause of lameness in the horse, which subsequently guides treatment. It is the first step to evaluate decreased performance in an equine athlete, even if the horse does not appear overtly lame, to rule out any pain-associated cause.\n\nLameness exams are also a key component of the [[equine prepurchase exam|pre-purchase examination]]. These examinations evaluate the horse to give the potential buyer information regarding present soundness of the horse. Veterinarians may comment on aspects that could inhibit the use of the horse for the buyer's intended activity, such as subclinical osteoarthritis or conformational defects. However, the veterinarian is not there to \"pass\" or \"fail\" a horse, but only to give their impression of the horse on that day.<ref name=MEL>{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=Gary|title=Manual of Equine Lameness|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-1546-6}}</ref> Therefore, pre-purchase examinations make no guarantees of the future health or soundness of the horse. The pre-purchase exam may range in scope depending on the desire of the buyer, from a simple examination with hoof and flexion tests, to multiple radiographs, ultrasound, and advanced imaging techniques including MRI.\n\n===History===\nA detailed history is the first step of a lameness exam.  \n#Age: Foals are more likely to have infectious causes of lameness ([[septic arthritis]]). Horses just starting training may be lame due to a developmental orthopedic disease, such as osteochondrosis. Older animals are more likely to experience [[osteoarthritis]].<ref name=MEL/>  \n#Breed: Breed-specific diseases, such as [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (equine)|hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] (HYPP), can be ruled out. Additionally, some breeds or types are more prone to certain types of lameness.\n#Discipline: Certain lamenesses are associated with certain uses. For example, racehorses are more likely to have fatigue-related injuries such as stress fractures and injury to the flexor tendons, while western show horses are more likely to suffer from navicular syndrome and English sport horses are more likely to have osteoarthritis or injury to the suspensory ligament.<ref name=MEL/>\n#Past history of lameness: An old injury may be re-injured. In the case of progressive disease, such as osteoarthritis, a horse will often experience recurrent lameness that must be managed. Shifting lameness may suggest a bilateral injury or infectious cause of lameness.\n#Duration and progression the lameness: Acute injury is more common with soft tissue injury. Chronic, progressive disease is more common in cases such as osteoarthritis and navicular disease. \n#Recent changes in management: such as turn-out, exercise level, diet, or shoeing.\n#Effect of exercise on degree of lameness.<ref name=MEL/>\n#Any treatment implemented, including rest.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Physical examination and palpation===\n[[Image:Zippo 09.JPG|thumb|upright|100px|Splints can be palpated on physical examination.]]\nOne of the first steps of the lameness examination is to evaluate the horse at rest. A good evaluation of [[equine conformation|conformation]], including overall body type, can help the practitioner determine the potential cause of lameness. Certain conformational defects can predispose a horse to injury, and knowledge of correct conformation can help narrow down possible causes of injury, especially when combined with the horse's history. The horse's stance is also evaluated. Frequently resting a particular leg, \"pointing\" a foot (holding a leg out in front of the body), or standing in an abnormal position can indicate compensation for an injury. Shifting of weight is normal in the hind legs, but frequent shifting of weight in the front legs, or placing both front feet in front of the body, can indicate bilateral forelimb lameness.<ref name=MEL/> Stifle pain sometimes causes a horse to stand with the stifles rotated out.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/> Hip and pelvic pain can produce a toe-out, stifle out, hock-in stance and that remains present at the walk.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nAsymmetry of the muscular structure, due to muscle atrophy, usually occurs on the side of the lame limb. Hind limb lameness or pelvic fracture can cause unilateral atrophy of the middle gluteal or gracilis muscles.<ref name=MEL/> Damage to the suprascapular nerve can lead to atrophy of the muscles of the shoulder (supraspinatus and infraspinatus). Neck muscle atrophy can be seen with cervical vertebral malformation (Wobbler's disease), articular facet osteoarthritis, and neurologic causes of lameness.<ref name=MEL/> Asymmetry in a limb can also occur due to swelling of a joint or soft tissue. For this reason, each leg should be compared to its partner.\n\nAfter a visual exam, the practitioner [[palpate]]s the horse, feeling for heat, swelling, and sensitivity to pressure indicating pain. Palpation is usually most thoroughly performed in the lower limb, but a comprehensive exam will include palpation of the back, pelvis, and neck. Joints should be palpated for pain, effusion of joint pouches, thickening of the joint capsule, and checked for range of motion. Major ligaments and tendons, such as the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, inferior check ligament, suspensory ligament, and distal sesamoidean ligaments, should also be palpated along their entire length. Individual bones may be palpated if injury is suspected, such as a fracture, bucked shins in racehorses (cannon bones), or splints (splint bones).<ref name=MEL/>\n\nSpecialized manipulative tests can be used to help identify specific areas of pain:\n* The Churchill test: pressure is applied to the plantar surface of the head of the medial splint bone. A painful horse will flex and abduct the limb, indicating hock pain.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Peroneus tertius rupture: The hock is pulled into extension while the stifle is flexed. A positive test (the ability to extend the hock) indicates a ruptured peroneus tertius muscle.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Patella displacement: the patella is pushed laterally and proximally, to test for upward fixation of the patella.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Cruciate test: the examiner moves the tibia sharply caudally, to feel for movement away from the femur or [[crepitus]]. Excessive movement can indicate cruciate rupture.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Test for stifle collateral ligament damage: the stifle is held still, while the distal limb is abducted (to test for damage to the medial collateral ligament) or adducted (to test for lateral collateral ligament damage). Excessive movement by the distal limb relative to the stifle suggests rupture of the collateral ligament. Sprain of these ligaments can be evaluated by repeating this test multiple times, before trotting the horse off an looking for lameness.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Evaluation of the hoof===\nThe majority of lameness originates in the hoof. For this reason, the hoof is closely scrutinized in shape, balance, shoeing, wear pattern, and for the presence of cracks, and contracted or sheared heels.\n\n[[Image:Halfarabianwithhighheel.jpg|thumb|right|Chronic lameness often causes an upright hoof capsule.]]\nChronic lameness will change the shape of the hoof capsule, since the lame limb is not weighted as much as its partner, making the capsule more upright, narrow, with a higher heel on the lame limb and more flattened on the sound one.<ref name=MEL/> Hoof or horseshoe wear can indicate breakover and if the horse is dragging its toes. Change in shape of the hoof wall is also common in horses suffering from laminitis. \"Founder rings,\" or thickened concentric rings in the hoof wall, indicate a past episode of laminitis. Concavity of the dorsal (front) surface of the hoof can indicate chronic laminitis. The sole may become convex if the coffin bone begins to push through the bottom of the hoof.<ref>Lucas, Don (1963) \"Laminitis,\" Iowa State University Veterinarian: Vol. 26: Iss. 3, Article 7. \nAvailable at: http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/iowastate_veterinarian/vol26/iss3/7</ref>\n\nCorrect hoof balance allows for even distribution of forces through the leg and hoof. Poor hoof balance, due to conformational flaws or poor trimming, can cause lameness from musculoskeletal injury,<ref>Wilson, A. M., Seelig, T. J., Shield, R. A. and Silverman, B. W. (1998), The effect of foot imbalance on point of force application in the horse. \"Equine Veterinary Journal\", 30: 540\u2013545. {{doi|10.1111/j.2042-3306.1998.tb04531}}</ref> and poor hoof balance has been associated with increased risk of catastrophic injury in racehorses.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kane | first1 = AJ | last2 = Stover | first2 = SM | last3 = Gardner | first3 = IA | last4 = Bock | first4 = KB | last5 = Case | first5 = JT | last6 = Johnson | first6 = BJ | last7 = Anderson | first7 = ML | last8 = Barr | first8 = BC | last9 = Daft | first9 = BM | last10 = Kinde | first10 = H | last11 = Larochelle | first11 = D | last12 = Moore | first12 = J | last13 = Mysore | first13 = J | last14 = Stoltz | first14 = J | last15 = Woods | first15 = L | last16 = Read | first16 = DH | last17 = Ardans | first17 = AA | year = 1998 | title = Hoof size, shape, and balance as possible risk factors for catastrophic musculoskeletal injury of Thoroughbred racehorses | url = | journal = American Journal of Veterinary Research | volume = 59 | issue = 12| pages = 1545\u20131552 }}</ref> Side-to-side (mediolateral) imbalance can cause sheared heals and hoof cracks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van Heel | first1 = M.

Long toes force the horse to pivot (break over) further forward over the toe. The toe acts as a lever arm, and its increased length makes it harder for the heels to rotate off the ground. This increases strain on the deep digital flexor tendon and the ligaments of the navicular bone.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n[[Image:Absces.JPG|thumb|right|An abscess has ruptured out of the coronary band of this horse.]]\nThe bottom of the hoof should also be examined. The shape of the sole, size of the frog, and shape of the bars can indicate overall health of the hoof. Holes in heel bulb usually indicate a hoof abscess that has ruptured.<ref name=MEL/> The horse's shoeing can also provide clues to the examiner. The application of corrective shoes or pads may indicate past problems requiring special shoeing. This can be especially helpful during the pre-purchase exam, when the lameness history of the horse may not be readily available.\n\nDigital pulse evaluation is important when addressing the hoof. An increased digital pulse often indicates that the lesion is in the foot, and are usually most significantly increased in horses with [[laminitis]]. The coronary band may also be palpated. Cool swelling can indicate coffin joint effusion, swelling with an increase in temperature can indicate laminitis, firm swelling can occur with [[ringbone]], and a localized swelling with pain can indicate an abscess.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nExaminers will also \"hoof test\" each foot by applying a metal instrument that squeezes the foot to test for deep pain. Diffuse sensitivity occurs with fracture or infection of the coffin bone, and laminitis. More localized sensitivity can be found with sole bruises, puncture wounds, hoof abscesses, and hot nails. Sensitivity over the middle third of the frog is consistent with navicular syndrome, but can also occur with sheared heels. To distinguish these two, the hoof testers may be applied over the heels, which will be sensitive in the case of any heel-related pain, such as sheared, contracted, or bruised heels.<ref name=MEL/> The hoof wall may also be percussed (struck with a hammer), which will produce a positive response in cases of hoof cracks that are causing the horse pain, laminitis, or a gravel (hoof abscess travelling up the hoof wall towards the coronary band).<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Evaluation in motion===\n[[File:80 tarkastuksessa.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Horses are usually trotted on a straight line to evaluate lameness.]]\nThe horse is evaluated in motion, usually at the walk and trot, but occasionally also in the canter. The walk is often the best gait to evaluate foot placement.<ref name=MEL/> The trot is generally the best gait to localize the lameness to a particular leg, because it is a symmetrical gait where the front half of the horse and the back half move in unison.<ref name=Keegan/> The canter may also be used for lameness evaluation. Resistance to picking up the canter or to engage the hind end can suggest pain in the sacro-iliac joint, pelvis, or hind leg.\n\nLameness may be accentuated under certain conditions. Therefore, the moving examination is often performed both in a straight line and on a circle, and may be repeated on different footings. Hard footing tends to make joint and bone injury more apparent, while soft, deep footings tend to accentuate soft tissue injury. Circles may accentuate a lameness when the lame leg is on the inside or outside of the circle.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/><ref>Starke, Sandra D., et al. \"Vertical head and trunk movement adaptations of sound horses trotting in a circle on a hard surface.\" ''The Veterinary Journal'' 2012; 193(1): 73\u2013-80.</ref>\n\nAt times, it may be helpful to evaluate the horse under saddle, since the weight of the rider can accentuate lameness.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/> In cases of decreased performance, it can be useful to watch a horse performing certain discipline-specific movements, which may be the only time the rider notices a change in the horse's abilities.\n\nGait is evaluated for symmetry. This includes the overall fluidity of the horse's motion, length of stride, loading of a leg, how the hoof lands on the ground (flat, toe, or heel-first), range of motion of the joints, deviations in body position, and position of the head and neck.\n\nThe first evaluation of the horse is used to determine the severity of lameness and to help pinpoint which part of the body may be affected. The process of watching a horse move is repeated after each additional flexion test or nerve block to determine its effect on the animal.\n\n===Grading lameness===\nLameness is graded on a scale. This allows the practitioner to help quantify a lameness in order to determine relative severity, assess the degree of change after flexion tests or nerve blocks, and to determine the improvement of lameness over time once treatment has been implemented. The most commonly used scale in the United States is a 1\u2013-5 scale of the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP). Other scales are more commonly used outside of the United States, including a 1\u201310 scale in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = Can lameness be graded reliably? | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Journal | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 379\u2013382 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-3306.2011.00391 }}</ref>\n\n'''AAEP Lameness Grading Scale'''\n{{Unbulleted list|Grade 0: lameness is not perceptible under any circumstances|Grade 1: lameness is difficult to observe and not consistently apparent under any circumstances|Grade 2: the lameness is consistently apparent under certain circumstances (specific surfaces, on an incline, circling, under saddle, etc), but difficult to observe at a walk or trot on a straight line|Grade 3: the lameness is consistently apparent at the trot under all circumstances|Grade 4: the lameness is apparent at the walk|Grade 5: the horse is minimally or non-weight bearing on the limb, or unable to move}}\n\nNon-weight bearing lameness (grade 5) is most commonly the result of a hoof abscess. While very painful, most hoof abscesses are quite treatable and do not cause long-term lameness. However, fractures and septic synovial structures (such as an infected joint pouch or tendon sheath) can also cause non-weight bearing lameness, and require emergency evaluation and treatment by a veterinarian. Therefore, non-weight bearing lameness should be assessed by an equine professional in a timely manner, especially if it is associated with trauma, laceration, or recent joint injection.\n\n===Flexion tests===\n{{Main|Flexion test}}\n\nFlexion tests are a diagnostic tool involving the application of sustained pressure on a particular set of joints. The limb is forcibly flexed for between 30 seconds and 3 minutes,<ref name=\"Ramey AAEP\">Ramey, DW. \"Prospective Evaluation of Forelimb Flexion Tests in Practice: Clinical Response, Radiographic Correlations, and Predictive Value\nfor Future Lameness\".

An increase in lameness following a flexion test suggests that those joints or surrounding soft tissue structures may be a source of pain for the horse. Flexion tests help narrow down the source of lameness to a certain part of the leg, but they are non-specific because they almost always affect more than one joint and because they also affect the soft tissue structures around the joint, not just the joint itself.<ref name=MEL/> Additionally, they must be interpreted carefully due to the risk of false negatives and false positives.\n\n===Regional limb anesthesia (nerve blocks)===\nNerve blocks involve injecting a small amount of local anesthetic around a nerve or into a [[synovial membrane|synovial structure]] (such as a joint or tendon sheath) in order to block the perception of pain in a specific area. After the substance is injected, it is given a few minutes to take effect. The block is then tested by pushing a blunt object, such as a ballpoint pen, into the area that is supposed to be desensitized. If the horse does not react to this pressure, the area is desensitized, and the horse is trotted to see if the lameness has improved. Improvement indicates that the cause of lameness was from a structure desensitized by the nerve block.\n\nNerve blocks are performed in a step-wise fashion, beginning at the most [[distal]] (lower) part of the limb and moving upward. This is due to the fact that blocking a nerve higher up will desensitize everything it innervates distal to the blocking location. For example, blocking the leg at the level of the fetlock will also block the entire foot, since the nerve fibers that innervate the foot are inhibited when they travel through the fetlock area. A positive result from this block will not be able to differentiate foot pain from pain in the pastern or fetlock region. More information may be gained from blocking the foot first, then the fetlock, since it allows for greater specificity in determining the cause of lameness.\n\nThe duration of the anesthetic varies depending on the substance used. Lidocaine is especially short acting, and is therefore usually not used for lameness evaluations. The longer-acting anesthetic [[mepivacaine]] is most-commonly used for nerve blocks,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bidwell | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Brown | first2 = K.

If the anesthetic migrates to the structure that is causing the horse pain, the horse will have a positive block, and the examiner will conclude that the lameness originates in an area that is not actually causing the horse discomfort. False results can also be secondary to practitioner error if the anesthetic is accidentally administered into a location that was unintended, such as a synovial structure rather than around a nerve. Additionally, individual horses have variation in their neural anatomy, and if atypical patterns are present, a given block may block an area unintended by the examiner, leading to false positives.<ref>Sack, WO. \"Nerve distribution in the metacarpus and front digit of the horse\".

These modalities are best applied if the general location of lameness is known from flexion tests and nerve blocks. These methods are both non-invasive and relatively cheap.\n\nRadiographs (\"x-rays\") are made by photons, produced by a generator, that have hit a piece of x-ray film. This film is then exposed to produce an image. The photons that hit the film are actually those that have been reflected, rather than absorbed, by the animal's body. Different tissue types absorb photons to varying degrees, leading to differing levels of darkness ([[radiodensity]]) on the x-ray film. An anatomical structure is delineated by comparing its radiodensity those tissues surrounding it. Interpretation of a radiograph therefore requires the surrounding structures to have enough of a difference in radiodensity to allow it to stand out. While this is obvious in tissue such as bone, soft tissues of the leg do not stand out well on radiographs. Therefore, radiographs are best used to evaluate boney changes rather than soft tissue damage. One exception of this rule is the use of contrast, injected into synovial structures, which allows these structures to stand out on radiographs.<ref>Lamb CR. Contrast radiography of equine joints, tendon sheaths, and draining tracts. The Veterinary Clinics of North America. Equine Practice 1991, 7(2):241\u2013257.</ref> Common uses for radiographs are to evaluate for suspected fractures, bone chips, laminitis, and navicular changes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kaser-Hotz | first1 = B. | last2 = Ueltschi | first2 = G. | year = 1992 | title = Radiographic Appearance of the Navicular Bone in Sound Horses | url = | journal = Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 9\u201317 | doi = 10.1111/j.1740-8261.1992.tb01949 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Widmer | first1 = W.

Different tissues absorb or reflect ultrasonic waves to different degrees, which may be picked up by the machine and turned into an image. Because ultrasound does not easily cross bone or air, it is best used for the evaluation of soft-tissue structures. It is therefore a complementary imaging modality to radiographs, and is most commonly used to look for injury to ligaments and tendons, and the navicular bursa, although muscle damage and arterial blood flow have also been evaluated with ultrasound in cases of lameness.<ref>Genovese RL, Rantanen NW, Hauser ML, Simpson BS. The Veterinary Clinics of North America. Equine Practice [1986, 2(1):145-226]</ref>  Ultrasound is especially useful for determining the size and shape of lesions within structures, allowing quantification of an injury.

The bone scan is often useful for lameness that can't be easily localized to one area, that affects multiple limbs, or lameness that is thought to originate in areas not easily imaged by other means, such as the vertebral column. Although it provides localization for lameness, it does not give a definitive diagnosis.<ref>Winter MD, Berry CR, Reese DJ. Nuclear scintigraphy in horses. Compend Contin Educ Vet. 2010 Dec; 32 (12):E5.</ref> The availability of this modality is more limited relative to radiographs and ultrasound, and usually requires referral to a secondary care facility. Additionally, the horse must stay for a short period of time until it is no longer radioactive.  It is relatively non-invasive, requiring an initial injection of the radioisotope, and sedation throughout the procedure.\n\nThe bone scan offers several advantages over traditional radiographs. In some cases, it may be more sensitive due to the fact that some lesions are only apparent on radiographs after they have become chronic. The bone scan allows imaging of the pelvis, vertebral column, and upper limbs, which are areas that are usually poorly imaged by radiographs on the adult horse, due to their size. It also allows some evaluation of soft tissue, which is generally not imaged well by radiographs.<ref>Steckel RR. The role of scintigraphy in the lameness evaluation. The Veterinary Clinics of North America. Equine Practice 1991, 7(2):207-239.</ref>\n\n===Computed Tomography===\n[[X-ray computed tomography|Computed tomography]] (CT) is an imaging modality that produces a 3-dimensional radiograph. A series of plain radiographs are taken in a spiral around the site of interest, and the individual 2-D radiographs are converted into a 3-D image by a computer. The image may be manipulated to view in different planes, such as cross-section, making it possible to see an injury from multiple perspectives and improving diagnostic capabilities when compared to plain radiographs. Like plain radiographs, CT is not as useful for soft tissue lesions when compared to boney lesions. However, CT requires general anesthesia, and is more costly and less available than plain radiographs, limiting its use in general practice.<ref>Desbrosse, F. G., Vandeweerd, J.-M. E. F., Perrin, R.

Equine Veterinary Education, 20: 93\u201398.</ref> CT provides a large amount of data with exceptional speed, taking only seconds to minutes to complete. When compared to MRI, it is not only significantly faster (MRI takes 1\u20132 hours to produce an image), but also less expensive. Its combination of speed and imaging capabilities makes it beneficial for use prior to orthopedic surgery, especially in the case of complicated fractures, as it allows for visualization from all sides so that the surgeon may determine the best approach and method of correction prior to cutting.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = P.

Like CT, an MRI image may be viewed in various planes of orientation, improving visualization of anatomic structures and any associated pathologic change. MRI is considered the gold standard for diagnosing soft tissue injury within the foot.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S.

Available magnet size restricts imaging to the level of the stifle or elbow, or below. MRI takes a significant amount of time acquire an image, which translates to long anesthesia times and therefore reduces the size of the area that may be imaged in a single session. The area thought to be associated with lameness must be placed in the MRI. MRI is therefore inappropriate for any lameness that can not be localized to a specific region of the limb. Additionally, MRI has limited availability and high cost compared to the other imaging modalities.\n\nHorses may undergo standing MRI, where the horse is sedated and imaged with a low-field magnet (0.27 Tesla), or it may be placed in a high-field magnet (1.5 or 3 Tesla) while under general anesthesia. Low-field magnets produce less resolution<ref>Mitchell RD, Edwards RB, Makkreel LD, Oliveira TD. Standing MRI Lesions Identified in Jumping and Dressage Horses With Lameness Isolated to the Foot. Proc. AAEP, 2006, Vol. 52; 422-426.</ref> and the subtle swaying of the standing horse leads to motion artifact (blurring of the image), especially in the case of the knee or hock, leading to reduced image quality. However, standing MRI tends to be cheaper, and it eliminates the risks of general anesthesia, such as further damage to the injured area or additional injury that may occur during anesthetic recovery.\n\n===Thermography ===\nThermography, or thermal imaging, measures the heat gradient of skin by detection of infrared radiation. Because heat is a cardinal sign of inflammation, thermal imaging can be used to detect inflammation that may be the cause of lameness, and at times discover a subclinical injury.<ref>Eddy AL, Van Hoogmoed LM, Snyder JR. \"The Role of Thermography in the Management of Equine Lameness\". ''The Veterinary Journal''. Vol 162(3); 172-181.</ref> When used, horses must be placed in an area free of sunlight exposure, drafts, or other sources of outside heat, and hair length should be uniform in the area imaged.

In adult horses, septic arthritis or tenosynovitis are most commonly seen secondary to joint injection, penetrating injury, or following surgery, and are often from [[Staphylococcus]] infection.<ref>Schneider, R.

It requires general anesthesia, but allows thorough visualization of the synovial membrane and articular cartilage. Treatment may often be performed at the same time. Arthroscopy is most commonly used for chip fractures of the knee and fetlock joints, osteochondritis dessecans lesions, and proliferative synovitis.<ref>McILWRAITH, C. W.

Other treatment options, such as corrective shoeing, joint injections, and regenerative therapies, are pursued based on the cause of lameness and the financial limits of the owner. Consultation with a [[veterinarian]] is generally recommended, even for mild cases, as some types of lameness may worsen if not properly diagnosed and treated.\n\n==Horseman\u2019s terms for lameness or blemishes==\nVarious horseman's terms have evolved over the years to describe common lamenesses or blemishes (defects that do not cause lameness) in horses.\n\n*[[Bog spavin]]: excessive synovial fluid in the tarsocrural joint, which leads to a large, soft, cool distention on the dorsal surface of the hock.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = O'Meara | first1 = B | year = 2012 | title = Bog spavin: recognizing the problem is the first step toward recovery | url = | journal = Veterinary Record | volume = 170 | issue = | pages = 284\u2013285 }}</ref>\n*[[Bone spavin]]: osteoarthritis of the distal hock joints, which produces lameness and is sometimes seen as a visible, hard swelling on the inside of the hock joint.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gough | first1 = M.

In the horse, it is most commonly caused by pain, but can be due to neurologic or mechanical dysfunction. Lameness is a common veterinary problem in [[racehorse]]s, [[sport horse]]s, and pleasure horses. It is one of the most costly health problems for the equine industry, both monetarily for the cost of diagnosis and treatment, and for the cost of time off resulting in loss-of-use.<ref>Seitzinger AH, Traub-Dargatz JL, Kane AJ, Kopral CA, Morley PS, Garber LP, Losinger WC, & Hill GW. \"Comparison of the Economic Costs of Equine Lameness, Colic, and Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis (EPM)\".

Horses are predisposed to orthopedic lameness by conformational flaws, poor hoof balance, working on poor footing, repetitive movements, poor conditioning for a given activity, and competing at a very high athletic level.<ref name=\"MVM Online\"/>\n\n'''Metabolic''' causes of lameness include [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (equine)|hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] (HYPP) and [[Equine polysaccharide storage myopathy|polysaccharide storage myopathy]], which directly affect muscular function.\n\n'''Circulatory''' causes of lameness occur when blood flow to an area is compromised.

These include problems such as [[cellulitis]], hoof abscesses, and [[septic arthritis]].\n\n===Mechanical lameness===\nMechanical lameness is caused by a physical abnormality, such as scar tissue, that prevents normal motion of a limb. Mechanical lameness does not cause pain. Classic examples of mechanical lameness include upward fixation of the patella and fibrotic myopathy, but any type of adhesion (often secondary to scarring during healing post-injury) or fibrosis can cause mechanical lameness.\n* Upward fixation of the patella occurs when the normal locking mechanism of the stifle, which allows the horse to \"lock\" its hind legs into a fixed position so it may stand with minimal effort, engages at inappropriate times such as when the horse is walking. It results in an inability to flex the stifle, so the horse must walk with an extended hind leg. It is associated with straight hind limb [[equine conformation|conformation]] (post leg), poor muscling of the hind limb, stifle trauma, and genetics.<ref>Tnibar, M. A.

Signs more commonly associated with a neurologic cause include unilateral muscle atrophy, [[paresis]], [[paralysis]], or [[dysmetria]]. Neurologic causes of lameness include:\n\n* Cervical vertebral stenotic myopathy ([[Wobbler disease#Wobbler disease in horses|Wobbler disease]]): compression of the spinal cord in the cervical (neck) region results in lameness, ataxia, and change in gait, especially in the hind legs, and neck stiffness or pain.\n* [[Stringhalt]]: caused by damage to the long digital extensor muscle, or from eating the weed [[Hypochaeris radicata]]; it produces a gait characterized by rapid, spasmodic hyperflexion of the hind limbs.<ref>HUNTINGTON, P.

Radial nerve paralysis will cause a dropped elbow and make it difficult to extend the affected limb. Suprascapular nerve damage will lead to atrophy of the main muscles of the shoulder (sweeny). Femoral nerve paralysis causes hyperflexion of the stifles, hocks, and fetlocks and the horse usually walks on the toe of the hind foot.<ref>DYSON, S., TAYLOR, P. and WHITWELL, K. (1988), Femoral nerve paralysis after general anaesthesia.

Those that commonly alter gait include [[tetanus]], [[botulism]], [[Lyme disease]], [[equine protozoal myeloencephalitis]] (EPM), [[rabies]], [[West Nile virus]], [[eastern equine encephalitis virus|equine encephalitis virus]], and [[equine herpesvirus 1]].\n* [[Neoplasia|Neoplasic]] (cancerous) changes in the brain or around the spinal cord may also cause alterations in gait.\n\n==Signs of lameness==\nManifestations of lameness include any alteration in gait from what is normal for the horse. In general, it is harder to detect hind limb lameness when compared to lameness in a front limb when using visual cues.\n\n===Identifying a front limb lameness===\nThe classic sign of lameness in a front leg is a prominent \"head bob.\" Viewed from the side, the horse raises its head and neck when the lame leg hits the ground, which helps to unload the lame leg. This is sometimes remembered by the adage \"down on sound.\" A head bob is usually easy to see when one leg is lame, but can be subtle in very mild unilateral lameness, or in the case of bilateral front limb lameness.<ref name=MEL/> A horse may also try to reduce impact on a lame front leg by tensing of the muscles of the shoulder. In this case, it will stiffen the limb just before it hits the ground, a sign that may be noticed by an astute observer.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Identifying a hind limb lameness===\nEvaluation of hind limb lameness can be difficult. Generally, the viewer watches the hip, sacrum, gluteal muscles, or hemi-pelvis (pelvis of one side of the body) when examining lameness in the hind end. Examination should be performed both watching the horse from behind while trotting away from the examiner, and from the side as the horse passes.\n\nWhen watching from behind, the viewer often looks for a \"hip hike\" or \"pelvic hike.\" This occurs when the horse raises the pelvis on the lame side as it is bearing weight, trying to shift weight off of the painful leg in a manner similar to raising of the head in front limb lameness. This is a sudden, short upward motion of the hemi-pelvis or gluteal muscles. The hip of the lame leg does not always rise above the level of the hip of the sound leg, which can be confusing to those looking for a \"hip hike.\" Instead, it is an exaggerated upward movement that is watched for during weight bearing. Additionally, horses with a hind limb lameness will tend to reduce the degree of leg use. To do so, some horses will reduce the contraction time of the gluteals on the side of the lame leg, leading to a \"hip roll\" or \"hip dip\" and appearance that the hip drops a greater degree on the side of the lame leg.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nThese apparently contradictory statements (\"hip hike\" vs \"hip drop\" on the lame leg) can be explained by when the horse perceives pain during the stride. If the pain is perceived during the early stance phase of the stride, the horse will try to unweight the leg and produce a \"hip hike.\" If the pain is perceived during the pushoff phase of the stride, the horse does not push with as much force, subsequently reducing the height the pelvis is raised, and leading to a \"dipping\" motion during the swing phase of the stride as the horse brings the limb forward. In some cases, both a hip hike and a hip drop can be seen in the same horse.<ref name=Keegan>Keegan KG. Head Nods and Hip Hikes. Western Veterinary Conference 2013. {{cite web |url=http://www.wvc.org/images/session_notes_2013/2013_EQ21.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229010842/http://www.wvc.org/images/session_notes_2013/2013_EQ21.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-29 }}</ref> Some practitioners simply look for the side with the greater overall deviation, which occurs in the lame leg<ref name=\"MVM Online\"/><ref name=MEL/>\n\nAnother method to detecting hind limb lameness requires watching the pelvis from the side. The entire pelvis is evaluated, and its relative position vertically (relative to the ground) is compared at various points in the stride. The pelvis normally rises and falls with each step. Horses with pain during the early stance phase of the trot will not allow the pelvis to drop as much when the lame leg is weighted, trying to avoid extra weight on the painful leg. Subsequently, the pelvis will not fall as much downward when the lame leg is bearing weight as when the sound leg is bearing weight. When viewed from behind, this is seen as a \"hip hike.\" If the horse is more painful as it is pushing off a limb, it will not push off with as much force, and the pelvis will rise less on the lame side relative to the same point of the stride when the sound leg is on the ground. This is seen as the \"hip roll\" when viewed from behind.<ref name=Keegan/>\n\nOther signs that indicate hind limb lameness include \"plaiting\" with the hind feet, which can be seen in cases of sacro-iliac pain,<ref name=\"SI lesions\"/> carrying the hindquarters to one side or drifting in one direction,<ref name=MEL/><ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\">Dyson SJ.

One method is to look at the relative time a leg spends in the cranial (forward) phase of the stride. For a front leg, this is when the lower leg is in front of the horse, i.e. angled forward, while the caudal phase is when the leg is underneath the horse, i.e. angled backward. For a hind leg, the cranial phase occurs when the lower leg is under the body of the horse, and the caudal phase is when the limb is out behind the body of the horse.\n\nA normal horse with have a cranial phase and a caudal phase of equal length: the horse will bring the leg as far forward as it does backward. In a lame horse, the cranial phase will be shorter when compared to the caudal phase, so it appears to spend more time with the leg backward than it does forward. A shortened cranial phase is most commonly seen in cases of bilateral lameness, lameness of the upper limb (such as shoulder or hip pain), and osteoarthritis of the hocks.<ref name=MEL/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S | year = 1986 | title = Shoulder lameness in horses: An analysis of 58 suspected cases | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 29\u201336 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-3306.1986.tb03531.x }}</ref><ref>Wright, I.M.

It is the first step to evaluate decreased performance in an equine athlete, even if the horse does not appear overtly lame, to rule out any pain-associated cause.\n\nLameness exams are also a key component of the [[equine prepurchase exam|pre-purchase examination]]. These examinations evaluate the horse to give the potential buyer information regarding present soundness of the horse. Veterinarians may comment on aspects that could inhibit the use of the horse for the buyer's intended activity, such as subclinical osteoarthritis or conformational defects. However, the veterinarian is not there to \"pass\" or \"fail\" a horse, but only to give their impression of the horse on that day.<ref name=MEL>{{cite book|last1=Baxter|first1=Gary|title=Manual of Equine Lameness|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-1546-6}}</ref> Therefore, pre-purchase examinations make no guarantees of the future health or soundness of the horse. The pre-purchase exam may range in scope depending on the desire of the buyer, from a simple examination with hoof and flexion tests, to multiple radiographs, ultrasound, and advanced imaging techniques including MRI.\n\n===History===\nA detailed history is the first step of a lameness exam.  \n#Age: Foals are more likely to have infectious causes of lameness ([[septic arthritis]]). Horses just starting training may be lame due to a developmental orthopedic disease, such as osteochondrosis. Older animals are more likely to experience [[osteoarthritis]].<ref name=MEL/>  \n#Breed: Breed-specific diseases, such as [[hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (equine)|hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]] (HYPP), can be ruled out. Additionally, some breeds or types are more prone to certain types of lameness.\n#Discipline: Certain lamenesses are associated with certain uses. For example, racehorses are more likely to have fatigue-related injuries such as stress fractures and injury to the flexor tendons, while western show horses are more likely to suffer from navicular syndrome and English sport horses are more likely to have osteoarthritis or injury to the suspensory ligament.<ref name=MEL/>\n#Past history of lameness: An old injury may be re-injured. In the case of progressive disease, such as osteoarthritis, a horse will often experience recurrent lameness that must be managed. Shifting lameness may suggest a bilateral injury or infectious cause of lameness.\n#Duration and progression the lameness: Acute injury is more common with soft tissue injury. Chronic, progressive disease is more common in cases such as osteoarthritis and navicular disease. \n#Recent changes in management: such as turn-out, exercise level, diet, or shoeing.\n#Effect of exercise on degree of lameness.<ref name=MEL/>\n#Any treatment implemented, including rest.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Physical examination and palpation===\n[[Image:Zippo 09.JPG|thumb|upright|100px|Splints can be palpated on physical examination.]]\nOne of the first steps of the lameness examination is to evaluate the horse at rest. A good evaluation of [[equine conformation|conformation]], including overall body type, can help the practitioner determine the potential cause of lameness. Certain conformational defects can predispose a horse to injury, and knowledge of correct conformation can help narrow down possible causes of injury, especially when combined with the horse's history. The horse's stance is also evaluated. Frequently resting a particular leg, \"pointing\" a foot (holding a leg out in front of the body), or standing in an abnormal position can indicate compensation for an injury. Shifting of weight is normal in the hind legs, but frequent shifting of weight in the front legs, or placing both front feet in front of the body, can indicate bilateral forelimb lameness.<ref name=MEL/> Stifle pain sometimes causes a horse to stand with the stifles rotated out.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/> Hip and pelvic pain can produce a toe-out, stifle out, hock-in stance and that remains present at the walk.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nAsymmetry of the muscular structure, due to muscle atrophy, usually occurs on the side of the lame limb. Hind limb lameness or pelvic fracture can cause unilateral atrophy of the middle gluteal or gracilis muscles.<ref name=MEL/> Damage to the suprascapular nerve can lead to atrophy of the muscles of the shoulder (supraspinatus and infraspinatus). Neck muscle atrophy can be seen with cervical vertebral malformation (Wobbler's disease), articular facet osteoarthritis, and neurologic causes of lameness.<ref name=MEL/> Asymmetry in a limb can also occur due to swelling of a joint or soft tissue. For this reason, each leg should be compared to its partner.\n\nAfter a visual exam, the practitioner [[palpate]]s the horse, feeling for heat, swelling, and sensitivity to pressure indicating pain. Palpation is usually most thoroughly performed in the lower limb, but a comprehensive exam will include palpation of the back, pelvis, and neck. Joints should be palpated for pain, effusion of joint pouches, thickening of the joint capsule, and checked for range of motion. Major ligaments and tendons, such as the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, inferior check ligament, suspensory ligament, and distal sesamoidean ligaments, should also be palpated along their entire length. Individual bones may be palpated if injury is suspected, such as a fracture, bucked shins in racehorses (cannon bones), or splints (splint bones).<ref name=MEL/>\n\nSpecialized manipulative tests can be used to help identify specific areas of pain:\n* The Churchill test: pressure is applied to the plantar surface of the head of the medial splint bone. A painful horse will flex and abduct the limb, indicating hock pain.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Peroneus tertius rupture: The hock is pulled into extension while the stifle is flexed. A positive test (the ability to extend the hock) indicates a ruptured peroneus tertius muscle.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Patella displacement: the patella is pushed laterally and proximally, to test for upward fixation of the patella.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Cruciate test: the examiner moves the tibia sharply caudally, to feel for movement away from the femur or [[crepitus]]. Excessive movement can indicate cruciate rupture.<ref name=MEL/>\n* Test for stifle collateral ligament damage: the stifle is held still, while the distal limb is abducted (to test for damage to the medial collateral ligament) or adducted (to test for lateral collateral ligament damage). Excessive movement by the distal limb relative to the stifle suggests rupture of the collateral ligament. Sprain of these ligaments can be evaluated by repeating this test multiple times, before trotting the horse off an looking for lameness.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Evaluation of the hoof===\nThe majority of lameness originates in the hoof. For this reason, the hoof is closely scrutinized in shape, balance, shoeing, wear pattern, and for the presence of cracks, and contracted or sheared heels.\n\n[[Image:Halfarabianwithhighheel.jpg|thumb|right|Chronic lameness often causes an upright hoof capsule.]]\nChronic lameness will change the shape of the hoof capsule, since the lame limb is not weighted as much as its partner, making the capsule more upright, narrow, with a higher heel on the lame limb and more flattened on the sound one.<ref name=MEL/> Hoof or horseshoe wear can indicate breakover and if the horse is dragging its toes. Change in shape of the hoof wall is also common in horses suffering from laminitis. \"Founder rings,\" or thickened concentric rings in the hoof wall, indicate a past episode of laminitis. Concavity of the dorsal (front) surface of the hoof can indicate chronic laminitis. The sole may become convex if the coffin bone begins to push through the bottom of the hoof.<ref>Lucas, Don (1963) \"Laminitis,\" Iowa State University Veterinarian: Vol. 26: Iss. 3, Article 7. \nAvailable at: http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/iowastate_veterinarian/vol26/iss3/7</ref>\n\nCorrect hoof balance allows for even distribution of forces through the leg and hoof. Poor hoof balance, due to conformational flaws or poor trimming, can cause lameness from musculoskeletal injury,<ref>Wilson, A. M., Seelig, T. J., Shield, R. A. and Silverman, B. W. (1998), The effect of foot imbalance on point of force application in the horse. \"Equine Veterinary Journal\", 30: 540\u2013545. {{doi|10.1111/j.2042-3306.1998.tb04531}}</ref> and poor hoof balance has been associated with increased risk of catastrophic injury in racehorses.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kane | first1 = AJ | last2 = Stover | first2 = SM | last3 = Gardner | first3 = IA | last4 = Bock | first4 = KB | last5 = Case | first5 = JT | last6 = Johnson | first6 = BJ | last7 = Anderson | first7 = ML | last8 = Barr | first8 = BC | last9 = Daft | first9 = BM | last10 = Kinde | first10 = H | last11 = Larochelle | first11 = D | last12 = Moore | first12 = J | last13 = Mysore | first13 = J | last14 = Stoltz | first14 = J | last15 = Woods | first15 = L | last16 = Read | first16 = DH | last17 = Ardans | first17 = AA | year = 1998 | title = Hoof size, shape, and balance as possible risk factors for catastrophic musculoskeletal injury of Thoroughbred racehorses | url = | journal = American Journal of Veterinary Research | volume = 59 | issue = 12| pages = 1545\u20131552 }}</ref> Side-to-side (mediolateral) imbalance can cause sheared heals and hoof cracks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van Heel | first1 = M.

Long toes force the horse to pivot (break over) further forward over the toe. The toe acts as a lever arm, and its increased length makes it harder for the heels to rotate off the ground. This increases strain on the deep digital flexor tendon and the ligaments of the navicular bone.<ref name=MEL/>\n\n[[Image:Absces.JPG|thumb|right|An abscess has ruptured out of the coronary band of this horse.]]\nThe bottom of the hoof should also be examined. The shape of the sole, size of the frog, and shape of the bars can indicate overall health of the hoof. Holes in heel bulb usually indicate a hoof abscess that has ruptured.<ref name=MEL/> The horse's shoeing can also provide clues to the examiner. The application of corrective shoes or pads may indicate past problems requiring special shoeing. This can be especially helpful during the pre-purchase exam, when the lameness history of the horse may not be readily available.\n\nDigital pulse evaluation is important when addressing the hoof. An increased digital pulse often indicates that the lesion is in the foot, and are usually most significantly increased in horses with [[laminitis]]. The coronary band may also be palpated. Cool swelling can indicate coffin joint effusion, swelling with an increase in temperature can indicate laminitis, firm swelling can occur with [[ringbone]], and a localized swelling with pain can indicate an abscess.<ref name=MEL/>\n\nExaminers will also \"hoof test\" each foot by applying a metal instrument that squeezes the foot to test for deep pain. Diffuse sensitivity occurs with fracture or infection of the coffin bone, and laminitis. More localized sensitivity can be found with sole bruises, puncture wounds, hoof abscesses, and hot nails. Sensitivity over the middle third of the frog is consistent with navicular syndrome, but can also occur with sheared heels. To distinguish these two, the hoof testers may be applied over the heels, which will be sensitive in the case of any heel-related pain, such as sheared, contracted, or bruised heels.<ref name=MEL/> The hoof wall may also be percussed (struck with a hammer), which will produce a positive response in cases of hoof cracks that are causing the horse pain, laminitis, or a gravel (hoof abscess travelling up the hoof wall towards the coronary band).<ref name=MEL/>\n\n===Evaluation in motion===\n[[File:80 tarkastuksessa.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Horses are usually trotted on a straight line to evaluate lameness.]]\nThe horse is evaluated in motion, usually at the walk and trot, but occasionally also in the canter. The walk is often the best gait to evaluate foot placement.<ref name=MEL/> The trot is generally the best gait to localize the lameness to a particular leg, because it is a symmetrical gait where the front half of the horse and the back half move in unison.<ref name=Keegan/> The canter may also be used for lameness evaluation. Resistance to picking up the canter or to engage the hind end can suggest pain in the sacro-iliac joint, pelvis, or hind leg.\n\nLameness may be accentuated under certain conditions. Therefore, the moving examination is often performed both in a straight line and on a circle, and may be repeated on different footings. Hard footing tends to make joint and bone injury more apparent, while soft, deep footings tend to accentuate soft tissue injury. Circles may accentuate a lameness when the lame leg is on the inside or outside of the circle.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/><ref>Starke, Sandra D., et al. \"Vertical head and trunk movement adaptations of sound horses trotting in a circle on a hard surface.\" ''The Veterinary Journal'' 2012; 193(1): 73\u2013-80.</ref>\n\nAt times, it may be helpful to evaluate the horse under saddle, since the weight of the rider can accentuate lameness.<ref name=\"Dyson Stifle\"/> In cases of decreased performance, it can be useful to watch a horse performing certain discipline-specific movements, which may be the only time the rider notices a change in the horse's abilities.\n\nGait is evaluated for symmetry. This includes the overall fluidity of the horse's motion, length of stride, loading of a leg, how the hoof lands on the ground (flat, toe, or heel-first), range of motion of the joints, deviations in body position, and position of the head and neck.\n\nThe first evaluation of the horse is used to determine the severity of lameness and to help pinpoint which part of the body may be affected. The process of watching a horse move is repeated after each additional flexion test or nerve block to determine its effect on the animal.\n\n===Grading lameness===\nLameness is graded on a scale. This allows the practitioner to help quantify a lameness in order to determine relative severity, assess the degree of change after flexion tests or nerve blocks, and to determine the improvement of lameness over time once treatment has been implemented. The most commonly used scale in the United States is a 1\u2013-5 scale of the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP). Other scales are more commonly used outside of the United States, including a 1\u201310 scale in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = Can lameness be graded reliably? | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Journal | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 379\u2013382 | doi = 10.1111/j.2042-3306.2011.00391 }}</ref>\n\n'''AAEP Lameness Grading Scale'''\n{{Unbulleted list|Grade 0: lameness is not perceptible under any circumstances|Grade 1: lameness is difficult to observe and not consistently apparent under any circumstances|Grade 2: the lameness is consistently apparent under certain circumstances (specific surfaces, on an incline, circling, under saddle, etc), but difficult to observe at a walk or trot on a straight line|Grade 3: the lameness is consistently apparent at the trot under all circumstances|Grade 4: the lameness is apparent at the walk|Grade 5: the horse is minimally or non-weight bearing on the limb, or unable to move}}\n\nNon-weight bearing lameness (grade 5) is most commonly the result of a hoof abscess. While very painful, most hoof abscesses are quite treatable and do not cause long-term lameness. However, fractures and septic synovial structures (such as an infected joint pouch or tendon sheath) can also cause non-weight bearing lameness, and require emergency evaluation and treatment by a veterinarian. Therefore, non-weight bearing lameness should be assessed by an equine professional in a timely manner, especially if it is associated with trauma, laceration, or recent joint injection.\n\n===Flexion tests===\n{{Main|Flexion test}}\n\nFlexion tests are a diagnostic tool involving the application of sustained pressure on a particular set of joints. The limb is forcibly flexed for between 30 seconds and 3 minutes,<ref name=\"Ramey AAEP\">Ramey, DW. \"Prospective Evaluation of Forelimb Flexion Tests in Practice: Clinical Response, Radiographic Correlations, and Predictive Value\nfor Future Lameness\". Proc. AAEP, 1997, Vol. 43; 116-119.</ref> depending on the joint and practitioner preference, and the horse is immediately trotted off.  An increase in lameness following a flexion test suggests that those joints or surrounding soft tissue structures may be a source of pain for the horse. Flexion tests help narrow down the source of lameness to a certain part of the leg, but they are non-specific because they almost always affect more than one joint and because they also affect the soft tissue structures around the joint, not just the joint itself.<ref name=MEL/> Additionally, they must be interpreted carefully due to the risk of false negatives and false positives.\n\n===Regional limb anesthesia (nerve blocks)===\nNerve blocks involve injecting a small amount of local anesthetic around a nerve or into a [[synovial membrane|synovial structure]] (such as a joint or tendon sheath) in order to block the perception of pain in a specific area. After the substance is injected, it is given a few minutes to take effect. The block is then tested by pushing a blunt object, such as a ballpoint pen, into the area that is supposed to be desensitized. If the horse does not react to this pressure, the area is desensitized, and the horse is trotted to see if the lameness has improved. Improvement indicates that the cause of lameness was from a structure desensitized by the nerve block.\n\nNerve blocks are performed in a step-wise fashion, beginning at the most [[distal]] (lower) part of the limb and moving upward. This is due to the fact that blocking a nerve higher up will desensitize everything it innervates distal to the blocking location. For example, blocking the leg at the level of the fetlock will also block the entire foot, since the nerve fibers that innervate the foot are inhibited when they travel through the fetlock area. A positive result from this block will not be able to differentiate foot pain from pain in the pastern or fetlock region. More information may be gained from blocking the foot first, then the fetlock, since it allows for greater specificity in determining the cause of lameness.\n\nThe duration of the anesthetic varies depending on the substance used. Lidocaine is especially short acting, and is therefore usually not used for lameness evaluations. The longer-acting anesthetic [[mepivacaine]] is most-commonly used for nerve blocks,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bidwell | first1 = L. A. | last2 = Brown | first2 = K.

If the anesthetic migrates to the structure that is causing the horse pain, the horse will have a positive block, and the examiner will conclude that the lameness originates in an area that is not actually causing the horse discomfort. False results can also be secondary to practitioner error if the anesthetic is accidentally administered into a location that was unintended, such as a synovial structure rather than around a nerve. Additionally, individual horses have variation in their neural anatomy, and if atypical patterns are present, a given block may block an area unintended by the examiner, leading to false positives.<ref>Sack, WO. \"Nerve distribution in the metacarpus and front digit of the horse\".

These modalities are best applied if the general location of lameness is known from flexion tests and nerve blocks. These methods are both non-invasive and relatively cheap.\n\nRadiographs (\"x-rays\") are made by photons, produced by a generator, that have hit a piece of x-ray film. This film is then exposed to produce an image. The photons that hit the film are actually those that have been reflected, rather than absorbed, by the animal's body. Different tissue types absorb photons to varying degrees, leading to differing levels of darkness ([[radiodensity]]) on the x-ray film. An anatomical structure is delineated by comparing its radiodensity those tissues surrounding it. Interpretation of a radiograph therefore requires the surrounding structures to have enough of a difference in radiodensity to allow it to stand out. While this is obvious in tissue such as bone, soft tissues of the leg do not stand out well on radiographs. Therefore, radiographs are best used to evaluate boney changes rather than soft tissue damage. One exception of this rule is the use of contrast, injected into synovial structures, which allows these structures to stand out on radiographs.<ref>Lamb CR. Contrast radiography of equine joints, tendon sheaths, and draining tracts. The Veterinary Clinics of North America. Equine Practice 1991, 7(2):241\u2013257.</ref> Common uses for radiographs are to evaluate for suspected fractures, bone chips, laminitis, and navicular changes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kaser-Hotz | first1 = B. | last2 = Ueltschi | first2 = G. | year = 1992 | title = Radiographic Appearance of the Navicular Bone in Sound Horses | url = | journal = Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 9\u201317 | doi = 10.1111/j.1740-8261.1992.tb01949 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Widmer | first1 = W.

Different tissues absorb or reflect ultrasonic waves to different degrees, which may be picked up by the machine and turned into an image. Because ultrasound does not easily cross bone or air, it is best used for the evaluation of soft-tissue structures. It is therefore a complementary imaging modality to radiographs, and is most commonly used to look for injury to ligaments and tendons, and the navicular bursa, although muscle damage and arterial blood flow have also been evaluated with ultrasound in cases of lameness.<ref>Genovese RL, Rantanen NW, Hauser ML, Simpson BS. The Veterinary Clinics of North America. Equine Practice [1986, 2(1):145-226]</ref>  Ultrasound is especially useful for determining the size and shape of lesions within structures, allowing quantification of an injury.

The bone scan is often useful for lameness that can't be easily localized to one area, that affects multiple limbs, or lameness that is thought to originate in areas not easily imaged by other means, such as the vertebral column. Although it provides localization for lameness, it does not give a definitive diagnosis.<ref>Winter MD, Berry CR, Reese DJ. Nuclear scintigraphy in horses. Compend Contin Educ Vet. 2010 Dec; 32 (12):E5.</ref> The availability of this modality is more limited relative to radiographs and ultrasound, and usually requires referral to a secondary care facility. Additionally, the horse must stay for a short period of time until it is no longer radioactive.  It is relatively non-invasive, requiring an initial injection of the radioisotope, and sedation throughout the procedure.\n\nThe bone scan offers several advantages over traditional radiographs. In some cases, it may be more sensitive due to the fact that some lesions are only apparent on radiographs after they have become chronic. The bone scan allows imaging of the pelvis, vertebral column, and upper limbs, which are areas that are usually poorly imaged by radiographs on the adult horse, due to their size. It also allows some evaluation of soft tissue, which is generally not imaged well by radiographs.<ref>Steckel RR. The role of scintigraphy in the lameness evaluation. The Veterinary Clinics of North America. Equine Practice 1991, 7(2):207-239.</ref>\n\n===Computed Tomography===\n[[X-ray computed tomography|Computed tomography]] (CT) is an imaging modality that produces a 3-dimensional radiograph. A series of plain radiographs are taken in a spiral around the site of interest, and the individual 2-D radiographs are converted into a 3-D image by a computer. The image may be manipulated to view in different planes, such as cross-section, making it possible to see an injury from multiple perspectives and improving diagnostic capabilities when compared to plain radiographs. Like plain radiographs, CT is not as useful for soft tissue lesions when compared to boney lesions. However, CT requires general anesthesia, and is more costly and less available than plain radiographs, limiting its use in general practice.<ref>Desbrosse, F. G., Vandeweerd, J.-M. E. F., Perrin, R.

When compared to MRI, it is not only significantly faster (MRI takes 1\u20132 hours to produce an image), but also less expensive. Its combination of speed and imaging capabilities makes it beneficial for use prior to orthopedic surgery, especially in the case of complicated fractures, as it allows for visualization from all sides so that the surgeon may determine the best approach and method of correction prior to cutting.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = P.

Like CT, an MRI image may be viewed in various planes of orientation, improving visualization of anatomic structures and any associated pathologic change.

Available magnet size restricts imaging to the level of the stifle or elbow, or below. MRI takes a significant amount of time acquire an image, which translates to long anesthesia times and therefore reduces the size of the area that may be imaged in a single session. The area thought to be associated with lameness must be placed in the MRI. MRI is therefore inappropriate for any lameness that can not be localized to a specific region of the limb. Additionally, MRI has limited availability and high cost compared to the other imaging modalities.\n\nHorses may undergo standing MRI, where the horse is sedated and imaged with a low-field magnet (0.27 Tesla), or it may be placed in a high-field magnet (1.5 or 3 Tesla) while under general anesthesia. Low-field magnets produce less resolution<ref>Mitchell RD, Edwards RB, Makkreel LD, Oliveira TD. Standing MRI Lesions Identified in Jumping and Dressage Horses With Lameness Isolated to the Foot. Proc. AAEP, 2006, Vol. 52; 422-426.</ref> and the subtle swaying of the standing horse leads to motion artifact (blurring of the image), especially in the case of the knee or hock, leading to reduced image quality. However, standing MRI tends to be cheaper, and it eliminates the risks of general anesthesia, such as further damage to the injured area or additional injury that may occur during anesthetic recovery.\n\n===Thermography ===\nThermography, or thermal imaging, measures the heat gradient of skin by detection of infrared radiation. Because heat is a cardinal sign of inflammation, thermal imaging can be used to detect inflammation that may be the cause of lameness, and at times discover a subclinical injury.<ref>Eddy AL, Van Hoogmoed LM, Snyder JR. \"The Role of Thermography in the Management of Equine Lameness\".

''AAEP, 2002, Vol. 48; 337-342.</ref> \n*Founder ([[laminitis]]): a very painful condition resulting from the inflammation of the laminae within the hoof, leading to rotation of the coffin bone.\n*[[Navicular disease]] or navicular syndrome: a catch-all phrase used to describe pain in the palmar hoof which was originally attributed to damage to the navicular bone. MRI has since shown that navicular syndrome may be caused by damage to any of the structures within the hoof, including the navicular bone, the navicular bursa, the coffin joint, the deep digital flexor tendon, and various ligamentous supportive structures.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dyson | first1 = S. | last2 = Murray | first2 = R. | last3 = Schramme | first3 = M. | last4 = Blunden | first4 = T. | year = 2011 | title = Current concepts of navicular disease | url = | journal = Equine Veterinary Education | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 27\u201339 }}</ref> \n*[[Osselet]]s: swelling on the front surface of the fetlock joints of the front legs, caused by traumatic arthritis of the fetlock joints.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Briggs|first1=Karen|title=Osselets (Traumatic Arthritis of the Fetlock)|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/10119/osselets-traumatic-arthritis-of-the-fetlock|website=TheHorse.com|accessdate=2017-12-29|language=en|date=1 September 2000}}</ref>\n*[[Ringbone]]: boney proliferation around the pastern. May be articular (osteoarthritis) or non-articular. The articular forms can affect the pastern or coffin joints, and can cause lameness.\n*Shoe boil: see \"capped joint\"\n*[[Sidebone]]: ossification of the collateral cartilages of the hoof secondary to chronic concussion, may be palpated on just above the coronary band on either side of the hoof. Rarely causes lameness, therefore considered a blemish.<ref name=MEL/>\n*[[Splints]]: bony enlargements in the area of the splint bone, most commonly on the inside of the front leg, but sometimes on the outside of the front leg or on a hind leg. They are caused by trauma to the split bone itself or the ligament between the splint bone and cannon bone. Acutely, there may be no visible swelling but the horse will be painful on palpation, and lame. Once healed, the boney swelling is cool to the touch and considered a blemish.<ref name=MEL/>\n*[[Stocking up]]: Edema (fluid) retained in the lower legs due to reduced lymphatic drainage, often because the horse is sedentary for long periods (such as when stalled) but occasionally due to pathology. It is cool to the touch, and usually decreases or resolves with exercise. It is considered a blemish.\n*Sweeney (shoulder sweeny): a loss of muscle of the shoulder. It is due to atrophy of the supraspinatous and infraspinatus muscles, secondary to damage to the suprascapular nerve, which innervates these muscles.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carmona | first1 = J | last2 = Lopez | first2 = C | year = | title = Autologous Platelet Concentrates as a Treatment for Shoulder Injury in a Horse | url = | journal = J.

He joined [[Trabzonspor]], the major team in the area. Tekke was still in his teens when he started to appear in the first team. In 45 matches that he played between 1994\u20131997, he scored 6 goals. At the beginning of the 1997\u20131998 season he was loaned out to [[Altay SK]] of [[\u0130zmir]], where he scored 8 goals in 24 matches. In a 4\u20135 defeat to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], he scored a hat-trick. However a few weeks later he broke his leg and was out of the game for six months. Upon his return to Trabzonspor, Tekke played another 38 matches and scored 6 goals before he transferred to [[Gaziantepspor]] in the summer of 2000. In this period he made his first appearance for the [[Turkish national football team|Turkish national team]].\n\nIn 2002, Tekke returned to Trabzonspor and was given the captaincy. This was the time Tekke reached the peak of his career. In the 2004\u201305 season he managed to become the league's top goal scorer with 31 goals, 7 goals ahead of the second placed player and was second for the [[Golden Foot]]. During his spell with Trabzonspor, he won two medals for winning the [[Turkish Cup]] in consecutive seasons.\n\n===Russia===\nIn July 2006, he signed for [[FC Zenit St. Petersburg|Zenit St. Petersburg]]. On 6 August 2006, Tekke scored on his debut for the club, as he came off the bench against [[FC Shinnik Yaroslavl|Shinnik Yaroslavl]] and scored the only goal of the game for his team to win 1\u20130. Tekke scored the winning goal in the [[UEFA Cup]] group stage in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Athlitiki Enosi Larissa F.C.|AE Larissa]]. He assisted the second in the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final]] win over [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. On 21 October 2008, Tekke scored in the 1\u20131 draw with [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] in the Champions League. On 3 February 2010, Tekke signed a three-year contract with [[FC Rubin Kazan]]. He only played five games before he decided to return to Turkey, transferring to [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]].\n\n===Back to Turkey===\nOn 1 September 2010, Tekke signed a two-year contract with [[Besiktas JK]]. However, he was only able to play a total of two games before he was sent to [[Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc]], in the 2010\u201311 transfer window. In the five matches he played for Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc, he scored three goals. In the summer transfer season of 2011, the newly promoted team, [[Orduspor]], declared that they had purchased Tekke from Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc. Tekke was given the number 23 and the captaincy of the team. He then moved to Orduspor and retired soon after. He then became a manager.\n\n==International career==\nTekke was in the Turkish national squad for U15, U16, U17, U18, U21, and for the [[Turkish national football team|Turkish national team]].

[[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Association football|football]] coach and former player who is currently the manager of [[\u0130stanbulspor]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Turkey===\nTekke was born in the small town of [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcba\u015f\u0131, Trabzon|K\u00f6pr\u00fcba\u015f\u0131]], in the province of [[Trabzon Province|Trabzon]]. He joined [[Trabzonspor]], the major team in the area. Tekke was still in his teens when he started to appear in the first team. In 45 matches that he played between 1994\u20131997, he scored 6 goals. At the beginning of the 1997\u20131998 season he was loaned out to [[Altay SK]] of [[\u0130zmir]], where he scored 8 goals in 24 matches. In a 4\u20135 defeat to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], he scored a hat-trick. However a few weeks later he broke his leg and was out of the game for six months. Upon his return to Trabzonspor, Tekke played another 38 matches and scored 6 goals before he transferred to [[Gaziantepspor]] in the summer of 2000. In this period he made his first appearance for the [[Turkish national football team|Turkish national team]].\n\nIn 2002, Tekke returned to Trabzonspor and was given the captaincy. This was the time Tekke reached the peak of his career. In the 2004\u201305 season he managed to become the league's top goal scorer with 31 goals, 7 goals ahead of the second placed player and was second for the [[Golden Foot]]. During his spell with Trabzonspor, he won two medals for winning the [[Turkish Cup]] in consecutive seasons.\n\n===Russia===\nIn July 2006, he signed for [[FC Zenit St. Petersburg|Zenit St. Petersburg]]. On 6 August 2006, Tekke scored on his debut for the club, as he came off the bench against [[FC Shinnik Yaroslavl|Shinnik Yaroslavl]] and scored the only goal of the game for his team to win 1\u20130. Tekke scored the winning goal in the [[UEFA Cup]] group stage in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Athlitiki Enosi Larissa F.C.|AE Larissa]]. He assisted the second in the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final]] win over [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. On 21 October 2008, Tekke scored in the 1\u20131 draw with [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE Borisov]] in the Champions League. On 3 February 2010, Tekke signed a three-year contract with [[FC Rubin Kazan]]. He only played five games before he decided to return to Turkey, transferring to [[Be\u015fikta\u015f]].\n\n===Back to Turkey===\nOn 1 September 2010, Tekke signed a two-year contract with [[Besiktas JK]]. However, he was only able to play a total of two games before he was sent to [[Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc]], in the 2010\u201311 transfer window. In the five matches he played for Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc, he scored three goals. In the summer transfer season of 2011, the newly promoted team, [[Orduspor]], declared that they had purchased Tekke from Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc. Tekke was given the number 23 and the captaincy of the team. He then moved to Orduspor and retired soon after. He then became a manager.\n\n==International career==\nTekke was in the Turkish national squad for U15, U16, U17, U18, U21, and for the [[Turkish national football team|Turkish national team]]. For U15, he played 6 matches and scored no goals.
