{"title_page": "Culture of Montenegro", "text_new": "{{Culture of Montenegro}}\n\nThe '''culture of [[Montenegro]]''' is as pluralistic and diverse as its [[History of Montenegro|history]] and [[Geography of Montenegro|geographical position]] would suggest. Montenegro's culture has drawn influences mainly from [[Ancient Greece| ]][[Ancient Rome]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Republic of Venice]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and [[Yugoslavia]].\n\n==Values and norms==\n[[File:The convent Cetinje Montenegro.jpg|thumb|right|380px|The convent in [[Cetinje]], [[Old Montenegro]] in 1889]]\n===Ethical beliefs and laws===\nA very important dimension of [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] culture is the [[Ethics|ethical]] ideal of ''\u010cojstvo i Juna\u0161tvo'', roughly translated as \"Humanity and Courage\", an ancient Montenegrin code of honor. Another result of its centuries long [[warrior]] history, it is the unwritten code of [[Chivalry]] that stipulates that to deserve a true respect of its people, a person has to show virtues of [[integrity]], [[dignity]], [[humility]], [[self-sacrifice]] for the just cause, [[respect]] for others, and [[Wiktionary:Rectitude|Rectitude]] along with the [[bravery]]. In the old days of battle, it resulted in Montenegrins fighting to the death, as being captured was considered the greatest [[shame]]. This code of conduct is still very much ingrained, to greater or lesser extent, in every Montenegrin's ethical beliefs system and it is essential that it be kept in mind in order to truly understand them.\n\nA Montenegrin tradition made into law in Montenegro by [[King Nikola]] during his reign, consisting of newly-weds planting an [[olive tree]] on their wedding day as a symbol of marriage.\n\nThe infamous Montenegrin traditional law of vendetta, known as \"[[Krvna Osveta]]\", where one Montenegrin must take revenge on whoever killed his relative by killing the murderer or one of the murderer's close relatives, similar to the Albanian \"Gjakmarrje\".\n\n===Religion and faith===\nMontenegrin society is still very partiarchal and conservative. According to the 2011 census, the vast majority of more than 96% of Montenegrin residents declare themselves as members of some religious organization. While Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religious denomination in Montenegro, there are also sizable numbers of adherents of both Catholic Christianity and Islam. The dominant Church is the Serbian Orthodox Church although traces of a forming Montenegrin Orthodox Church are present. \n\n===Traditions and customs===\nThe [[Slava]] is exclusive custom of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] believers, each family has one patron saint that they venerate on their feast day. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the traditional Julian calendar, as per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls currently on January 7 of the Gregorian calendar, thus the Serbs celebrate Christmas on January 7, shared with the Orthodox churches of Jerusalem, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and the Greek Old Calendarists. \n\nThe [[badnjak]] is a tree branch or young tree brought into the house and placed on the fire on the evening of [[Christmas Eve]], a central tradition in Eastern Orthodox Christmas celebrations in Montenegro. The tree from which the badnjak is cut, preferably a young and straight Austrian oak, is ceremonially felled early on the morning of Christmas Eve. The felling, preparation, bringing in, and laying on the fire, are surrounded by elaborate rituals, with many regional variations. \n\n==Tradition==\n[[File:Montenegrin Herzegovinian costume.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Male folk costume from Montenegro]]\n\n===Folk dances===\nThe traditional folk dance is a circle dance called [[kolo]], which is common among Montenegrins, [[Serbs]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]]. It is a collective dance, where a group of people (usually several dozen, at the very least three) hold each other by the hands or around the waist dancing, forming a circle (hence the name), semicircle or spiral. It is called [[Oro (eagle dance)|Oro]] (or the \"Eagle dance\") in Montenegro. Similar circle dances also exist in other cultures of the region. \n\n===Epic songs===\nMontenegrins' long-standing history of struggle for freedom and independence is invariably linked with strong traditions of oral [[epic poetry]]. Traditionally, they are delivered to the audience accompanied by the music produced by a [[gusle]], a one-string instrument played by the story-teller (''guslar''), who sings or recites the stories of heroes and battles in [[Decasyllable|decasyllabic verse]]. Historically, these songs have had an immense motivational power over the population. The guslars commanded almost as much respect as the best of [[warrior]]s, as they were as much the authors, thus history writers, as they were interpreters. Presently, these traditions are somewhat livelier in the northern parts of the country (also shared with people in eastern [[Herzegovina]], western [[Serbia]], and central [[Dalmatia]]).\n\n===Montenegrin names===\nThere are many Montenegrin names unique to the Montenegrin people which display the distinct culture of the Montenegrins. \n\nFor an extensive list see: \n[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Montenegrin_given_names Montenegrin given names].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Montenegrin cuisine}}\n[[File:Foods from Montenegro.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Foods from Montenegro]]\nMontenegrin cuisine is a result of Montenegro's geographic position and its long history. The traditional dishes of Montenegro's heartland, and its [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]] have a distinctively [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] flavour which shows in the [[bread]]-making style, the way [[meat]] is cured and dried, [[cheese]]-making, [[wine]] and [[Distilled beverage|spirits]], the [[soup]] and [[stew]] making style, [[polenta]], stuffed [[capsicums]], [[meatball]]s, priganice, [[Dolma|japraci]], [[Collard greens|ra\u0161tan]], etc. \n\nThe second large influence came from the [[Levant]] and [[Turkish cuisine|Turkey]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], [[Moussaka|musaka]], [[Pilaf|pilav]], [[pita]], [[burek]], [[\u0107evapi]], [[kebab]], Turkish sweets like [[baklava]] and [[tulumba]], etc. [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]] dishes include [[goulash]], satarash, and djuvech, which are also very common. Last but not least, [[Croatian cuisine]] made its mark mostly in the desserts department. \n\nAdditionally [[cr\u00eapes]], [[doughnuts]], [[jam]], myriad types of [[biscuits]] and [[cakes]], all make a contribution to the average Montenegrin's waist-line. [[Vienna]]-style bread is the most prevalent type of bread in the shops.\n\nMontenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from the one in the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of [[Mediterranean cuisine]], with [[seafood]] being a common dish.\n\n==Architecture==\n{{Main|Architecture of Montenegro}}\nMontenegro has a number of significant cultural and historical sites, including heritage sites from the pre-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Baroque]] periods. The Montenegrin coastal region is especially well known for its religious monuments, mostly related to [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] architecture, including the [[Cathedral of Saint Tryphon]], the [[basilica]] of [[St. Luke]] (over 800 years), Our Lady of the Rock (''\u0160krpjela''), the [[Savina monastery (Montenegro)|Savina Monastery]], and others. The ancient city of ''Cattaro'' (now called [[Kotor]]) is listed on the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage list, even as a perfect example of the Venetian architecture. The [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] influence in architecture, and in religious artwork is especially apparent in the country's interior.\n\n==Literature==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; float:right; margin-right:9px; margin-left:2px;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[File:Oktoih petoglasnik iz 1494. eksponat iz zbirke Pedago\u0161kog muzeja u Beogradu.jpg|200px]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[File:Be\u010dko izdanje Gorskog vijenca 1847.png|250px]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Cetinje Octoechos]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[The Mountain Wreath]]\n|}\n''Montenegrin literature'' refers to the entire (historical and modern) corpus of [[literature]] created in [[Montenegro]], written mainly in [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and other related languages spoken in the country\n\n===Characteristics===\nAlthough there are works written at least 800 years ago (like the [[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]]), the most important representatives are writers who lived in 19th and 20th century and wrote mainly in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The first literary works written in the region are ten centuries old, and the first Montenegrin book was printed five hundreds years ago. \n\nIn [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] Cattaro (actual [[Kotor]]) there were a group of writers and poets that introduced [[Renaissance]] culture in [[Albania Veneta|coastal Montenegro]], writing in [[Latin]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]: [[Ludovico Pasquali]], [[Giovanni Bona de Boliris]], Giovanni Polizza, Giorgio Bisanti, Girolamo Pima, Timoteo Cisilla, Giovanni Crussala, Giuseppe Bronza and Girolamo Panizzola.\n\nThe first state-owned printing press ([[Printing House of Crnojevi\u0107i]]) was located in [[Cetinje]] in 1494, where the first [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] book was printed the same year ([[Oktoih]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Montenegro#ref887673|title=Montenegro|publisher=[[Britannica Encyclopaedia]]|accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref> A number of medieval manuscripts, dating from the 13th century, are kept in the Montenegrin monasteries. On the substratum of traditional oral folk epic poetry, authors like [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] have created their own expression. His epic ''Gorski Vijenac'' (''[[The Mountain Wreath]]''), written in the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[vernacular]], presents the central point of the Montenegrin [[Serb|Serbs]] culture.\n\n===Notable authors===\n*In ''18th and 19th centuries'': [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], [[Andrija Zmajevi\u0107]], [[Vasilije Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], [[Vuk Vr\u010devi\u0107]], [[Stefan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]] and [[Marko Miljanov]].\n*In ''20th century: [[Mihailo Lali\u0107]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Radovan Zogovi\u0107]], [[\u0106amil Sijari\u0107]], [[Miodrag Bulatovi\u0107]], [[\u010cedo Vukovi\u0107]], [[Mirko Kova\u010d (writer)|Mirko Kova\u010d]], [[Dragan Radulovi\u0107]], [[Borislav Peki\u0107]] and [[Vito Nikoli\u0107]].\n*Contemporary authors include: [[Bal\u0161a Brkovi\u0107]], [[Borislav Jovanovi\u0107 (writer)|Borislav Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Jevrem Brkovi\u0107]], [[Andrej Nikolaidis]], [[Tanja Baki\u0107]], [[Bosiljka Pu\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Dragana Kr\u0161enkovi\u0107 Brkovi\u0107]].\n\n==Painting and sculpture==\nThe painters from Montenegro gave a great contribution to the affirmation of the Montenegrin culture in the world. Leaving to the other parts of the world ([[Paris]], [[Belgrade]], [[Zagreb]]), they took their Montenegrin soul and heritage with them, and passed it down to others through their artworks. The last 15 years saw the opening of the Faculty of the Fine Arts in [[Cetinje]], bringing up a whole new wave of talent. Some of the most prominent painters from Montenegro includes: [[Milo Milunovi\u0107]], [[Petar Lubarda]], [[Dado (painter)|Dado \u0110uri\u0107]], [[Uro\u0161 To\u0161kovi\u0107]], [[Vojo Stani\u0107]], [[Dimitrije Popovi\u0107]], [[Boris Dragojevi\u0107]] and scluptor [[Risto Stijovi\u0107]].\n\n==Music==\nThe music of Montenegro represents a mix of the country's unique musical tradition and Western musical influences. The music of Montenegro has been relatively overlooked, especially in comparison with its literature and visual arts. Nevertheless, the 20th century produced several outstanding composers and interpreters. Specialized Musical High Schools in Kotor and Titograd, were the pillars of the classical music education, the latter being upgraded to the rank of Academy in the last decade of the 20th century. Particular attention is given to Choir and Chamber music. In addition, a professional orchestra is maintained by a national TV in Podgorica. \n\n===Historical overview===\nIn the 10th and 11th centuries a composer of religious chants (Jovan of Duklja) was the oldest composer known from the [[Adriatic]] coast. At the end of the 12th century a script was made, now called ''[[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja|Ljetopis Popa Dukljanina]]'', which described the secular use of musical instruments. Seven liturgies from the 15th century, written by a [[Venice|Venetian]] publisher L.A. Giunta, have been saved in a St. Clara monastery in [[Kotor]]. In those centuries the typical music \"venetian style\" was introduced to coastal Montenegro (then called [[Albania Veneta]]).\n\n[[File:Ste\u0107ak i Gusle - Nevesinje.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[Gusle]], Montenegrin traditional folk instrument]]\nReligious music development was sparked in the 19th century, when a Catholic singing academy was opened in Kotor. Also, until the musical renaissance of the 20th century, Montenegrin music was mainly based on the simple traditional instrument, the [[gusle]].<ref>[http://www.njegos.org/heritage/gusle.htm Montenegrin gusle]</ref>The oldest singing society, named \"Jedinstvo\" was formed in Kotor in 1839. In 1870 in [[Cetinje]], the first Montenegrin Army Music started being formed\u2014although not many people applied for the orchestra, because being a soldier was much more valued in Montenegrin society than being a musician. Many scholars believe that the biggest contribution to Montenegrin music was the one from the Italian composer who spent the most part of his life in these areas: Dionisio de Sarno San Giorgio. \n\nWith his \"Balkan Empress\" \u2013 inspired by the work of King Nikola, got all the praises of Italian critique in the second half of the 19th century.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&search-alias=books-uk&field-author=Dionisio%20de%20Sarno%20San%20Giorgio Works of Dionisio De Sarno San Giorgio, mostly done in Montenegro]</ref> The first music school in Montenegro was founded in 1934 in [[Cetinje]].\n====Traditional music====\nTraditional music heritage is somewhat different in different parts of Montenegro. In traditional music, different styles can be noticed in the [[Gulf of Kotor]] area, Old Montenegro and [[Sanjak]] regions. Old Montenegro traditional music is based around the traditional instrument, the [[gusle]]. The music is mainly vocal, or instrumental-vocal. Many songs are adapted from the [[Epic poetry|epic]]s, and are based on the events and tales from Montenegrin tradition.\n\n====Classical music====\nDue to the country's turbulent history, filled with defensive wars and constant fighting for freedom, the development of culture, especially music, was a secondary interest for [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]. The first notable [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] composer was Jovan Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 (1860\u20131889). He composed piano miniatures, orchestra, solo and chorus songs that were performed even in [[Prague]]. He died when he was only 29 years old. In the 19th century, there were also many [[opera]]s with [[libretto]]s inspired by Montenegro and its culture, like the famous \"Balkan Empress\".<ref>[http://mytheatrereviews.blogspot.com/2008/11/balkanska-carica-balkan-empress.html Balkan Empress]</ref> Other prominent 19th-century composers include Aleksa Ivanovi\u0107 and Dragan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who graduated from Prague music schools.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, when music schools were first introduced, and culture started developing faster, Montenegrin music started flourishing. There have been a number of notable classical music composers from Montenegro, especially during the 20th century. In the first half of the century, two musical schools developed: one based in Cetinje, and the other one in [[Podgorica]]. An important role in the music development of that time was played by Radio Titograd, which broadcast various music programmes daily, and helped popularise the music. At that time, composers started returning to the roots, introducing many traditional elements in modern compositions. Also, during the 1940s and 1950s, musical schools were opened in Kotor, Podgorica, Cetinje, [[Tivat]], [[Herceg Novi]], [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], [[Ulcinj]] and [[Berane]].\n\nThe Argentine composer Mauricio Annunziata, taking possession of the Montenegrin culture, religion and music, produced the cantata Akatist Op. 108, Hymns of Praise to Saint Basil of Ostrog at the Basilica Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome in May 2008, for solo voices, chorus and orchestra, also in version for organ. This concert marked the second anniversary of the Independence of Montenegro and it was held before the entire diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See and the highest authorities of the Vatican City. The work was hugely successful in the Italian version of the text produced by Dragana Polovi\u010d.\n\nToday, Montenegro is known for several award-winning [[classical guitarists]], among them [[Montenegrin Guitar Duo]] ([[Goran Krivokapi\u0107]] and [[Danijel Cerovi\u0107]]) and [[Milo\u0161 Karadagli\u0107]].\n\n=== Popular music in Montenegro ===\nProbably the best known rock band from Montenegro is [[Perper (band)|Perper]] from [[Cetinje]]. Other notable rock bands include DST from [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Highway (Montenegrin band)|Highway]], Autogeni Trening, Gospoda Glembajevi and Mikrokozma from capital [[Podgorica]]. Rock musicians from Montenegro who were popular throughout the former Yugoslavia include [[Marinko Pavi\u0107evi\u0107]], [[Miladin \u0160obi\u0107]] and [[Rambo Amadeus]]. While the notable pop singers from Montenegro are [[Sergej \u0106etkovi\u0107]], [[Vanja Radovanovi\u0107]], [[Slavko Kalezi\u0107]], [[Bojan Marovi\u0107]], [[Knez (singer)|Knez]], [[Vlado Georgiev]], [[Nina Petkovi\u0107]], [[Andrea Demirovi\u0107]], [[Stefan Filipovi\u0107]], [[Nina \u017di\u017ei\u0107]], also pop music groups [[No Name (Montenegrin band)|No Name]] and [[D mol]]. There are currently few active rock and pop Festivals in Montenegro, the most notables are [[Sea Dance Festival]], [[Cetinje]] Beer Fest, \"City Groove\" in [[Podgorica]], \"Lake\" and \"Bedem\" Fests in [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], and many other summer music festivals.\n\nHip hop in Montenegro evolved in the mid-1990s, and was popularized mostly thanks to the most famous Montenegrin hip hop group at that time, [[Monteniggers]]. Following their popularity, another hip hop artists emerged. Song themes were often humorous commentaries on everyday life. After a few years of stagnation, a new wave of Montenegrin hip hop started emerging through a growing number of hip hop oriented artists and bands, such as [[Who See]] from [[Kotor]], Barska Stoka from [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], Psiho Mistik and Bacili from [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and D\u017eej D\u017eej Oko\u010da and Sivilo from [[Podgorica]]. The main problem these artists face is lack of support from record labels, and insufficient funds available for hip hop projects. There are currently few active Hip Hop Festivals in Montenegro, the most famous is \"Asfaltiranje\".\n\nIn late 1980s and 1990s a dance music was popular, mostly thanks to \"Elmag radio\", which aired those songs. The best known groups are: H2O (from Bar), This Beat, Bass Reflex, Brchko, PG Crew, Maxi Playboy, Koko Kid (from Podgorica), Bianco Nero (Black and White in Italian), Grofovi (from Mojkovac) and many others.\n\n==Performing arts==\n===Film===\nConsidering its population of about 600,000 people, Montenegro has produced a number of outstanding film directors and actors including [[Du\u0161an Vukoti\u0107]], the first Yugoslav Oscar winner (for the short animated film category in 1961), [[Veljko Bulaji\u0107]], and [[\u017divko Nikoli\u0107]], other notable\nMontenegrin directors and filmmakers include: [[Krsto Papi\u0107]], [[Branko Baleti\u0107]],\nVelimir Stojanovi\u0107, [[Zdravko Velimirovi\u0107]], Bane Basta\u0107, [[Predrag Golubovi\u0107]], Krsto \u0160kanata, Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, and perspective filmmakers of new generation Ivan Salati\u0107,\nGojko Berkuljan, Marija Perovi\u0107, [[Nikola Vuk\u010devi\u0107 (film director)|Nikola Vuk\u010devi\u0107]], [[\u017deljko So\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Ivona Juka]].\n\nIn 2013 the Montenegrin film ''[[Bad Destiny]]'' became the first film from the country to be submitted for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref name=\"86th\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pobjeda.me/2013/08/27/film-as-pik-losa-sudbina-kandidat-crne-gore-za-nominaciju-za-oskara/ |title=Film \"As pik \u2013 lo\u0161a sudbina\" kandidat Crne Gore za nominaciju za Oskara |accessdate=2013-08-29 |work=pobjeda |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191736/http://www.pobjeda.me/2013/08/27/film-as-pik-losa-sudbina-kandidat-crne-gore-za-nominaciju-za-oskara/ |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}</ref><ref name=\"HWR\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-serbia-nominates-circles-montenegro-618819 |title= Oscars: Serbia Nominates 'Circles' and Montenegro Taps 'Bad Destiny' in Foreign Language Category |accessdate=2013-08-31 |work=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\nAmong the most famous actors from Montenegro are: [[Milutin Karad\u017ei\u0107]], Mladen Nelevi\u0107, Milorad Janketi\u0107, [[\u017darko Lau\u0161evi\u0107]], [[Miodrag Krivokapi\u0107 (actor)|Miodrag Krivokapi\u0107]], [[Branimir Popovi\u0107]], [[Dejan \u010cuki\u0107]], [[Andrija Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], [[Petar Strugar]] and [[Mom\u010dilo Ota\u0161evi\u0107]].\n\n===Theatre===\nNotable theatres include the [[Montenegrin National Theatre]] in [[Podgorica]], the Theatre of Nik\u0161i\u0107 in [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], and the City Theatre in [[Podgorica]]. Montenegrin National Theatre is the only professional theatre and along with the Faculty of [[Drama]], located in [[Cetinje]] is responsible for the lion share of the theatre production in the country. During summer months, City Theatre in [[Budva]] takes precedence as a stage for performers coming from all corners of former [[Yugoslavia]] and the world.\n\nMany scholars believe that the biggest contribution to Montenegrin music in theater was the one from the Italian composer who spent the most part of his life in these areas: including Dionisio de Sarno San Giorgio.

According to the 2011 census, the vast majority of more than 96% of Montenegrin residents declare themselves as members of some religious organization. While Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religious denomination in Montenegro, there are also sizable numbers of adherents of both Catholic Christianity and Islam. The dominant Church is the Serbian Orthodox Church although traces of a forming Montenegrin Orthodox Church are present. \n\n===Traditions and customs===\nThe [[Slava]] is exclusive custom of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] believers, each family has one patron saint that they venerate on their feast day. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the traditional Julian calendar, as per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls currently on January 7 of the Gregorian calendar, thus the Serbs celebrate Christmas on January 7, shared with the Orthodox churches of Jerusalem, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and the Greek Old Calendarists. \n\nThe [[badnjak]] is a tree branch or young tree brought into the house and placed on the fire on the evening of [[Christmas Eve]], a central tradition in Eastern Orthodox Christmas celebrations in Montenegro. The tree from which the badnjak is cut, preferably a young and straight Austrian oak, is ceremonially felled early on the morning of Christmas Eve. The felling, preparation, bringing in, and laying on the fire, are surrounded by elaborate rituals, with many regional variations. \n\n==Tradition==\n[[File:Montenegrin Herzegovinian costume.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Male folk costume from Montenegro]]\n\n===Folk dances===\nThe traditional folk dance is a circle dance called [[kolo]], which is common among Montenegrins, [[Serbs]] and [[Macedonians]]. It is a collective dance, where a group of people (usually several dozen, at the very least three) hold each other by the hands or around the waist dancing, forming a circle (hence the name), semicircle or spiral. It is called [[Oro (eagle dance)|Oro]] (or the \"Eagle dance\") in Montenegro. Similar circle dances also exist in other cultures of the region. \n\n===Epic songs===\nMontenegrins' long-standing history of struggle for freedom and independence is invariably linked with strong traditions of oral [[epic poetry]]. Traditionally, they are delivered to the audience accompanied by the music produced by a [[gusle]], a one-string instrument played by the story-teller (''guslar''), who sings or recites the stories of heroes and battles in [[Decasyllable|decasyllabic verse]]. Historically, these songs have had an immense motivational power over the population. The guslars commanded almost as much respect as the best of [[warrior]]s, as they were as much the authors, thus history writers, as they were interpreters. Presently, these traditions are somewhat livelier in the northern parts of the country (also shared with people in eastern [[Herzegovina]], western [[Serbia]], and central [[Dalmatia]]).\n\n===Montenegrin names===\nThere are many Montenegrin names unique to the Montenegrin people which display the distinct culture of the Montenegrins. \n\nFor an extensive list see: \n[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Montenegrin_given_names Montenegrin given names].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Montenegrin cuisine}}\n[[File:Foods from Montenegro.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Foods from Montenegro]]\nMontenegrin cuisine is a result of Montenegro's geographic position and its long history. The traditional dishes of Montenegro's heartland, and its [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]] have a distinctively [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] flavour which shows in the [[bread]]-making style, the way [[meat]] is cured and dried, [[cheese]]-making, [[wine]] and [[Distilled beverage|spirits]], the [[soup]] and [[stew]] making style, [[polenta]], stuffed [[capsicums]], [[meatball]]s, priganice, [[Dolma|japraci]], [[Collard greens|ra\u0161tan]], etc. \n\nThe second large influence came from the [[Levant]] and [[Turkish cuisine|Turkey]], [[Sarma (food)|sarma]], [[Moussaka|musaka]], [[Pilaf|pilav]], [[pita]], [[burek]], [[\u0107evapi]], [[kebab]], Turkish sweets like [[baklava]] and [[tulumba]], etc. [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]] dishes include [[goulash]], satarash, and djuvech, which are also very common. Last but not least, [[Croatian cuisine]] made its mark mostly in the desserts department. \n\nAdditionally [[cr\u00eapes]], [[doughnuts]], [[jam]], myriad types of [[biscuits]] and [[cakes]], all make a contribution to the average Montenegrin's waist-line. [[Vienna]]-style bread is the most prevalent type of bread in the shops.\n\nMontenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from the one in the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of [[Mediterranean cuisine]], with [[seafood]] being a common dish.\n\n==Architecture==\n{{Main|Architecture of Montenegro}}\nMontenegro has a number of significant cultural and historical sites, including heritage sites from the pre-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Baroque]] periods. The Montenegrin coastal region is especially well known for its religious monuments, mostly related to [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] architecture, including the [[Cathedral of Saint Tryphon]], the [[basilica]] of [[St. Luke]] (over 800 years), Our Lady of the Rock (''\u0160krpjela''), the [[Savina monastery (Montenegro)|Savina Monastery]], and others. The ancient city of ''Cattaro'' (now called [[Kotor]]) is listed on the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage list, even as a perfect example of the Venetian architecture. The [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] influence in architecture, and in religious artwork is especially apparent in the country's interior.\n\n==Literature==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; float:right; margin-right:9px; margin-left:2px;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[File:Oktoih petoglasnik iz 1494. eksponat iz zbirke Pedago\u0161kog muzeja u Beogradu.jpg|200px]] || style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[File:Be\u010dko izdanje Gorskog vijenca 1847.png|250px]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Cetinje Octoechos]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[The Mountain Wreath]]\n|}\n''Montenegrin literature'' refers to the entire (historical and modern) corpus of [[literature]] created in [[Montenegro]], written mainly in [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and other related languages spoken in the country\n\n===Characteristics===\nAlthough there are works written at least 800 years ago (like the [[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]]), the most important representatives are writers who lived in 19th and 20th century and wrote mainly in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The first literary works written in the region are ten centuries old, and the first Montenegrin book was printed five hundreds years ago. \n\nIn [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] Cattaro (actual [[Kotor]]) there were a group of writers and poets that introduced [[Renaissance]] culture in [[Albania Veneta|coastal Montenegro]], writing in [[Latin]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]: [[Ludovico Pasquali]], [[Giovanni Bona de Boliris]], Giovanni Polizza, Giorgio Bisanti, Girolamo Pima, Timoteo Cisilla, Giovanni Crussala, Giuseppe Bronza and Girolamo Panizzola.\n\nThe first state-owned printing press ([[Printing House of Crnojevi\u0107i]]) was located in [[Cetinje]] in 1494, where the first [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] book was printed the same year ([[Oktoih]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Montenegro#ref887673|title=Montenegro|publisher=[[Britannica Encyclopaedia]]|accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref> A number of medieval manuscripts, dating from the 13th century, are kept in the Montenegrin monasteries. On the substratum of traditional oral folk epic poetry, authors like [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] have created their own expression. His epic ''Gorski Vijenac'' (''[[The Mountain Wreath]]''), written in the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[vernacular]], presents the central point of the Montenegrin [[Serb|Serbs]] culture.\n\n===Notable authors===\n*In ''18th and 19th centuries'': [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], [[Andrija Zmajevi\u0107]], [[Vasilije Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], [[Vuk Vr\u010devi\u0107]], [[Stefan Mitrov Ljubi\u0161a]] and [[Marko Miljanov]].\n*In ''20th century: [[Mihailo Lali\u0107]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Radovan Zogovi\u0107]], [[\u0106amil Sijari\u0107]], [[Miodrag Bulatovi\u0107]], [[\u010cedo Vukovi\u0107]], [[Mirko Kova\u010d (writer)|Mirko Kova\u010d]], [[Dragan Radulovi\u0107]], [[Borislav Peki\u0107]] and [[Vito Nikoli\u0107]].\n*Contemporary authors include: [[Bal\u0161a Brkovi\u0107]], [[Borislav Jovanovi\u0107 (writer)|Borislav Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Jevrem Brkovi\u0107]], [[Andrej Nikolaidis]], [[Tanja Baki\u0107]], [[Bosiljka Pu\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Dragana Kr\u0161enkovi\u0107 Brkovi\u0107]].\n\n==Painting and sculpture==\nThe painters from Montenegro gave a great contribution to the affirmation of the Montenegrin culture in the world. Leaving to the other parts of the world ([[Paris]], [[Belgrade]], [[Zagreb]]), they took their Montenegrin soul and heritage with them, and passed it down to others through their artworks. The last 15 years saw the opening of the Faculty of the Fine Arts in [[Cetinje]], bringing up a whole new wave of talent. Some of the most prominent painters from Montenegro includes: [[Milo Milunovi\u0107]], [[Petar Lubarda]], [[Dado (painter)|Dado \u0110uri\u0107]], [[Uro\u0161 To\u0161kovi\u0107]], [[Vojo Stani\u0107]], [[Dimitrije Popovi\u0107]], [[Boris Dragojevi\u0107]] and scluptor [[Risto Stijovi\u0107]].\n\n==Music==\nThe music of Montenegro represents a mix of the country's unique musical tradition and Western musical influences. The music of Montenegro has been relatively overlooked, especially in comparison with its literature and visual arts. Nevertheless, the 20th century produced several outstanding composers and interpreters. Specialized Musical High Schools in Kotor and Titograd, were the pillars of the classical music education, the latter being upgraded to the rank of Academy in the last decade of the 20th century. Particular attention is given to Choir and Chamber music. In addition, a professional orchestra is maintained by a national TV in Podgorica. \n\n===Historical overview===\nIn the 10th and 11th centuries a composer of religious chants (Jovan of Duklja) was the oldest composer known from the [[Adriatic]] coast. At the end of the 12th century a script was made, now called ''[[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja|Ljetopis Popa Dukljanina]]'', which described the secular use of musical instruments. Seven liturgies from the 15th century, written by a [[Venice|Venetian]] publisher L.A. Giunta, have been saved in a St. Clara monastery in [[Kotor]]. In those centuries the typical music \"venetian style\" was introduced to coastal Montenegro (then called [[Albania Veneta]]).\n\n[[File:Ste\u0107ak i Gusle - Nevesinje.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[Gusle]], Montenegrin traditional folk instrument]]\nReligious music development was sparked in the 19th century, when a Catholic singing academy was opened in Kotor. Also, until the musical renaissance of the 20th century, Montenegrin music was mainly based on the simple traditional instrument, the [[gusle]].<ref>[http://www.njegos.org/heritage/gusle.htm Montenegrin gusle]</ref>The oldest singing society, named \"Jedinstvo\" was formed in Kotor in 1839. In 1870 in [[Cetinje]], the first Montenegrin Army Music started being formed\u2014although not many people applied for the orchestra, because being a soldier was much more valued in Montenegrin society than being a musician. Many scholars believe that the biggest contribution to Montenegrin music was the one from the Italian composer who spent the most part of his life in these areas: Dionisio de Sarno San Giorgio. \n\nWith his \"Balkan Empress\" \u2013 inspired by the work of King Nikola, got all the praises of Italian critique in the second half of the 19th century.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&search-alias=books-uk&field-author=Dionisio%20de%20Sarno%20San%20Giorgio Works of Dionisio De Sarno San Giorgio, mostly done in Montenegro]</ref> The first music school in Montenegro was founded in 1934 in [[Cetinje]].\n====Traditional music====\nTraditional music heritage is somewhat different in different parts of Montenegro. In traditional music, different styles can be noticed in the [[Gulf of Kotor]] area, Old Montenegro and [[Sanjak]] regions. Old Montenegro traditional music is based around the traditional instrument, the [[gusle]]. The music is mainly vocal, or instrumental-vocal. Many songs are adapted from the [[Epic poetry|epic]]s, and are based on the events and tales from Montenegrin tradition.\n\n====Classical music====\nDue to the country's turbulent history, filled with defensive wars and constant fighting for freedom, the development of culture, especially music, was a secondary interest for [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]. The first notable [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] composer was Jovan Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 (1860\u20131889). He composed piano miniatures, orchestra, solo and chorus songs that were performed even in [[Prague]]. He died when he was only 29 years old. In the 19th century, there were also many [[opera]]s with [[libretto]]s inspired by Montenegro and its culture, like the famous \"Balkan Empress\".<ref>[http://mytheatrereviews.blogspot.com/2008/11/balkanska-carica-balkan-empress.html Balkan Empress]</ref> Other prominent 19th-century composers include Aleksa Ivanovi\u0107 and Dragan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who graduated from Prague music schools.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, when music schools were first introduced, and culture started developing faster, Montenegrin music started flourishing. There have been a number of notable classical music composers from Montenegro, especially during the 20th century. In the first half of the century, two musical schools developed: one based in Cetinje, and the other one in [[Podgorica]]. An important role in the music development of that time was played by Radio Titograd, which broadcast various music programmes daily, and helped popularise the music. At that time, composers started returning to the roots, introducing many traditional elements in modern compositions. Also, during the 1940s and 1950s, musical schools were opened in Kotor, Podgorica, Cetinje, [[Tivat]], [[Herceg Novi]], [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], [[Ulcinj]] and [[Berane]].\n\nThe Argentine composer Mauricio Annunziata, taking possession of the Montenegrin culture, religion and music, produced the cantata Akatist Op. 108, Hymns of Praise to Saint Basil of Ostrog at the Basilica Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome in May 2008, for solo voices, chorus and orchestra, also in version for organ. This concert marked the second anniversary of the Independence of Montenegro and it was held before the entire diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See and the highest authorities of the Vatican City. The work was hugely successful in the Italian version of the text produced by Dragana Polovi\u010d.\n\nToday, Montenegro is known for several award-winning [[classical guitarists]], among them [[Montenegrin Guitar Duo]] ([[Goran Krivokapi\u0107]] and [[Danijel Cerovi\u0107]]) and [[Milo\u0161 Karadagli\u0107]].\n\n=== Popular music in Montenegro ===\nProbably the best known rock band from Montenegro is [[Perper (band)|Perper]] from [[Cetinje]]. Other notable rock bands include DST from [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Highway (Montenegrin band)|Highway]], Autogeni Trening, Gospoda Glembajevi and Mikrokozma from capital [[Podgorica]]. Rock musicians from Montenegro who were popular throughout the former Yugoslavia include [[Marinko Pavi\u0107evi\u0107]], [[Miladin \u0160obi\u0107]] and [[Rambo Amadeus]]. While the notable pop singers from Montenegro are [[Sergej \u0106etkovi\u0107]], [[Vanja Radovanovi\u0107]], [[Slavko Kalezi\u0107]], [[Bojan Marovi\u0107]], [[Knez (singer)|Knez]], [[Vlado Georgiev]], [[Nina Petkovi\u0107]], [[Andrea Demirovi\u0107]], [[Stefan Filipovi\u0107]], [[Nina \u017di\u017ei\u0107]], also pop music groups [[No Name (Montenegrin band)|No Name]] and [[D mol]]. There are currently few active rock and pop Festivals in Montenegro, the most notables are [[Sea Dance Festival]], [[Cetinje]] Beer Fest, \"City Groove\" in [[Podgorica]], \"Lake\" and \"Bedem\" Fests in [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], and many other summer music festivals.\n\nHip hop in Montenegro evolved in the mid-1990s, and was popularized mostly thanks to the most famous Montenegrin hip hop group at that time, [[Monteniggers]]. Following their popularity, another hip hop artists emerged. Song themes were often humorous commentaries on everyday life. After a few years of stagnation, a new wave of Montenegrin hip hop started emerging through a growing number of hip hop oriented artists and bands, such as [[Who See]] from [[Kotor]], Barska Stoka from [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], Psiho Mistik and Bacili from [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and D\u017eej D\u017eej Oko\u010da and Sivilo from [[Podgorica]]. The main problem these artists face is lack of support from record labels, and insufficient funds available for hip hop projects. There are currently few active Hip Hop Festivals in Montenegro, the most famous is \"Asfaltiranje\".\n\nIn late 1980s and 1990s a dance music was popular, mostly thanks to \"Elmag radio\", which aired those songs. The best known groups are: H2O (from Bar), This Beat, Bass Reflex, Brchko, PG Crew, Maxi Playboy, Koko Kid (from Podgorica), Bianco Nero (Black and White in Italian), Grofovi (from Mojkovac) and many others.\n\n==Performing arts==\n===Film===\nConsidering its population of about 600,000 people, Montenegro has produced a number of outstanding film directors and actors including [[Du\u0161an Vukoti\u0107]], the first Yugoslav Oscar winner (for the short animated film category in 1961), [[Veljko Bulaji\u0107]], and [[\u017divko Nikoli\u0107]], other notable\nMontenegrin directors and filmmakers include: [[Krsto Papi\u0107]], [[Branko Baleti\u0107]],\nVelimir Stojanovi\u0107, [[Zdravko Velimirovi\u0107]], Bane Basta\u0107, [[Predrag Golubovi\u0107]], Krsto \u0160kanata, Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107, and perspective filmmakers of new generation Ivan Salati\u0107,\nGojko Berkuljan, Marija Perovi\u0107, [[Nikola Vuk\u010devi\u0107 (film director)|Nikola Vuk\u010devi\u0107]], [[\u017deljko So\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Ivona Juka]].\n\nIn 2013 the Montenegrin film ''[[Bad Destiny]]'' became the first film from the country to be submitted for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref name=\"86th\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pobjeda.me/2013/08/27/film-as-pik-losa-sudbina-kandidat-crne-gore-za-nominaciju-za-oskara/ |title=Film \"As pik \u2013 lo\u0161a sudbina\" kandidat Crne Gore za nominaciju za Oskara |accessdate=2013-08-29 |work=pobjeda |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191736/http://www.pobjeda.me/2013/08/27/film-as-pik-losa-sudbina-kandidat-crne-gore-za-nominaciju-za-oskara/ |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}</ref><ref name=\"HWR\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-serbia-nominates-circles-montenegro-618819 |title= Oscars: Serbia Nominates 'Circles' and Montenegro Taps 'Bad Destiny' in Foreign Language Category |accessdate=2013-08-31 |work=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\nAmong the most famous actors from Montenegro are: [[Milutin Karad\u017ei\u0107]], Mladen Nelevi\u0107, Milorad Janketi\u0107, [[\u017darko Lau\u0161evi\u0107]], [[Miodrag Krivokapi\u0107 (actor)|Miodrag Krivokapi\u0107]], [[Branimir Popovi\u0107]], [[Dejan \u010cuki\u0107]], [[Andrija Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], [[Petar Strugar]] and [[Mom\u010dilo Ota\u0161evi\u0107]].\n\n===Theatre===\nNotable theatres include the [[Montenegrin National Theatre]] in [[Podgorica]], the Theatre of Nik\u0161i\u0107 in [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], and the City Theatre in [[Podgorica]]. Montenegrin National Theatre is the only professional theatre and along with the Faculty of [[Drama]], located in [[Cetinje]] is responsible for the lion share of the theatre production in the country. During summer months, City Theatre in [[Budva]] takes precedence as a stage for performers coming from all corners of former [[Yugoslavia]] and the world.\n\nMany scholars believe that the biggest contribution to Montenegrin music in theater was the one from the Italian composer who spent the most part of his life in these areas: including Dionisio de Sarno San Giorgio. With his \"Balkan Empress\" \u2013 inspired by the work of King Nikola, got all the praises of Italian critique in the second half of the 19th century.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&search-alias=books-uk&field-author=Dionisio%20de%20Sarno%20San%20Giorgio Works of Dionisio De Sarno San Giorgio, mostly done in Montenegro]</ref>\n\n==Montenegro as a theme in foreign works==\n*Croatian writter and poet [[Ivan Ma\u017eurani\u0107]], wrote a Montenegrin-themed epic poem [[The Death of Smail-aga \u010cengi\u0107]].\n*The 2006 James Bond film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' is partially set in Montenegro.\n*''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[F.

French filmmaker [[Jean-Pierre Melville]] called ''The Kremlin Letter'' \"masterly\" and \"...saw it as establishing the standard for cinema.\"<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nLate in 1969, a brilliant young [[United States Navy]] intelligence officer, Charles Rone, finds his commission revoked so that he can be recruited into an espionage mission. Rone is told that the mission is being undertaken independently of governmental intelligence agencies, as was commonplace prior to [[World War II]], when espionage operations were handled by a small community of agents operating on a [[freelance]] basis.\n\nRone is told that the primary operator in that community, a \"brutal, sadistic, conscienceless assassin\" named Robert Sturdevant, did not adapt to the post-war shift to government intelligence agencies, along with the disbanding of the independent network of spies, with Sturdevant disappearing and reportedly later committing suicide. Now, the government has suffered a significant failure in an important intelligence operation and has turned back to the independent agents for help.\n\nThis time, \"The Highwayman\", another member of the old group of independent spies is the man leading the effort to reassemble the network to take on this mission. Another member of the group has recently died, and Rone has been tabbed as his replacement, due to Rone's exceptional analytical skills, [[eidetic memory]] and ability to speak eight languages with a native accent.\n\nRone meets with The Highwayman and another group member, Ward, the latter of whom takes on the role of Rone's primary tutor. They first task Rone with rounding up three other members of the group:  Janis, \"The Whore\", a [[drug dealer]] and [[pimp|panderer]], \"The Warlock\", a culturally sophisticated homosexual, and \"The Erector Set\", a highly skilled thief and burglar.\n\nJanis begs off of the mission, saying that he won't work for The Highwayman, but only for Sturdevant, whom he believes would never have killed himself.  Rone finally bribes him into agreeing to participate.  The Warlock joins the operation without hesitation, but The Erector Set's hands have become too arthritic to be of use. Instead, he sends his beautiful daughter, B.A., in his place, as he has trained her to be as capable as is he.\n\nThe group's mission is the retrieval of a letter, written without proper authorization, that promises United States aid to the Soviet Union in destroying Chinese atomic weapons plants.  The letter had been solicited on behalf of an unknown high-level Soviet official by Dmitri Polyakov, who had previously been selling Soviet secrets to the United States that he had obtained from that same Soviet official. Upon finding out about the letter, which was a de facto \"declaration of war against China\", U.S. and British authorities had contacted Polyakov and arranged to buy it back from him.  However, Polyakov then committed suicide after being apprehended by Soviet counter-intelligence, under the direction of Colonel Yakov Kosnov.\n\nThe group [[blackmail]]s Captain Potkin, the Soviet head of counter-intelligence in the U.S., threatening his family to force him to allow them the use of his usually-vacant apartment in Moscow.  Once they arrive in the Soviet Union, the terminally ill Highwayman sacrifices his life, attempting to divert the attention of Soviet counter-intelligence away from the remainder of the team.  Rone is assigned to remain at the apartment with Ward and accept reports verbally from other team members, Rone's memory allowing them to avoid the use of written records.  Janis, The Warlock and B.A. then set out to establish themselves in various parts of Russian society as they try to ascertain the identity of Polyakov's contact.\n\nJanis enters a partnership with a local brothel operator, who points him to a Chinese man known as \"The Kitai\" as a possible source for names of officials and others to whom he can sell heroin, with which Janis already plans to keep the prostitutes addicted. Janis later discerns that the Kitai is also a spy and further happens to spot Kosnov leaving a local night club with a woman whom he discovers was Polyakov's devoted wife, Erika Beck. She is now married to Kosnov, so B.A. plants a listening device in their bedroom.  After that, B.A. takes up with a local small-time thief and [[black market]] operator, though she finds herself terribly unhappy and wishes only to return home to her father.  In the meantime, the Warlock integrates himself into the local community of intellectual homosexuals, starting an affair with a university professor.  He then meets one of the professor's students who was Polyakov's former lover and who informs him that Polyakov had had a relationship with Vladimir Bresnavitch of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Central Committee]].\n\nBresnavitch turns out to have an adversarial relationship with Kosnov, whose activities Bresnavitch oversees on behalf of the Committee. According to Kosnov, the animosity between the two men went back many years to when Bresnavitch sought to oust Kosnov from his job, in favor of Sturdevant. Prior to that time, Kosnov and Sturdevant had been friendly, with each one trusting the other to allow his agents to operate in the other's territory. However, with the pressure from Bresnavitch, Kosnov decided he had to do \"something spectacular\" to keep his job, so he betrayed Sturdevant's trust and captured his agents, employing a great deal of brutality and earning the lasting enmity of Sturdevant himself.\n\nUpon deducing that Bresnavitch had used Polyakov to [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] stolen art works in Paris, Ward decides to go there in search of any possible leads. On the day of his return, the group's mission is destroyed when Potkin returns to the Soviet Union and informs Bresnavitch about the operation. Janis, B.A. and Ward are apprehended, while The Warlock commits suicide just before capture and Rone narrowly escapes. Rone tries visiting the Kitai to arrange re-purchase of the letter, but the Kitai responds by trying to kill him and Rone determines that the Chinese have possession of the letter.\n\nRone then turns to Erika, with whom he has been having an affair while posing as a Russian [[gigolo]] named Yorgi.  He hopes to get her to inquire with her husband about the condition of those captured.  She informs him that Kosnov participated in no such capture, and Rone realizes that Bresnavitch quietly orchestrated the raid without the knowledge of Soviet counter-intelligence, a clear indicator that he was Polyakov's traitorous high-level Soviet official contact.  Rone's questions reveal to Erika his true identity and he promises to help her escape to the West.  She tells him she will try to ascertain the fates of the captured agents and later reports back that B.A. has taken poison and is expected to die, while one of the men is dead and the other has survived and is being held captive.\n\nRone threatens to expose Bresnavitch unless Ward, the surviving agent, is released.  Bresnavitch agrees, and Rone and Ward then arrange to leave the next day. Disapproving of Rone's plans to aid Erika, Ward lures her into a trap and kills her.  Kosnov believes that her lover Yorgi killed her and tracks down Rone, though unaware of Rone's true identity, in search of revenge. But Ward enters, leading Kosnov to observe that \"I seem to know you.\"  Ward says that the two men have \"a lot of old corpses to dig up and talk about.\"  He begins listing the names of the agents betrayed by Kosnov and says that the time has come for retribution, as he shoots Kosnov in the kneecap.  Kosnov stares at Ward in disbelief, saying \"No, it isn't. It can't be.\"  Ward then closes on him off-camera and Kosnov begins screaming in torment.\n\nAs they head for a plane to leave the country, Rone shares with Ward his conclusions that Ward is in fact Sturdevant and intends to stay, having made a deal with Bresnavitch to take over as the head of Soviet counter-intelligence.  Ward denies it, but only coyly, and then reveals that B.A. is not dead.  He says that she will be held to ensure that Rone does not reveal the truth about him.  Rone, very much in love with B.A., vows that he'll get her back somehow.  Ward offers to release B.A. if Rone does \"one last little thing\", handing Rone an envelope as Rone boards the plane.  After seating himself, Rone opens the envelope to find a note which reads, \"Kill Potkin's wife and daughters or I kill the girl.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Patrick O'Neal (actor)|Patrick O'Neal]] as Charles Rone\n* [[Richard Boone]] as Ward\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as Colonel Kosnov\n* [[Bibi Andersson]] as Erika Kosnov\n* [[Barbara Parkins]] as B.A.\n* [[George Sanders]] as \"The Warlock\"\n* [[Nigel Green]] as \"The Whore\"\n* [[Miche\u00e1l MacL\u00edamm\u00f3ir]] as \"Sweet Alice\"\n* [[Orson Welles]] as Bresnavitch\n* [[Ronald Radd]] as Captain Potkin\n* [[Dean Jagger]] as \"The Highwayman\"\n* [[Lila Kedrova]] as Sophie\n* [[Raf Vallone]] as Puppet Maker\n* [[Sandor El\u00e8s]] (credited as Sandor Eles) as Lt.

French filmmaker [[Jean-Pierre Melville]] called ''The Kremlin Letter'' \"masterly\" and \"...saw it as establishing the standard for cinema.\"<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nLate in 1969, a brilliant young [[United States Navy]] intelligence officer, Charles Rone, finds his commission revoked so that he can be recruited into an espionage mission. Rone is told that the mission is being undertaken independently of governmental intelligence agencies, as was commonplace prior to [[World War II]], when espionage operations were handled by a small community of agents operating on a [[freelance]] basis.\n\nRone is told that the primary operator in that community, a \"brutal, sadistic, conscienceless assassin\" named Robert Sturdevant, did not adapt to the post-war shift to government intelligence agencies, along with the disbanding of the independent network of spies, with Sturdevant disappearing and reportedly later committing suicide. Now, the government has suffered a significant failure in an important intelligence operation and has turned back to the independent agents for help.\n\nThis time, \"The Highwayman\", another member of the old group of independent spies is the man leading the effort to reassemble the network to take on this mission. Another member of the group has recently died, and Rone has been tabbed as his replacement, due to Rone's exceptional analytical skills, [[eidetic memory]] and ability to speak eight languages with a native accent.\n\nRone meets with The Highwayman and another group member, Ward, the latter of whom takes on the role of Rone's primary tutor. They first task Rone with rounding up three other members of the group:  Janis, \"The Whore\", a [[drug dealer]] and [[pimp|panderer]], \"The Warlock\", a culturally sophisticated homosexual, and \"The Erector Set\", a highly skilled thief and burglar.\n\nJanis begs off of the mission, saying that he won't work for The Highwayman, but only for Sturdevant, whom he believes would never have killed himself.  Rone finally bribes him into agreeing to participate.  The Warlock joins the operation without hesitation, but The Erector Set's hands have become too arthritic to be of use. Instead, he sends his beautiful daughter, B.A., in his place, as he has trained her to be as capable as is he.\n\nThe group's mission is the retrieval of a letter, written without proper authorization, that promises United States aid to the Soviet Union in destroying Chinese atomic weapons plants.  The letter had been solicited on behalf of an unknown high-level Soviet official by Dmitri Polyakov, who had previously been selling Soviet secrets to the United States that he had obtained from that same Soviet official. Upon finding out about the letter, which was a de facto \"declaration of war against China\", U.S. and British authorities had contacted Polyakov and arranged to buy it back from him.  However, Polyakov then committed suicide after being apprehended by Soviet counter-intelligence, under the direction of Colonel Yakov Kosnov.\n\nThe group [[blackmail]]s Captain Potkin, the Soviet head of counter-intelligence in the U.S., threatening his family to force him to allow them the use of his usually-vacant apartment in Moscow.  Once they arrive in the Soviet Union, the terminally ill Highwayman sacrifices his life, attempting to divert the attention of Soviet counter-intelligence away from the remainder of the team.  Rone is assigned to remain at the apartment with Ward and accept reports verbally from other team members, Rone's memory allowing them to avoid the use of written records.  Janis, The Warlock and B.A. then set out to establish themselves in various parts of Russian society as they try to ascertain the identity of Polyakov's contact.\n\nJanis enters a partnership with a local brothel operator, who points him to a Chinese man known as \"The Kitai\" as a possible source for names of officials and others to whom he can sell heroin, with which Janis already plans to keep the prostitutes addicted. Janis later discerns that the Kitai is also a spy and further happens to spot Kosnov leaving a local night club with a woman whom he discovers was Polyakov's devoted wife, Erika Beck. She is now married to Kosnov, so B.A. plants a listening device in their bedroom.  After that, B.A. takes up with a local small-time thief and [[black market]] operator, though she finds herself terribly unhappy and wishes only to return home to her father.  In the meantime, the Warlock integrates himself into the local community of intellectual homosexuals, starting an affair with a university professor.  He then meets one of the professor's students who was Polyakov's former lover and who informs him that Polyakov had had a relationship with Vladimir Bresnavitch of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Central Committee]].\n\nBresnavitch turns out to have an adversarial relationship with Kosnov, whose activities Bresnavitch oversees on behalf of the Committee. According to Kosnov, the animosity between the two men went back many years to when Bresnavitch sought to oust Kosnov from his job, in favor of Sturdevant.

{"title_page": "Animacy", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n\n{{Grammatical categories}}\n'''Animacy''' (antonym: '''inanimacy''') is a [[Grammatical category|grammatical]] and [[semantic]] feature, existing in some languages, expressing how [[Sentience|sentient]] or [[life|alive]] the referent of a [[noun]] is. Widely expressed, animacy is one of the most elementary principles in languages around the globe and is a distinction acquired as early as six months of age.<ref name=Szewczyk>{{cite journal|last=Szewczyk|first=Jakub M.|last2=Schriefers|first2=Herbert|title=Is animacy special? ERP correlates of semantic violations and animacy violations in sentence processing|journal=Brain Research|date=2010|volume=1368|pages=208\u2013221|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2010.10.070|pmid=21029726}}</ref>\n\nConcepts of animacy constantly vary beyond a simple animate and inanimate binary; many languages function off of a [[implicational hierarchy|hierarchical]] General Animacy Scale that ranks animacy as a \"matter of gradience.\"<ref name=Yamamoto>{{cite book|last=Yamamoto|first=Mutsumi|title=Agency and impersonality: Their linguistic and cultural manifestations|date=2006|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co.|location=Amsterdam|page=36}}</ref> Typically (with some variation of order and of where the cutoff for animacy occurs), the scale ranks humans above animals, then plants, natural forces, concrete objects, and abstract objects, in that order. In referring to humans, this scale contains a hierarchy of persons, ranking the first and second person [[pronoun]]s above the third person, partly a product of empathy, involving the speaker and [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]].<ref name=\"Yamamoto\" />\n\n==Examples==\nThe distinction between ''he'', ''she'', and [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns|other personal pronouns]], on one hand, and ''it'', on the other hand is a distinction in animacy in [[English language|English]] and in many [[Indo-European languages]]. The same can be said about distinction between ''who'' and ''what''. Some languages, such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Spoken Finnish]] do not distinguish between ''s/he'' and ''it''. In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], there is a distinction in animacy between ''[[wikt:h\u00e4n#Finnish|h\u00e4n]]'' \"he/she\" and ''[[wikt:se#Finnish|se]]'' \"it\", but in [[Spoken Finnish]], ''se'' can mean \"he/she\". English shows a similar lack of distinction between ''they'' animate and ''they'' inanimate in the plural but, as shown above, it has such a distinction in the singular.\n\nThere is another example of how animacy plays some role in English. For example, the higher animacy a referent has, the less preferable it is to use the preposition ''of'' for possession (that can also be interpreted in terms of alienable or [[inalienable possession]]):\n* ''My face'' is correct while <nowiki>*</nowiki>''the face of me'' would sound very strange.\n* ''The man's face'' and ''the face of the man'' are both correct, but the former is preferred.\n* ''The clock's face'' and ''the face of the clock'' are both correct.\n\nExamples of languages in which an animacy hierarchy is important include the [[Totonac language]] in [[Mexico]] and the [[Southern Athabaskan languages]] (such as [[Western Apache]] and [[Navajo language|Navajo]]) whose animacy hierarchy has been the subject of intense study. The [[Tamil language]] has a [[grammatical gender|noun classification]] based on animacy.\n\n===Proto-Indo-European language===\nBecause of the similarities in morphology of feminine and masculine [[grammatical gender#Masculine, feminine, and neuter|grammatical gender]] inflections in [[Indo-European languages]], there is a theory that in an early stage, the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] had only two grammatical genders: \"[[Grammatical gender#Animate and inanimate|animate]]\" and \"[[Grammatical gender#Common and neuter|inanimate/neuter]]\"; the most obvious difference being that inanimate/neuter nouns used the same form for the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], and [[accusative case|accusative]] [[noun case]]s. The distinction was preserved in [[Anatolian languages]] like [[Hittite language|Hittite]], all of which are now extinct. ([[Sanskrit]] still preserves this form for neuter gender nouns - nominative and accusative forms are the same.)\n\nThe animate gender would then later, after the separation of the Anatolian languages, have developed into the feminine and masculine genders. The plural of neuter/inanimate nouns is believed to have had the same ending as [[collective noun]]s in the singular, and some words with the collective noun ending in singular were later to become words with the feminine gender. Traces can be found in [[Ancient Greek]] in which the singular form of verbs was used when they referred to neuter words in plural. In many Indo-European languages, such as [[Latin]] and the [[Slavic languages]], the plural ending of many neuter words in the merged nominative\u2013accusative\u2013vocative corresponds to the feminine singular nominative form.\n\n===Navajo===\nLike most other [[Athabaskan languages]], [[Southern Athabaskan languages]] show various levels of animacy in their grammar, with certain nouns taking specific verb forms according to their rank in this animacy hierarchy. For instance, [[Navajo language|Navajo]] nouns can be ranked by animacy on a continuum from most animate (a human) to least animate (an abstraction) (Young & Morgan 1987: 65-66):\n\nHuman > Infant/Big Animal > Medium-sized Animal > Small Animal > Natural Force > Abstraction\n\nGenerally, the most animate noun in a sentence must occur first while the noun with lesser animacy occurs second. If both nouns are equal in animacy, either noun can occur in the first position. Both sentences (1) and (2) are correct. The ''yi-'' prefix on the verb indicates that the first noun is the subject and ''bi-'' indicates that the second noun is the subject.\n\n{|\n| (1) \n| '''Ashkii'''\n| '''at\u2019\u00e9\u00e9d'''\n| '''yin\u00ed\u0142\u2019\u012f\u0301'''\n|-\n|\n| boy\n| girl\n| ''yi''-look\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'The boy is looking at the girl.'\n|}\n\n{|\n| (2) \n| '''At\u2019\u00e9\u00e9d'''\n| '''ashkii'''\n| '''bin\u00ed\u0142\u2019\u012f\u0301'''\n|-\n|\n| girl\n| boy\n| ''bi''-look\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'The girl is being looked at by the boy.'\n|}\n\nSentence (3), however, sounds wrong to most Navajo speakers because the less animate noun occurs before the more animate noun:\n\n{|\n| (3) \n| '''*Ts\u00eddii'''\n| '''at\u2019\u00e9\u00e9d'''\n| '''yisht\u0105sh'''\n|-\n|\n| bird\n| girl\n| ''yi''-pecked\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|*'The bird pecked the girl.'\n|}\n\nIn order to express that idea, the more animate noun must occur first, as in sentence (4):\n\n{|\n| (4) \n| '''At\u2019\u00e9\u00e9d'''\n| '''ts\u00eddii'''\n| '''bisht\u0105sh'''\n|-\n|\n| girl\n| bird\n| ''bi''-pecked\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'The girl was pecked by the bird.'\n|}\n\nThere is evidence suggesting that the word order, per se, is not the important factor.  Instead, the verb construction usually interpreted as the passive voice (e.g. \"the girl was pecked by the bird\") instead indicates that the more animate noun allowed the less animate noun to perform the action (e.g. \"the girl let herself be pecked by the bird\").  The idea is that things ranked higher in animacy are presumed to be in control of the situation, and that the less-animate thing can only act if the more-animate thing permits it.\n\n===Japanese===\nAlthough nouns in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are not marked for animacy, it has two [[copula (linguistics)|existential]]/[[possessive (linguistics)|possessive]] verbs; one for implicitly animate nouns (usually humans and animals) and one for implicitly inanimate nouns (often nonliving objects and plants). The verb ''iru'' (\u3044\u308b, also written \u5c45\u308b) is used to show the existence or possession of an animate noun. The verb ''aru'' (\u3042\u308b, sometimes written \u5728\u308b when existential or \u6709\u308b when possessive) is used to show the existence or possession of an inanimate noun.\n\nAn animate noun, there 'cat,' is marked as the subject of the verb with the subject particle ''ga'' (\u304c), but no [[topic-prominent language|topic]] or location is marked. That implies the noun is indefinite and merely exists.\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (1) \n| '''Neko'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''iru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n| \u732b\n| \u304c\n| \u3044\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n| cat\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'There is a cat.'\n|}\n\nIn the second example, a topic is introduced, in this case \"I\", with the topic particle ''wa'' (\u306f). The animate noun is again marked with a subject particle, and no location is denoted. That implies that the topic owns or is holding onto the noun.\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (2)\n| '''Watashi'''\n| '''ni'''\n| '''wa'''\n| '''neko'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''iru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n|\u79c1\n|\u306b\n|\u306f\n| \u732b\n| \u304c\n| \u3044\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n|I\n|LOC\n|TOPIC\n| cat\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'I have a cat.'\n|}\n\nIn the third example, the noun is marked as the topic (and by default functions as the subject of the verb) while a location, there the top of a chair, is marked with the location particle ''ni'' (\u306b). That implies that the noun is a definite noun and is at the specified location.\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (3)\n| '''Neko'''\n| '''wa''' \n| '''isu no ue'''\n| '''ni'''\n| '''iru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n|\u732b\n|\u306f\n| \u6905\u5b50\u306e\u4e0a\n| \u306b\n| \u3044\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n|cat\n|TOPIC\n| chair+NOUNCOORDINATOR+above/on\n| LOCATION\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'The cat is on the chair.'\n|}\n\nIn all those cases, if the noun is not animate, such as a stone, instead of a cat, the verb ''iru'' must be replaced with the verb ''aru'' (\u3042\u308b or \u6709\u308b[possessive]/\u5728\u308b[existential,locative]).\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (1) \n| '''Ishi'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''aru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n| \u77f3\n| \u304c\n| \u3042\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n| stone\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'There is a stone.'\n|}\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (2)\n| '''Watashi'''\n| '''ni'''\n| '''wa''' \n| '''ishi'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''aru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n|\u79c1\n|\u306b\n|\u306f\n| \u77f3\n| \u304c\n| \u3042\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n|I\n|LOC\n|TOPIC\n| stone\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'I have a stone.'\n|}\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (3)\n| '''Ishi'''\n| '''wa''' \n| '''isu no ue'''\n| '''ni'''\n| '''aru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n|\u77f3\n|\u306f\n| \u6905\u5b50\u306e\u4e0a\n| \u306b\n| \u3042\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n|stone\n|TOPIC\n| chair+NOUNCOORDINATOR+above/on\n| LOCATION\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'The stone is on the chair.'\n|}\n\nIn some cases in which 'natural' animacy is ambiguous, whether a noun is animate or not is the decision of the speaker, as in the case of a [[robot]], which could be correlated with the animate verb (to signify [[sentience]] or [[anthropomorphism]]) or with the inanimate verb (to emphasise that is a nonliving thing).\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (1) \n| '''Robotto'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''iru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n| \u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\n| \u304c\n| \u3044\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n| robot\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'There is a robot' (emphasis on its human-like behavior).\n|}\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (2) \n| '''Robotto'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''aru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n| \u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\n| \u304c\n| \u3042\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n| robot\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'There is a robot' (emphasis on its status as a nonliving thing).\n|}\n\n====Ryukyuan languages====\nThe [[Ryukyuan languages]], spoken in the [[Ryukyu Islands]] agree in animacy in their case systems.<ref>\nShimoji, Michinori; Pellard, Thomas, eds.

Retrieved August 21, 2012.\n</ref>\n\n===Slavic languages===\n====Overview====\n[[Slavic languages]] that have case (all of them except [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]), including [[Russian language|Russian]], have a somewhat complex hierarchy of animacy in which syntactically animate nouns may include both animate and inanimate objects (like mushrooms and dances).<ref name=Frarie>{{cite book|last=Frarie|first=Susan E.|title=Animacy in Czech and Russian|date=1992|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill}}</ref> Overall, the border between animate and inanimate places humans and animals in the former and plants, etc., in the latter, thus basing itself more so on sentience than life.<ref name=\"Frarie\" />\n\nAnimacy functions as a subgender through which noun cases intersect in a phenomenon called [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]], which here can be either [[grammatical case|nominative-accusative or genitive-accusative]]. Inanimate nouns have accusative forms that take on the same forms as their nominative, with animate nouns marked by having their accusative forms resemble the genitive.<ref name=Klenin>{{cite book|last=Klenin|first=Emily|title=Animacy in Russian: a new interpretation|date=1983|publisher=Slavica Publishers|location=Columbus, OH}}</ref>\nFor example, syncretism conditioned by referential animacy results in forms like the following:\n\n* NOM ''stol'' \u2018table\u2019 -> ACC stol, like nom -> GEN stola (exhibiting nom-acc syncretism);\n* NOM ''kot'' \u2018cat\u2019 -> ACC kota, like gen  -> GEN kota (exhibiting gen-acc syncretism).<ref name=\"Klenin\" />\n\nThat syncretism also occurs when restricted by declension class, resulting in syncretism in multiple [[Pronoun|pronominal forms]], such as the reflexive pronoun ''sebja'', personal pronouns, and the indefinite interrogative and relative pronoun ''kto''.<ref name=\"Klenin\" />\n\nIn their plural forms, nouns of all genders may distinguish the categories of animate vs. inanimate by that syncretism, but only masculine nouns of the first declension (and their modifiers) show it in the singular (Frarie 1992:12), and other declensions and genders of nouns \"restrict (morphological) expression of animacy to the plural\" (Frarie 1992:47).\n* Masc nouns that show '''acc-gen''' (sg & plural) syncretism: \u043c\u0443\u0436 [mu\u0282] husband, \u0441\u044b\u043d [s\u0268n] son, \u043b\u0435\u0432 [l\u02b2ef] lion, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u044c [kon\u02b2] horse.<ref name=\"Frarie\" />\n* Fem animate nouns

syntactically, such as in endings of modifiers for masc nouns of the second declension.<ref name=\"Frarie\" />\n\n====Animacy as a \"subgender\"====\nWhile animacy is viewed as primarily semantic when approached diachronically, a synchronic view suggests animacy as a sublevel of gender.<ref name=\"Klenin\" /> Syntactic gender is defined through patterns in agreement, not necessarily semantic value.<ref name=\"Klenin\" /> For example, Russian has \"common gender\" nouns that refer to traditionally masculine roles but act as syntactically feminine.<ref name=\"Klenin\" />\n\nAnimacy occurs as a subgender of nouns and modifiers (and pronouns only when adjectival) and is primarily reflected in modifier-head agreement (as opposed to subject-predicate agreement).\n\n====Controversy====\nSome consider the system to be based on marking inanimacy in which case the gen-acc distinguishes a \"non-inanimate\" subgender of nouns and modifiers,<ref name=\"Klenin\" /> and others claim that ultimately it is indeed animacy that is marked.<ref name=\"Frarie\" />\n\n===Sinhala===\nIn spoken [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], there are two [[copula (linguistics)|existential]]/[[possessive (linguistics)|possessive verbs]]: \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf ''hi\u0163inaw\u0101'' / \u0d89\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf ''innaw\u0101'' are used only for animate nouns (humans and animals), and \u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf ''tiyenaw\u0101'' for inanimate nouns (like nonliving objects, plants, things):\n{|\n|- align=center\n|

[[Spanish language|Spanish]], the preposition ''a'' (meaning \"to\" or \"at\") has gained a second role as a marker of concrete animate direct objects:\n{|\n| ''Veo esa catedral.''\n| \"I can see that cathedral.\"\n| (inanimate direct object)\n|- \n| ''Veo a esa persona'' \n| \"I can see that person.\"\n| (animate direct object)\n|-\n| ''Vengo a Espa\u00f1a.''\n| \"I come to Spain.\"\n| (''a'' used in its literal sense)\n|}\n\nThe usage is standard and is found around the Spanish-speaking world.\n\n====Pronouns====\nSpanish personal pronouns are generally omitted if the subject of the sentence, but when they are explicitly stated, they are used only with people or [[humanized animals]] or things. The inanimate subject pronoun in Spanish is ''ello'', like ''it'' in English.\n\nSpanish direct object pronouns (''me, te, lo, la, se, nos, os, los, las'') do not differentiate between animate and inanimate entities, and only the third persons have a gender distinction. Thus, for example, the third person singular feminine pronoun, ''la'', could refer to a woman, an animal (like ''mariposa'', butterfly), or an object (like ''casa'', house), if their genders are feminine.<ref>{{cite book | title=Diccionario panhisp\u00e1nico de dudas |year=2005 |publisher=Santillana Ediciones Generales |location=Bogot\u00e1 |isbn=958-704-368-5 | author=Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola.}}</ref>\n\nWith pronouns, there is a tendency to use ''le'' (which is usually an indirect object pronoun, meaning \"to him/her\") as a direct-object pronoun, at the expense of the direct-object pronouns ''lo/la'', if the referent is animate. That tendency is especially strong if (a) the pronoun is being used as a special second-person pronoun of respect, (b) the referent is male, (c) certain verbs are used, (d) the subject of the verb happens to be inanimate.  There is great regional variation as regards that usage.\n\n===Arabic===\nIn [[Classical Arabic|Classical]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]] and some other [[varieties of Arabic]], animacy has a limited application in the [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] of plural and [[dual form|dual]] nouns with verbs and adjectives. Verbs follow nouns in plural agreement only when the verb comes after the subject. When a verb comes before an explicit subject, the verb is always singular. Also, only animate plural and dual nouns take plural agreement; inanimate plural and dual nouns are always analyzed as singular feminine for the purpose of agreement. Thus, Arabic {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0646\u062f\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u064a\u0637\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627}} (''Al-muhandis\u016bn yu\u1e6d\u012br\u016bn 'il\u0101 'Alm\u0101niy\u0101'', \"The engineers fly to [[Germany]]\") is masculine plural agreement, but {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0626\u0631\u0627\u062a \u062a\u0637\u064a\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627}} (''Al-\u1e6d\u0101'ir\u0101t tu\u1e6d\u012br 'il\u0101 'Alm\u0101niy\u0101'', \"The planes fly to Germany\") is feminine singular.

In such languages, participants more animate are more likely to be the [[theta role|agent]] of the verb, and therefore are marked in an accusative pattern: unmarked in the agent role and marked in the patient or oblique role.\n\nLikewise, less animate participants are inherently more patient-like, and take ergative marking: unmarked when in the patient role and marked when in the agent role. The hierarchy of animacy generally, but not always, is ordered:\n{| \n| ''1st person''\n| > || ''2nd person''\n| > || ''3rd person''\n| > || ''proper names''\n| > || ''humans''\n| > || {{unbulleted list|''non-humans''|''animates''}}\n| > || ''inanimates''\n|}\nThe location of the split (the line which divides the inherently agentive participants from the inherently patientive participants) varies from language to language, and, in many cases, the two classes overlap, with a class of nouns near the middle of the hierarchy being marked for both the agent and patient roles.\n\n===Hierarchical alignment===\nIn a [[direct\u2013inverse language]], clauses with [[transitive verb]]s can be expressed with either a direct or an inverse construction. The direct construction is used when the subject of the transitive clause outranks the object in salience or animacy. The inverse construction is used when the \"notional object\" outranks the \"notional subject\".\n\n===Thematic roles===\nA noun essentially requires the traits of animacy in order to receive the role of Actor and Experiencer. Additionally, the Agent role is generally assigned to the NP with highest ranking in the animacy hierarchy \u2013 ultimately, only animate beings can function as true agents.<ref name=\"Szewczyk\" /> Similarly, languages universally tend to place animate nouns earlier in the sentence than inanimate nouns.<ref name=\"Szewczyk\" />\nAnimacy is a key component of agency \u2013 combined with other factors like \"awareness of action\".<ref name=\"Yamamoto\" /> Agency and animacy are intrinsically linked \u2013 with each as a \"conceptual property\" of the other.<ref name=\"Yamamoto\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Grammatical gender]]\n* [[Noun class]]\n* [[Classifier (linguistics)]]\n\n==References==\n* Frishberg, Nancy.

Widely expressed, animacy is one of the most elementary principles in languages around the globe and is a distinction acquired as early as six months of age.<ref name=Szewczyk>{{cite journal|last=Szewczyk|first=Jakub M.|last2=Schriefers|first2=Herbert|title=Is animacy special?

Benjamins Pub. Co.|location=Amsterdam|page=36}}</ref> Typically (with some variation of order and of where the cutoff for animacy occurs), the scale ranks humans above animals, then plants, natural forces, concrete objects, and abstract objects, in that order. In referring to humans, this scale contains a hierarchy of persons, ranking the first and second person [[pronoun]]s above the third person, partly a product of empathy, involving the speaker and [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]].<ref name=\"Yamamoto\" />\n\n==Examples==\nThe distinction between ''he'', ''she'', and [[Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns|other personal pronouns]], on one hand, and ''it'', on the other hand is a distinction in animacy in [[English language|English]] and in many [[Indo-European languages]]. The same can be said about distinction between ''who'' and ''what''. Some languages, such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Spoken Finnish]] do not distinguish between ''s/he'' and ''it''. In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], there is a distinction in animacy between ''[[wikt:h\u00e4n#Finnish|h\u00e4n]]'' \"he/she\" and ''[[wikt:se#Finnish|se]]'' \"it\", but in [[Spoken Finnish]], ''se'' can mean \"he/she\". English shows a similar lack of distinction between ''they'' animate and ''they'' inanimate in the plural but, as shown above, it has such a distinction in the singular.\n\nThere is another example of how animacy plays some role in English. For example, the higher animacy a referent has, the less preferable it is to use the preposition ''of'' for possession (that can also be interpreted in terms of alienable or [[inalienable possession]]):\n* ''My face'' is correct while <nowiki>*</nowiki>''the face of me'' would sound very strange.\n* ''The man's face'' and ''the face of the man'' are both correct, but the former is preferred.\n* ''The clock's face'' and ''the face of the clock'' are both correct.\n\nExamples of languages in which an animacy hierarchy is important include the [[Totonac language]] in [[Mexico]] and the [[Southern Athabaskan languages]] (such as [[Western Apache]] and [[Navajo language|Navajo]]) whose animacy hierarchy has been the subject of intense study. The [[Tamil language]] has a [[grammatical gender|noun classification]] based on animacy.\n\n===Proto-Indo-European language===\nBecause of the similarities in morphology of feminine and masculine [[grammatical gender#Masculine, feminine, and neuter|grammatical gender]] inflections in [[Indo-European languages]], there is a theory that in an early stage, the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] had only two grammatical genders: \"[[Grammatical gender#Animate and inanimate|animate]]\" and \"[[Grammatical gender#Common and neuter|inanimate/neuter]]\"; the most obvious difference being that inanimate/neuter nouns used the same form for the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], and [[accusative case|accusative]] [[noun case]]s. The distinction was preserved in [[Anatolian languages]] like [[Hittite language|Hittite]], all of which are now extinct. ([[Sanskrit]] still preserves this form for neuter gender nouns - nominative and accusative forms are the same.)\n\nThe animate gender would then later, after the separation of the Anatolian languages, have developed into the feminine and masculine genders. The plural of neuter/inanimate nouns is believed to have had the same ending as [[collective noun]]s in the singular, and some words with the collective noun ending in singular were later to become words with the feminine gender. Traces can be found in [[Ancient Greek]] in which the singular form of verbs was used when they referred to neuter words in plural. In many Indo-European languages, such as [[Latin]] and the [[Slavic languages]], the plural ending of many neuter words in the merged nominative\u2013accusative\u2013vocative corresponds to the feminine singular nominative form.\n\n===Navajo===\nLike most other [[Athabaskan languages]], [[Southern Athabaskan languages]] show various levels of animacy in their grammar, with certain nouns taking specific verb forms according to their rank in this animacy hierarchy. For instance, [[Navajo language|Navajo]] nouns can be ranked by animacy on a continuum from most animate (a human) to least animate (an abstraction) (Young & Morgan 1987: 65-66):\n\nHuman > Infant/Big Animal > Medium-sized Animal > Small Animal > Natural Force > Abstraction\n\nGenerally, the most animate noun in a sentence must occur first while the noun with lesser animacy occurs second. If both nouns are equal in animacy, either noun can occur in the first position. Both sentences (1) and (2) are correct. The ''yi-'' prefix on the verb indicates that the first noun is the subject and ''bi-'' indicates that the second noun is the subject.\n\n{|\n| (1) \n| '''Ashkii'''\n| '''at\u2019\u00e9\u00e9d'''\n| '''yin\u00ed\u0142\u2019\u012f\u0301'''\n|-\n|\n| boy\n| girl\n| ''yi''-look\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'The boy is looking at the girl.'\n|}\n\n{|\n| (2) \n| '''At\u2019\u00e9\u00e9d'''\n| '''ashkii'''\n| '''bin\u00ed\u0142\u2019\u012f\u0301'''\n|-\n|\n| girl\n| boy\n| ''bi''-look\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'The girl is being looked at by the boy.'\n|}\n\nSentence (3), however, sounds wrong to most Navajo speakers because the less animate noun occurs before the more animate noun:\n\n{|\n| (3) \n| '''*Ts\u00eddii'''\n| '''at\u2019\u00e9\u00e9d'''\n| '''yisht\u0105sh'''\n|-\n|\n| bird\n| girl\n| ''yi''-pecked\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|*'The bird pecked the girl.'\n|}\n\nIn order to express that idea, the more animate noun must occur first, as in sentence (4):\n\n{|\n| (4) \n| '''At\u2019\u00e9\u00e9d'''\n| '''ts\u00eddii'''\n| '''bisht\u0105sh'''\n|-\n|\n| girl\n| bird\n| ''bi''-pecked\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'The girl was pecked by the bird.'\n|}\n\nThere is evidence suggesting that the word order, per se, is not the important factor.  Instead, the verb construction usually interpreted as the passive voice (e.g. \"the girl was pecked by the bird\") instead indicates that the more animate noun allowed the less animate noun to perform the action (e.g. \"the girl let herself be pecked by the bird\").  The idea is that things ranked higher in animacy are presumed to be in control of the situation, and that the less-animate thing can only act if the more-animate thing permits it.\n\n===Japanese===\nAlthough nouns in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are not marked for animacy, it has two [[copula (linguistics)|existential]]/[[possessive (linguistics)|possessive]] verbs; one for implicitly animate nouns (usually humans and animals) and one for implicitly inanimate nouns (often nonliving objects and plants). The verb ''iru'' (\u3044\u308b, also written \u5c45\u308b) is used to show the existence or possession of an animate noun. The verb ''aru'' (\u3042\u308b, sometimes written \u5728\u308b when existential or \u6709\u308b when possessive) is used to show the existence or possession of an inanimate noun.\n\nAn animate noun, there 'cat,' is marked as the subject of the verb with the subject particle ''ga'' (\u304c), but no [[topic-prominent language|topic]] or location is marked. That implies the noun is indefinite and merely exists.\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (1) \n| '''Neko'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''iru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n| \u732b\n| \u304c\n| \u3044\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n| cat\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'There is a cat.'\n|}\n\nIn the second example, a topic is introduced, in this case \"I\", with the topic particle ''wa'' (\u306f). The animate noun is again marked with a subject particle, and no location is denoted. That implies that the topic owns or is holding onto the noun.\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (2)\n| '''Watashi'''\n| '''ni'''\n| '''wa'''\n| '''neko'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''iru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n|\u79c1\n|\u306b\n|\u306f\n| \u732b\n| \u304c\n| \u3044\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n|I\n|LOC\n|TOPIC\n| cat\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'I have a cat.'\n|}\n\nIn the third example, the noun is marked as the topic (and by default functions as the subject of the verb) while a location, there the top of a chair, is marked with the location particle ''ni'' (\u306b). That implies that the noun is a definite noun and is at the specified location.\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (3)\n| '''Neko'''\n| '''wa''' \n| '''isu no ue'''\n| '''ni'''\n| '''iru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n|\u732b\n|\u306f\n| \u6905\u5b50\u306e\u4e0a\n| \u306b\n| \u3044\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n|cat\n|TOPIC\n| chair+NOUNCOORDINATOR+above/on\n| LOCATION\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'The cat is on the chair.'\n|}\n\nIn all those cases, if the noun is not animate, such as a stone, instead of a cat, the verb ''iru'' must be replaced with the verb ''aru'' (\u3042\u308b or \u6709\u308b[possessive]/\u5728\u308b[existential,locative]).\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (1) \n| '''Ishi'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''aru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n| \u77f3\n| \u304c\n| \u3042\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n| stone\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'There is a stone.'\n|}\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (2)\n| '''Watashi'''\n| '''ni'''\n| '''wa''' \n| '''ishi'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''aru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n|\u79c1\n|\u306b\n|\u306f\n| \u77f3\n| \u304c\n| \u3042\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n|I\n|LOC\n|TOPIC\n| stone\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'I have a stone.'\n|}\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (3)\n| '''Ishi'''\n| '''wa''' \n| '''isu no ue'''\n| '''ni'''\n| '''aru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n|\u77f3\n|\u306f\n| \u6905\u5b50\u306e\u4e0a\n| \u306b\n| \u3042\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n|stone\n|TOPIC\n| chair+NOUNCOORDINATOR+above/on\n| LOCATION\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'The stone is on the chair.'\n|}\n\nIn some cases in which 'natural' animacy is ambiguous, whether a noun is animate or not is the decision of the speaker, as in the case of a [[robot]], which could be correlated with the animate verb (to signify [[sentience]] or [[anthropomorphism]]) or with the inanimate verb (to emphasise that is a nonliving thing).\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (1) \n| '''Robotto'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''iru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n| \u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\n| \u304c\n| \u3044\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n| robot\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'There is a robot' (emphasis on its human-like behavior).\n|}\n\n{|\n|- align=center\n| (2) \n| '''Robotto'''\n| '''ga'''\n| '''aru.'''\n|- align=center\n|\n| \u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\n| \u304c\n| \u3042\u308b\n|- align=center\n|\n| robot\n| SUBJECT\n| to exist\n|- align=left \n|\n| colspan=\"3\"|'There is a robot' (emphasis on its status as a nonliving thing).\n|}\n\n====Ryukyuan languages====\nThe [[Ryukyuan languages]], spoken in the [[Ryukyu Islands]] agree in animacy in their case systems.<ref>\nShimoji, Michinori; Pellard, Thomas, eds.

Inanimate nouns have accusative forms that take on the same forms as their nominative, with animate nouns marked by having their accusative forms resemble the genitive.<ref name=Klenin>{{cite book|last=Klenin|first=Emily|title=Animacy in Russian: a new interpretation|date=1983|publisher=Slavica Publishers|location=Columbus, OH}}</ref>\nFor example, syncretism conditioned by referential animacy results in forms like the following:\n\n* NOM ''stol'' \u2018table\u2019 -> ACC stol, like nom -> GEN stola (exhibiting nom-acc syncretism);\n* NOM ''kot'' \u2018cat\u2019 -> ACC kota, like gen  -> GEN kota (exhibiting gen-acc syncretism).<ref name=\"Klenin\" />\n\nThat syncretism also occurs when restricted by declension class, resulting in syncretism in multiple [[Pronoun|pronominal forms]], such as the reflexive pronoun ''sebja'', personal pronouns, and the indefinite interrogative and relative pronoun ''kto''.<ref name=\"Klenin\" />\n\nIn their plural forms, nouns of all genders may distinguish the categories of animate vs. inanimate by that syncretism, but only masculine nouns of the first declension (and their modifiers) show it in the singular (Frarie 1992:12), and other declensions and genders of nouns \"restrict (morphological) expression of animacy to the plural\" (Frarie 1992:47).\n* Masc nouns that show '''acc-gen''' (sg & plural) syncretism: \u043c\u0443\u0436 [mu\u0282] husband, \u0441\u044b\u043d [s\u0268n] son, \u043b\u0435\u0432 [l\u02b2ef] lion, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u044c [kon\u02b2] horse.<ref name=\"Frarie\" />\n* Fem animate nouns

syntactically, such as in endings of modifiers for masc nouns of the second declension.<ref name=\"Frarie\" />\n\n====Animacy as a \"subgender\"====\nWhile animacy is viewed as primarily semantic when approached diachronically, a synchronic view suggests animacy as a sublevel of gender.<ref name=\"Klenin\" /> Syntactic gender is defined through patterns in agreement, not necessarily semantic value.<ref name=\"Klenin\" /> For example, Russian has \"common gender\" nouns that refer to traditionally masculine roles but act as syntactically feminine.<ref name=\"Klenin\" />\n\nAnimacy occurs as a subgender of nouns and modifiers (and pronouns only when adjectival) and is primarily reflected in modifier-head agreement (as opposed to subject-predicate agreement).\n\n====Controversy====\nSome consider the system to be based on marking inanimacy in which case the gen-acc distinguishes a \"non-inanimate\" subgender of nouns and modifiers,<ref

[[Spanish language|Spanish]], the preposition ''a'' (meaning \"to\" or \"at\") has gained a second role as a marker of concrete animate direct objects:\n{|\n| ''Veo esa catedral.''\n| \"I can see that cathedral.\"\n| (inanimate direct object)\n|- \n| ''Veo a esa persona'' \n| \"I can see that person.\"\n| (animate direct object)\n|-\n| ''Vengo a Espa\u00f1a.''\n| \"I come to Spain.\"\n| (''a'' used in its literal sense)\n|}\n\nThe usage is standard and is found around the Spanish-speaking world.\n\n====Pronouns====\nSpanish personal pronouns are generally omitted if the subject of the sentence, but when they are explicitly stated, they are used only with people or [[humanized animals]] or things. The inanimate subject pronoun in Spanish is ''ello'', like ''it'' in English.\n\nSpanish direct object pronouns (''me, te, lo, la, se, nos, os, los, las'') do not differentiate between animate and inanimate entities, and only the third persons have a gender distinction. Thus, for example, the third person singular feminine pronoun, ''la'', could refer to a woman, an animal (like ''mariposa'', butterfly), or an object (like ''casa'', house), if their genders are feminine.<ref>{{cite book | title=Diccionario panhisp\u00e1nico de dudas |year=2005 |publisher=Santillana Ediciones Generales |location=Bogot\u00e1 |isbn=958-704-368-5 | author=Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola.}}</ref>\n\nWith pronouns, there is a tendency to use ''le'' (which is usually an indirect object pronoun, meaning \"to him/her\") as a direct-object pronoun, at the expense of the direct-object pronouns ''lo/la'', if the referent is animate. That tendency is especially strong if (a) the pronoun is being used as a special second-person pronoun of respect, (b) the referent is male, (c) certain verbs are used, (d) the subject of the verb happens to be inanimate.  There is great regional variation as regards that usage.\n\n===Arabic===\nIn [[Classical Arabic|Classical]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]] and some other [[varieties of Arabic]], animacy has a limited application in the [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] of plural and [[dual form|dual]] nouns with verbs and adjectives. Verbs follow nouns in plural agreement only when the verb comes after the subject. When a verb comes before an explicit subject, the verb is always singular. Also, only animate plural and dual nouns take plural agreement; inanimate plural and dual nouns are always analyzed as singular feminine for the purpose of agreement. Thus, Arabic {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0646\u062f\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u064a\u0637\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627}} (''Al-muhandis\u016bn yu\u1e6d\u012br\u016bn 'il\u0101 'Alm\u0101niy\u0101'', \"The engineers fly to [[Germany]]\") is masculine plural agreement, but {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0626\u0631\u0627\u062a \u062a\u0637\u064a\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627}} (''Al-\u1e6d\u0101'ir\u0101t tu\u1e6d\u012br 'il\u0101 'Alm\u0101niy\u0101'', \"The planes fly to Germany\") is feminine singular.

Animals fall in the latter category, but their status may change depending on the usage, especially with personification. Different writers might use {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0637\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627}} (''Al-ghurb\u0101n yu\u1e6d\u012br\u016bn 'il\u0101 'Alm\u0101niy\u0101'') or {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0637\u064a\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627}} (''Al-ghurb\u0101n tu\u1e6d\u012br 'il\u0101 'Alm\u0101niy\u0101'') for \"The ravens fly to Germany.\"\n\n==Animacy hierarchy and morphosyntactic alignment==\n\n===Split ergativity===\nAnimacy can also condition the nature of the morphologies of [[split ergativity|split-ergative]] languages. In such languages, participants more animate are more likely to be the [[theta role|agent]] of the verb, and therefore are marked in an accusative pattern: unmarked in the agent role and marked in the patient or oblique role.\n\nLikewise, less animate participants are inherently more patient-like, and take ergative marking: unmarked when in the patient role and marked when in the agent role. The hierarchy of animacy generally, but not always, is ordered:\n{| \n| ''1st person''\n| > || ''2nd person''\n| > || ''3rd person''\n| > || ''proper names''\n| > || ''humans''\n| > || {{unbulleted list|''non-humans''|''animates''}}\n| > || ''inanimates''\n|}\nThe location of the split (the line which divides the inherently agentive participants from the inherently patientive participants) varies from language to language, and, in many cases, the two classes overlap, with a class of nouns near the middle of the hierarchy being marked for both the agent and patient roles.\n\n===Hierarchical alignment===\nIn a [[direct\u2013inverse language]], clauses with [[transitive verb]]s can be expressed with either a direct or an inverse construction. The direct construction is used when the subject of the transitive clause outranks the object in salience or animacy. The inverse construction is used when the \"notional object\" outranks the \"notional subject\".\n\n===Thematic roles===\nA noun essentially requires the traits of animacy in order to receive the role of Actor and Experiencer. Additionally, the Agent role is generally assigned to the NP with highest ranking in the animacy hierarchy \u2013 ultimately, only animate beings can function as true agents.<ref name=\"Szewczyk\" /> Similarly, languages universally tend to place animate nouns earlier in the sentence than inanimate nouns.<ref name=\"Szewczyk\" />\nAnimacy is a key component of agency \u2013 combined with other factors like \"awareness of action\".<ref name=\"Yamamoto\" /> Agency and animacy are intrinsically linked \u2013 with each as a \"conceptual property\" of the other.<ref name=\"Yamamoto\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Grammatical gender]]\n* [[Noun class]]\n* [[Classifier (linguistics)]]\n\n==References==\n* Frishberg, Nancy.

It received widespread critical acclaim;<ref name=\":0\" /> Hurt won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]] for Best Actor, and the film received a further three Oscar nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film tells of two very different individuals who share a prison cell in Brazil during the [[Brazilian military government]]: Valentin Arregui, who is imprisoned (and has been tortured) due to his activities on behalf of a leftist revolutionary group, and Luis Molina, an effeminate [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] in prison for having sex with an underage boy.\n\nMolina passes the time by recounting memories from one of his favorite films, a wartime romantic thriller that's also a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda film]]. He weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens him up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over his shallow views of film watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two.\n\nAs the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if he succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group.\n\nWhen Molina declares himself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina's last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades. Molina at first refuses to take the number, fearing the consequences of treason, but he relents, bidding Valentin farewell with a kiss.\n\nNow out of prison, Molina calls the telephone number, and a meeting is arranged with the revolutionary group. But the secret police have had Molina under surveillance, and at the rendezvous, a gun battle occurs, with the revolutionaries shooting Molina. As he wanders the streets wounded, the secret police catch him and demand the telephone number, but Molina refuses and dies. On the orders of the police chief, the policemen dump Molina's body in a rubbish pit and fabricate a story about his death and his presumed collaboration with the revolutionary group.\n\nIn the prison, Valentin is being treated after being tortured. After a sympathetic doctor risks his job by administering [[morphine]] to help him sleep, Valentin finds himself on an idyllic tropical island with Marta.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[William Hurt]] as Luis Molina<ref name=\"festivalcannes\">[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/932/year/1985.html \u00abKISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN\u00bb]</ref>\n* [[Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1]] as Valentin Arregui\n* [[Sonia Braga]] as Leni Lamaison/Marta/Spider Woman\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Lewgoy]] as Warden\n* [[Milton Gon\u00e7alves]] as Secret Policeman\n* [[M\u00edriam Pires]] as Molina's mother\n* [[Nuno Leal Maia]] as Gabriel, Molina's friend\n* [[Fernando Torres (actor)|Fernando Torres]] as Americo\n* Patricio Bisso as Greta\n* [[Herson Capri]] as Werner, Leni's German lover and Chief of Counter-Intelligence in movie fantasy\n* [[Denise Dumont]] as Michelle, Leni's best friend in movie fantasy\n* Ant\u00f4nio Petrin as Clubfoot, Resistance fighter in movie fantasy\n* Wilson Grey as Flunky, Resistance fighter in movie fantasy\n*[[Ana Maria Braga]] as Lidia, Valentin's girlfriend\n*[[Sergio Kato]] as Martim, Molina's friend\n* [[Miguel Falabella]] as Lieutenant\n}}\n\n\n==Background==\nThe film is based on the 1976 novel ''El beso de la mujer ara\u00f1a'' (''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'') by [[Manuel Puig]]. The Argentinian author was the first to adapt his own novel as a [[Kiss of the Spider Woman (play)|stage play]]. A Broadway musical [[Kiss of the Spider Woman (musical)|of the same name]], also based on the novel, was produced in 1993.\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nAs noted in Puig's 2001 biography, ''Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman: His Life and Fictions,'' the novel was banned in Argentina, and the English translation edition preceded a widespread publication in Spanish. The novel was considered for a film adaptation by various directors, including [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]. In 1981, Argentine-born director [[H\u00e9ctor Babenco]] was in Los Angeles, to accept an award from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] for his breakout feature film, ''[[Pixote]]''. At the reception, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] asked Babenco about his future projects, and the director mentioned his desire to adapt Puig's novel, starring [[Burt Lancaster]]. The actor was in attendance at the event, and Thomas introduced him to Babenco. \n\nWhen Lancaster expressed interest, Babenco initially assumed he was disingenuous, but promised to send him a copy of the novel. Several days later, Lancaster's assistant telephoned Babenco to make sure ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' was in the mail, and the director sent it right away. The two met in the coming weeks at the New York Critics\u2019 award ceremony, and Lancaster committed to the role of Molina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/kiss-of-the-spider-woman-william-hurt-125185008702.html|title=William Hurt Looks Back at 'Kiss of the Spider Woman,' the Groundbreaking, Oscar-Winning Drama Turning 30 This Month|date=27 July 2015|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Although Lancaster was attached'','' giving it built in marketability, the novel's untraditional narrative made it a challenge to adapt, and its homosexual theme was perceived as a detriment to attracting widespread audiences. Babenco, who was an expatriate in Brazil at that time, feared a xenophobic backlash against the production for casting American actors. Additional obstacles to the production included Manuel Puig's antagonism toward Babenco; he did not like ''Pixote,'' and suspected the director was an \u201copportunist.\u201d\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nBabenco continued to develop the property despite the author's misgivings, and attracted potential investors, including German filmmaker [[Frank Ripploh]]. [[Richard Gere]] was set to play Valentin, giving the production further box-office credibility''.'' New York City socialite [[Jane Holzer]], who appeared in several [[Andy Warhol]] films and was an acquaintance of David Weisman, agreed to finance initial production costs, and [[Leonard Schrader]], who had collaborated with his brother, [[Paul Schrader]], on ''[[The Yakuza]]'', was hired to write the script. However, Babenco remained wary of anglicizing the source material, and was relieved by the casting of Puerto Rican actor [[Raul Julia]], who replaced Richard Gere.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors circulated in the press that Lancaster had a penchant for cross-dressing, and Babenco attempted to dispel the scandal at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] by telling a French gay tabloid that he did not know Lancaster was homosexual when he was cast''.'' Although Babenco intended to imply that Lancaster was not gay, and his sexual orientation had nothing to do with the actor's involvement with the film, his statement was taken out of context when it was published, and prompted further inquisition into Lancaster's personal life. This, along with Lancaster's advancing age, and a heart bypass operation in Apr 1983, caused the production to be delayed, and the filmmakers turned to [[William Hurt]] as a replacement. The morning after Hurt consented to the role, Weisman and Babenco met with independent producer [[Ray Stark]], whose company, Rastar, had been acquired by Columbia Pictures. Stark agreed to take on the project at that time, but neither he nor Columbia are credited onscreen.\n\nThe picture's expected $1.5 million budget was financed in part by Brazil's [[Embrafilme]], which purchased Brazilian distribution rights for $160,000. Below-the-line expenses were raised by Babenco's HB Filmes, and international production services were funded by Weisman's Sugarloaf Films, Inc. The crew was mainly Brazilian, accompanied by several Argentine-born craftsmen''.'' Rehearsals took place in a S\u00e3o Paulo prison that had been vacated in the wake of riots, and sets were constructed at Vera Cruz Studios, which had been abandoned due to bankruptcy.\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe film's setting was relocated from [[Argentina]] to [[Brazil]], with the added political context of the then-current [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian military dictatorship]].\n\nThe story features a \"[[Story within a story|film within a film]]\", featuring Luis Molina episodically telling Valentin Arregui the plot of a fictional film called ''Her Real Glory'' ostensibly produced in [[Germany]] during [[World War II|Second World War]] by the [[Nazis]]. \n\nWhile the book alludes to five motion pictures, the film version focuses on a single Nazi propaganda movie. Puig biographer [[Suzanne Jill Levine]] identified the film as a compilation of various Third Reich productions with the American [[Paris Underground (film)|''Paris Underground'']] and [[Die gro\u00dfe Liebe (1931 film)|''Die gro\u00dfe Liebe'']] ''(The Great Love),'' a 1931 [[Otto Preminger]] film starring [[Zarah Leander]] as a cabaret singer who falls in love with high-ranking German lieutenant. Leander was the model for the ''Kiss of the Spider Woman\u2019s'' \u201cLeni Lamaison,\u201d who was named after propaganda filmmaker [[Leni Riefenstahl]].\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began October 13, 1983 in [[S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]]. Since Babenco \"rarely\" spoke English, Hurt took direction from him via an [[assistant director]].<ref name=\"iw\" /> Hurt and Julia had agreed to work for the [[Screen Actors Guild]] pay scale, and deferred the greater portion of their salaries for a profit-share in the sale of the film's distribution rights, as well as its box-office gross. While Babenco and Weisman were also working for the same \u201cdeferred investment plan,\u201d other players, including actress [[S\u00f4nia Braga]], opted to be paid upfront. During filming in Brazil, Hurt and a friend were threatened at gunpoint but were let go several hours later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124043013|title=William Hurt: In Every Role, A New Life To Inhabit|date=25 February 2010|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nThe film received positive reviews.

It received widespread critical acclaim;<ref name=\":0\" /> Hurt won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]] for Best Actor, and the film received a further three Oscar nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film tells of two very different individuals who share a prison cell in Brazil during the [[Brazilian military government]]: Valentin Arregui, who is imprisoned (and has been tortured) due to his activities on behalf of a leftist revolutionary group, and Luis Molina, an effeminate [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] in prison for having sex with an underage boy.\n\nMolina passes the time by recounting memories from one of his favorite films, a wartime romantic thriller that's also a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[propaganda film]]. He weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens him up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over his shallow views of film watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two.\n\nAs the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if he succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group.\n\nWhen Molina declares himself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina's last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades. Molina at first refuses to take the number, fearing the consequences of treason, but he relents, bidding Valentin farewell with a kiss.\n\nNow out of prison, Molina calls the telephone number, and a meeting is arranged with the revolutionary group. But the secret police have had Molina under surveillance, and at the rendezvous, a gun battle occurs, with the revolutionaries shooting Molina. As he wanders the streets wounded, the secret police catch him and demand the telephone number, but Molina refuses and dies. On the orders of the police chief, the policemen dump Molina's body in a rubbish pit and fabricate a story about his death and his presumed collaboration with the revolutionary group.\n\nIn the prison, Valentin is being treated after being tortured. After a sympathetic doctor risks his job by administering [[morphine]] to help him sleep, Valentin finds himself on an idyllic tropical island with Marta.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[William Hurt]] as Luis Molina<ref name=\"festivalcannes\">[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/932/year/1985.html \u00abKISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN\u00bb]</ref>\n* [[Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1]] as Valentin Arregui\n* [[Sonia Braga]] as Leni Lamaison/Marta/Spider Woman\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Lewgoy]] as Warden\n* [[Milton Gon\u00e7alves]] as Secret Policeman\n* [[M\u00edriam Pires]] as Molina's mother\n* [[Nuno Leal Maia]] as Gabriel, Molina's friend\n* [[Fernando Torres (actor)|Fernando Torres]] as Americo\n* Patricio Bisso as Greta\n* [[Herson Capri]] as Werner, Leni's German lover and Chief of Counter-Intelligence in movie fantasy\n* [[Denise Dumont]] as Michelle, Leni's best friend in movie fantasy\n* Ant\u00f4nio Petrin as Clubfoot, Resistance fighter in movie fantasy\n* Wilson Grey as Flunky, Resistance fighter in movie fantasy\n*[[Ana Maria Braga]] as Lidia, Valentin's girlfriend\n*[[Sergio Kato]] as Martim, Molina's friend\n* [[Miguel Falabella]] as Lieutenant\n}}\n\n\n==Background==\nThe film is based on the 1976 novel ''El beso de la mujer ara\u00f1a'' (''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'') by [[Manuel Puig]]. The Argentinian author was the first to adapt his own novel as a [[Kiss of the Spider Woman (play)|stage play]]. A Broadway musical [[Kiss of the Spider Woman (musical)|of the same name]], also based on the novel, was produced in 1993.\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\nAs noted in Puig\u2019s 2001 biography, ''Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman: His Life and Fictions,'' the novel was banned in Argentina, and the English translation edition preceded a widespread publication in Spanish. The novel was considered for a film adaptation by various directors, including [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]. In 1981, Argentine-born director [[H\u00e9ctor Babenco]] was in Los Angeles, to accept an award from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] for his breakout feature film, ''[[Pixote]]''. At the reception, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic [[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] asked Babenco about his future projects, and the director mentioned his desire to adapt Puig\u2019s novel, starring [[Burt Lancaster]]. The actor was in attendance at the event, and Thomas introduced him to Babenco. \n\nWhen Lancaster expressed interest, Babenco initially assumed he was disingenuous, but promised to send him a copy of the novel. Several days later, Lancaster\u2019s assistant telephoned Babenco to make sure ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' was in the mail, and the director sent it right away. The two met in the coming weeks at the New York Critics\u2019 award ceremony, and Lancaster committed to the role of Molina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/kiss-of-the-spider-woman-william-hurt-125185008702.html|title=William Hurt Looks Back at 'Kiss of the Spider Woman,' the Groundbreaking, Oscar-Winning Drama Turning 30 This Month|date=27 July 2015|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Although Lancaster was attached'','' giving it built in marketability, the novel\u2019s untraditional narrative made it a challenge to adapt, and its homosexual theme was perceived as a detriment to attracting widespread audiences. Babenco, who was an expatriate in Brazil at that time, feared a xenophobic backlash against the production for casting American actors. Additional obstacles to the production included Manuel Puig\u2019s antagonism toward Babenco; he did not like ''Pixote,'' and suspected the director was an \u201copportunist.\u201d\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nBabenco continued to develop the property despite the author\u2019s misgivings, and attracted potential investors, including German filmmaker [[Frank Ripploh]]. [[Richard Gere]] was set to play Valentin, giving the production further box-office credibility''.'' New York City socialite [[Jane Holzer]], who appeared in several [[Andy Warhol]] films and was an acquaintance of David Weisman, agreed to finance initial production costs, and [[Leonard Schrader]], who had collaborated with his brother, [[Paul Schrader]], on ''[[The Yakuza]]'', was hired to write the script. However, Babenco remained wary of anglicizing the source material, and was relieved by the casting of Puerto Rican actor [[Raul Julia]], who replaced Richard Gere.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors circulated in the press that Lancaster had a penchant for cross-dressing, and Babenco attempted to dispel the scandal at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] by telling a French gay tabloid that he did not know Lancaster was homosexual when he was cast''.'' Although Babenco intended to imply that Lancaster was not gay, and his sexual orientation had nothing to do with the actor\u2019s involvement with the film, his statement was taken out of context when it was published, and prompted further inquisition into Lancaster\u2019s personal life. This, along with Lancaster\u2019s advancing age, and a heart bypass operation in Apr 1983, caused the production to be delayed, and the filmmakers turned to [[William Hurt]] as a replacement. The morning after Hurt consented to the role, Weisman and Babenco met with independent producer [[Ray Stark]], whose company, Rastar, had been acquired by Columbia Pictures. Stark agreed to take on the project at that time, but neither he nor Columbia are credited onscreen.\n\nThe picture\u2019s expected $1.5 million budget was financed in part by Brazil\u2019s [[Embrafilme]], which purchased Brazilian distribution rights for $160,000. Below-the-line expenses were raised by Babenco\u2019s HB Filmes, and international production services were funded by Weisman\u2019s Sugarloaf Films, Inc. The crew was mainly Brazilian, accompanied by several Argentine-born craftsmen''.'' Rehearsals took place in a S\u00e3o Paulo prison that had been vacated in the wake of riots, and sets were constructed at Vera Cruz Studios, which had been abandoned due to bankruptcy.\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe film's setting was relocated from [[Argentina]] to [[Brazil]], with the added political context of the then-current [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian military dictatorship]].\n\nThe story features a \"[[Story within a story|film within a film]]\", featuring Luis Molina episodically telling Valentin Arregui the plot of a fictional film called ''Her Real Glory'' ostensibly produced in [[Germany]] during [[World War II|Second World War]] by the [[Nazis]]. \n\nWhile the book alludes to five motion pictures, the film version focuses on a single Nazi propaganda movie. Puig biographer [[Suzanne Jill Levine]] identified the film as a compilation of various Third Reich productions with the American [[Paris Underground (film)|''Paris Underground'']] and [[Die gro\u00dfe Liebe (1931 film)|''Die gro\u00dfe Liebe'']] ''(The Great Love),'' a 1931 [[Otto Preminger]] film starring [[Zarah Leander]] as a cabaret singer who falls in love with high-ranking German lieutenant. Leander was the model for the ''Kiss of the Spider Woman\u2019s'' \u201cLeni Lamaison,\u201d who was named after propaganda filmmaker [[Leni Riefenstahl]].\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began October 13, 1983 in [[S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]]. Since Babenco \"rarely\" spoke English, Hurt took direction from him via an [[assistant director]].<ref name=\"iw\" /> Hurt and Julia had agreed to work for the [[Screen Actors Guild]] pay scale, and deferred the greater portion of their salaries for a profit-share in the sale of the film\u2019s distribution rights, as well as its box-office gross. While Babenco and Weisman were also working for the same \u201cdeferred investment plan,\u201d other players, including actress [[S\u00f4nia Braga]], opted to be paid upfront. During filming in Brazil, Hurt and a friend were threatened at gunpoint but were let go several hours later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124043013|title=William Hurt: In Every Role, A New Life To Inhabit|date=25 February 2010|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nThe film received positive reviews.

Stoner and Peter A. Conway.<ref name=var/>\n\nThe film was released on October 21, 2016, by [[IFC Midnight]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSeventeen-year-old [[Sean Paul Lockhart]] ([[Garrett Clayton]]) arrives in Pennsylvania to film a solo sex scene under the direction of Stephen Kocis ([[Christian Slater]]), the owner of Cobra Videos. Lockhart lies to his mother ([[Alicia Silverstone]]), claiming that he is visiting Pennsylvania to intern with a film company, and also lies to Kocis about his age, saying he is eighteen. Lockhart chooses his stage name to be \u2018[[Brent Corrigan]]\u2019, and after a successful first video agrees to stay on and continue filming [[gay pornography]] with partners, all under the direction of Kocis. Kocis, who is also housing Corrigan, becomes gradually infatuated with Corrigan, and they have sex despite Corrigan's reluctance.\n\nFaded escort [[Joe Kerekes]] ([[James Franco]]) and his muse [[Harlow Cuadra]] ([[Keegan Allen]]) run a competitor porn site called Viper Boyz. Kerekes is aggressively possessive of Cuadra, and the couple are slipping into debt due to their extravagant lifestyle. Cuadra becomes increasingly irate at the popularity of Corrigan, and although his own popularity Kerekes becomes despondent that he is not getting booked to the same extent as Cuadra.\n\nCorrigan's videos become extremely popular, and upon learning how unfairly he is paid, Corrigan starts to feel animosity towards Kocis. He asks for a high fee for his next video, and although Kocis agrees to raise sightly, he reminds Corrigan that he is under contract. Later that evening he discovers that Kocis has made exorbitant amounts, and after a fight Corrigan leaves to return home. After losing out on a high-profile contract due to Kocis legally owning his name, and after a telephone confrontation where Kocis tries to assert his position, Corrigan reports to the police that he was seventeen in the videos he filmed with Kocis. His actions indict Kocis with child pornography charges, causes repercussions throughout the gay porn industry, and renders him unable to get work. It also causes friction with his mother, who looks upon him unfavourably. \n\nKerekes and Cuadra offer Corrigan $25,000 to perform in one video with Viper Boyz, however grow agitated that Kocis retain ownership of \u2018Brent Corrigan\u2019. Cuadra gains entry to Kocis\u2019 house by pretending to audition for Cobra Video, and during the audition he violently kills Kocis. He and Kerekes rob the house, before burning the house down in an attempt to make it look as though Kocis died from arson. \n\nQuickly uncovered as foul play, Kocis\u2019 death launches a murder investigation. Corrigan goes to the police to disclose he believes Kerekes and Cuadra were responsible. He visits their residence with a wire, and captures Cuadra's confession to the killing. In the moments before their arrest, they consider the gravity of their crimes before reaffirming their love. At the police station, Corrigan reconciles with his mother. In the final shots, Corrigan is shown to be director and actor on set, producing porn with his own studio.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Garrett Clayton]] as [[Sean Paul Lockhart|Sean Paul Lockhart / Brent Corrigan]]\n* [[Christian Slater]] as [[Bryan Kocis|Stephen Kocis]]\n* [[Keegan Allen]] as [[Bryan Kocis#Death|Harlow Cuadra]]\n* [[James Franco]] as [[Bryan Kocis#Death|Joseph \"Joe\" Kerekes]]\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Janette Lockhart \n* [[Spencer Lofranco]] as Mikey\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Amy Kocis\n* [[Sean Grandillo]] as Caleb\n\n== Release ==\n''King Cobra'' premiered at the 2016 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in April 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/2016-tribeca-film-festival-lineup-872107 |title=Tribeca Film Festival Sets ''Hologram for the King'', ''Elvis & Nixon'' World Premieres|last=Lee|first=Ashley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 2, 2016|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}</ref> Shortly after, [[IFC Films]] acquired distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/07/king-cobra-movie-james-franco-christian-slater-ifc-films-1201788308/|title=James Franco Porn Murder Pic ''King Cobra'' Hooks Up With IFC Films|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=July 18, 2016|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> The film was released in the US on October 21, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/09/king-cobra-trailer-james-franco-christian-slater-gay-porn-film-brent-corrigan-1201730699/|title=''King Cobra'' Trailer: James Franco and Christian Slater Star In Gay Porn Drama|work=[[Indiewire.com]]|first=Liz|last=Calvario|date=September 26, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 43% of 35 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review;

Stoner and Peter A. Conway.<ref name=var/>\n\nThe film was released on October 21, 2016, by [[IFC Midnight]].\n\n== Plot ==\nSeventeen-year-old [[Sean Paul Lockhart]] ([[Garrett Clayton]]) arrives in Pennsylvania to film a solo sex scene under the direction of Stephen Kocis ([[Christian Slater]]), the owner of Cobra Videos. Lockhart lies to his mother ([[Alicia Silverstone]]), claiming that he is visiting Pennsylvania to intern with a film company, and also lies to Kocis about his age, saying he is eighteen. Lockhart chooses his stage name to be \u2018[[Brent Corrigan]]\u2019, and after a successful first video agrees to stay on and continue filming [[gay pornography]] with partners, all under the direction of Kocis. Kocis, who is also housing Corrigan, becomes gradually infatuated with Corrigan, and they have sex despite Corrigan\u2019s reluctance.\n\nFaded escort [[Joe Kerekes]] ([[James Franco]]) and his muse [[Harlow Cuadra]] ([[Keegan Allen]]) run a competitor porn site called Viper Boyz. Kerekes is aggressively possessive of Cuadra, and the couple are slipping into debt due to their extravagant lifestyle. Cuadra becomes increasingly irate at the popularity of Corrigan, and although his own popularity Kerekes becomes despondent that he is not getting booked to the same extent as Cuadra.\n\nCorrigan\u2019s videos become extremely popular, and upon learning how unfairly he is paid, Corrigan starts to feel animosity towards Kocis. He asks for a high fee for his next video, and although Kocis agrees to raise sightly, he reminds Corrigan that he is under contract. Later that evening he discovers that Kocis has made exorbitant amounts, and after a fight Corrigan leaves to return home. After losing out on a high-profile contract due to Kocis legally owning his name, and after a telephone confrontation where Kocis tries to assert his position, Corrigan reports to the police that he was seventeen in the videos he filmed with Kocis. His actions indict Kocis with child pornography charges, causes repercussions throughout the gay porn industry, and renders him unable to get work. It also causes friction with his mother, who looks upon him unfavourably. \n\nKerekes and Cuadra offer Corrigan $25,000 to perform in one video with Viper Boyz, however grow agitated that Kocis retain ownership of \u2018Brent Corrigan\u2019. Cuadra gains entry to Kocis\u2019 house by pretending to audition for Cobra Video, and during the audition he violently kills Kocis. He and Kerekes rob the house, before burning the house down in an attempt to make it look as though Kocis died from arson. \n\nQuickly uncovered as foul play, Kocis\u2019 death launches a murder investigation. Corrigan goes to the police to disclose he believes Kerekes and Cuadra were responsible. He visits their residence with a wire, and captures Cuadra\u2019s confession to the killing. In the moments before their arrest, they consider the gravity of their crimes before reaffirming their love. At the police station, Corrigan reconciles with his mother. In the final shots, Corrigan is shown to be director and actor on set, producing porn with his own studio.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Garrett Clayton]] as [[Sean Paul Lockhart|Sean Paul Lockhart / Brent Corrigan]]\n* [[Christian Slater]] as [[Bryan Kocis|Stephen Kocis]]\n* [[Keegan Allen]] as [[Bryan Kocis#Death|Harlow Cuadra]]\n* [[James Franco]] as [[Bryan Kocis#Death|Joseph \"Joe\" Kerekes]]\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Janette Lockhart \n* [[Spencer Lofranco]] as Mikey\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Amy Kocis\n* [[Sean Grandillo]] as Caleb\n\n== Release ==\n''King Cobra'' premiered at the 2016 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in April 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/2016-tribeca-film-festival-lineup-872107 |title=Tribeca Film Festival Sets ''Hologram for the King'', ''Elvis & Nixon'' World Premieres|last=Lee|first=Ashley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 2, 2016|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}</ref> Shortly after, [[IFC Films]] acquired distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/07/king-cobra-movie-james-franco-christian-slater-ifc-films-1201788308/|title=James Franco Porn Murder Pic ''King Cobra'' Hooks Up With IFC Films|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=July 18, 2016|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> The film was released in the US on October 21, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/09/king-cobra-trailer-james-franco-christian-slater-gay-porn-film-brent-corrigan-1201730699/|title=''King Cobra'' Trailer: James Franco and Christian Slater Star In Gay Porn Drama|work=[[Indiewire.com]]|first=Liz|last=Calvario|date=September 26, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 43% of 35 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review;

The invention of the [[magnetic compass]], [[telescope]] and [[sextant]] enabled increasing accuracy. In 1492, [[Martin Behaim]], a German cartographer, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/guide/gmillgtm.html Globes and Terrain Models \u2013 Geography and Maps: An Illustrated Guide], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1507, [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]] produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map (''[[Universalis Cosmographia]]'') bearing the first use of the name \"America\". [[Portugal|Portuguese]] cartographer [[Diego Ribero]] was the author of the first known planisphere with a graduated Equator (1527). [[Italy|Italian]] cartographer [[Battista Agnese]] produced at least 71 manuscript atlases of sea charts. [[Johannes Werner]] refined and promoted the [[Werner projection]]. This was an equal-area, heart-shaped world map projection (generally called a cordiform projection) which was used in the 16th and 17th centuries. Over time, other iterations of this map type arose; most notable are the [[sinusoidal projection]] and the [[Bonne projection]]. The Werner projection places its standard parallel at the North Pole; a sinusoidal projection places its standard parallel at the equator; and the Bonne projection is intermediate between the two.<ref>Henry Bottomley, \u00ab Between the Sinusoidal projection and the Werner: an alternative to the Bonne \u00bb, ''Cybergeo : European Journal of Geography'' [Online], Cartography, Images, GIS, document 241, Online since 13 June 2003, connection on 27 July 2018.

By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word \"atlas\" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death and new editions were published after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Mercator-projection|title=Mercator Projection|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-01-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator|title=Gerardus Mercator|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-02-26|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Renaissance]], maps were used to impress viewers and establish the owner's reputation as sophisticated, educated, and worldly. Because of this,\u00a0 towards the end of the Renaissance, maps were displayed with equal importance of painting, sculptures, and other pieces of art.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlton|first=Genevieve|date=2011|title=Worldly Consumer: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=63|pages=123\u2013126|via=}}</ref> In the sixteenth century, maps were becoming increasingly available to consumers through the introduction of printmaking, with about 10% of Venetian homes having some sort of map by the late 1500s.\n\nThere were three main functions of maps in the Renaissance:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Cartography and the Renaissance: Continuity and Change|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=3\u201324|via=}}</ref>\n*General descriptions of the world\n*Navigation and wayfinding\n*Land surveying and property management\n\nIn medieval times, written directions of how to get somewhere were more common than the use of maps. With the Renaissance, cartography began to be seen as a metaphor for power.<ref name=\":0\" /> Political leaders could lay claim on territories through the use of maps and this was greatly aided by the religious and colonial expansion of Europe. The most commonly mapped places during the Renaissance were the Holy Land and other religious places.\n\nIn the late 1400s to the late 1500s, Rome, Florence, and Venice dominated map making and trade. It started in Florence in the mid to late 1400s. Map trade quickly shifted to Rome and Venice but then was overtaken by atlas makers in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=The Italian Map Trade: 1480-1650|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=773\u2013790|via=}}</ref>  Map publishing in Venice was completed with humanities and book publishing in mind, rather than just informational use.\n\n====Printing technology====\nThere were two main printmaking technologies in the Renaissance: [[woodcut]] and [[Intaglio (printmaking)|copper-plate intaglio]], referring to the medium used to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nIn woodcut, the map image is created as a relief chiseled from medium-grain hardwood. The areas intended to be printed are inked and pressed against the sheet. Being raised from the rest of the block, the map lines cause indentations in the paper that can often be felt on the back of the map. There are advantages to using relief to make maps. For one, a printmaker doesn't need a press because the maps could be developed as rubbings. Woodblock is durable enough to be used many times before defects appear. Existing printing presses can be used to create the prints rather than having to create a new one. On the other hand, it is hard to achieve fine detail with the relief technique. Inconsistencies in linework are more apparent in woodcut than in intaglio. To improve quality in the late fifteenth century, a style of relief craftsmanship developed using fine chisels to carve the wood, rather than the more commonly used knife.\n\nIn intaglio, lines are engraved into workable metals, typically copper but sometimes brass. The engraver spreads a thin sheet of wax over the metal plate and uses ink to draw the details. Then, the engraver traces the lines with a stylus to etch them into the plate beneath.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Delano-Smith|first=Catherine|date=2005|title=Stamped Signs on Manuscripts Maps in the Renaissance|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=57|pages=59\u201362|doi=10.1080/0308569042000289842}}</ref> The engraver can also use styli to prick holes along the drawn lines, trace along them with colored chalk, and then engrave the map.\u00a0Lines going in the same direction are carved at the same time, and then the plate is turned to carve lines going in a different direction. To print from the finished plate, ink is spread over the metal surface and scraped off such that it remains only in the etched channels. Then the plate is pressed forcibly against the paper so that the ink in the channels is transferred to the paper. The pressing is so forceful that it leaves a \"plate mark\" around the border of the map at the edge of the plate, within which the paper is depressed compared to the margins.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Techniques of Map Engraving, Printing, and Coloring in the European Renaissance|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=591\u2013610|via=}}</ref> Copper and other metals were expensive at the time, so the plate was often reused for new maps or melted down for other purposes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhether woodcut or intaglio, the printed map is hung out to dry. Once dry, it is usually placed in another press of flatten the paper. Any type of paper that was available at the time could be used to print the map on, but thicker paper was more durable.\n\nBoth relief and intaglio were used about equally by the end of the fifteenth century.\n\n====Lettering====\nLettering in mapmaking is important for denoting information. Fine lettering is difficult in woodcut, where it often turned out square and blocky, contrary to the stylized, rounded writing style popular in Italy at the time.<ref name=\":2\" /> To improve quality, mapmakers developed fine chisels to carve the relief. Intaglio lettering did not suffer the troubles of a coarse medium and so was able to express the looping cursive that came to be known as [[Italic script|cancellaresca]].<ref name=\":2\" /> There were custom-made reverse punches that were also used in metal engraving alongside freehand lettering.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Color====\nThe first use of color in map making cannot be narrowed down to one reason. There are arguments that color started as a way to indicate information on the map, with aesthetics coming second. There are also arguments that color was first used on maps for aesthetics but then evolved into conveying information.<ref name=\":2\" /> Either way, many maps of the Renaissance left the publisher without being colored, a practice that continued all the way into the 1800s. However, most publishers accepted orders from their patrons to have their maps or atlases colored if they wished. Because all coloring was done by hand, the patron could request simple, cheap color, or more expensive, elaborate color, even going so far as silver or gold gilding. The simplest coloring was merely outlines, such as of borders and along rivers. Wash color meant painting regions with inks or watercolors. Limning meant adding silver and gold leaf to the map to illuminate lettering, heraldic arms, or other decorative elements.\n\n===The Enlightenment===\nMaps of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period practically universally used copper plate intaglio, having abandoned the fragile, coarse woodcut technology. Use of map projections evolved, with the double hemisphere being very common and Mercator's prestigious navigational projection gradually making more appearances.\n\nDue to the paucity of information and the immense difficulty of surveying during the period, mapmakers frequently plagiarized material without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, a famous map of North America known as the \"Beaver Map\" was published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is a close reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer, in turn, had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Creux]], in 1664. By the late 18th century, mapmakers often credited the original publisher with something along the lines of, \"After [the original cartographer]\" in the map's title or [[Cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]].<ref>\"Map Imitation\" in [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520\u2013c. 1580). It belongs to the so-called ''plane chart'' model, where observed latitudes and magnetic directions are plotted directly into the plane, with a constant scale, as if the Earth were a plane (Portuguese National Archives of Torre do Tombo, Lisbon).]]\n[[File:Structureforet.jpg|thumb|right|Mapping can be done with [[GPS]] and [[laser rangefinder]] directly in the field. Image shows mapping of forest structure (position of trees, dead wood and canopy).]]\n\nIn cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to [[digital mapping|store and manipulate them digitally]].\n\nAdvances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. [[Hartmann Schedel]] was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available. Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the Sun at noon.\n\nAdvances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[remote sensing]] provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite [[ground track]]s for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395|title=Map projections: A Working Manual|last=Snyder|first=John|date=1987|website=United States Geological Survey|access-date=}}</ref> Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also [[digital raster graphic]].\n\nThese days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.\n\n[[rugged computer|Field-rugged computers]], [[GPS]], and [[laser rangefinder]]s make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.\n\n==Deconstruction==\n{{Only primary sources|date=January 2019 <!--Monmonier, at least, is secondary-->}}\n{{Confusing section|date=April 2019}}\nThere are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's [[deconstruction]]. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.<ref name=Harley/>\n\nIt is claimed that the Europeans promoted an \"[[epistemology|epistemological]]\" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.<ref name=Harley>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext Harley, J.

Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}}\n\nA common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. \"There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images.

However, to later scholars in the field{{When|date=April 2019}}, it was evident that cultural influences dominate map-making.<ref name=Harley/> For instance, certain abstracts on maps and the map-making society itself describe the social influences on the production of maps.

Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885.<ref name=\"Basset\" />\n\nBefore 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory.<ref name=\"Basset\" /> This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.{{Why|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Map types==\n\n===General vs. thematic cartography===\n[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005 detail.jpg|thumb|Small section of an orienteering map.]]\n[[File:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of [[Easter Island]].]]\n[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]]]\n\nIn understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&nbsp;inch to 1 mile) \"[[Ordnance Survey]]\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.\n\n[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.\n\nA third type of map is known as an \"orienteering,\" or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848|title=Cartography and Visualization Part I: Types of Maps|last=Dutton|first=John|date=|website=Penn State University E-Education|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Topographic vs. topological===\nA [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate [[digital elevation model]]s which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennelly|first=Patrick|date=2006|title=A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|volume=33|pages=21\u201336|doi=10.1559/152304006777323118|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b7254610b5f6f23f536576bf01f0cc60d40f7cb1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/|title=Eduard Imhof (1895\u20131986)|last=Ormeling|first=F.J.|date=1986-12-31|website=International Cartographic Association|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.<ref name=Ovenden>{{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5| pages=22, 60, 131, 132, 135}}</ref> Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose.<ref>{{cite book |author=Devlin, Keith |title=The Millennium Problems |url=https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit |url-access=registration |location=New York, New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit/page/162 162\u2013163] |isbn=978-0-465-01730-0}}</ref>\n\n==Map design==\n[[File:Livingston-Greenwich-map.jpg|thumb|right|Illustrated map.]]\n\n===Map purpose and selection of information===\n[[Arthur H.

Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map \u2013 for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].\n\n==== Cartographic process ====\n[[File:The Cartographic Process.png|thumb|]]The cartographic process begins with a real or imagined environment or setting. As map makers gather data on the subject they are mapping (usually through technology and/or remote sensing), they begin to recognize and detect patterns that can be used to arrange the data for map creation (i.e., they think about the data and its patterns as well as how to best visualize them on a map). After this, the cartographer compiles the data and experiments with the many different methods of map design and production (including [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]], [[Symbol|symbolization]], and other production methods) in an attempt to encode and portray the data on a map that will allow the map user to decode and interpret the map in the way that matches the intended purpose of the map maker. Next, the user of the map reads and analyzes the map by recognizing and interpreting the symbols and patterns that are found on the map. This leads the user to take action and draw conclusions based on the information that they find on the map. In this way, maps help shape how we view the world based on the spatial perspectives and viewpoints that they help create in our mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog160/node/1882|title=3.1 The Cartographic Process {{!}} GEOG 160: Mapping our Changing World|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n\n===Naming conventions===\n{{main|Toponymy|Cartographic labeling}}\nMost maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].\n\nIn some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nDifficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Ru\u00dfland'' for \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as \"Leghorn\" when road signs and railway timetables show it as \"Livorno\". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''\u0420'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukh\u0101, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.\n\nFurther difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Qu\u00e9bec'' in French.<ref>{{cite book |title=Illustrated Atlas of the World |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-528-83492-9}}</ref>[[File:Legenda Michelin kaart 1940.jpg|thumb|Legend or key of a Belgian road map (Michelin 1940)]]\n\nThe study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].\n\nIn order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman]]'s early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].<ref name=\"Ovenden\" />\n\n===Map symbology===\n{{main | Map symbol}}\nCartographic [[symbology]] encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.\n\nA map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. The following list provides some examples. These items are also elements of [[Page layout (cartography)|map layout.]]\n\n* A [[Page layout (cartography)#Legend|legend]], or key, explains the map's pictorial language.\n* A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.\n* A neatline frames the entire map image.\n* A [[compass rose]] or north arrow provides orientation.\n* An overview map gives global context for the primary map.\n* A [[bar scale]] translates between map measurements and real distances.\n* A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.\n\nThe map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.\n\n[[Map coloring]] is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the [[gamut]] that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.\n\nQuantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon's magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.\n\n=====Examples of point symbols=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

For example, country names may be printed on a world map, each label within the outline of the country it names. Features and background may be in any color, which can make reading labels printed over them harder to read than reading text from a book.<ref>Jill Saligoe-Simmel,[https://www.drjill.net/map-fonts-article-1-the-basics-of-typography-for-cartography/ \"Using Text on Maps: Typography in Cartography\"]</ref> Two traits of good labels are legibility and easy feature association. In order for a label to be legible, it must have a type, size and color that are easy to read. Ideally, a label would not interfere with other map features or labels. A halo may be placed around the label to contrast it against the background. A label must also be easily associated with the feature it names, regardless of the feature's category or extent. Choosing a location for a label to enhance this association while avoiding clutter and conflict with other labels is an art that incorporates many techniques. One technique is to use a different font per category of feature. For example, using an italicized, dark blue font for a water label can suggest waves. Or, labels for contour lines can be thin and have the same color as the contours. In difficult cases where there is not enough space to place the label near the feature to form an unambiguous association, a leader line can connect the label to the feature.\n\n===Map generalization===\n{{main|Cartographic generalization}}\nA good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of meters away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.\n\n===Map projections===\n{{comparison_of_cartography_surface_development.svg|300px}}\n{{main|Map projection}}\n\nThe Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.<ref name=\"Albrecht 2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm|last=Albrecht|first=Jochen|series=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/201syllabusSp05.htm Introduction to Mapping Sciences, 2005]|title=Maps projections|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> The mapmaker must choose a suitable ''map projection'' according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.\n\n==Cartographic errors==\nSome maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]] or as a \"[[watermark]]\" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled \"[[trap streets]]\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-53421-3 | page = 51 |editor=2nd.}}</ref> Other names and forms for this are [[paper townsite]]s, [[fictitious entry|fictitious entries]], and copyright [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]].<ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright_Easter_Eggs Openstreetmap.org Copyright Easter Eggs]</ref>\n\nAnother motive for deliberate errors is cartographic \"vandalism\": a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work. Mount Richard, for example, was a fictitious peak on the [[Rocky Mountains]]' [[continental divide]] that appeared on a [[Boulder County, Colorado]] map in the early 1970s. It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.\n\n[[Sandy Island (New Caledonia)]] is an example of a fictitious location that stubbornly survives, reappearing on new maps copied from older maps while being deleted from other new editions.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Main|Outline of cartography}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Animated mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Cartogram}}\n* {{annotated link|Terrain cartography|aka=Cartographic relief depiction}}\n* {{annotated link|City map}}\n* {{annotated link|Counter-mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Fantasy map}}\n* {{annotated link|Figure-ground in map design}}\n* {{annotated link|Geoinformatics}}\n* {{annotated link|Geovisualization}}\n* {{annotated link|Geo warping}}\n* {{annotated link|History of cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|History of Cartography Project}}\n* {{annotated link|List of cartographers}}\n* {{annotated link|Locator map}}\n* {{annotated link|OpenStreetMap}}\n* {{annotated link|Pictorial map}}\n* {{annotated link|Planetary cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Seafloor mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Scribing (cartography)}}\n* {{annotated link|Toponymy}}\n* {{annotated link|World map}}\n* {{annotated link|Page layout (cartography)}}\n<!-- The article titled ''{{annotated link|great circle distance}}'' explains how to find that quantity if one knows the two latitudes and longitudes. -->\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Mapmaking\n* {{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}}\n* {{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Kraak, Menno-Jan  |author2=Ormeling, Ferjan |title=Cartography: Visualization of Spatial Data |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-13-088890-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Peterson, Michael P. |title=Interactive and Animated Cartography |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-13-079104-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Slocum, T. |title=Thematic Cartography and Geographic Visualization |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-13-035123-4}}\n\n;History\n* {{cite book |title=Mapping the World: An Illustrated History of Cartography |author=Ralph E Ehrenberg |publisher=National Geographic |date=October 11, 2005 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 256] |isbn=978-0-7922-6525-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 }}\n* {{cite book |author=[[John Brian Harley|J.

In 1492, [[Martin Behaim]], a German cartographer, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/guide/gmillgtm.html Globes and Terrain Models \u2013 Geography and Maps: An Illustrated Guide], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1507, [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]] produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map (''[[Universalis Cosmographia]]'') bearing the first use of the name \"America\".

This was an equal-area, heart-shaped world map projection (generally called a cordiform projection) which was used in the 16th and 17th centuries. Over time, other iterations of this map type arose; most notable are the [[sinusoidal projection]] and the [[Bonne projection]]. The Werner projection places its standard parallel at the North Pole; a sinusoidal projection places its standard parallel at the equator; and the Bonne projection is intermediate between the two.<ref>Henry Bottomley, \u00ab Between the Sinusoidal projection and the Werner: an alternative to the Bonne \u00bb, ''Cybergeo : European Journal of Geography'' [Online], Cartography, Images, GIS, document 241, Online since 13 June 2003, connection on 27 July 2018.

By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word \"atlas\" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death and new editions were published after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Mercator-projection|title=Mercator Projection|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-01-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator|title=Gerardus Mercator|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-02-26|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Renaissance]], maps were used to impress viewers and establish the owner's reputation as sophisticated, educated, and worldly. Because of this,\u00a0 towards the end of the Renaissance, maps were displayed with equal importance of painting, sculptures, and other pieces of art.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlton|first=Genevieve|date=2011|title=Worldly Consumer: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=63|pages=123\u2013126|via=}}</ref> In the sixteenth century, maps were becoming increasingly available to consumers through the introduction of printmaking, with about 10% of Venetian homes having some sort of map by the late 1500s.\n\nThere were three main functions of maps in the Renaissance:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Cartography and the Renaissance: Continuity and Change|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=3\u201324|via=}}</ref>\n*General descriptions of the world\n*Navigation and wayfinding\n*Land surveying and property management\n\nIn medieval times, written directions of how to get somewhere were more common than the use of maps. With the Renaissance, cartography began to be seen as a metaphor for power.<ref name=\":0\" /> Political leaders could lay claim on territories through the use of maps and this was greatly aided by the religious and colonial expansion of Europe. The most commonly mapped places during the Renaissance were the Holy Land and other religious places.\n\nIn the late 1400s to the late 1500s, Rome, Florence, and Venice dominated map making and trade. It started in Florence in the mid to late 1400s. Map trade quickly shifted to Rome and Venice but then was overtaken by atlas makers in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=The Italian Map Trade: 1480-1650|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=773\u2013790|via=}}</ref>  Map publishing in Venice was completed with humanities and book publishing in mind, rather than just informational use.\n\n====Printing technology====\nThere were two main printmaking technologies in the Renaissance: [[woodcut]] and [[Intaglio (printmaking)|copper-plate intaglio]], referring to the medium used to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nIn woodcut, the map image is created as a relief chiseled from medium-grain hardwood. The areas intended to be printed are inked and pressed against the sheet. Being raised from the rest of the block, the map lines cause indentations in the paper that can often be felt on the back of the map. There are advantages to using relief to make maps. For one, a printmaker doesn't need a press because the maps could be developed as rubbings. Woodblock is durable enough to be used many times before defects appear. Existing printing presses can be used to create the prints rather than having to create a new one. On the other hand, it is hard to achieve fine detail with the relief technique. Inconsistencies in linework are more apparent in woodcut than in intaglio. To improve quality in the late fifteenth century, a style of relief craftsmanship developed using fine chisels to carve the wood, rather than the more commonly used knife.\n\nIn intaglio, lines are engraved into workable metals, typically copper but sometimes brass. The engraver spreads a thin sheet of wax over the metal plate and uses ink to draw the details. Then, the engraver traces the lines with a stylus to etch them into the plate beneath.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Delano-Smith|first=Catherine|date=2005|title=Stamped Signs on Manuscripts Maps in the Renaissance|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=57|pages=59\u201362|doi=10.1080/0308569042000289842}}</ref> The engraver can also use styli to prick holes along the drawn lines, trace along them with colored chalk, and then engrave the map.\u00a0Lines going in the same direction are carved at the same time, and then the plate is turned to carve lines going in a different direction. To print from the finished plate, ink is spread over the metal surface and scraped off such that it remains only in the etched channels. Then the plate is pressed forcibly against the paper so that the ink in the channels is transferred to the paper. The pressing is so forceful that it leaves a \"plate mark\" around the border of the map at the edge of the plate, within which the paper is depressed compared to the margins.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Techniques of Map Engraving, Printing, and Coloring in the European Renaissance|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=591\u2013610|via=}}</ref> Copper and other metals were expensive at the time, so the plate was often reused for new maps or melted down for other purposes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhether woodcut or intaglio, the printed map is hung out to dry. Once dry, it is usually placed in another press of flatten the paper. Any type of paper that was available at the time could be used to print the map on, but thicker paper was more durable.\n\nBoth relief and intaglio were used about equally by the end of the fifteenth century.\n\n====Lettering====\nLettering in mapmaking is important for denoting information. Fine lettering is difficult in woodcut, where it often turned out square and blocky, contrary to the stylized, rounded writing style popular in Italy at the time.<ref name=\":2\" /> To improve quality, mapmakers developed fine chisels to carve the relief. Intaglio lettering did not suffer the troubles of a coarse medium and so was able to express the looping cursive that came to be known as [[Italic script|cancellaresca]].<ref name=\":2\" /> There were custom-made reverse punches that were also used in metal engraving alongside freehand lettering.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Color====\nThe first use of color in map making cannot be narrowed down to one reason. There are arguments that color started as a way to indicate information on the map, with aesthetics coming second. There are also arguments that color was first used on maps for aesthetics but then evolved into conveying information.<ref name=\":2\" /> Either way, many maps of the Renaissance left the publisher without being colored, a practice that continued all the way into the 1800s. However, most publishers accepted orders from their patrons to have their maps or atlases colored if they wished. Because all coloring was done by hand, the patron could request simple, cheap color, or more expensive, elaborate color, even going so far as silver or gold gilding. The simplest coloring was merely outlines, such as of borders and along rivers. Wash color meant painting regions with inks or watercolors. Limning meant adding silver and gold leaf to the map to illuminate lettering, heraldic arms, or other decorative elements.\n\n===The Enlightenment===\nMaps of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period practically universally used copper plate intaglio, having abandoned the fragile, coarse woodcut technology. Use of map projections evolved, with the double hemisphere being very common and Mercator's prestigious navigational projection gradually making more appearances.\n\nDue to the paucity of information and the immense difficulty of surveying during the period, mapmakers frequently plagiarized material without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, a famous map of North America known as the \"Beaver Map\" was published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is a close reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer, in turn, had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Creux]], in 1664. By the late 18th century, mapmakers often credited the original publisher with something along the lines of, \"After [the original cartographer]\" in the map's title or [[Cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]].<ref>\"Map Imitation\" in [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520\u2013c. 1580).

Image shows mapping of forest structure (position of trees, dead wood and canopy).]]\n\nIn cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to [[digital mapping|store and manipulate them digitally]].\n\nAdvances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. [[Hartmann Schedel]] was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available. Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the Sun at noon.\n\nAdvances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[remote sensing]] provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite [[ground track]]s for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395|title=Map projections: A Working Manual|last=Snyder|first=John|date=1987|website=United States Geological Survey|access-date=}}</ref> Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also [[digital raster graphic]].\n\nThese days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.\n\n[[rugged computer|Field-rugged computers]], [[GPS]], and [[laser rangefinder]]s make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.\n\n==Deconstruction==\n{{Only primary sources|date=January 2019 <!--Monmonier, at least, is secondary-->}}\n{{Confusing section|date=April 2019}}\nThere are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's [[deconstruction]]. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.<ref name=Harley/>\n\nIt is claimed that the Europeans promoted an \"[[epistemology|epistemological]]\" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.<ref name=Harley>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext Harley, J.

Cartographica, Vol. 26, No. 2. pp 1-5]</ref> An example of this understanding is that \"[<nowiki />European reproduction of terrain on maps] reality can be expressed in mathematical terms; that systematic observation and measurement offer the only route to cartographic truth\u2026\".<ref name=Harley/> 17th-century map-makers were careful and precise in their strategic approaches to maps based on a scientific model of knowledge. Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}}\n\nA common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. \"There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images. Cartographers developed a 'sense of the other' in relation to nonconforming maps.\"<ref name=Harley/>\n\nAlthough cartography has been a target of much criticism in recent decades, a cartographer's 'black box'{{Definition needed|date=April 2019}} always seemed to be naturally defended to the point where it overcame the criticism. However, to later scholars in the field{{When|date=April 2019}}, it was evident that cultural influences dominate map-making.<ref name=Harley/> For instance, certain abstracts on maps and the map-making society itself describe the social influences on the production of maps.

Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885.<ref name=\"Basset\" />\n\nBefore 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory.<ref name=\"Basset\" /> This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.{{Why|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Map types==\n\n===General vs. thematic cartography===\n[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005 detail.jpg|thumb|Small section of an orienteering map.]]\n[[File:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of [[Easter Island]].]]\n[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]]]\n\nIn understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&nbsp;inch to 1 mile) \"[[Ordnance Survey]]\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.\n\n[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.\n\nA third type of map is known as an \"orienteering,\" or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848|title=Cartography and Visualization Part I: Types of Maps|last=Dutton|first=John|date=|website=Penn State University E-Education|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Topographic vs. topological===\nA [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate [[digital elevation model]]s which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennelly|first=Patrick|date=2006|title=A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|volume=33|pages=21\u201336|doi=10.1559/152304006777323118|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b7254610b5f6f23f536576bf01f0cc60d40f7cb1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/|title=Eduard Imhof (1895\u20131986)|last=Ormeling|first=F.J.|date=1986-12-31|website=International Cartographic Association|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river.

[[Alan MacEachren]] explains that a well designed map \"is convincing because it implies authenticity\".<ref>{{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}} (p.&nbsp;9)</ref> An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the \"needed link\" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}} p.&nbsp;93</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map \u2013 for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].\n\n==== Cartographic process ====\n[[File:The Cartographic Process.png|thumb|]]The cartographic process begins with a real or imagined environment or setting. As map makers gather data on the subject they are mapping (usually through technology and/or remote sensing), they begin to recognize and detect patterns that can be used to arrange the data for map creation (i.e., they think about the data and its patterns as well as how to best visualize them on a map). After this, the cartographer compiles the data and experiments with the many different methods of map design and production (including [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]], [[Symbol|symbolization]], and other production methods) in an attempt to encode and portray the data on a map that will allow the map user to decode and interpret the map in the way that matches the intended purpose of the map maker. Next, the user of the map reads and analyzes the map by recognizing and interpreting the symbols and patterns that are found on the map. This leads the user to take action and draw conclusions based on the information that they find on the map. In this way, maps help shape how we view the world based on the spatial perspectives and viewpoints that they help create in our mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog160/node/1882|title=3.1 The Cartographic Process {{!}} GEOG 160: Mapping our Changing World|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n\n===Naming conventions===\n{{main|Toponymy|Cartographic labeling}}\nMost maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].\n\nIn some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nDifficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Ru\u00dfland'' for \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as \"Leghorn\" when road signs and railway timetables show it as \"Livorno\". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''\u0420'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukh\u0101, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.\n\nFurther difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Qu\u00e9bec'' in French.<ref>{{cite book |title=Illustrated Atlas of the World |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-528-83492-9}}</ref>[[File:Legenda Michelin kaart 1940.jpg|thumb|Legend or key of a Belgian road map (Michelin 1940)]]\n\nThe study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].\n\nIn order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman]]'s early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].<ref name=\"Ovenden\" />\n\n===Map symbology===\n{{main | Map symbol}}\nCartographic [[symbology]] encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.\n\nA map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. The following list provides some examples. These items are also elements of [[Page layout (cartography)|map layout.]]\n\n* A [[Page layout (cartography)#Legend|legend]], or key, explains the map's pictorial language.\n* A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.\n* A neatline frames the entire map image.\n* A [[compass rose]] or north arrow provides orientation.\n* An overview map gives global context for the primary map.\n* A [[bar scale]] translates between map measurements and real distances.\n* A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.\n\nThe map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.\n\n[[Map coloring]] is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the [[gamut]] that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.\n\nQuantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon's magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.\n\n=====Examples of point symbols=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

For example, country names may be printed on a world map, each label within the outline of the country it names. Features and background may be in any color, which can make reading labels printed over them harder to read than reading text from a book.<ref>Jill Saligoe-Simmel,[https://www.drjill.net/map-fonts-article-1-the-basics-of-typography-for-cartography/ \"Using Text on Maps: Typography in Cartography\"]</ref> Two traits of good labels are legibility and easy feature association. In order for a label to be legible, it must have a type, size and color that are easy to read. Ideally, a label would not interfere with other map features or labels. A halo may be placed around the label to contrast it against the background. A label must also be easily associated with the feature it names, regardless of the feature's category or extent. Choosing a location for a label to enhance this association while avoiding clutter and conflict with other labels is an art that incorporates many techniques. One technique is to use a different font per category of feature. For example, using an italicized, dark blue font for a water label can suggest waves. Or, labels for contour lines can be thin and have the same color as the contours. In difficult cases where there is not enough space to place the label near the feature to form an unambiguous association, a leader line can connect the label to the feature.\n\n===Map generalization===\n{{main|Cartographic generalization}}\nA good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of meters away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.\n\n===Map projections===\n{{comparison_of_cartography_surface_development.svg|300px}}\n{{main|Map projection}}\n\nThe Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.<ref name=\"Albrecht 2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm|last=Albrecht|first=Jochen|series=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/201syllabusSp05.htm Introduction to Mapping Sciences, 2005]|title=Maps projections|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> The mapmaker must choose a suitable ''map projection'' according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.\n\n==Cartographic errors==\nSome maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]] or as a \"[[watermark]]\" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled \"[[trap streets]]\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-53421-3 | page = 51 |editor=2nd.}}</ref> Other names and forms for this are [[paper townsite]]s, [[fictitious entry|fictitious entries]], and copyright [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]].<ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright_Easter_Eggs Openstreetmap.org Copyright Easter Eggs]</ref>\n\nAnother motive for deliberate errors is cartographic \"vandalism\": a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work. Mount Richard, for example, was a fictitious peak on the [[Rocky Mountains]]' [[continental divide]] that appeared on a [[Boulder County, Colorado]] map in the early 1970s. It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.\n\n[[Sandy Island (New Caledonia)]] is an example of a fictitious location that stubbornly survives, reappearing on new maps copied from older maps while being deleted from other new editions.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Main|Outline of cartography}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Animated mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Cartogram}}\n* {{annotated link|Terrain cartography|aka=Cartographic relief depiction}}\n* {{annotated link|City map}}\n* {{annotated link|Counter-mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Fantasy map}}\n* {{annotated link|Figure-ground in map design}}\n* {{annotated link|Geoinformatics}}\n* {{annotated link|Geovisualization}}\n* {{annotated link|Geo warping}}\n* {{annotated link|History of cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|History of Cartography Project}}\n* {{annotated link|List of cartographers}}\n* {{annotated link|Locator map}}\n* {{annotated link|OpenStreetMap}}\n* {{annotated link|Pictorial map}}\n* {{annotated link|Planetary cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Seafloor mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Scribing (cartography)}}\n* {{annotated link|Toponymy}}\n* {{annotated link|World map}}\n* {{annotated link|Page layout (cartography)}}\n<!-- The article titled ''{{annotated link|great circle distance}}'' explains how to find that quantity if one knows the two latitudes and longitudes. -->\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Mapmaking\n* {{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}}\n* {{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Kraak, Menno-Jan  |author2=Ormeling, Ferjan |title=Cartography: Visualization of Spatial Data |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-13-088890-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Peterson, Michael P. |title=Interactive and Animated Cartography |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-13-079104-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Slocum, T. |title=Thematic Cartography and Geographic Visualization |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-13-035123-4}}\n\n;History\n* {{cite book |title=Mapping the World: An Illustrated History of Cartography |author=Ralph E Ehrenberg |publisher=National Geographic |date=October 11, 2005 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 256] |isbn=978-0-7922-6525-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 }}\n* {{cite book |author=[[John Brian Harley|J.

She has been with the show for four years and is so identified with her character that she is nicknamed \"George\". Off-screen, June is outspoken, ribald, cigar-smoking and frequently inebriated, unlike her kindly on-screen persona. Although June has been popular with viewers in the past, several ''Applehurst'' characters have recently been killed off causing June to worry that Sister George may be next. Her worry affects her already volatile relationship with her live-in lover, a younger, beautiful woman named Alice (York), whom June calls \"Childie\". Childlike Alice plays with dolls, writes poetry, and has a minor fashion industry job, but relies on June for most of her financial and emotional support. Domineering June is alternately affectionate toward Alice and abusive to her, and reacts jealously when Alice spends time with other men or women. Alice rebels by talking back to June and refusing to play along with a \"contrition\" game in which June makes her kneel and eat a cigar butt.\n\nAfter an ''Applehurst'' colleague jokes about Sister George possibly dying on the show, June walks out on a script reading, gets drunk, and forces herself into a taxi alongside two young Catholic [[nun]]s, whom she sexually assaults, resulting in the taxi having an accident in a busy intersection. The nuns' Mother Superior and the Archbishop complain to the [[BBC]], causing powerful network producer Mrs Croft ([[Coral Browne]]) to visit June at home and lecture her about her behaviour and her attitude at work. When June balks at apologising for the incident, Mrs Croft makes clear that her future at the network depends on her apologising and changing her ways. Mrs Croft further infuriates June by taking an interest in Alice, complimenting her cooking and encouraging her poetic aspirations. At the next script reading, June finds that Sister George has been temporarily written out of the show with an illness, seemingly as punishment for June, and raising the possibility that her character will not recover.\n\nJune's spirits improve when she receives the next script, showing that Sister George has recovered and returned to riding her scooter. June and Alice go to a party at [[Gateways club|Gateways]] lesbian nightclub, to which she jokingly invites Mrs Croft. Halfway through the party, when June is already annoyed by Alice dancing with another woman, Mrs Croft arrives to tell June in person that Sister George will die by being hit by a ten-ton truck. After June storms off, Mrs Croft invites Alice to meet with her to further discuss Alice's poetry. On June's last day of filming for ''Applehurst'', Alice untruthfully says she cannot meet June for lunch because she is busy at work. June, upset, tries to sabotage her fellow actors' performances and to drag out the filming as long as possible; afterward, she finds out that Alice lied to her in order to meet with Mrs Croft.\n\nAt her farewell cast party, June makes a scene, insulting the senior network executive, pouring drinks over a fellow cast member, and finally exploding in front of the guests when Mrs Croft offers her a new role as the voice of a talking cow on a children's puppet show. She confronts Mrs Croft and Alice, who leave the party together and return to June and Alice's flat. Mrs Croft persuades Alice to leave and stay with her for one night in order to avoid June's wrath, and offers to help Alice further her writing ambitions. Alice and Mrs Croft end up having sex in Alice's bedroom, and June catches them in the act; this leads to a final confrontation in which June reveals that Alice is thirty two years old and the mother of a teenage daughter, whom she abandoned. Alice leaves with Mrs Croft, dropping her key in the letter box to show she will not return. Left alone, June wanders onto the deserted ''Applehurst'' set, destroying equipment and props and uttering \"moo\" like a cow.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Beryl Reid]] as June \"George\" Buckridge \n* [[Susannah York]] as Alice \"Childie\" McNaught \n* [[Coral Browne]] as Mercy Croft \n* [[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]] as Leo Lockhart \n* [[Patricia Medina]] as Betty Thaxter \n* Byron Webster as Jack Adams \n* [[Cyril Delevanti]] as Ted Baker \n* Brendan Dillon as Bert Turner \n* [[Hugh Paddick]] as Freddie \n* Sivi Aberg as Diana \n* [[Rosalie Williams]] as Mildred\n* Elaine Church as Marlene\n* Mike Freeman as Noel \n* [[Meier Tzelniker]] as Mr. Emmanuel Katz \n* Cicely Walper as Mrs. Margaret Coote\n* [[William Beckley (actor)|William Beckley]] as Floor Manager \n* Maggie Paige as Maid \n* [[Jack Raine]] as Deputy Commissioner \n* Dolly Taylor as Tea Lady  \n* Sam Kydd as Cab Driver\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Adaptation and production==\nRobert Aldrich bought the screen rights to the play in April 1967.<ref>Hudson in 'Ice Station' Role\nMartin, Betty.

The opening sequence shows June drinking at [[The Holly Bush, Hampstead|The Holly Bush]] public house, before wandering through the streets and alleyways of [[Hampstead]] west of Heath Street, and emerging at [[Hammersmith Bridge]]. The nightclub party sequence was filmed at the [[Gateways Club]], a real-life lesbian nightclub then located in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. ''The Killing of Sister George'' was the first film to portray the interior of a lesbian nightclub.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hankin|first=Kelly|date=Fall 2001|title=Lesbian Locations: The Production of Lesbian Bar Space in the Killing of Sister George|url=|journal=Cinema Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\nThe exterior scenes outside June's and her neighbour's flats were filmed in [[Knightsbridge]].\n\nIn ''Caviar To The General'', a UK [[Channel 4]] documentary celebrating the life and career of Coral Browne, broadcast in December 1990, Browne claimed that the sex scene was filmed multiple times, once with herself and Susannah York on set together and then on further occasions with only one of the two actresses present. Browne claimed that York was very upset about filming the scene and claimed she was eating grapes to stop herself from vomiting, thus she was relieved when Aldrich recalled her for further filming where he encouraged Browne to \"make love to the camera\".\n\n==Release==\nBetween the time ''The Killing of Sister George'' started filming and ended production, the United States movie industry instituted the new [[MPAA film rating system]]. Largely on the basis of the graphic sex scene between Alice and Mrs. Croft, ''The Killing of Sister George'' received an [[X rating#United States|X rating]], which limited its screening in US cinemas and ability to be advertised in mainstream newspapers. Aldrich spent $75,000 battling the rating, but his lawsuit was dismissed, and the film died at the box office.\n\nIn the UK, the film also had considerable censorship problems, with [[BBFC]] chief [[John Trevelyan (censor)|John Trevelyan]] demanding some dialogue changes and the complete removal of the sex scene; this led to a standoff between Aldrich and the BBFC. The [[Greater London Council]] and 11 other councils allowed the film to be shown with lesser cuts to the scene, and Trevelyan finally passed a cut version for countrywide release in 1970. All subsequent home releases of the film have been fully uncut.\n\nThe [[Motion picture rating system#Italy|Committee for the Theatrical Review]] of the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities]] also rated the film as [[Motion picture rating system#Italy|VM18]], not suitable for children under 18, in addition to mandating the removal of two scenes involving a kiss between women, and one scene where Mrs. Croft caresses Alice's breast.<ref>[http://www.italiataglia.it/ Italia Taglia] Database of the documents produced by the Committee for the Theatrical Review of The Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, from 1944 to 2000: Document N\u00b0 54435 signed on 13 September 1969 by Minister [[Franco Evangelisti (politician)|Franco Evangelisti]].</ref>\n\nSince its theatrical release, the film has been shown a number of times on British television, although sometimes with the sex scene deleted.

George is a great character, a gin-swigging, cigar-chomping, sadistic masculine woman, the opposite of the sweet character she plays on radio.

Browne claimed that York was very upset about filming the scene and claimed she was eating grapes to stop herself from vomiting, thus she was relieved when Aldrich recalled her for further filming where he encouraged Browne to \"make love to the camera\".\n\n==Release==\nBetween the time ''The Killing of Sister George'' started filming and ended production, the United States movie industry instituted the new [[MPAA film rating system]]. Largely on the basis of the graphic sex scene between Alice and Mrs. Croft, ''The Killing of Sister George'' received an [[X rating#United States|X rating]], which limited its screening in US cinemas and ability to be advertised in mainstream newspapers. Aldrich spent $75,000 battling the rating, but his lawsuit was dismissed, and the film died at the box office.\n\nIn the UK, the film also had considerable censorship problems, with [[BBFC]] chief [[John Trevelyan (censor)|John Trevelyan]] demanding some dialogue changes and the complete removal of the sex scene; this led to a standoff between Aldrich and the BBFC. The [[Greater London Council]] and 11 other councils allowed the film to be shown with lesser cuts to the scene, and Trevelyan finally passed a cut version for countrywide release in 1970. All subsequent home releases of the film have been fully uncut.\n\nThe [[Motion picture rating system#Italy|Committee for the Theatrical Review]] of the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities]] also rated the film as [[Motion picture rating system#Italy|VM18]], not suitable for children under 18, in addition to mandating the removal of two scenes involving a kiss between women, and one scene where Mrs. Croft caresses Alice's breast.<ref>[http://www.italiataglia.it/ Italia Taglia] Database of the documents produced by the Committee for the Theatrical Review of The Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, from 1944 to 2000: Document N\u00b0 54435 signed on 13 September 1969 by Minister [[Franco Evangelisti (politician)|Franco Evangelisti]].</ref>\n\nSince its theatrical release, the film has been shown a number of times on British television, although sometimes with the sex scene deleted. Rarely seen on American television, it was broadcast uncut by [[Turner Classic Movies]] as part of a June 2007 salute to gay cinema.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe movie earned rentals of $3.45&nbsp;million in North America and $1.875&nbsp;million in other countries.

But, nevertheless, it is a spirited, highly entertaining, even sometimes enlightening, possibly even liberating movie, pulling lesbians out of the closet.\" He praised the performances of the leading actresses, in which he stated \"Reid\u2019s marvellous performance is at the heart of Aldrich\u2019s version of Frank Marcus\u2019s theatre hit. George is a great character, a gin-swigging, cigar-chomping, sadistic masculine woman, the opposite of the sweet character she plays on radio.

The school\u2019s original purpose was to educate [[freedmen]] and their children.\n\nThe College was renamed '''Waco College'''. Classes were held in a modest one-building trade school; freedmen were taught the skills of blacksmithing, carpentry, tanning, and saddle work, common occupations for the area, especially in the increasingly segregated state. This was the model established by the [[Tuskegee Institute]].\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 1.25em;\" |'''Presidents of Paul Quinn College'''\n|-\n|1872 &ndash; 1876\n| style=\"width:125pt;\"|Bishop [[John M.

During this period, more than twenty acres of additional land was purchased and the curriculum was expanded to include the classical subjects of [[Latin]], [[mathematics]], [[music]], [[theology]], [[English language|English]], plus vocational skills in [[carpentry]], sewing, and household, kitchen, and dining room work. In May 1881, the College was chartered by the State of Texas and changed its name to Paul Quinn College to commemorate the contributions of Bishop [[William Paul Quinn]].\n\n===Expansion===\nThe campus was expanded, with new buildings constructed with capital raised from interested patrons. In 1950, the College began significant physical expansion. A campus church, student union building, gymnasium and administration building were erected between 1950 and 1954. Two new dormitories, a modern two-story classroom building, a fully equipped science department, and a new library were added to the campus.\n\nIn spring of 1954, the Waco Chamber of Commerce successfully completed a campaign which raised $100,000 for a new women\u2019s dormitory to replace one destroyed by fire. Bishop O.L. Sherman was assigned to supervise the work of the A.M.E. Church in Texas in 1962. His first official act was to have the Charter of the College changed so that trustees could be elected without regard to race, creed, or color. Because of this significant innovation, new leaders from Central Texas were added to the Board of Trustees.\n\nDr. Stanley E. Rutland became President of the College in 1969. Under his leadership, the physical plant of the College continued to improve. Among the changes were the addition of a new gymnasium, the renovation of historic Johnson Hall, and the development of the Ethnic Cultural Center. Under Dr. Rutland, the College received accreditation in 1972 with the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS) for the first time.<ref name=\"SACSDatabase\">{{cite news | url=http://www.sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=56880 | title=Paul Quinn College | publisher=[[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] | year=2011 | first= | last= | accessdate=2011-04-14 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Move to Dallas===\nThe College relocated to southeast [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in 1990.

BCG\u2019s work ultimately provided the Institution with a blueprint that eventually became the College\u2019s Strategic Plan from 2007-2012.\n\n===New direction===\nIn September 2007, [[Michael Sorrell|Michael J. Sorrell]], [[Esq.]], a former member of the Board of Trustees, was selected as president, after having served as the interim president since March of that year.

In the fall of 2011, two fully interactive technology classrooms were built on the second level of the building. These classrooms have state of the art video conferencing capability.\n\nThe '''Isabel and Comer Cottrell Student Union Building''', also known as '''the SUB''', was completed in 1970. The SUB includes the cafe, the Tiger's Den, the student lounge, and the student workout facility. In the fall of 2012, the institution will convert the student workout facility into the Quinnite Retention Center, a 24-hour study facility that will aide in the College's efforts to improve retention rates. The space that was formerly the campus bookstore will now be a state of the art gym facility that students, staff, and faculty can use. The Grand Lounge is the campus' primary meeting space. It is also where the weekly Chapel services are held.\n\nThe '''Richard Allen Chapel''', formerly Carr P. Collins Chapel, completed in 1970, is currently under renovation. The lawn of the Chapel is the venue for the annual commencement exercises. Completed in 1970, it serves as the religious education building.\n\nThe gymnasium was completed in 1961. In spring 2011, the gymnasium was outfitted with a new HVAC system.\n\n'''Zale Library''' was completed in 1963. The library contains a 9x23 foot mural that was painted by artist Louis Freund in 1968. The mural depicts the progression and struggles of African-Americans in the pursuit of an education. In spring 2011, more than 900 volumes of legal publications were donated by Hunton & Williams, LLP to start the Paul Quinn College Law Library.\n\nThe school has one residence hall, the '''Lucy Hughes Hall''', formerly Pearl C. Anderson hall. the dormitory for females opened in 1969 as a facility of Bishop College. It currently serves men and women. The other dormitory buildings were demolished in a 15-building demolition that began in 2010.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120804123252/http://www.mbntexas.biz/articles.php?aid=68046caa4c-20100726154554&CatID=3&SubCatID=2 ]</ref> The campus is gated.\n\nThe campus is {{convert|91|mi|km}} from [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], {{convert|190|mi|km}} from [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], {{convert|230|mi|km}} from [[Houston]], and {{convert|520|mi|km}} from [[New Orleans]].<ref>\"[http://www.pqc.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=102&Itemid=166 Visit us].\" Paul Quinn College.

The school\u2019s original purpose was to educate [[freedmen]] and their children.\n\nThe College was renamed '''Waco College'''. Classes were held in a modest one-building trade school; freedmen were taught the skills of blacksmithing, carpentry, tanning, and saddle work, common occupations for the area, especially in the increasingly segregated state. This was the model established by the [[Tuskegee Institute]].\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 1.25em;\" |'''Presidents of Paul Quinn College'''\n|-\n|1872 &ndash; 1876\n| style=\"width:125pt;\"|Bishop [[John M.

During this period, more than twenty acres of additional land was purchased and the curriculum was expanded to include the classical subjects of [[Latin]], [[mathematics]], [[music]], [[theology]], [[English language|English]], plus vocational skills in [[carpentry]], sewing, and household, kitchen, and dining room work. In May 1881, the College was chartered by the State of Texas and changed its name to Paul Quinn College to commemorate the contributions of Bishop [[William Paul Quinn]].\n\n===Expansion===\nThe campus was expanded, with new buildings constructed with capital raised from interested patrons. In 1950, the College began significant physical expansion. A campus church, student union building, gymnasium and administration building were erected between 1950 and 1954. Two new dormitories, a modern two-story classroom building, a fully equipped science department, and a new library were added to the campus.\n\nIn spring of 1954, the Waco Chamber of Commerce successfully completed a campaign which raised $100,000 for a new women\u2019s dormitory to replace one destroyed by fire. Bishop O.L. Sherman was assigned to supervise the work of the A.M.E. Church in Texas in 1962. His first official act was to have the Charter of the College changed so that trustees could be elected without regard to race, creed, or color. Because of this significant innovation, new leaders from Central Texas were added to the Board of Trustees.\n\nDr. Stanley E. Rutland became President of the College in 1969. Under his leadership, the physical plant of the College continued to improve. Among the changes were the addition of a new gymnasium, the renovation of historic Johnson Hall, and the development of the Ethnic Cultural Center. Under Dr. Rutland, the College received accreditation in 1972 with the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS) for the first time.<ref name=\"SACSDatabase\">{{cite news | url=http://www.sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=56880 | title=Paul Quinn College | publisher=[[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] | year=2011 | first= | last= | accessdate=2011-04-14 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Move to Dallas===\nThe College relocated to southeast [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in 1990.

BCG\u2019s work ultimately provided the Institution with a blueprint that eventually became the College\u2019s Strategic Plan from 2007-2012.\n\n===New direction===\nIn September 2007, [[Michael Sorrell|Michael J.

They have been listening to his phone calls for years but he has never given anything away. The recordings made by [[Pussy Bonpensiero]] are of no value. Using Pussy's file number, CW16, Agent [[FBI on The Sopranos#Agent Skip Lipari|Skip Lipari]] says that he is \"probably compost\"; he takes his photograph down from the wall and throws it into a bin. They decide to plant a listening device in the basement of Tony's home, where he thinks his conversations are masked by the noise of the [[central air conditioning]] units. They obtain legal authorization.\n\nThere is a once-a-week period when the house is empty for long enough. In the first week, they enter and find an old reading lamp in the basement in which a microphone could be hidden. They take pictures of it in order to replace it with an exact replica with a hidden listening device. In the second week, the return is aborted when the house's [[water heating|water heater]] explodes and the basement is flooded. In the third week, the FBI plant the replacement lamp and start listening.\n\n[[Meadow Soprano|Meadow]] adjusts to life at [[Columbia University]]. Her volatile roommate, [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Caitlin Rucker|Caitlin]], is having a hard time.\n\nTony and the crew eat a hearty lunch in the back room of [[Satriale's Pork Store|Satriale's]]. [[Patsy Parisi]] is not eating, still mourning  his deceased identical twin [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Phillip .22Philly Spoons.22 Parisi|Phillip]] on their birthday. Patsy suspects Tony had something to do with his killing. One afternoon, while the FBI watches, not knowing what to do, a drunken Patsy aims a gun at Tony from his pool patio. He can see Tony clearly in the house, but lowers the gun, turns round and [[urination|urinate]]s in the pool instead, none of this seen by Tony. Some days later, Tony confronts Patsy when they are alone.

They have been listening to his phone calls for years but he has never given anything away. The recordings made by [[Pussy Bonpensiero]] are of no value. Using Pussy's file number, CW16, Agent [[FBI on The Sopranos#Agent Skip Lipari|Skip Lipari]] says that he is \"probably compost\"; he takes his photograph down from the wall and throws it into a bin. They decide to plant a listening device in the basement of Tony's home, where he thinks his conversations are masked by the noise of the [[central air conditioning]] units. They obtain legal authorization.\n\nThere is a once-a-week period when the house is empty for long enough. In the first week, they enter and find an old reading lamp in the basement in which a microphone could be hidden. They take pictures of it in order to replace it with an exact replica with a hidden listening device. In the second week, the return is aborted when the house's [[water heater]] explodes and the basement is flooded. In the third week, the FBI plant the replacement lamp and start listening.\n\n[[Meadow Soprano|Meadow]] adjusts to life at [[Columbia University]]. Her volatile roommate, [[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Caitlin Rucker|Caitlin]], is having a hard time.\n\nTony and the crew eat a hearty lunch in the back room of [[Satriale's Pork Store|Satriale's]]. [[Patsy Parisi]] is not eating, still mourning  his deceased identical twin [[List of characters from The Sopranos in the Soprano crime family#Phillip .22Philly Spoons.22 Parisi|Phillip]] on their birthday. Patsy suspects Tony had something to do with his killing. One afternoon, while the FBI watches, not knowing what to do, a drunken Patsy aims a gun at Tony from his pool patio. He can see Tony clearly in the house, but lowers the gun, turns round and [[urination|urinate]]s in the pool instead, none of this seen by Tony. Some days later, Tony confronts Patsy when they are alone. He tells him that the past is past; he compels and cajoles him into declaring, twice, that he has put his grief behind him.\n\n==First appearance==\n*'''[[List of characters from The Sopranos - Friends and Family#Caitlin Rucker|Caitlin Rucker]]''': Meadow's roommate at her college dormitory.\n\n==Title reference==\n* Mr. Ruggerio is Tony's neighborhood [[plumber]]; one of the FBI agents says the Soprano house is in \"Mister Ruggerio's Neighborhood.\" This is a reference to the children's TV show ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''.\n\n==Production==\n* The episode was part one of a two-hour season premiere when it originally aired in 2001.\n* [[Federico Castelluccio]] (Furio Giunta) is now billed in the opening credits as part of the main cast, but only in episodes in which he appears.\n* First episode in which [[Nancy Marchand]] (Livia Soprano) is not billed in the opening credits.\n* FBI Codenames for the Sopranos:\n**Tony - Papa Bing / Der Bingle\n**Carmela - Mrs. Bing\n**Meadow - Princess Bing\n**A.J. - Baby Bing\n**The Soprano residence - The Sausage Factory\n\n==Music==\n* The music playing when Tony walks down his driveway in the first scene is the intro to \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlife\"' by [[Alabama 3]], who also perform the opening theme song. \n* The episode features the \"[[Peter Gunn]] Theme\" (by [[Henry Mancini]]) and \"[[Every Breath You Take]]\" (by [[The Police]]) [[Mashup (music)|mashed up]] by Kathryn Dayak from HBO.
