There have been a number of other theories for the origin of the name ''Oulu''. One possible source is a word in the [[Sami languages|Sami language]] meaning 'flood water', but there are other suggestions. At minimum, the structure of the word requires that, if originally given by speakers of a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language, the name must be a [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivative]]. In all likelihood, it also predates Finnish settlement and is thus a [[loanword]] from one of the now-extinct [[Sami languages|Saami languages]] once spoken in the area.\n\nThe most probable theory is that the name derives from the Finnish dialectal word ''oulu'', meaning \"[[floodwater]]\", which is related to e.g. [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]] ''\u00e5ulo'', meaning \"melted snow\", ''\u00e5ulot'' meaning \"thaw\" (of unknown ultimate origin). Two other word families have also been speculated to be related. The first is seen in the Northern Savo dialectal word ''uula'' and its Sami counterpart ''oalli'', both meaning \"river channel\". The second is the Uralic root [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''uwa'', meaning \"river bed\" (reflected as ''vuo'' in modern Finnish, also in derivatives such as ''vuolas'' \"heavy-flowing\"). To either of these roots, some Sami variety would have to be assumed having added further derivational suffixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scripta.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/oulun_etymologia.shtml |title=Oulu-nimen etymologia |website=Scripta.kotus.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Oulu1800.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of central Oulu from the 19th Century]]\nOulu is situated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], at the mouth of river [[Oulujoki]], which is an ancient trading site. The city proper was founded on 8 April 1605 by King [[Charles IX of Sweden]], opposite the fort built on the island of Linnansaari. This took place after favourable peace settlements with Russia, which removed the threat of attack via the main east-west waterway, the river Oulu. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The surrounding areas were populated much earlier. Oulu was the capital of the [[Province of Oulu]] from 1776 to 2009.\n\nIn 1822, a major fire destroyed much of the city. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], chiefly known for the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] (empire style) buildings around [[Helsinki Senate Square]], was enlisted to provide the plan for its rebuilding. With minor changes, this plan remains the basis for the layout of Oulu's town center. The [[Oulu Cathedral]] was built in 1832 to his designs, with the spire being finished in 1844. During the [[Crimean War]], Oulu's harbour was raided by the British fleet, who destroyed ships and burned tar houses, leading to international criticism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nOnce known for [[tar|wood tar]] and [[salmon]], Oulu has evolved into a major high-tech centre, particularly in [[Information technology|IT]] and [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] technology. Other prominent industries include wood refining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper, and steel. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe municipality of [[Ylikiiminki]] was merged with the city of Oulu on 1 January 2009.

It is the most populous city in Northern Finland, and the fifth most populous in the country. Only the city of [[Murmansk]], Russia, has more people and is further north.\n\nOulu is considered one of Europe's \"living labs\", where residents experiment with new technology (such as [[Near-field communication|NFC tags]] and [[Ubiquitous computing|ubi]]-screens) on a community-wide scale.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn= |page=63 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe city is named after the river [[Oulujoki]], which originates in the lake [[Ouluj\u00e4rvi]]. There have been a number of other theories for the origin of the name ''Oulu''. One possible source is a word in the [[Sami languages|Sami language]] meaning 'flood water', but there are other suggestions. At minimum, the structure of the word requires that, if originally given by speakers of a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language, the name must be a [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivative]]. In all likelihood, it also predates Finnish settlement and is thus a [[loanword]] from one of the now-extinct [[Sami languages|Saami languages]] once spoken in the area.\n\nThe most probable theory is that the name derives from the Finnish dialectal word ''oulu'', meaning \"[[floodwater]]\", which is related to e.g. [[Southern Sami language|Southern Sami]] ''\u00e5ulo'', meaning \"melted snow\", ''\u00e5ulot'' meaning \"thaw\" (of unknown ultimate origin). Two other word families have also been speculated to be related. The first is seen in the Northern Savo dialectal word ''uula'' and its Sami counterpart ''oalli'', both meaning \"river channel\". The second is the Uralic root [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as *''uwa'', meaning \"river bed\" (reflected as ''vuo'' in modern Finnish, also in derivatives such as ''vuolas'' \"heavy-flowing\"). To either of these roots, some Sami variety would have to be assumed having added further derivational suffixes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scripta.kotus.fi/www/verkkojulkaisut/julk125/oulunsalo/oulun_etymologia.shtml |title=Oulu-nimen etymologia |website=Scripta.kotus.fi |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Oulu1800.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of central Oulu from the 19th Century]]\nOulu is situated by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], at the mouth of river [[Oulujoki]], which is an ancient trading site. The city proper was founded on 8 April 1605 by King [[Charles IX of Sweden]], opposite the fort built on the island of Linnansaari. This took place after favourable peace settlements with Russia, which removed the threat of attack via the main east-west waterway, the river Oulu. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The surrounding areas were populated much earlier. Oulu was the capital of the [[Province of Oulu]] from 1776 to 2009.\n\nIn 1822, a major fire destroyed much of the city. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], chiefly known for the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] (empire style) buildings around [[Helsinki Senate Square]], was enlisted to provide the plan for its rebuilding. With minor changes, this plan remains the basis for the layout of Oulu's town center. The [[Oulu Cathedral]] was built in 1832 to his designs, with the spire being finished in 1844. During the [[Crimean War]], Oulu's harbour was raided by the British fleet, who destroyed ships and burned tar houses, leading to international criticism.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nOnce known for [[tar|wood tar]] and [[salmon]], Oulu has evolved into a major high-tech centre, particularly in [[Information technology|IT]] and [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] technology. Other prominent industries include wood refining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper, and steel. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe municipality of [[Ylikiiminki]] was merged with the city of Oulu on 1 January 2009. Oulu and the municipalities of [[Haukipudas]], [[Kiiminki]], [[Oulunsalo]], and [[Yli-Ii]] were merged on 1 January 2013.<ref name=\"uusioulu\">{{cite web|title=Uusi Oulu|url=http://www.ouka.fi/uusioulu/|publisher=City of Oulu|accessdate=19 September 2011|location=Oulu|language=Finnish|trans-title=New Oulu | date=9 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOulu was the site of the 2018 [[Oulu child sexual exploitation scandal]].

Mainland Finland's northernmost and southernmost points are roughly [[equidistant]] from Oulu. Oulu's coast sits at the [[Bothnian Bay]] (''Per\u00e4meri'' in Finnish) and the [[Sweden|Swedish mainland]] is about 180&nbsp;km directly west across the Bothnian Bay. The nearby island [[Hailuoto]] is just off the coast.\n\n===Subdivisions===\n{{Category see also|Districts of Oulu}}\nOulu is divided into 106 city districts.
