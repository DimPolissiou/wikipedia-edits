His nickname was the \"Iron Guru\".\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early life and career ===\nGironda was born in [[The Bronx, New York]]. While he was still a young child, the family moved out west to [[Los Angeles]] when his father, a stuntman, was offered work in the upcoming ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben Hur]]'' film. Vince tried his hand at being a stuntman as well but when he saw a photograph of [[John Grimek]], he realized he needed more physical development and began lifting weights at the age of 22.\n\nThe first gym he trained at was the local [[YMCA]]. He was there for approximately eight months before moving to the Easton Brothers' gym. The Easton brothers taught him to be one of their instructors. He worked there and experimented with training protocols before opening his own gym in [[North Hollywood]], California in 1948 called Vince's Gym.\n\n=== Training philosophy ===\nGironda is often quoted as saying that bodybuilding is 85% nutrition. He was also an early proponent of [[low carb]] dieting and recommended the use of numerous supplements, including desiccated liver tablets, free form amino acids, 225 mcg [[kelp]] tablets, [[Vitamin C]] tablets, digestive enzymes and raw glandular such as adrenal and orchic. In certain circumstances, Gironda would recommend up to three dozen fertile hen-eggs a day, along with raw (unhomogenized, unpasteurized) cream or half-and-half milk. Large amounts of fertile eggs, he said, are equal to the anabolic steroid [[Dianabol]] in effectiveness. However, he was vehemently against the use of steroids for physique development, claiming that they contributed to a grotesque appearance.\n\nHe had what many consider unorthodox training ideas. For example, unlike many other physique trainers, he did not prescribe regular [[squat (exercise)|barbell back squats]] (his gym had no squat racks), stating that they caused the over-development of the [[gluteal muscles]] and hips relative to the thighs. The exception would be female trainees who needed more gluteus and hip development. Typically, Gironda prescribed [[leg extension|leg extensions]], [[leg curl|leg curls]]<nowiki/>, [[Squat (exercise)#Sissy squat|sissy squats]], [[Squat (exercise)#Hack squat|hack squats]]<nowiki/> and a special style of squat which he called the \"thigh squat\" for thigh development. In addition, he was one of the first few in the bodybuilding scene to comment that sit-ups do not contribute to the development of abdominal muscles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://checkmeowt.co.uk/8x8-workout-review/|title=8x8 Workout: Vince Gironda Training Review|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nGironda also counseled against using the regular [[bench press]] for chest training, which he considered an inferior exercise because it involved too much front deltoid (shoulder); in its place he favored the \"Neck press\" in which the bar is lowered, with a wide grip, to the neck instead of the chest. He also favored chest pressing using dumbbells with the palms facing each other from flat & incline angles, stating that he thought to have the hands face the other with the thumbs facing each other also involved too much front deltoid. He considered his Gironda Dip the best overall pectoral developer. For Gironda, pectorals should be a wide slab, not two discrete masses. For the back, Gironda recommended using a full range of motion\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as touching the sternum to the bar when chinning\u200a\u2014\u200ain order to fully contract the latissimus muscles. For shoulders, he stated that if you want to build maximum mass, shoulder raises (front raise, side lateral raise, and bent-over lateral raise) were the best. Although he normally recommended shoulder raises for deltoid development, he created a special form of shoulder press for [[Larry Scott (bodybuilder)|Larry Scott]] to help develop his shoulders called the \"Scott press\". For triceps, he preferred the overhead cable extensions where the elbows rest on the cradle bench and triceps pressdowns while leaning against a post. For biceps, preacher curls (A.K.A. \"Scott curls\"), spider curls, and dumbbell curls were unbeatable. For training calves, he insisted that calf raises should be done barefoot & for high reps (usually sets of 20) with a full range of motion. His theory in bodybuilding was to build a body using isolation exercises, in order to achieve that mind-muscle connection.\nHe was also very famous for kicking people out of his gym for going against his techniques and performing the certain exercises he counseled against. (I.E. sit-ups, bench press, squats, etc.) Quoting, \"We're not weightlifters, we're bodybuilders\".\n\nDuring the 1960s, Vince's reputation grew as a [[personal trainer]] due to his pupils winning all the important contests, the most well-known pupil being [[Larry Scott (bodybuilder)|Larry Scott]], winning the first 2 [[International Federation of Body Builders|IFBB]] [[Mr. Olympia|Mr. Olympias]] in 1965 & 1966. Bodybuilders who have trained at Vince's Gym over the years include \"Body by\" [[Jake Steinfeld]], [[Lou Ferrigno]] (\"[[The Incredible Hulk (1977 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]\"), [[Frank Zane]], Don Howorth and  [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Gironda came to be known as \"the Iron Guru\", a name former magazine editor and photo/journalist Denie Walter gave him.\n\nIn 1972 Vince and Ray Raridon (personal trainer at Vince's Gym) became frustrated with quality and prices of the nutritional supplements that were in the market. Vince and Ray went on to create their own formulations with Signet Labs in Los Angeles. They came out with NSP Nutrition as their answer to the low quality and ineffective supplements. NSP Research Nutrition was born, which Vince lovingly called \"Old Time Body Building Co.\" They used those terms because \"We still make the staples of natural bodybuilding that Vince so strongly advocated.\n\n=== Competitive history ===\n1949 Pro Mr California - 4th\n\n1950 Pro Mr USA - tied for 4th\n\n1951 Pro Mr America - 2nd\n\n1957 Pro Mr USA - 3rd\n\n1962 [[Universe Championships|Nabba Pro Mr. Universe]] - Class 2, 2nd\n----------------------------------------------\n\n=== Trainer to the stars ===\nBy the early 1950s, he was a very well known trainer of both champion bodybuilders and movie and television actors. Gironda claimed to be able to get a person into shape faster than anyone else.  He also claimed that the movie studios would send their actors and actresses to him for that reason.\n\nA short list of stars who trained at Vince's Gym includes William Smith, [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], [[Cher]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Denzel Washington]], [[James Garner]], [[Brian Keith]], [[Robert McRay]], [[Tommy Chong]] (of Cheech & Chong), Patrick Curtis, [[Gordon Scott]], [[Jeff Goldblum]],Roger Torrey, [[Carl Weathers]], [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]], [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]], [[Clint Walker]], [[Peter Lupus]], [[Sean Penn]] and [[Erik Estrada]].\n\n=== Writer ===\nIn the 1970s Vince wrote countless articles for ''[[Iron Man (magazine)|Iron Man]]'', managed his mail-order business, started a nutrition supplement company (NSP Nutrition) and authored his own training and nutrition manuals, all the time still operating his gym.\n\nIn the 1980s, a book was published with the collaboration of ''MuscleMag International'' publisher Robert Kennedy titled \"Unleashing the Wild Physique\". It contained considerable knowledge Vince gathered and tested throughout his 30+ year career. The release of the book prompted a promotion tour where the Iron Guru gave sold-out seminars throughout the US and Canada.\n\n=== Downfall of Vince's Gym ===\nIn the 1990s the growing popularity of very well-equipped gyms with considerable mass appeal and the emergence of numerous personal trainers to the stars made it difficult for simple gyms to operate, and so Vince's Gym closed in November 1995. A contributing factor to the gym closing was the severe health problems of Gironda's beloved son Guy. Caring for Guy sapped Gironda's energy, and his motivation to run his gym.\n\n== Death ==\nGironda died on October 18, 1997, in [[Ventura County]], less than a month before his 80th birthday.\n\n== Books ==\n*Robert Kennedy and Vince Gironda, ''Unleashing the Wild Physique'', 1984, Sterling Pub.

Through his influence Carey would leave the Church of England and join with other Dissenters to form a small [[Congregational church]] in nearby [[Hackleton]]. While apprenticed to Nichols, he also taught himself [[Greek language|Greek]] with the help of a local villager who had a college education.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nWhen Nichols died in 1779, Carey went to work for the local shoemaker, Thomas Old; he married Old's sister-in-law Dorothy Plackett in 1781 in the Church of St John the Baptist, Piddington. Unlike William, Dorothy was illiterate; her signature in the marriage register is a crude cross. William and Dorothy Carey had seven children, five sons and two daughters; both girls died in infancy, as well as son Peter, who died at the age of 5. Thomas Old himself died soon afterward, and Carey took over his business, during which time he taught himself [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Italian, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and French, often reading while working on the shoes.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nCarey acknowledged his humble origins and referred to himself as a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]]. [[John Brown Myers]] entitled his biography of Carey ''William Carey the Shoemaker Who Became the Father and Founder of Modern Missions''.\n\n==Founding of the Baptist Missionary Society==\n[[File:Detail from Hanging in Carey Baptist Church - Moulton - Northamptonshire.JPG|thumb|Detail from wall hanging depicting Carey's life, in Carey Baptist Church, Moulton, Northamptonshire]]\nCarey became involved with a local association of [[Strict Baptist|Particular Baptists]] that had recently formed, where he became acquainted with men such as [[John Ryland]], [[John Sutcliff]], and [[Andrew Fuller]], who would become his close friends in later years. They invited him to preach in their church in the nearby village of [[Earls Barton]] every other Sunday. On 5 October 1783, William Carey was [[baptism#Baptist|baptised]] by Ryland and committed himself to the Baptist denomination.\n[[File:W H Carey.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait sketch by [[Colesworthey Grant]]]]\nIn 1785, Carey was appointed the schoolmaster for the village of [[Moulton, Northamptonshire|Moulton]]. He was also invited to serve as pastor to the local Baptist church. During this time he read [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]' ''Account of the Life of the Late Rev. [[David Brainerd]]'' and the journals of the explorer [[James Cook]], and became concerned with propagating the Christian [[Gospel]] throughout the world. [[John Eliot (missionary)#Legacy|John Eliot]] (c. 1604 \u2013 21 May 1690), Puritan missionary in New England, and David Brainerd (1718\u201347) became the \"canonized heroes\" and \"enkindlers\" of Carey.<ref>Carpenter, John, (2002) \"New England Puritans: The Grandparents of Modern Protestant Missions,\" ''[[Fides et Historia]]'' 30.4, 529.</ref>\n\nIn 1789 Carey, became the full-time pastor of Harvey Lane Baptist Church in [[Leicester]]. Three years later, in 1792, he published his groundbreaking missionary manifesto, ''An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens''. This short book consists of five parts. The first part is a theological justification for missionary activity, arguing that the command of Jesus to make disciples of all the world ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28:18\u201320) remains binding on Christians.<ref>[http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/enquiry/anenquiry.pdf AN ENQUIRY INTO THE OBLIGATIONS OF CHRISTIANS, TO USE MEANS FOR THE CONVERSION OF THE HEATHENS] reprinted London: Carey Kingsgate Press, 1961</ref>\n\nThe second part outlines a history of missionary activity, beginning with the early Church and ending with David Brainerd and [[John Wesley]].<ref name=\"wmcarey.edu\">William Carey (1792), [http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/enquiry/anenquiry.pdf AN ENQUIRY INTO THE OBLIGATIONS OF CHRISTIANS, TO USE MEANS FOR THE CONVERSION OF THE HEATHENS] reprinted London: Carey Kingsgate Press, 1961</ref>\n\nPart 3 comprises 26 pages of tables, listing area, population, and religion statistics for every country in the world. Carey had compiled these figures during his years as a schoolteacher. The fourth part answers objections to sending missionaries, such as difficulty learning the language or danger to life. Finally, the fifth part calls for the formation by the Baptist denomination of a missionary society and describes the practical means by which it could be supported. Carey's seminal pamphlet outlines his basis for missions: Christian obligation, wise use of available resources, and accurate information.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nCarey later preached a pro-missionary sermon (the so-called [[Deathless Sermon]]), using [[Isaiah]] 54:2\u20133 as his text, in which he repeatedly used the epigram which has become his most famous quotation: {{cquote|Expect great things from God; attempt great things for God.}}\nCarey finally overcame the resistance to missionary effort, and the 'Particular Baptist Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Amongst the Heathen' (subsequently known as the 'Baptist Missionary Society' and since 2000 as [[BMS World Mission]]) was founded in October 1792, including Carey, Andrew Fuller, John Ryland, and John Sutcliff as charter members. They then concerned themselves with practical matters such as raising funds, as well as deciding where they would direct their efforts. A medical missionary, Dr John Thomas, had been in [[Calcutta]] and was in England raising funds; they agreed to support him and that Carey would accompany him to India.\n\n==Missionary life in India==\n[[File:Grave of William Carey, India, ca. 1920 (IMP-CSCNWW33-OS15-65).jpg|thumb|Black-and-white [[lantern slide]] ca 1920, showing the grave at Serampore of William Carey and his second wife Charlotte Emilia Carey (1761-1821) and third wife Grace Carey (d. 1835)]]\nCarey, his eldest son Felix, Thomas and his wife and daughter sailed from London aboard an English ship in April 1793. Dorothy Carey had refused to leave England, being pregnant with their fourth son and having never been more than a few miles from home; but before they left they asked her again to come with them and she gave consent, with the knowledge that her sister Kitty would help her give birth. En route they were delayed at the [[Isle of Wight]], at which time the captain of the ship received word that he endangered his command if he conveyed the missionaries to Calcutta, as their unauthorised journey violated the trade monopoly of the [[British East India Company]]. He decided to sail without them, and they were delayed until June when Thomas found a Danish captain willing to offer them passage. In the meantime, Carey's wife, who had by now given birth, agreed to accompany him provided her sister came as well. They landed at [[Calcutta]] in November.<ref name=notefrom>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/s/smith_geo/carey/carey.htm|title=Note from the preparer of this etext_ I have had to insert a view comments mainly in regards to adjustments to fonts to allow}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first year in Calcutta, the missionaries sought means to [[Tentmaking|support themselves]] and a place to establish their mission. They also began to learn the Bengali language to communicate with others. A friend of Thomas owned two [[indigo dye|indigo]] factories and needed managers, so Carey moved with his family north to [[Midnapore]]. During the six years that Carey managed the indigo plant, he completed the first revision of his Bengali [[New Testament]] and began formulating the principles upon which his missionary community would be formed, including communal living, financial self-reliance, and the training of indigenous ministers. His son Peter died of [[dysentery]], which, along with other causes of stress, resulted in Dorothy suffering a [[nervous breakdown]] from which she never recovered.<ref name=notefrom/>\n\nMeanwhile, the missionary society had begun sending more missionaries to India. The first to arrive was [[John Fountain]], who arrived in Midnapore and began teaching school. He was followed by [[William Ward (missionary)|William Ward]], a printer; [[Joshua Marshman]], a schoolteacher; David Brunsdon, one of Marshman's students; and William Grant, who died three weeks after his arrival. Because the East India Company was still hostile to missionaries, they settled in the [[Danish India|Danish colony]] in [[Serampore]] and were joined there by Carey on 10 January 1800.<ref name=notefrom/>\n\n===Late Indian period===\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}\n[[File:Carey House - Serampore College - Hooghly 2017-07-06 0903.JPG|thumb|Carey lived here at the Serampore College]]\nOnce settled in [[Serampore]], the mission bought a house large enough to accommodate all of their families and a school, which was to be their principal means of support. Ward set up a print shop with a secondhand press Carey had acquired and began the task of printing the Bible in Bengali. In August 1800 Fountain died of dysentery. By the end of that year, the mission had their first convert, a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] named [[Krishna Pal]]. They had also earned the goodwill of the local Danish government and [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley |Richard Wellesley]], then Governor-General of India.\n\nThe conversion of [[Hindu]]s to Christianity posed a new question for the missionaries concerning whether it was appropriate for converts to retain their [[caste]]. In 1802, the daughter of Krishna Pal, a [[Shudra|Sudra]], married a [[Brahmin]]. This wedding was a public demonstration that the church repudiated the caste distinctions.\n\nBrunsdon and Thomas died in 1801. The same year, the Governor-General founded [[Fort William College]], a college intended to educate civil servants. He offered Carey the position of professor of Bengali. Carey's colleagues at the college included [[pundit (India)|pundit]]s, whom he could consult to correct his Bengali testament. One of his colleagues was [[Madan Mohan Tarkalankar]] who taught him the Sanskrit language. He also wrote grammars of Bengali and [[Sanskrit]], and began a translation of the Bible into Sanskrit. He also used his influence with the Governor-General to help put a stop to the practices of infant sacrifice and [[Sati (practice)|suttee]], after consulting with the pundits and determining that they had no basis in the Hindu sacred writings (although the latter would not be abolished until 1829).\n\nDorothy Carey died in 1807.<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1992/issue36/3627.html?start=3 ''William Carey's Less-than-Perfect Family Life''], Christian History, Issue 36, 10 January 1992</ref> Due to her debilitating mental breakdown, she had long since ceased to be an able member of the mission, and her condition was an additional burden to it. John Marshman wrote how Carey worked away on his studies and translations, \"\u2026while an insane wife, frequently wrought up to a state of most distressing excitement, was in the next room\u2026\".\n\nSeveral friends and colleagues had urged William to commit Dorothy to an asylum. But he recoiled at the thought of the treatment she might receive in such a place and took the responsibility to keep her within the family home, even though the children were exposed to her rages.<ref>Timothy George, The Life and Mission of William Carey, IVP, p. 158</ref>\n\nIn 1808 Carey remarried. His new wife [[Charlotte Rhumohr]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] member of his church was, unlike Dorothy, Carey's intellectual equal. They were married for 13 years until her death.\n\nFrom the printing press at the mission came translations of the Bible in Bengali, Sanskrit, and other major languages and dialects. Many of these languages had never been printed before; William Ward had to create [[Punchcutting|punches]] for the type by hand. Carey had begun translating literature and sacred writings from the original Sanskrit into English to make them accessible to his own countryman. On 11 March 1812, a fire in the print shop caused \u00a310,000 in damages and lost work. Among the losses were many irreplaceable manuscripts, including much of Carey's translation of Sanskrit literature and a polyglot dictionary of Sanskrit and related languages, which would have been a seminal [[philology|philological]] work had it been completed. However, the press itself and the punches were saved, and the mission was able to continue printing in six months. In Carey's lifetime, the mission printed and distributed the Bible in whole or part in 44 languages and dialects.\n\nAlso, in 1812, [[Adoniram Judson]], an American [[Congregational church|Congregational]] missionary en route to India, studied the scriptures on baptism in preparation for a meeting with Carey. His studies led him to become a Baptist. Carey's urging of American Baptists to take over support for Judson's mission, led to the foundation in 1814 of the first American Baptist Mission board, the ''General Missionary Convention of the Baptist Denomination in the United States of America for Foreign Missions'', later commonly known as the [[Triennial Convention]]. Most American Baptist denominations of today are directly or indirectly descended from this convention.\n\n[[File:SeramporeCollege.jpg|thumb|left|Serampore College]]\nIn 1818, the mission founded [[Serampore College]] to train indigenous ministers for the growing church and to provide education in the arts and sciences to anyone regardless of caste or country. [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick VI]], [[King of Denmark]], granted a royal charter in 1827 that made the college a degree-granting institution, the first in Asia.<ref>The [[Senate of Serampore College (University) |Senate of Serampore College]]</ref>\n\nIn 1820 Carey founded the [[Agri Horticultural Society of India]] at [[Alipore]], Calcutta, supporting his enthusiasm for botany. When [[William Roxburgh]] went on leave, Carey was entrusted to maintain the Botanical Garden at Calcutta. The genus ''[[Careya]]'' was named after him.<ref>{{cite book| title= William Carey| last =Culross | first = James| publisher=A.C.

In 1823 he married a third time, to a widow named Grace Hughes.\n\nInternal dissent and resentment was growing within the Missionary Society as its numbers grew, the older missionaries died, and they were replaced by less experienced men. Some new missionaries arrived who were not willing to live in the communal fashion that had developed, one going so far as to demand \"a separate house, stable and servants.\"  Unused to the rigorous work ethic of Carey, Ward, and Marshman, the new missionaries thought their seniors \u2013 particularly Marshman \u2013 to be somewhat dictatorial, assigning them work not to their liking.\n\nAndrew Fuller, who had been secretary of the Society in England, had died in 1815, and his successor, John Dyer, was a bureaucrat who attempted to reorganise the Society along business lines and manage every detail of the Serampore mission from England. Their differences proved to be irreconcilable, and Carey formally severed ties with the missionary society he had founded, leaving the mission property and moving onto the college grounds. He lived a quiet life until his death in 1834, revising his Bengali Bible, preaching, and teaching students. The couch on which he died, on 9 June 1834, is now housed at [[Regent's Park College]], the Baptist [[Permanent Private Hall|hall]] of the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n===Criticism===\nMuch of what is known about William Carey's missionary life in India is from missionary reports sent to Britain. Historians such as Comaroffs, Thorne, Van der Veer and Brian Pennington note that the representation of India in these reports must be examined in their context and with care for its evangelical and colonial ideology.<ref name=bkp2/> The reports by Carey were conditioned by his background, personal factors and his own religious beliefs. The polemic notes and observations of Carey, and his colleague William Ward, were in a community suffering from extreme poverty and epidemics, and they constructed a view of Indian culture and Hinduism in light of their missionary goals.<ref name=bkp2/><ref>Robert Eric Frykenberg and Alaine M.

More recently, Beck's biography of Dorothy Carey paints a more detailed picture: William Carey uprooted his family from all that was familiar and sought to settle them in one of the most unlikely and difficult cultures in the world for an uneducated eighteenth century English peasant woman. Faced with enormous difficulties in adjusting to all of this change, she failed to make the adjustment emotionally and ultimately, mentally, and her husband seemed to be unable to help her through all of this because he just did not know what to do about it.<ref name=\"Beck, James R. 1992\">Beck, James R.

Through his influence Carey would leave the Church of England and join with other Dissenters to form a small [[Congregational church]] in nearby [[Hackleton]]. While apprenticed to Nichols, he also taught himself [[Greek language|Greek]] with the help of a local villager who had a college education.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nWhen Nichols died in 1779, Carey went to work for the local shoemaker, Thomas Old; he married Old's sister-in-law Dorothy Plackett in 1781 in the Church of St John the Baptist, Piddington. Unlike William, Dorothy was illiterate; her signature in the marriage register is a crude cross. William and Dorothy Carey had seven children, five sons and two daughters; both girls died in infancy, as well as son Peter, who died at the age of 5. Thomas Old himself died soon afterward, and Carey took over his business, during which time he taught himself [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Italian, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and French, often reading while working on the shoes.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nCarey acknowledged his humble origins and referred to himself as a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]]. [[John Brown Myers]] entitled his biography of Carey ''William Carey the Shoemaker Who Became the Father and Founder of Modern Missions''.\n\n==Founding of the Baptist Missionary Society==\n[[File:Detail from Hanging in Carey Baptist Church - Moulton - Northamptonshire.JPG|thumb|Detail from wall hanging depicting Carey's life, in Carey Baptist Church, Moulton, Northamptonshire]]\nCarey became involved with a local association of [[Strict Baptist|Particular Baptists]] that had recently formed, where he became acquainted with men such as [[John Ryland]], [[John Sutcliff]], and [[Andrew Fuller]], who would become his close friends in later years. They invited him to preach in their church in the nearby village of [[Earls Barton]] every other Sunday. On 5 October 1783, William Carey was [[baptism#Baptist|baptised]] by Ryland and committed himself to the Baptist denomination.\n[[File:W H Carey.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait sketch by [[Colesworthey Grant]]]]\nIn 1785, Carey was appointed the schoolmaster for the village of [[Moulton, Northamptonshire|Moulton]]. He was also invited to serve as pastor to the local Baptist church. During this time he read [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]' ''Account of the Life of the Late Rev. [[David Brainerd]]'' and the journals of the explorer [[James Cook]], and became concerned with propagating the Christian [[Gospel]] throughout the world. [[John Eliot (missionary)#Legacy|John Eliot]] (c. 1604 \u2013 21 May 1690), Puritan missionary in New England, and David Brainerd (1718\u201347) became the \"canonized heroes\" and \"enkindlers\" of Carey.<ref>Carpenter, John, (2002) \"New England Puritans: The Grandparents of Modern Protestant Missions,\" ''[[Fides et Historia]]'' 30.4, 529.</ref>\n\nIn 1789 Carey, became the full-time pastor of Harvey Lane Baptist Church in [[Leicester]]. Three years later, in 1792, he published his groundbreaking missionary manifesto, ''An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens''. This short book consists of five parts. The first part is a theological justification for missionary activity, arguing that the command of Jesus to make disciples of all the world ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28:18\u201320) remains binding on Christians.<ref>[http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/enquiry/anenquiry.pdf AN ENQUIRY INTO THE OBLIGATIONS OF CHRISTIANS, TO USE MEANS FOR THE CONVERSION OF THE HEATHENS] reprinted London: Carey Kingsgate Press, 1961</ref>\n\nThe second part outlines a history of missionary activity, beginning with the early Church and ending with David Brainerd and [[John Wesley]].<ref name=\"wmcarey.edu\">William Carey (1792), [http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/enquiry/anenquiry.pdf AN ENQUIRY INTO THE OBLIGATIONS OF CHRISTIANS, TO USE MEANS FOR THE CONVERSION OF THE HEATHENS] reprinted London: Carey Kingsgate Press, 1961</ref>\n\nPart 3 comprises 26 pages of tables, listing area, population, and religion statistics for every country in the world. Carey had compiled these figures during his years as a schoolteacher. The fourth part answers objections to sending missionaries, such as difficulty learning the language or danger to life. Finally, the fifth part calls for the formation by the Baptist denomination of a missionary society and describes the practical means by which it could be supported. Carey's seminal pamphlet outlines his basis for missions: Christian obligation, wise use of available resources, and accurate information.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nCarey later preached a pro-missionary sermon (the so-called [[Deathless Sermon]]), using [[Isaiah]] 54:2\u20133 as his text, in which he repeatedly used the epigram which has become his most famous quotation: {{cquote|Expect great things from God; attempt great things for God.}}\nCarey finally overcame the resistance to missionary effort, and the 'Particular Baptist Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Amongst the Heathen' (subsequently known as the 'Baptist Missionary Society' and since 2000 as [[BMS World Mission]]) was founded in October 1792, including Carey, Andrew Fuller, John Ryland, and John Sutcliff as charter members. They then concerned themselves with practical matters such as raising funds, as well as deciding where they would direct their efforts. A medical missionary, Dr John Thomas, had been in [[Calcutta]] and was in England raising funds; they agreed to support him and that Carey would accompany him to India.\n\n==Missionary life in India==\n[[File:Grave of William Carey, India, ca. 1920 (IMP-CSCNWW33-OS15-65).jpg|thumb|Black-and-white [[lantern slide]] ca 1920, showing the grave at Serampore of William Carey and his second wife Charlotte Emilia Carey (1761-1821) and third wife Grace Carey (d. 1835)]]\nCarey, his eldest son Felix, Thomas and his wife and daughter sailed from London aboard an English ship in April 1793. Dorothy Carey had refused to leave England, being pregnant with their fourth son and having never been more than a few miles from home; but before they left they asked her again to come with them and she gave consent, with the knowledge that her sister Kitty would help her give birth. En route they were delayed at the [[Isle of Wight]], at which time the captain of the ship received word that he endangered his command if he conveyed the missionaries to Calcutta, as their unauthorised journey violated the trade monopoly of the [[British East India Company]]. He decided to sail without them, and they were delayed until June when Thomas found a Danish captain willing to offer them passage. In the meantime, Carey's wife, who had by now given birth, agreed to accompany him provided her sister came as well. They landed at [[Calcutta]] in November.<ref name=notefrom>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/s/smith_geo/carey/carey.htm|title=Note from the preparer of this etext_ I have had to insert a view comments mainly in regards to adjustments to fonts to allow}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first year in Calcutta, the missionaries sought means to [[Tentmaking|support themselves]] and a place to establish their mission. They also began to learn the Bengali language to communicate with others. A friend of Thomas owned two [[indigo dye|indigo]] factories and needed managers, so Carey moved with his family north to [[Midnapore]]. During the six years that Carey managed the indigo plant, he completed the first revision of his Bengali [[New Testament]] and began formulating the principles upon which his missionary community would be formed, including communal living, financial self-reliance, and the training of indigenous ministers. His son Peter died of [[dysentery]], which, along with other causes of stress, resulted in Dorothy suffering a [[nervous breakdown]] from which she never recovered.<ref name=notefrom/>\n\nMeanwhile, the missionary society had begun sending more missionaries to India. The first to arrive was [[John Fountain]], who arrived in Midnapore and began teaching school. He was followed by [[William Ward (missionary)|William Ward]], a printer; [[Joshua Marshman]], a schoolteacher; David Brunsdon, one of Marshman's students; and William Grant, who died three weeks after his arrival. Because the East India Company was still hostile to missionaries, they settled in the [[Danish India|Danish colony]] in [[Serampore]] and were joined there by Carey on 10 January 1800.<ref name=notefrom/>\n\n===Late Indian period===\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}\n[[File:Carey House - Serampore College - Hooghly 2017-07-06 0903.JPG|thumb|Carey lived here at the Serampore College]]\nOnce settled in [[Serampore]], the mission bought a house large enough to accommodate all of their families and a school, which was to be their principal means of support. Ward set up a print shop with a secondhand press Carey had acquired and began the task of printing the Bible in Bengali. In August 1800 Fountain died of dysentery. By the end of that year, the mission had their first convert, a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] named [[Krishna Pal]]. They had also earned the goodwill of the local Danish government and [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley |Richard Wellesley]], then Governor-General of India.\n\nThe conversion of [[Hindu]]s to Christianity posed a new question for the missionaries concerning whether it was appropriate for converts to retain their [[caste]]. In 1802, the daughter of Krishna Pal, a [[Shudra|Sudra]], married a [[Brahmin]]. This wedding was a public demonstration that the church repudiated the caste distinctions.\n\nBrunsdon and Thomas died in 1801. The same year, the Governor-General founded [[Fort William College]], a college intended to educate civil servants. He offered Carey the position of professor of Bengali. Carey's colleagues at the college included [[pundit (India)|pundit]]s, whom he could consult to correct his Bengali testament. One of his colleagues was [[Madan Mohan Tarkalankar]] who taught him the Sanskrit language. He also wrote grammars of Bengali and [[Sanskrit]], and began a translation of the Bible into Sanskrit. He also used his influence with the Governor-General to help put a stop to the practices of infant sacrifice and [[Sati (practice)|suttee]], after consulting with the pundits and determining that they had no basis in the Hindu sacred writings (although the latter would not be abolished until 1829).\n\nDorothy Carey died in 1807.<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1992/issue36/3627.html?start=3 ''William Carey's Less-than-Perfect Family Life''], Christian History, Issue 36, 10 January 1992</ref> Due to her debilitating mental breakdown, she had long since ceased to be an able member of the mission, and her condition was an additional burden to it. John Marshman wrote how Carey worked away on his studies and translations, \"\u2026while an insane wife, frequently wrought up to a state of most distressing excitement, was in the next room\u2026\".\n\nSeveral friends and colleagues had urged William to commit Dorothy to an asylum. But he recoiled at the thought of the treatment she might receive in such a place and took the responsibility to keep her within the family home, even though the children were exposed to her rages.<ref>Timothy George, The Life and Mission of William Carey, IVP, p. 158</ref>\n\nIn 1808 Carey remarried. His new wife [[Charlotte Rhumohr]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] member of his church was, unlike Dorothy, Carey's intellectual equal. They were married for 13 years until her death.\n\nFrom the printing press at the mission came translations of the Bible in Bengali, Sanskrit, and other major languages and dialects. Many of these languages had never been printed before; William Ward had to create [[Punchcutting|punches]] for the type by hand. Carey had begun translating literature and sacred writings from the original Sanskrit into English to make them accessible to his own countryman. On 11 March 1812, a fire in the print shop caused \u00a310,000 in damages and lost work. Among the losses were many irreplaceable manuscripts, including much of Carey's translation of Sanskrit literature and a polyglot dictionary of Sanskrit and related languages, which would have been a seminal [[philology|philological]] work had it been completed. However, the press itself and the punches were saved, and the mission was able to continue printing in six months. In Carey's lifetime, the mission printed and distributed the Bible in whole or part in 44 languages and dialects.\n\nAlso, in 1812, [[Adoniram Judson]], an American [[Congregational church|Congregational]] missionary en route to India, studied the scriptures on baptism in preparation for a meeting with Carey. His studies led him to become a Baptist. Carey's urging of American Baptists to take over support for Judson's mission, led to the foundation in 1814 of the first American Baptist Mission board, the ''General Missionary Convention of the Baptist Denomination in the United States of America for Foreign Missions'', later commonly known as the [[Triennial Convention]]. Most American Baptist denominations of today are directly or indirectly descended from this convention.\n\n[[File:SeramporeCollege.jpg|thumb|left|Serampore College]]\nIn 1818, the mission founded [[Serampore College]] to train indigenous ministers for the growing church and to provide education in the arts and sciences to anyone regardless of caste or country. [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick VI]], [[King of Denmark]], granted a royal charter in 1827 that made the college a degree-granting institution, the first in Asia.<ref>The [[Senate of Serampore College (University) |Senate of Serampore College]]</ref>\n\nIn 1820 Carey founded the [[Agri Horticultural Society of India]] at [[Alipore]], Calcutta, supporting his enthusiasm for botany. When [[William Roxburgh]] went on leave, Carey was entrusted to maintain the Botanical Garden at Calcutta. The genus ''[[Careya]]'' was named after him.<ref>{{cite book| title= William Carey| last =Culross | first = James| publisher=A.C.

In 1823 he married a third time, to a widow named Grace Hughes.\n\nInternal dissent and resentment was growing within the Missionary Society as its numbers grew, the older missionaries died, and they were replaced by less experienced men. Some new missionaries arrived who were not willing to live in the communal fashion that had developed, one going so far as to demand \"a separate house, stable and servants.\"  Unused to the rigorous work ethic of Carey, Ward, and Marshman, the new missionaries thought their seniors \u2013 particularly Marshman \u2013 to be somewhat dictatorial, assigning them work not to their liking.\n\nAndrew Fuller, who had been secretary of the Society in England, had died in 1815, and his successor, John Dyer, was a bureaucrat who attempted to reorganise the Society along business lines and manage every detail of the Serampore mission from England. Their differences proved to be irreconcilable, and Carey formally severed ties with the missionary society he had founded, leaving the mission property and moving onto the college grounds. He lived a quiet life until his death in 1834, revising his Bengali Bible, preaching, and teaching students. The couch on which he died, on 9 June 1834, is now housed at [[Regent's Park College]], the Baptist [[Permanent Private Hall|hall]] of the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n===Criticism===\nMuch of what is known about William Carey's missionary life in India is from missionary reports sent to Britain. Historians such as Comaroffs, Thorne, Van der Veer and Brian Pennington note that the representation of India in these reports must be examined in their context and with care for its evangelical and colonial ideology.<ref name=bkp2/> The reports by Carey were conditioned by his background, personal factors and his own religious beliefs. The polemic notes and observations of Carey, and his colleague William Ward, were in a community suffering from extreme poverty and epidemics, and they constructed a view of Indian culture and Hinduism in light of their missionary goals.<ref name=bkp2/><ref>Robert Eric Frykenberg and Alaine M. Low (2003), Christians and Missionaries in India, pp. 156\u2013157, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-3956-5}}</ref> These reports were by those who had declared their conviction in foreign missionary work, and the letters describe experiences of foreigners who were resented by both the natives as well as the British colonial officials and competing Christian groups. Their accounts of culture and Hinduism were forged in impoverished Bengal (modern [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]]) that was physically, politically and spiritually difficult.<ref name=bkp2/> Pennington summarises the accounts reported by Carey and his colleagues as follows,\n\n{{cquote|Plagued with anxieties and fears about their own health, regularly reminded of colleagues who had lost their lives or reason, uncertain of their own social location, and preaching to crowds whose reactions ranged from indifference to amusement to hostility, missionaries found expression for their darker misgivings in their production of what is surely part of their speckled legacy: a fabricated Hinduism crazed by blood-lust and devoted to the service of devils.<ref name=bkp2>Brian K. Pennington (2005), Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction, pp. 76\u201377, Oxford University Press</ref>}}\n\nWilliam Carey recommended that British people in India must learn and interpret Sanskrit in a manner \"compatible with colonial aims\".<ref name=sn1>Silvia Nagy (2010), ''Colonization Or Globalization?: Postcolonial Explorations of Imperial Expansion'', p. 62, {{ISBN|978-073-91-31763}}</ref> Carey wrote, \"To gain the ear of those who are thus deceived, it is necessary for them to believe that the speaker has a superior knowledge of the subject. In these circumstances, knowledge of Sanskrit is valuable.\"<ref name= sn1/> Carey lacked understanding and respect for Indian culture, writes Rao,<ref name= vr1/> describing Indian music as \"disgusting\" and bringing to mind practices dishonorable to God.

Myers]], only allude to Carey's distress caused by the mental illness and subsequent breakdown suffered by his wife, Dorothy, in the early years of their ministry in India. More recently, Beck's biography of Dorothy Carey paints a more detailed picture: William Carey uprooted his family from all that was familiar and sought to settle them in one of the most unlikely and difficult cultures in the world for an uneducated eighteenth century English peasant woman. Faced with enormous difficulties in adjusting to all of this change, she failed to make the adjustment emotionally and ultimately, mentally, and her husband seemed to be unable to help her through all of this because he just did not know what to do about it.<ref name=\"Beck, James R. 1992\">Beck, James R.

The IJBC featured longtime Bern producer and collaborator Wil Masisak on keyboards, drums, guitar and [[Bass (instrument)|bass]]; Eben \"Eby Brown\" Grace on guitar and [[Pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]]; Brian \"Slim Nickel\" Schey on bass and guitar; Paul Kuhn on cellocaster; Anna Phoebe on electric violin; and drummers Colin \"Spanky\" Mahoney and Jake Coffin.\n\nIn early 2007, Bern's ''Breathe'' won in The 6th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Folk/Singer-Songwriter Album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/jukebox2007.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501181807/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/jukebox2007.asp|url-status=dead|title=Independent Music Awards \u2013 6th Annual Winners|archivedate=May 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, 2010 and 2012, Bern played with ''[[Common Rotation]]'' from Los Angeles, California  which consists of vocals, guitar, banjo, trumpet, saxophone, and other instruments. Their concert in September 2009 at the M Bar in Los Angeles, was released as a live album in the spring of 2010 called \"Live in Los Angeles\"  with about half the songs Bern playing solo and the other half including Common Rotation.\n\nBern's songwriting skills were used in the biopic parody film ''[[Walk Hard]]'' where he helped write 16 songs for the movie. Many of these songs made the theatrical cut of the film including the Dylanesque \"Royal Jelly,\" and the melodic \"(Have You Heard the News) Dewey Cox Died.\"  He continues to write songs for films, including ''[[Get Him to the Greek]]'' and ''Father's Day''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/tags/horror|title=Horror|website=Syfy.com}}</ref> Bern\u2019s song \"One Dance\" was also included in Kasdan's first film [[Zero Effect]]. Bern wrote \"Swing Set,\" a duet with [[Emmylou Harris]], for the off Broadway production of ''Family Week'' directed by [[Jonathan Demme]], and wrote the title song for Demme's documentary ''Jimmy Carter Man From Plains''.\n\nIn 2012, Bern released two studio recordings of American roots music: ''Drifter,'' featuring a duet with Emmylou Harris, and ''Doubleheader,'' an 18-song tribute to baseball culled from close to 30 years of songwriting and recorded at Bob Weir\u2019s TRI Studios in Marin County. \n\nIn 2004, Bern published the novel ''Quitting Science''  and, in 2012, ''Cleaver the Gronk'' under the pen name Cunliffe Merriwether. \n\nAn avid baseball fan, Bern has written several baseball songs including \"Johnny Sylvester Comes Back to Visit the Babe\" in which he put words to music to the story of [[Babe Ruth]] and Johnny Sylvester.<ref>{{cite book|author=Poekel, Charlie|title=Babe and the Kid: The Legendary Story of Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester|isbn=978-1-59629-267-3|page=140|publisher=The History Press|date=2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Bern released the album ''Regent Street.''\n\n==Life==\nBern learned to play cello at age six, and the guitar at 14.<ref name=post> Kathleen Phalen-Tomaselli, [http://poststar.com/lifestyles/the-artistic-genius-of-dan-bern/article_b678735d-3e70-5433-9118-cfaf3a57aed3.html The artistic genius of Dan Bern] The Poststar.
