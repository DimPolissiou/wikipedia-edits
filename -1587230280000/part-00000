{"title_page": "Real versus nominal value (economics)", "text_new": "{{otheruses|Real versus nominal value}}\n{{Economics sidebar}}\n\nIn [[economics]], '''nominal''' value is measured in terms of money, whereas '''real''' value is measured against goods or services. A real value is one which has been adjusted for [[inflation]], enabling comparison of quantities as if the prices of goods had not changed on average. Changes in value '''in real terms''' therefore exclude the effect of inflation. In contrast with a real value, a nominal value has not been adjusted for inflation, and so changes longitude tectonic brass eon in nominal value reflect at least in part the effect of inflation.\n\n==Prices and inflation==\n\nA representative collection of [[good (economics)|goods]], or '''commodity bundle''', is used for comparison purposes, to measure inflation. The '''nominal''' (unadjusted) value of the commodity bundle in a given year depends on prices current at the time, whereas the real value of the commodity bundle, if it is truly representative, in aggregate remains the same. The real values of individual goods or commodities may rise or fall against each other, in relative terms, but a representative commodity bundle as a whole retains its real value as a constant over time.\n\nA price index is calculated relative to a '''base''' year. Indices are typically normalized at 100 in the base year. Starting from a base (or reference) year, a [[price index]] ''P<sub>t</sub>'' represents the price of the commodity bundle over time ''t''.

A real value is one which has been adjusted for [[inflation]], enabling comparison of quantities as if the prices of goods had not changed on average. Changes in value '''in real terms''' therefore exclude the effect of inflation. In contrast with a real value, a nominal value has not been adjusted for inflation, and so changes in nominal value reflect at least in part the effect of inflation.\n\n==Prices and inflation==\n\nA representative collection of [[good (economics)|goods]], or '''commodity bundle''', is used for comparison purposes, to measure inflation. The '''nominal''' (unadjusted) value of the commodity bundle in a given year depends on prices current at the time, whereas the real value of the commodity bundle, if it is truly representative, in aggregate remains the same. The real values of individual goods or commodities may rise or fall against each other, in relative terms, but a representative commodity bundle as a whole retains its real value as a constant over time.\n\nA price index is calculated relative to a '''base''' year. Indices are typically normalized at 100 in the base year. Starting from a base (or reference) year, a [[price index]] ''P<sub>t</sub>'' represents the price of the commodity bundle over time ''t''. In base year zero, ''P''<sub>0</sub> is set to 100. If for example the base year is 1992, real values are expressed in [[constant dollars|constant 1992 dollars]], with the price level defined as 100 for 1992. If, for example, the price of the commodity bundle has increased in the first year by 1%, then ''P<sub>t</sub>'' rises from ''P''<sub>0</sub> = 100 to ''P''<sub>1</sub> = 101. \n\nThe inflation rate <math>i_t</math> between year ''t'' - 1 and year ''t'' is:\n\n:change in price / price in year ''t'' - 1 \n\n:<math>= \\frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} * 100</math> \n\n:<math>= (\\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1 )  *100</math>\n\n==Real value==\n[[File:U.S. Real and Nominal Gas Prices 1996 to 2016 - v1.png|thumb|400px|Comparison of real and nominal gas prices 1996 to 2016, illustrating the formula for conversion.

''Manhunt'' was subject to a significant [[Video game controversies|video game controversy]] due to the level of [[graphic violence]] depicted, banned in several countries, and implicated in a murder by the [[Media of the United Kingdom|UK media]], although this implication was later rejected by the police and courts. ''Manhunt'' spawned the sequel ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' in 2007, and as of March 2008, the [[Manhunt (video game series)|''Manhunt'' series]] has collectively sold 1.7 million copies.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Mahuntstyle.jpg|thumb|left|An execution in ''Manhunt'', in which James Earl Cash suffocates a hunter with a plastic bag.]]\n''Manhunt'' is a stealth-based urban horror styled game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].

Unlockable content becomes available only when the player achieves three or more stars on a certain number of levels. On normal difficulty (called \"Fetish\"), players can earn only four stars; one is awarded for completing the scene under a certain amount of time, and one to three stars are awarded based on the brutality of the executions carried out during the scene. On hard difficulty (called \"Hardcore\"), players are graded out of five stars; one for speed, one to three for brutality and one for simply completing the scene. To gain the maximum number of stars, a set number of brutal executions must be carried out over the course of each scene; face-to-face fighting does not award stars.<ref name=\"IGNbasics\"/>\n\nIn order to carry out executions, players must approach a hunter from behind, undetected. To facilitate this, each scene is full of \"dark spots\" ([[Computer graphics lighting|shadows]] where the player can hide). Enemies cannot see into the shadows (unless they see the player actually entering the area). A standard technique in the game is to hide in the shadows and tap a wall to attract the attention of a nearby hunter. When the hunter has examined the area and is moving away, players can emerge from the shadows behind them, and execute them.<ref name=\"gspot\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/manhunt-review/1900-6083971/ |title=Manhunt Review (PS2) |author=Kasavin, Greg |date=November 19, 2003 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref> The game has three levels of execution, with each level progressively more violent and graphic than the last: \"hasty\" executions are quick and not very bloody, \"violent\" are considerably more gory, and \"gruesome\" are over-the-top blood-soaked murders.

Cash is forced to kill numerous dangerous gangs in various abandoned locations to satisfy the Director's needs, including \"The Skinz\" (a [[Nazi skinhead]] gang), \"The Wardogs\" (a sadistic [[paramilitary]], who use Cash's family as bait to lure him out), and \"The Innocentz\" (divided between the \"Skullyz\" - [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]], [[occult]]ist gangsters - and \"The Babyfaces\" - demented [[Perversion|perverts]]). After discovering the Director had his family killed, Cash vows revenge. \n\nAfter facing \"The Smileys\" (a gang of [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] inmates) in an [[Psychiatric hospital|insane asylum]], Cash is instructed to follow the \"[[White Rabbit]]\", a man dressed in a rabbit costume, until the Director ultimately betrays him for the \"final scene\" of his film. Cash survives and escapes after killing the White Rabbit, prompting the Director to deploy the remaining Wardogs, led by Ramirez, to find and kill him. Ramirez catches Cash and decides to play a [[cat and mouse]] game with him. Cash ends up managing to kill Ramirez and his men. He is then rescued by the journalist reporting on him, who explains that the Director is Lionel Starkweather, a famous former [[film producer]] from [[Los Santos (Grand Theft Auto)|Los Santos]] who now produces for a [[snuff film]] ring. The journalist has been compiling evidence against Starkweather and now has enough to expose him, but needs to retrieve some from her apartment. Starkweather [[blackmail]]s corrupt police chief Gary Schaffer into apprehending Cash and the journalist, but Cash is able to protect her from the police, before leaving to deal with Starkweather. \n\nCash fights police and [[SWAT]] teams hunting him through the subway and streets until he is cornered in a [[Classification yard|train yard]]. He is almost [[summarily executed]] before the police are killed by the Cerberus, who recapture Cash and bring him to Starkweather's [[mansion]] compound where he is almost executed again. The Cerberus are distracted when Piggsy, a [[mentally disturbed]], [[chainsaw]]-wielding psychopath who wears a [[pig]]'s head as a mask and is normally kept chained up in Starkweather's [[attic]], breaks free. Cash makes his way through the compound, killing all the members of the Cerberus along the way, until facing Piggsy in the upper levels of the mansion, whom he defeats by luring onto a [[Grille|grate]] that collapses under his weight and causes him to fall to his death. Afterwards, Cash finally confronts Starkweather in his office and [[Disembowelment|disembowels]] him with Piggsy's chainsaw, killing him.\n\nLater, the media and the police arrive at the mansion, with the journalist exposing Starkweather's snuff ring and police complicity, leading to Schaffer being [[Criminal charge|criminally prosecuted]] for corruption. Cash, however, is nowhere to be found.\n\n==Development==\n[[Rockstar North]] began development of ''Manhunt'' in the mid-early nineties, building the game with the [[RenderWare]] engine that had been used for the ''Grand Theft Auto'' titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/08/22/manhunt-3 |title=Manhunt (Preview) |author=Perry, Douglass C. |date=August 22, 2003 |website=IGN |publisher=Ziff Davis |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref> In September 2003, ''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'' published a preview of ''Manhunt'', commenting \"[Rockstar North has] scraped its imagination to further twist the way games are made in the future and delivers a chiseled, no-apologies assault on gaming standards.

It will likely be dismissed by many as a disgusting murder simulator with no reason to exist. But ''Manhunt'' also is the ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|Clockwork Orange]]'' of video games, holding your eyes open so as to not miss a single splatter \u2013 asking you, is this really what you enjoy watching? Had ''Manhunt'' been poorly made, using the snuff film angle as a cheap gimmick, the game would have been shameful and exploitative. What elevates it to a grotesque, chilling work of art is both presentation and game play. ''Manhunt'' is solid as a game; it's engaging to use stealth as you creep through the streets of this wicked city, using your smarts to avoid death, while dishing out much of your own. It's [[Ubisoft]]'s ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell|Splinter Cell]]'' meets the cult ''[[Faces of Death]]'' videos [...] If ''Manhunt'' succeeds at retail, it will say more about America's fascination with violence than any political discourse or social debate.

In 2007, former Rockstar employee Jeff Williams revealed that even the game's staff were somewhat uncomfortable about the level of violence; \"there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://badasscat.blogspot.com/2007/07/rockstar.html |title=Life During Wartime - Working at Rockstar Games |author=Williams, Jeff |date=July 24, 2007 |website=Alphabet City |publisher=[[BlogSpot]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070804084043/http://badasscat.blogspot.com/2007/07/rockstar.html |archivedate=August 4, 2007 |url-status=dead |accessdate=September 2, 2010}}</ref> Williams explained that the game \"just made us all feel icky.

On normal difficulty (called \"Fetish\"), players can earn only four stars; one is awarded for completing the scene under a certain amount of time, and one to three stars are awarded based on the brutality of the executions carried out during the scene. On hard difficulty (called \"Hardcore\"), players are graded out of five stars; one for speed, one to three for brutality and one for simply completing the scene. To gain the maximum number of stars, a set number of brutal executions must be carried out over the course of each scene; face-to-face fighting does not award stars.<ref name=\"IGNbasics\"/>\n\nIn order to carry out executions, players must approach a hunter from behind, undetected. To facilitate this, each scene is full of \"dark spots\" ([[Computer graphics lighting|shadows]] where the player can hide). Enemies cannot see into the shadows (unless they see the player actually entering the area). A standard technique in the game is to hide in the shadows and tap a wall to attract the attention of a nearby hunter. When the hunter has examined the area and is moving away, players can emerge from the shadows behind them, and execute them.<ref name=\"gspot\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/manhunt-review/1900-6083971/ |title=Manhunt Review (PS2) |author=Kasavin, Greg |date=November 19, 2003 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref> The game has three levels of execution, with each level progressively more violent and graphic than the last: \"hasty\" executions are quick and not very bloody, \"violent\" are considerably more gory, and \"gruesome\" are over-the-top blood-soaked murders.

Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of [[Analgesic|painkillers]], which are available throughout each scene.<ref name=\"gspot\"/> Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary.<ref name=\"IGNbasics\"/> ''Manhunt'' also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] Microphone and the [[Xbox Live]] microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.<ref name=\"IGNbasics\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2003, in Carcer City, a journalist reports on the news about James Earl Cash, a [[death row]] prisoner recently executed by [[lethal injection]]. However, Cash was only [[Sedative|sedated]], awakening to an unknown voice referring to himself as \"The Director\" giving him instructions through an [[In-ear monitor|earpiece]]. The Director promises Cash his freedom, but only if he murders \"Hunters\" \u2013 [[gang]] members sent to hunt him \u2013 in special areas filmed by [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]]. Cash is instructed to kill members of \"The Hoods\", a gang of corrupt police officers patrolling an abandoned area of Carcer City. He kills the Hoods but is [[Kidnapping|abducted]] by the Cerberus, a unit of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] working as [[private security]] for the Director. Cash is forced to kill numerous dangerous gangs in various abandoned locations to satisfy the Director's needs, including \"The Skinz\" (a [[Nazi skinhead]] gang), \"The Wardogs\" (a sadistic [[paramilitary]], who use Cash's family as bait to lure him out), and \"The Innocentz\" (divided between the \"Skullyz\" - [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]], [[occult]]ist gangsters - and \"The Babyfaces\" - demented [[Perversion|perverts]]). After discovering the Director had his family killed, Cash vows revenge. \n\nAfter facing \"The Smileys\" (a gang of [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] inmates) in an [[Psychiatric hospital|insane asylum]], Cash is instructed to follow the \"[[White Rabbit]]\", a man dressed in a rabbit costume, until the Director ultimately betrays him for the \"final scene\" of his film. Cash survives and escapes after killing the White Rabbit, prompting the Director to deploy the remaining Wardogs, led by Ramirez, to find and kill him. Ramirez catches Cash and decides to play a [[cat and mouse]] game with him. Cash ends up managing to kill Ramirez and his men. He is then rescued by the journalist reporting on him, who explains that the Director is Lionel Starkweather, a famous former [[film producer]] from [[Los Santos (Grand Theft Auto)|Los Santos]] who now produces for a [[snuff film]] ring. The journalist has been compiling evidence against Starkweather and now has enough to expose him, but needs to retrieve some from her apartment. Starkweather [[blackmail]]s corrupt police chief Gary Schaffer into apprehending Cash and the journalist, but Cash is able to protect her from the police, before leaving to deal with Starkweather. \n\nCash fights police and [[SWAT]] teams hunting him through the subway and streets until he is cornered in a [[Classification yard|train yard]]. He is almost [[summarily executed]] before the police are killed by the Cerberus, who recapture Cash and bring him to Starkweather's [[mansion]] compound where he is almost executed again. The Cerberus are distracted when Piggsy, a [[mentally disturbed]], [[chainsaw]]-wielding psychopath who wears a [[pig]]'s head as a mask and is normally kept chained up in Starkweather's [[attic]], breaks free. Cash makes his way through the compound, killing all the members of the Cerberus along the way, until facing Piggsy in the upper levels of the mansion, whom he defeats by luring onto a [[Grille|grate]] that collapses under his weight and causes him to fall to his death. Afterwards, Cash finally confronts Starkweather in his office and [[Disembowelment|disembowels]] him with Piggsy's chainsaw, killing him.\n\nLater, the media and the police arrive at the mansion, with the journalist exposing Starkweather's snuff ring and police complicity, leading to Schaffer being [[Criminal charge|criminally prosecuted]] for corruption. Cash, however, is nowhere to be found.\n\n==Development==\n[[Rockstar North]] began development of ''Manhunt'' in the mid-early nineties, building the game with the [[RenderWare]] engine that had been used for the ''Grand Theft Auto'' titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/08/22/manhunt-3 |title=Manhunt (Preview) |author=Perry, Douglass C. |date=August 22, 2003 |website=IGN |publisher=Ziff Davis |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref> In September 2003, ''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'' published a preview of ''Manhunt'', commenting \"[Rockstar North has] scraped its imagination to further twist the way games are made in the future and delivers a chiseled, no-apologies assault on gaming standards.

But ''Manhunt'' also is the ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|Clockwork Orange]]'' of video games, holding your eyes open so as to not miss a single splatter \u2013 asking you, is this really what you enjoy watching? Had ''Manhunt'' been poorly made, using the snuff film angle as a cheap gimmick, the game would have been shameful and exploitative. What elevates it to a grotesque, chilling work of art is both presentation and game play. ''Manhunt'' is solid as a game; it's engaging to use stealth as you creep through the streets of this wicked city, using your smarts to avoid death, while dishing out much of your own. It's [[Ubisoft]]'s ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell|Splinter Cell]]'' meets the cult ''[[Faces of Death]]'' videos [...] If ''Manhunt'' succeeds at retail, it will say more about America's fascination with violence than any political discourse or social debate.

Do I think games such as these could have dire psychological consequences, particularly for young people? As always, I remain agnostic on the matter. Who knows, really?

{"title_page": "Induction cooking", "text_new": "{{Short description|Direct induction heating of cooking vessels}}\n[[File:Kookplaat inductie.JPG|thumb|alt=Glassy smooth featureless rectangular cooktop set nearly flush with a kitchen counter|Top view of an induction cooktop]]\n'''Induction cooking''' is performed using direct [[induction heating]] of [[cooking vessel]]s, rather than relying on indirect [[radiation]], [[convection]], or [[thermal conduction]]. Induction cooking allows high power and very rapid increases in temperature to be achieved, and changes in heat settings are instantaneous.<ref name=acee/>\n\nIn an induction [[cooktop]] (\"induction hob\" or \"induction stove\"), a coil of copper wire is placed under the cooking pot and an [[alternating current|alternating electric current]] is passed through it. The resulting oscillating [[magnetic field]] [[wireless power transfer|wirelessly]] induces an electrical current in the pot.  This large [[eddy current]] flowing through the resistance of the pot results in resistive heating.\n\nFor nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as [[cast iron]] or some [[stainless steel]]s. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current;  \"all metal\" induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.\n\nInduction cooking has good electrical coupling between the pan and the coil and is thus quite efficient, which means it puts less [[waste heat]] into the kitchen, can be quickly turned on and off, and has safety advantages compared to gas stoves. Cooktops are also usually easy to clean, because the cooktop itself does not get very hot.\n\n==Cooking properties==\n\n[[File:Induction Cooktop Rolling Boil.jpg|thumb|alt=A pot of boiling water atop newspaper on an induction cooking surface|An induction cooking surface boiling water through several layers of newsprint. The paper is undamaged since heat is produced only in the bottom of the pot]]\n\n===Power and control===\nInduction cooking provides fast heating, improved [[thermal efficiency]], and more consistent heating than cooking by thermal conduction.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g0Z4CwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA682&dq=induction%20cooking&pg=PA682#v=onepage&q=induction%20cooking&f=false |title = Wireless Power Transfer|isbn = 9788793237629|last1 = Agbinya|first1 = Johnson I.|date = 2015-12-01}}</ref> The induction elements commonly have heating performance more comparable to a commercial [[gas burner]], but are significantly more energy-efficient. Induction cooking is generally digitally controlled which provides precise control of the power and cooking temperature. This makes it possible to boil a pot rapidly, and then keep a pot just simmering.\n\n===Safety===\nThe unit can detect whether cookware is present by monitoring power delivered. As with other electric ceramic cooking surfaces, a maximum pan size may be specified by the manufacturer, and a minimum size is also stated.\n\nThe control system shuts down the element if a pot is not present or not large enough. If a pan boils dry it can get extremely hot- a thermostat in the surface will turn off the power if it senses overheating to prevent cooker failures and potential fires.\n\n===Cooker surface===\nThe surface of the cooker is heated only by the pot and so does not usually reach a hazardous temperature. Induction cookers are easy to clean because the cooking surface is flat and smooth and does not get hot enough to make spilled food burn and stick.\n\nInduction cookers generally have low-thermal expansion glass ceramic tops that can be damaged by sufficient impact although they are required to meet minimum specified product safety standards with regard to impact.<ref>Hans Bach, Dieter Krause, ''Low thermal expansion glass ceramics'', Springer, 2005 {{ISBN|3-540-24111-6}} page 77, lists IEC, UL, Canadian, Australian and other standards with impact resistance requirements</ref> Aluminum foil can melt onto the top and cause permanent damage or cracking of the top. Surfaces can be scratched by sliding pans across the cooking surface.\n\n===Noise===\nSome noise is generated by an internal cooling fan. Also, [[electromagnetically induced acoustic noise and vibration|audible electromagnetically induced acoustic noise]] (a high pitched hum or buzz) may be produced by cookware, especially at high power, if the cookware has loose parts or if the multi-ply layers of the pot are not well bonded to each other; cookware with welded-in cladding layers and solid riveting is less likely to produce this type of noise. Some users are more capable of hearing or more sensitive to this high-frequency whine.\n\n===Other considerations===\nSome cooking techniques available when cooking over a flame are not applicable. Persons with implanted [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]]s or other electronic medical implants are usually instructed to avoid sources of magnetic fields; the medical literature seems to suggest that proximity to induction cooking surfaces is safe, but individuals with such implants should always check first with their cardiologists. Radio receivers near the induction-cooking unit may pick up some [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nBecause the cook top is shallow compared to a gas-fired or electrical coil cooking surface, wheelchair access can be improved; the user's legs can be below the counter height and the user's arms can reach over the top.\n\n===Efficiency===\n\nThe 2014 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings concluded that \"induction cooking is not always the most efficient method of cooking. When tested with a large cooking vessel, the efficiency of conventional electric\ntechnology was measured to be higher (83%) than that of induction cooking (77%). Yet the\nefficiency of conventional cooking appliances was shown to be highly dependent on the size of\nthe cooking vessel.\"<ref>https://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf</ref> Cooking methods that use flames or hot heating elements have a significantly higher loss to the ambient; induction heating directly heats the pot. Because the induction effect does not directly heat the air around the vessel, induction cooking results in further energy efficiencies. Cooling air is blown through the electronics beneath the surface but it is only slightly warm.\n\nThe purpose of a cooktop is to prepare food; for example, long periods of simmering may be required.  A rational measure of efficiency would be to compare the actual energy input to the cooktop to some theoretical value required to prepare the specified food.  Since experiments to make these measurements would be difficult to replicate, energy efficiency measurements that are published concentrate on the ability of a cooktop to transfer energy to a metal test block, which is much easier to measure in a repeatable fashion.\n\nEnergy transfer efficiency, as defined by [[U.S. Department of Energy]]  (DOE), is the percentage of the energy consumed by a cooker that, at the end of a simulated cooking cycle, appears to have been transferred as heat to a standardized aluminum test block.\n\nThe DOE test cycle starts with both the block and the cooktop at room temperature: 77&nbsp;\u00b0F \u00b1 9&nbsp;\u00b0F (25&nbsp;\u00b0C \u00b1 5&nbsp;\u00b0C). The cooktop is then switched to maximum heating power. When the test block temperature reaches + 144&nbsp;\u00b0F (+80&nbsp;\u00b0C) above the initial room temperature, the cooktop power is immediately reduced to 25% \u00b1 5% of its maximum power. After 15 minutes of operation at this lower power setting, the cooktop is turned off and the heat energy in the test block is measured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title10-vol3/pdf/CFR-2011-title10-vol3-part430-subpartB-appI.pdf#page=6|title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Chapter II, Subchapter D, Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix I: Uniform test method for measuring the energy consumption of conventional ranges, conventional cooking tops, conventional ovens, and microwave ovens|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref> Efficiency is given by the ratio between energy in the block and input (electric) energy.\n\nSuch a test, using a combination of two different power levels, was conceived to mimic real life use. Wasted energy terms such as residual unused heat (retained by solid hot-plates, ceramic or coil at the end of the test), and losses from convection and radiation by hot surfaces (including the ones of the block itself) are simply disregarded and don't contribute to efficiency.\n\nIn typical cooking, the energy delivered by the cooker is only partly used to heat the food up to temperature; once that has occurred, all the subsequent energy input is delivered to the air as loss through steam or convection and radiation from the pan sides. Since there is no increase in the food temperature, the DOE test procedure would consider the efficiency substantially zero. Cooking procedures such as [[Reduction (cooking)|reduction]] of a sauce, [[braising]] meat, simmering, and so on are significant uses of a cooker, but efficiency of these practices is not modelled by the DOE test procedure.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 DOE developed and proposed new test procedures for cooking products to allow direct comparison of energy transfer efficiency measurements among induction, electric resistance, and gas cooking tops and ranges. The procedures use a new hybrid test block made of aluminum and stainless steel, so it is suitable for tests on induction cookers. The proposed rule lists results of real lab tests conducted with the hybrid block. For comparable (large) cooking elements the following efficiencies were measured with \u00b10.5% repeatability: 70.7% - 73.6% for induction, 71.9% for electric coil, 43.9% for gas. Summarizing the results of several tests, DOE affirms that \"induction units have an average efficiency of 72.2%, not significantly higher than the 69.9% efficiency of smooth\u2014electric resistance units, or the 71.2% of electric coil units\".<ref name=\"DOE2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-12-03/pdf/2014-28212.pdf#page=17 |title=Federal Register, Vol. 79 No. 232, December 3 2014, Part III, Department of Energy, Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Conventional Cooking Products; Proposed Rule|format=PDF |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref> Moreover, DOE reminds that the 84% induction efficiency, cited in previous Technical Support Documents, was not measured by DOE laboratories but just \"referenced from an external test study\" performed in 1992.<ref name=\"DOE2014\" />\n\nIn addition independent tests conducted by manufacturers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |title=Electrolux sustainability |format=pdf |accessdate=2016-09-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919100541/http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |archivedate=2016-09-19 |url-status=dead }} See slide # 57</ref>  research laboratories<ref name=acee>{{cite web|url=http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf |title=Induction Cooking Technology Design and Assessment; M.

It can be raised only by using special pots with fins whose first design and commercialization came years ago,<ref name=\"gasefficiency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |title=Improving Range-Top Efficiency with Specialized Vessels |author=Greg Sorensen |author2=David Zabrowski |date=August 2009 |publisher=Appliance Magazine |accessdate=2010-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154301/http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> but that have been recently rediscovered, redesigned in a different way and put again on the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |title=Oxford-designed Flare pan uses 40 per cent less heat than conventional pans \u2014 Department of Engineering Science \u2014 University of Oxford |accessdate=2016-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928005335/http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |archive-date=2016-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> So for environmental considerations dealing with induction versus gas, a 40% gas efficiency will be used.\n\nWhen comparing with gas, the relative cost of electrical and gas energy, and the efficiency of the process by which electricity is generated, affect both overall environmental efficiency<ref>[http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/appliances/cookers.aspx Shopping guide to Gas & Electric Cookers, Ovens & Hobs, from Ethical Consumer]. \"The low CO<sub>2</sub> choice is pretty much always gas, where it is available. Although gas ovens and hobs use more energy, gas generates less carbon dioxide per kWh.\"</ref> (as explained in more detail below) and cost to the user.\n\n===Kitchen ventilation===\nEnergy lost from gas cooking heats the kitchen, whereas with induction cooking, the losses are much lower. This results in less heating of the kitchen itself and can affect the amount of ventilation required.\n\nGas cooking efficiencies may be lower if waste heat generation is taken into account.  Especially in restaurants, gas cooking can significantly increase the ambient temperature in localized areas.  Not only may extra cooling be required, but zoned venting may be needed to adequately condition hot areas without overcooling other areas.  Costs must be considered on an individual situation due to numerous variables in temperature differences, facility layout or openness, and heat generation schedule.  Induction cooking using grid electricity may surpass gas efficiencies when waste heat and air comfort are quantified.\n\nIn a commercial setting, induction cookers do not require safety interlocks between the fuel source and the ventilation, as may be required with gas systems.\n\n{{anchor|inductive_coupling_coils}}\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Induktionskochfeld Spule.jpg|thumb|Inside view of an induction cooker: the large copper coil forms the magnetic field, a cooling fan is visible below it, and power supply and [[line filter]] surround the coil. In the centre of the coil is a temperature sensor, covered in white [[thermal grease]]]]\n[[File:InductionsStove 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Ventilation slots visible. The unit has a small depth compared to the width of the stove|Side view of an induction stove]]\nAn induction cooker transfers electrical energy by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] from a coil of wire into a  metal vessel that must be [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]. The coil is mounted under the cooking surface, and a high frequency (e.g. 24&nbsp;kHz)  [[alternating current]] is passed through it. The current in the coil creates a dynamic magnetic field. When an [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive]] pot is brought close to the cooking surface, and the pan is thicker than the [[skin depth]], the magnetic field induces large [[eddy current]]s in the pot. The eddy currents flow through the [[electrical resistance]] of the pot to produce heat through [[Joule heating]]; the pot then in turn heats its contents by [[heat conduction]].\n\nThe cooking vessel typically needs to be made of a suitable [[stainless steel]] or [[iron]]. The increased [[magnetic permeability]] of the material decreases the [[skin depth]], concentrating the current near the surface of the metal, and so the electrical resistance will be further increased. Some energy will be dissipated wastefully by the current flowing through the resistance of the coil. To reduce the skin effect and consequent heat generation in the coil, it is made from [[litz wire]], which is a bundle of many smaller insulated wires in parallel. The coil has many turns, while the bottom of the pot effectively forms a single shorted turn. This forms a [[transformer]] that steps down the voltage and steps up the current. The resistance of the pot, as viewed from the primary coil, appears larger. In turn, most of the energy becomes heat in the high-resistance steel, while the driving coil stays cool.\n\nOften a thermostat is present to measure the temperature of the pan. This helps prevent the pan from severely overheating if accidentally heated empty or boiled dry, but also can allow the induction cooker to maintain a target temperature.\n\n===Applications===\n\nInduction equipment may be a built-in surface, part of a range, or a standalone surface unit. Built-in and rangetop units typically have multiple elements, the equivalent of separate burners on a gas-fueled range. Stand-alone induction modules are usually single-element, or sometimes have dual elements. All such elements share a basic design: an electromagnet sealed beneath a heat-resisting [[glass-ceramic]] sheet that is easily cleaned. The pot is placed on the ceramic glass surface and begins to heat up, along with its contents.\n\nIn [[Japan]], some models of [[rice cooker]]s are powered by induction. In Hong Kong, power companies list a number of models. Asian manufacturers have taken the lead in producing inexpensive single-induction-zone surfaces; efficient, low-waste-heat units are advantageous in densely populated cities with little living space per family, as many Asian cities are. Induction cookers are less frequently used in other parts of the world.\n\nInduction ranges may be applicable in commercial restaurant kitchens. Electric cooking avoids the cost of natural gas piping and in some jurisdictions may allow simpler ventilation and fire suppression equipment to be installed.<ref>Roger Fields, ''Restaurant Success by the Numbers: A Money-Guy's Guide to Opening the Next Hot Spot'', Random House of Canada, 2007 {{ISBN|1-58008-663-2}}, pp. 144\u2013145</ref> Drawbacks for commercial use include possible breakages of the glass cook-top, higher initial cost and the requirement for magnetic cookware.\n\n===Controls===\n\nThe [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] properties of a steel vessel concentrate the induced current in a thin layer near its surface, which results in a strong heating effect. In [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic materials]] like aluminum, the magnetic field penetrates deeper, and the induced current encounters little resistance in the metal.<ref>{{cite book|url-status=dead|chapter=A comparative study of resonant inverter topologies used in induction cookers|author1=Llorente, S. |title=APEC.

At least one high-frequency \"all-metal\" cooker is available, that works with lower efficiency on non-ferromagnetic metal cookware.\n\nThe cooking surface is made of a [[glass-ceramic]] material which is a poor heat conductor, so only a little heat is lost through the bottom of the pot. In normal operation the cooking surface stays significantly cooler than with other stove cooking methods, but still needs to cool down before it can be safely touched.\n\nUnits may have one, two, three, four or five induction zones, but four (normally in a 30-inch-wide unit) is the most common in the US and Europe. Two coils are most common in Hong Kong and three are most common in Japan. Some have touch-sensitive controls. Some induction stoves have a memory setting, one per element, to control the time that heat is applied. At least one manufacturer makes a \"zoneless\" induction cooking surface with multiple induction coils. This allows up to five utensils to be used at once anywhere on the cooking surface, not just on pre-defined zones.<ref>[http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf DeDietrich \"Piano\" cooktop specifications, retrieved 2012 May 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032647/http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}, dedietrich.co.uk</ref>\n\nSmall stand-alone portable induction cookers are relatively inexpensive, priced from around {{US$|20}} in some markets.\n\n===Cookware===\n\n[[File:Induction-label-de.svg|thumb|Cookware may carry a symbol that identifies it as compatible with an induction cooktop]]\n\nCookware must be compatible with induction heating; in most models, only ferrous metal can be heated. Cookware should have a flat bottom since the magnetic field drops rapidly with distance from the surface. (Special and costly wok-shaped tops are available for use with round-bottom [[wok]]s.) Induction disks are metal plates that are heated by induction and heat non-ferrous pots by thermal contact, but these are much less efficient than ferrous cooking vessels.\n\nInduction compatible cookware for an induction cooking surface can nearly always be used on other stoves. Some cookware or packaging is marked with symbols to indicate compatibility with induction, gas, or electric heat. Induction cooking surfaces work well with any pans with a high ferrous metal content at the base. Cast iron pans and any black metal or iron pans will work on an induction cooking surface. Stainless steel pans will work on an induction cooking surface if the base of the pan is a magnetic grade of stainless steel. If a magnet sticks well to the sole of the pan, it will work on an induction cooking surface. An \"all-metal\" cooker will work with non-ferrous cookware, but available models are limited.\n\nAluminum or copper alone does not work on an induction stove because of the materials\u2019 [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic]] and [[resistivity|electrical]] properties.<ref name=Moreland73>W. C. Moreland, ''The Induction Range: Its Performance and Its Development Problems'', IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, vol. TA-9, no. 1, January/February 1973 pages 81\u201386</ref> Aluminum and copper cookware are more conductive than steel, but the [[skin depth]] in these materials is larger since they are non-magnetic. The current flows in a thicker layer in the metal, encounters less resistance and so produces less heat. The induction cooker will not work efficiently with such pots. However, aluminum and copper are desirable in cookware, since they conduct heat better. Because of this 'tri-ply' pans often have an induction-compatible skin of stainless steel containing a layer of thermally conductive aluminum.\n\nFor frying, a pan with a base that is a good heat conductor is needed to spread the heat quickly and evenly. The sole of the pan will be either a steel plate pressed into the aluminum, or a layer of stainless steel over the aluminum. The high thermal conductivity of aluminum pans makes the temperature more uniform across the pan. Stainless frying pans with an aluminum base will not have the same temperature at their sides as an aluminum sided pan will have. Cast iron frying pans work well with induction cooking surfaces but the material is not as good a thermal conductor as aluminum.\n\nWhen boiling water, the circulating water spreads the heat and prevents hot spots. For products such as sauces, it is important that at least the base of the pan incorporates a good heat conducting material to spread the heat evenly. For delicate products such as thick sauces, a pan with aluminum throughout is better, since the heat flows up the sides through the aluminum, allowing the cook to heat the sauce rapidly but evenly.\n\n[[File:Foil on induction cooktop.jpg|thumb|alt=Aluminum foil in a square Pyrex dish of water, with a tear where the foil has melted| Household foil is much thinner than the skin depth in aluminum at the frequencies used by an induction cooker. Here the foil has melted where it was exposed to the air after steam formed under it. Cooking surface manufacturers prohibit the use of aluminum foil in contact with an induction cooking surface]]\n\nThe heat that can be produced in a pot is a function of the surface resistance. A higher surface resistance produces more heat for similar currents. This is a \u201cfigure of merit\u201d that can be used to rank the suitability of a material for induction heating. The surface resistance in a thick metal conductor is proportional to the resistivity divided by the skin depth. Where the thickness is less than the skin depth, the actual thickness can be used to calculate surface resistance.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some common materials are listed in this table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Skin depth at 24&nbsp;kHz<ref name=Moreland73/>\n!

Since the skin depth is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency, this suggests that much higher frequencies would be required to obtain equivalent heating in a copper pot as in an iron pot at 24&nbsp;kHz. Such high frequencies are not feasible with inexpensive power semiconductors; in 1973 the [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s used were limited to no more than 40&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=Moreland73/> Even a thin layer of copper on the bottom of a steel cooking vessel will shield the steel from the magnetic field and make it unusable for an induction top.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some additional heat is created by [[hysteresis loss]]es in the pot due to its ferromagnetic nature, but this creates less than ten percent of the total heat generated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|title=AN9012 Induction Heating System Topology Review|author=Fairchild Semiconductors|date=July 2000|accessdate=2009-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724205258/http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===\"All-metal\" models===\n\nNew types of power semiconductors and low-loss coil designs have made an all-metal cooker possible.\n\nPanasonic Corporation in 2009 developed a consumer induction cooker that uses a higher-frequency magnetic field, and a different oscillator circuit design, to allow use with non-ferrous metals.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Fujita |first=Atsushi |author2=Sadakata, Hideki |author3=Hirota, Izuo |author4=Omori, Hideki |author5=Nakaoka, Mutsuo |title=Latest developments of high-frequency series load resonant inverter type built-in cooktops for induction heated all metallic appliances |conference=Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, 2009.

Those were named Cool Top 2 (CT2) Induction ranges. The development work was done at the same R&D location by a team led by Bill Moreland and Terry Malarkey. The ranges were priced at $1,500 ($8,260 in 2017 dollars), including a set of high quality cookware made of Quadraply, a new laminate of stainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum and another layer of stainless steel (outside to inside).\n\nProduction took place in 1973 through to 1975 and stopped, coincidentally, with the sale of Westinghouse Consumer Products Division to [[White Consolidated Industries]] Inc.\n\nCT2 had four \"burners\" of about 1,600 watts each, measured by calorimetry. The range top was a [[Pyroceram]] ceramic sheet surrounded by a stainless-steel bezel, upon which four magnetic sliders adjusted four corresponding [[potentiometer]]s set below. That design, using no through-holes, made the range impervious to spills. The electronics section was made of four identical modules which were cooled by a single quiet, low-speed, high-torque fan.\n\nIn each of the electronics modules, the 240 V, 60&nbsp;Hz domestic line power was converted to between 20 V to 200 V of continuously variable DC by a phase-controlled [[rectifier]].

The units were more expensive than standard cooking surfaces.\n\nIn 2009 [[Panasonic]] developed an all-metal induction cooker that used frequencies up to 120&nbsp;kHz,<ref>https://www.sefa.com/panasonic-takes-induction-next-level/ \"Panasonic takes induction to the next level\", retrieved September 19, 2018</ref> three to five times higher than other cooktops,  to work with non-ferrous metal cookware.\n\n===Vendors===\n\nThe market for induction stoves is dominated by German manufacturers.\n\nSingle ring portable hobs have become popular in the UK, with prices as low as \u00a330 from discounters.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe European induction cooking market for hotels, restaurants and other caterers is primarily satisfied by smaller specialist commercial induction catering equipment manufacturers.\n\nTaiwanese and Japanese electronics companies are the dominant players in induction cooking for East Asia. After aggressive promotions by utilities in HK, many local brands emerged. Their power and ratings are high, more than 2,800 watts. Some of these companies have also started marketing in the West. However, the product range sold in Western markets is a subset of that in their domestic market; some Japanese electronics manufacturers only sell domestically.\n\nIn the United States, as of early 2013 there are over five dozen brands of induction-cooking equipment available, including both built-in and countertop residential equipment and commercial-grade equipment.  Even restricting to build-in residential-use units, there are over two dozen brands being sold; residential countertop units add another two-dozen-plus brands to the count.\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders in 2012 estimated that, in the United States, induction cooktops held only 4% of sales, compared to gas and other electric cooktops.<ref>[http://www.nahb.org/generic.aspx?genericContentID=183725&fromGSA=1 ''Kitchen Appliance Upgrades that Shine'', retrieved 2012 Aug 15], nahb.org{{dead link|date=August 2015}}</ref> The global induction cooktops market was estimated at $9.16 ml in value during 2015 and is set to grow to $13.53 mil by 2022.\n\nIn April 2010, ''The New York Times'' reported that \"In an independent survey last summer by the market research company Mintel of 2,000 Internet users who own appliances, only 5 percent of respondents said they had an induction range or cooktop. . . .

Induction cooking allows high power and very rapid increases in temperature to be achieved, and changes in heat settings are instantaneous.<ref name=acee/>\n\nIn an induction [[cooktop]] (\"induction hob\" or \"induction stove\"), a coil of copper wire is placed under the cooking pot and an [[alternating current|alternating electric current]] is passed through it. The resulting oscillating [[magnetic field]] [[wireless power transfer|wirelessly]] induces an electrical current in the pot.  This large [[eddy current]] flowing through the resistance of the pot results in resistive heating.\n\nFor nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as [[cast iron]] or some [[stainless steel]]s. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current;  \"all metal\" induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.\n\nInduction cooking has good electrical coupling between the pan and the coil and is thus quite efficient, which means it puts less [[waste heat]] into the kitchen, can be quickly turned on and off, and has safety advantages compared to gas stoves. Cooktops are also usually easy to clean, because the cooktop itself does not get very hot.\n\n==Cooking properties==\n\n[[File:Induction Cooktop Rolling Boil.jpg|thumb|alt=A pot of boiling water atop newspaper on an induction cooking surface|An induction cooking surface boiling water through several layers of newsprint. The paper is undamaged since heat is produced only in the bottom of the pot]]\n\n===Power and control===\nInduction cooking provides fast heating, improved [[thermal efficiency]], and more consistent heating than cooking by thermal conduction.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g0Z4CwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA682&dq=induction%20cooking&pg=PA682#v=onepage&q=induction%20cooking&f=false |title = Wireless Power Transfer|isbn = 9788793237629|last1 = Agbinya|first1 = Johnson I.|date = 2015-12-01}}</ref> The induction elements commonly have heating performance more comparable to a commercial [[gas burner]], but are significantly more energy-efficient. Induction cooking is generally digitally controlled which provides precise control of the power and cooking temperature. This makes it possible to boil a pot rapidly, and then keep a pot just simmering.\n\n===Safety===\nThe unit can detect whether cookware is present by monitoring power delivered. As with other electric ceramic cooking surfaces, a maximum pan size may be specified by the manufacturer, and a minimum size is also stated.\n\nThe control system shuts down the element if a pot is not present or not large enough. If a pan boils dry it can get extremely hot- a thermostat in the surface will turn off the power if it senses overheating to prevent cooker failures and potential fires.\n\n===Cooker surface===\nThe surface of the cooker is heated only by the pot and so does not usually reach a hazardous temperature. Induction cookers are easy to clean because the cooking surface is flat and smooth and does not get hot enough to make spilled food burn and stick.\n\nInduction cookers generally have low-thermal expansion glass ceramic tops that can be damaged by sufficient impact although they are required to meet minimum specified product safety standards with regard to impact.<ref>Hans Bach, Dieter Krause, ''Low thermal expansion glass ceramics'', Springer, 2005 {{ISBN|3-540-24111-6}} page 77, lists IEC, UL, Canadian, Australian and other standards with impact resistance requirements</ref> Aluminum foil can melt onto the top and cause permanent damage or cracking of the top. Surfaces can be scratched by sliding pans across the cooking surface.\n\n===Noise===\nSome noise is generated by an internal cooling fan. Also, [[electromagnetically induced acoustic noise and vibration|audible electromagnetically induced acoustic noise]] (a high pitched hum or buzz) may be produced by cookware, especially at high power, if the cookware has loose parts or if the multi-ply layers of the pot are not well bonded to each other; cookware with welded-in cladding layers and solid riveting is less likely to produce this type of noise. Some users are more capable of hearing or more sensitive to this high-frequency whine.\n\n===Other considerations===\nSome cooking techniques available when cooking over a flame are not applicable. Persons with implanted [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]]s or other electronic medical implants are usually instructed to avoid sources of magnetic fields; the medical literature seems to suggest that proximity to induction cooking surfaces is safe, but individuals with such implants should always check first with their cardiologists. Radio receivers near the induction-cooking unit may pick up some [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nBecause the cook top is shallow compared to a gas-fired or electrical coil cooking surface, wheelchair access can be improved; the user's legs can be below the counter height and the user's arms can reach over the top.\n\n===Efficiency===\n\nThe 2014 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings concluded that \"induction cooking is not always the most efficient method of cooking. When tested with a large cooking vessel, the efficiency of conventional electric\ntechnology was measured to be higher (83%) than that of induction cooking (77%). Yet the\nefficiency of conventional cooking appliances was shown to be highly dependent on the size of\nthe cooking vessel.\"<ref>https://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf</ref> Cooking methods that use flames or hot heating elements have a significantly higher loss to the ambient; induction heating directly heats the pot. Because the induction effect does not directly heat the air around the vessel, induction cooking results in further energy efficiencies. Cooling air is blown through the electronics beneath the surface but it is only slightly warm.\n\nThe purpose of a cooktop is to prepare food; for example, long periods of simmering may be required.  A rational measure of efficiency would be to compare the actual energy input to the cooktop to some theoretical value required to prepare the specified food.  Since experiments to make these measurements would be difficult to replicate, energy efficiency measurements that are published concentrate on the ability of a cooktop to transfer energy to a metal test block, which is much easier to measure in a repeatable fashion.\n\nEnergy transfer efficiency, as defined by [[U.S. Department of Energy]]  (DOE), is the percentage of the energy consumed by a cooker that, at the end of a simulated cooking cycle, appears to have been transferred as heat to a standardized aluminum test block.\n\nThe DOE test cycle starts with both the block and the cooktop at room temperature: 77&nbsp;\u00b0F \u00b1 9&nbsp;\u00b0F (25&nbsp;\u00b0C \u00b1 5&nbsp;\u00b0C). The cooktop is then switched to maximum heating power. When the test block temperature reaches + 144&nbsp;\u00b0F (+80&nbsp;\u00b0C) above the initial room temperature, the cooktop power is immediately reduced to 25% \u00b1 5% of its maximum power. After 15 minutes of operation at this lower power setting, the cooktop is turned off and the heat energy in the test block is measured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title10-vol3/pdf/CFR-2011-title10-vol3-part430-subpartB-appI.pdf#page=6|title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Chapter II, Subchapter D, Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix I: Uniform test method for measuring the energy consumption of conventional ranges, conventional cooking tops, conventional ovens, and microwave ovens|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref> Efficiency is given by the ratio between energy in the block and input (electric) energy.\n\nSuch a test, using a combination of two different power levels, was conceived to mimic real life use. Wasted energy terms such as residual unused heat (retained by solid hot-plates, ceramic or coil at the end of the test), and losses from convection and radiation by hot surfaces (including the ones of the block itself) are simply disregarded and don't contribute to efficiency.\n\nIn typical cooking, the energy delivered by the cooker is only partly used to heat the food up to temperature; once that has occurred, all the subsequent energy input is delivered to the air as loss through steam or convection and radiation from the pan sides. Since there is no increase in the food temperature, the DOE test procedure would consider the efficiency substantially zero. Cooking procedures such as [[Reduction (cooking)|reduction]] of a sauce, [[braising]] meat, simmering, and so on are significant uses of a cooker, but efficiency of these practices is not modelled by the DOE test procedure.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 DOE developed and proposed new test procedures for cooking products to allow direct comparison of energy transfer efficiency measurements among induction, electric resistance, and gas cooking tops and ranges. The procedures use a new hybrid test block made of aluminum and stainless steel, so it is suitable for tests on induction cookers. The proposed rule lists results of real lab tests conducted with the hybrid block. For comparable (large) cooking elements the following efficiencies were measured with \u00b10.5% repeatability: 70.7% - 73.6% for induction, 71.9% for electric coil, 43.9% for gas. Summarizing the results of several tests, DOE affirms that \"induction units have an average efficiency of 72.2%, not significantly higher than the 69.9% efficiency of smooth\u2014electric resistance units, or the 71.2% of electric coil units\".<ref name=\"DOE2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-12-03/pdf/2014-28212.pdf#page=17 |title=Federal Register, Vol. 79 No. 232, December 3 2014, Part III, Department of Energy, Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Conventional Cooking Products; Proposed Rule|format=PDF |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref> Moreover, DOE reminds that the 84% induction efficiency, cited in previous Technical Support Documents, was not measured by DOE laboratories but just \"referenced from an external test study\" performed in 1992.<ref name=\"DOE2014\" />\n\nIn addition independent tests conducted by manufacturers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |title=Electrolux sustainability |format=pdf |accessdate=2016-09-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919100541/http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |archivedate=2016-09-19 |url-status=dead }} See slide # 57</ref>  research laboratories<ref name=acee>{{cite web|url=http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf |title=Induction Cooking Technology Design and Assessment; M.

It can be raised only by using special pots with fins whose first design and commercialization came years ago,<ref name=\"gasefficiency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |title=Improving Range-Top Efficiency with Specialized Vessels |author=Greg Sorensen |author2=David Zabrowski |date=August 2009 |publisher=Appliance Magazine |accessdate=2010-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154301/http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> but that have been recently rediscovered, redesigned in a different way and put again on the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |title=Oxford-designed Flare pan uses 40 per cent less heat than conventional pans \u2014 Department of Engineering Science \u2014 University of Oxford |accessdate=2016-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928005335/http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |archive-date=2016-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> So for environmental considerations dealing with induction versus gas, a 40% gas efficiency will be used.\n\nWhen comparing with gas, the relative cost of electrical and gas energy, and the efficiency of the process by which electricity is generated, affect both overall environmental efficiency<ref>[http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/appliances/cookers.aspx Shopping guide to Gas & Electric Cookers, Ovens & Hobs, from Ethical Consumer]. \"The low CO<sub>2</sub> choice is pretty much always gas, where it is available. Although gas ovens and hobs use more energy, gas generates less carbon dioxide per kWh.\"</ref> (as explained in more detail below) and cost to the user.\n\n===Kitchen ventilation===\nEnergy lost from gas cooking heats the kitchen, whereas with induction cooking, the losses are much lower. This results in less heating of the kitchen itself and can affect the amount of ventilation required.\n\nGas cooking efficiencies may be lower if waste heat generation is taken into account.  Especially in restaurants, gas cooking can significantly increase the ambient temperature in localized areas.  Not only may extra cooling be required, but zoned venting may be needed to adequately condition hot areas without overcooling other areas.  Costs must be considered on an individual situation due to numerous variables in temperature differences, facility layout or openness, and heat generation schedule.  Induction cooking using grid electricity may surpass gas efficiencies when waste heat and air comfort are quantified.\n\nIn a commercial setting, induction cookers do not require safety interlocks between the fuel source and the ventilation, as may be required with gas systems.\n\n{{anchor|inductive_coupling_coils}}\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Induktionskochfeld Spule.jpg|thumb|Inside view of an induction cooker: the large copper coil forms the magnetic field, a cooling fan is visible below it, and power supply and [[line filter]] surround the coil. In the centre of the coil is a temperature sensor, covered in white [[thermal grease]]]]\n[[File:InductionsStove 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Ventilation slots visible. The unit has a small depth compared to the width of the stove|Side view of an induction stove]]\nAn induction cooker transfers electrical energy by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] from a coil of wire into a  metal vessel that must be [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]. The coil is mounted under the cooking surface, and a high frequency (e.g. 24&nbsp;kHz)  [[alternating current]] is passed through it. The current in the coil creates a dynamic magnetic field. When an [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive]] pot is brought close to the cooking surface, and the pan is thicker than the [[skin depth]], the magnetic field induces large [[eddy current]]s in the pot. The eddy currents flow through the [[electrical resistance]] of the pot to produce heat through [[Joule heating]]; the pot then in turn heats its contents by [[heat conduction]].\n\nThe cooking vessel typically needs to be made of a suitable [[stainless steel]] or [[iron]]. The increased [[magnetic permeability]] of the material decreases the [[skin depth]], concentrating the current near the surface of the metal, and so the electrical resistance will be further increased. Some energy will be dissipated wastefully by the current flowing through the resistance of the coil. To reduce the skin effect and consequent heat generation in the coil, it is made from [[litz wire]], which is a bundle of many smaller insulated wires in parallel. The coil has many turns, while the bottom of the pot effectively forms a single shorted turn. This forms a [[transformer]] that steps down the voltage and steps up the current. The resistance of the pot, as viewed from the primary coil, appears larger. In turn, most of the energy becomes heat in the high-resistance steel, while the driving coil stays cool.\n\nOften a thermostat is present to measure the temperature of the pan. This helps prevent the pan from severely overheating if accidentally heated empty or boiled dry, but also can allow the induction cooker to maintain a target temperature.\n\n===Applications===\n\nInduction equipment may be a built-in surface, part of a range, or a standalone surface unit. Built-in and rangetop units typically have multiple elements, the equivalent of separate burners on a gas-fueled range. Stand-alone induction modules are usually single-element, or sometimes have dual elements. All such elements share a basic design: an electromagnet sealed beneath a heat-resisting [[glass-ceramic]] sheet that is easily cleaned. The pot is placed on the ceramic glass surface and begins to heat up, along with its contents.\n\nIn [[Japan]], some models of [[rice cooker]]s are powered by induction. In Hong Kong, power companies list a number of models. Asian manufacturers have taken the lead in producing inexpensive single-induction-zone surfaces; efficient, low-waste-heat units are advantageous in densely populated cities with little living space per family, as many Asian cities are. Induction cookers are less frequently used in other parts of the world.\n\nInduction ranges may be applicable in commercial restaurant kitchens. Electric cooking avoids the cost of natural gas piping and in some jurisdictions may allow simpler ventilation and fire suppression equipment to be installed.<ref>Roger Fields, ''Restaurant Success by the Numbers: A Money-Guy's Guide to Opening the Next Hot Spot'', Random House of Canada, 2007 {{ISBN|1-58008-663-2}}, pp. 144\u2013145</ref> Drawbacks for commercial use include possible breakages of the glass cook-top, higher initial cost and the requirement for magnetic cookware.\n\n===Controls===\n\nThe [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] properties of a steel vessel concentrate the induced current in a thin layer near its surface, which results in a strong heating effect. In [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic materials]] like aluminum, the magnetic field penetrates deeper, and the induced current encounters little resistance in the metal.<ref>{{cite book|url-status=dead|chapter=A comparative study of resonant inverter topologies used in induction cookers|author1=Llorente, S. |title=APEC.

At least one high-frequency \"all-metal\" cooker is available, that works with lower efficiency on non-ferromagnetic metal cookware.\n\nThe cooking surface is made of a [[glass-ceramic]] material which is a poor heat conductor, so only a little heat is lost through the bottom of the pot. In normal operation the cooking surface stays significantly cooler than with other stove cooking methods, but still needs to cool down before it can be safely touched.\n\nUnits may have one, two, three, four or five induction zones, but four (normally in a 30-inch-wide unit) is the most common in the US and Europe. Two coils are most common in Hong Kong and three are most common in Japan. Some have touch-sensitive controls. Some induction stoves have a memory setting, one per element, to control the time that heat is applied. At least one manufacturer makes a \"zoneless\" induction cooking surface with multiple induction coils. This allows up to five utensils to be used at once anywhere on the cooking surface, not just on pre-defined zones.<ref>[http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf DeDietrich \"Piano\" cooktop specifications, retrieved 2012 May 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032647/http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}, dedietrich.co.uk</ref>\n\nSmall stand-alone portable induction cookers are relatively inexpensive, priced from around {{US$|20}} in some markets.\n\n===Cookware===\n\n[[File:Induction-label-de.svg|thumb|Cookware may carry a symbol that identifies it as compatible with an induction cooktop]]\n\nCookware must be compatible with induction heating; in most models, only ferrous metal can be heated. Cookware should have a flat bottom since the magnetic field drops rapidly with distance from the surface. (Special and costly wok-shaped tops are available for use with round-bottom [[wok]]s.) Induction disks are metal plates that are heated by induction and heat non-ferrous pots by thermal contact, but these are much less efficient than ferrous cooking vessels.\n\nInduction compatible cookware for an induction cooking surface can nearly always be used on other stoves. Some cookware or packaging is marked with symbols to indicate compatibility with induction, gas, or electric heat. Induction cooking surfaces work well with any pans with a high ferrous metal content at the base. Cast iron pans and any black metal or iron pans will work on an induction cooking surface. Stainless steel pans will work on an induction cooking surface if the base of the pan is a magnetic grade of stainless steel. If a magnet sticks well to the sole of the pan, it will work on an induction cooking surface. An \"all-metal\" cooker will work with non-ferrous cookware, but available models are limited.\n\nAluminum or copper alone does not work on an induction stove because of the materials\u2019 [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic]] and [[resistivity|electrical]] properties.<ref name=Moreland73>W. C. Moreland, ''The Induction Range: Its Performance and Its Development Problems'', IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, vol. TA-9, no. 1, January/February 1973 pages 81\u201386</ref> Aluminum and copper cookware are more conductive than steel, but the [[skin depth]] in these materials is larger since they are non-magnetic. The current flows in a thicker layer in the metal, encounters less resistance and so produces less heat. The induction cooker will not work efficiently with such pots. However, aluminum and copper are desirable in cookware, since they conduct heat better. Because of this 'tri-ply' pans often have an induction-compatible skin of stainless steel containing a layer of thermally conductive aluminum.\n\nFor frying, a pan with a base that is a good heat conductor is needed to spread the heat quickly and evenly. The sole of the pan will be either a steel plate pressed into the aluminum, or a layer of stainless steel over the aluminum. The high thermal conductivity of aluminum pans makes the temperature more uniform across the pan. Stainless frying pans with an aluminum base will not have the same temperature at their sides as an aluminum sided pan will have. Cast iron frying pans work well with induction cooking surfaces but the material is not as good a thermal conductor as aluminum.\n\nWhen boiling water, the circulating water spreads the heat and prevents hot spots. For products such as sauces, it is important that at least the base of the pan incorporates a good heat conducting material to spread the heat evenly. For delicate products such as thick sauces, a pan with aluminum throughout is better, since the heat flows up the sides through the aluminum, allowing the cook to heat the sauce rapidly but evenly.\n\n[[File:Foil on induction cooktop.jpg|thumb|alt=Aluminum foil in a square Pyrex dish of water, with a tear where the foil has melted| Household foil is much thinner than the skin depth in aluminum at the frequencies used by an induction cooker. Here the foil has melted where it was exposed to the air after steam formed under it. Cooking surface manufacturers prohibit the use of aluminum foil in contact with an induction cooking surface]]\n\nThe heat that can be produced in a pot is a function of the surface resistance. A higher surface resistance produces more heat for similar currents. This is a \u201cfigure of merit\u201d that can be used to rank the suitability of a material for induction heating. The surface resistance in a thick metal conductor is proportional to the resistivity divided by the skin depth. Where the thickness is less than the skin depth, the actual thickness can be used to calculate surface resistance.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some common materials are listed in this table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Skin depth at 24&nbsp;kHz<ref name=Moreland73/>\n!

Since the skin depth is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency, this suggests that much higher frequencies would be required to obtain equivalent heating in a copper pot as in an iron pot at 24&nbsp;kHz. Such high frequencies are not feasible with inexpensive power semiconductors; in 1973 the [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s used were limited to no more than 40&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=Moreland73/> Even a thin layer of copper on the bottom of a steel cooking vessel will shield the steel from the magnetic field and make it unusable for an induction top.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some additional heat is created by [[hysteresis loss]]es in the pot due to its ferromagnetic nature, but this creates less than ten percent of the total heat generated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|title=AN9012 Induction Heating System Topology Review|author=Fairchild Semiconductors|date=July 2000|accessdate=2009-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724205258/http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===\"All-metal\" models===\n\nNew types of power semiconductors and low-loss coil designs have made an all-metal cooker possible.\n\nPanasonic Corporation in 2009 developed a consumer induction cooker that uses a higher-frequency magnetic field, and a different oscillator circuit design, to allow use with non-ferrous metals.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Fujita |first=Atsushi |author2=Sadakata, Hideki |author3=Hirota, Izuo |author4=Omori, Hideki |author5=Nakaoka, Mutsuo |title=Latest developments of high-frequency series load resonant inverter type built-in cooktops for induction heated all metallic appliances |conference=Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, 2009.

Unlike this concept, a modern cooking surface uses electronically generated high-frequency current]]\nFirst patents date from the early 1900s.<ref>for example see UK Patent Application GB190612333, entitled \"Improvements in or relating to Apparatus for the Electrical Production of Heat for Cooking and other purposes\", applied for by Arthur F. Berry on 26 May 1906</ref> Demonstration stoves were shown by the Frigidaire division of General Motors in the mid-1950s<ref>''Kitchen of the Future has Glass-Dome Oven and Automatic Food Mixer'', Popular Mechanics Apr 1956, page 88</ref> on a touring GM showcase in North America. The induction cooker was shown heating a pot of water with a newspaper placed between the stove and the pot, to demonstrate the convenience and safety. This unit, however, was never put into production.\n\nModern implementation in the USA dates from the early 1970s, with work done at the Research & Development Center of [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] at Churchill Borough, near [[Pittsburgh]],<ref name=Moreland73/> That work was first put on public display at the 1971 [[National Association of Home Builders]] convention in Houston, Texas, as part of the Westinghouse Consumer Products Division display.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The stand-alone single-burner range was named the Cool Top Induction Range. It used paralleled [[Delco Electronics]] transistors developed for automotive electronic ignition systems to drive the 25&nbsp;kHz current.\n\n[[File:Westinghouse CT-2 Induction Range photograph 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The Westinghouse Electric CT-2; the first production induction range from 1973]]\nWestinghouse decided to make a few hundred production units to develop the market. Those were named Cool Top 2 (CT2) Induction ranges. The development work was done at the same R&D location by a team led by Bill Moreland and Terry Malarkey. The ranges were priced at $1,500 ($8,260 in 2017 dollars), including a set of high quality cookware made of Quadraply, a new laminate of stainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum and another layer of stainless steel (outside to inside).\n\nProduction took place in 1973 through to 1975 and stopped, coincidentally, with the sale of Westinghouse Consumer Products Division to [[White Consolidated Industries]] Inc.\n\nCT2 had four \"burners\" of about 1,600 watts each, measured by calorimetry. The range top was a [[Pyroceram]] ceramic sheet surrounded by a stainless-steel bezel, upon which four magnetic sliders adjusted four corresponding [[potentiometer]]s set below. That design, using no through-holes, made the range impervious to spills. The electronics section was made of four identical modules which were cooled by a single quiet, low-speed, high-torque fan.\n\nIn each of the electronics modules, the 240 V, 60&nbsp;Hz domestic line power was converted to between 20 V to 200 V of continuously variable DC by a phase-controlled [[rectifier]]. That DC power was in turn converted to 27&nbsp;kHz 30&nbsp;A (peak) AC by two arrays of six paralleled [[Motorola]] automotive-ignition transistors in a half-bridge configuration driving a series-resonant [[LC circuit|LC]] [[oscillator]], of which the inductor component was the induction-heating coil and its load, the cooking pan. The circuit design, largely by Ray Mackenzie,<ref>{{US Patent|3889090|Induction Heat Cooking Apparatus|Raymond W Mackenzie}}</ref> successfully dealt with certain bothersome overload problems.\n\nControl electronics included functions such as protection against over-heated cook-pans and overloads. Provision was made to reduce radiated electrical and magnetic fields.<ref>{{US Patent|4163139|Cooking vessel capacitive decoupling for induction cooking apparatus|Terence D Malarkey et al}}</ref><ref>{{US Patent|3996442|Induction heating coil assembly for heating cooking vessels|William C Moreland II et al}}</ref> There was also magnetic pan detection.<ref>{{US Patent|3796850|Pan detector for induction heating cooking unit|William C Moreland II et al}}</ref>\n\nCT2 was [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] Listed and received [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approval, both firsts. Numerous patents were also issued. CT2 won several awards, including Industrial Research Magazine's IR-100 1972 best-product award <ref>[http://www.rdmag.com/RD100SearchResults.aspx?&strCompany=Westinghouse&Type=C Archive, retrieved 2012 Aug 22], rdmag.com {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and a citation from the United States Steel Association. [[Raymond Baxter]] demonstrated the CT2 on the [[BBC]] series ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''. He showed how the CT2 could cook through a slab of ice.\n\n[[Kenmore Appliances|Sears Kenmore]] sold a free-standing oven/stove with four induction-cooking surfaces in the mid-1980s (Model Number 103.9647910). The unit also featured a [[self-cleaning oven]], solid-state kitchen timer and capacitive-touch control buttons (advanced for its time). The units were more expensive than standard cooking surfaces.\n\nIn 2009 [[Panasonic]] developed an all-metal induction cooker that used frequencies up to 120&nbsp;kHz,<ref>https://www.sefa.com/panasonic-takes-induction-next-level/ \"Panasonic takes induction to the next level\", retrieved September 19, 2018</ref> three to five times higher than other cooktops,  to work with non-ferrous metal cookware.\n\n===Vendors===\n\nThe market for induction stoves is dominated by German manufacturers.\n\nSingle ring portable hobs have become popular in the UK, with prices as low as \u00a330 from discounters.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe European induction cooking market for hotels, restaurants and other caterers is primarily satisfied by smaller specialist commercial induction catering equipment manufacturers.\n\nTaiwanese and Japanese electronics companies are the dominant players in induction cooking for East Asia. After aggressive promotions by utilities in HK, many local brands emerged. Their power and ratings are high, more than 2,800 watts. Some of these companies have also started marketing in the West. However, the product range sold in Western markets is a subset of that in their domestic market; some Japanese electronics manufacturers only sell domestically.\n\nIn the United States, as of early 2013 there are over five dozen brands of induction-cooking equipment available, including both built-in and countertop residential equipment and commercial-grade equipment.  Even restricting to build-in residential-use units, there are over two dozen brands being sold; residential countertop units add another two-dozen-plus brands to the count.\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders in 2012 estimated that, in the United States, induction cooktops held only 4% of sales, compared to gas and other electric cooktops.<ref>[http://www.nahb.org/generic.aspx?genericContentID=183725&fromGSA=1 ''Kitchen Appliance Upgrades that Shine'', retrieved 2012 Aug 15], nahb.org{{dead link|date=August 2015}}</ref> The global induction cooktops market was estimated at $9.16 ml in value during 2015 and is set to grow to $13.53 mil by 2022.\n\nIn April 2010, ''The New York Times'' reported that \"In an independent survey last summer by the market research company Mintel of 2,000 Internet users who own appliances, only 5 percent of respondents said they had an induction range or cooktop. . . .
