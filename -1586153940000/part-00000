Fullington has held the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] a record five times. He also had stints in [[World Championship Wrestling]], [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], and [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]].\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Tri-State Wrestling (1989\u20131992)===\nFullington got his start in professional wrestling in the [[Philadelphia]]-based Tri-State Wrestling Alliance under the [[ring name]] Mr. Sandman, [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managed]] by his then real-life wife [[Lori Fullington|Peaches]]. He also performed in Memphis in 1991\u20131992.\n\n===Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling===\n====Surfer and pimp (1992\u20131994)====\nIn April 1992 he arrived in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]] (later renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling) as a crowd favorite. He won his first [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW Championship]] from [[Don Muraco]] on November 16, 1992, but lost it back to Muraco on April 3, 1993. At the end of 1992, he would change his name from Mr Sandman to The Sandman. For the rest of 1993, Sandman would team on and off with [[J.T. Smith (wrestler)|JT Smith]] and be featured regularly.\nIn 1994, Sandman changed his gimmick after ECW owner [[Tod Gordon]] suggested that he channel his own personality into his character, creating an edgier gimmick. He began a feud with his former tag team partner [[Tommy Cairo]], after The Sandman was temporarily blinded following a match and inadvertently struck Peaches. When The Sandman regained his sight and saw Cairo assisting Peaches to her feet, he attacked Cairo. The Sandman subsequently became estranged from his wife (claiming \"life's a bitch, and then you marry one\"). After losing a match against Cairo, that led to Peaches hitting him with a strap profusely, [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]] attacked Peaches and led her back to the ring where Sandman held her and Woman applied the strap to her skin before Cairo returned to save her. After this event Sandman adopted [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]] as his new manager. In keeping with The Sandman's character, Woman would open his beers and light his cigarettes prior to matches. She began carrying a [[Shinai|Singapore cane]] with which she would strike The Sandman's opponents.<ref name=Schramm>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/06/25/4290333.html|title=Looking back on the career of \"Woman\"|author=Chris Schramm|publisher=[[Qu\u00e9becor M\u00e9dia]]|work=[[Canoe.ca]]|accessdate=January 17, 2015|date=June 25, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Loverro2007\">{{cite book|author=Thom Loverro|title=The Rise & Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0dlOLyCj6YC&pg=PA60|date=22 May 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-6156-9|pages=60\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"JohnsonMcCoy2007\">{{cite book|author1=Steven Johnson|author2=Heath McCoy|author3=Irv Muchnick|title=Benoit: Wrestling with the Horror That Destroyed a Family and Crippled a Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0rLnIRWqjUC&pg=PT48|date=1 November 2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-315-3|pages=48\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter Cairo insinuated that he was sleeping with Peaches, The Sandman stated that Cairo owed him \"$25 a romp\" and began demanding that Cairo \"pay your bills\".<ref name=\"Loverro2007\"/><ref name=\"JT\">T, J. \"[http://rajah.com/base/2005/3323 All In A Days Workrate: The Definitive History of ECW, part 1]\"</ref> Following the highly publicized [[Caning in Singapore|caning]] of [[Michael P. Fay]] in Singapore on May 5, 1994, Sandman adopted another defining attribute of his new gimmick as he began wielding a [[Shinai|kendo stick]], referred to as a [[Shinai|Singapore cane]], taking delight in caning other wrestlers such as rookie [[Tommy Dreamer]] or his \"estranged\" wife.<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/sandman.html|title=Sandman Profile|accessdate=2008-03-27|publisher=Online World Of Wrestling}}</ref> Sandman and Woman faced Cairo and Lori in a mixed Singapore Caning match on May 14, 1994. After Cairo and Lori defeated their opponents, Lori caned Sandman's [[Groin|crotch]] until Woman threw salt in her eyes, enabling Sandman to regroup and use his cane on both Lori and Cairo.<ref name=\"JT\"/>\n \nDuring a match against Tommy Dreamer, Sandman's valet: Woman attempted to attack Dreamer on his behalf when Dreamer planted a long kiss on her. After the match Sandman was told by Woman that Dreamer was with Cairo and that they were both sleeping with his wife, which enraged Sandman. Woman wanted to make Dreamer suffer and so lured Dreamer into a match with Sandman wherein whoever lost would have to receive 10 strikes from the other with a Singapore cane. After losing the match Tommy began to take the strokes, when it became clear that Woman intention was to humiliate him by making him beg her for mercy, which he did not much to her chagrin and Dreamer was idolized by the fans for his resolve and the level of disdain for the Sandman was increased. This would prove to be a defining moment for both men and for ECW in years to come.<ref>The Rise and Fall of ECW</ref>\n\nIn late 1994, The Sandman was once again (kayfabe) blinded after a lit cigarette was pushed into his eye during an [[\"I Quit\" match]] with Tommy Dreamer. Woman blamed Sandman for the injury and abandoned him. The Sandman subsequently claimed that he would have to retire as a result, with Dreamer responding by dedicating the remainder of his career to The Sandman. Cairo began mocking The Sandman, which led to Dreamer heavily beating him during a match at [[November to Remember (1994)|November to Remember]]. At Sandman's retirement ceremony during the same event, an attempted reconciliation with Lori was interrupted by Woman, who caned Lori and threatened Sandman. As Dreamer came to the rescue, Sandman revealed that he was not in fact blinded and attacked Dreamer. The Sandman later revealed that his blinding had been an elaborate ruse concocted to trick Dreamer into hurting Cairo on his behalf. Sandman had to wrestle Dreamer again the following month when he and now reconciled partner Tommy Cairo, teamed up against Cactus Jack & Dreamer, but were defeated by the duo.\n\n====ECW World Heavyweight Champion (1995\u20131996)====\nSandman challenged [[Shane Douglas]] for the ECW Championship in April 1995, but was attacked by his own valet, Woman, who helped Shane Douglas retain the title. In a rematch at [[Hostile City Showdown (1995)|Hostile City Showdown]] on April 15, 1995, Sandman faced Douglas (who had Woman in his corner) in a rematch. During the course of the match, Woman turned on the now overconfident Douglas, helping Sandman become the ECW Champion. It was revealed that the entire sequence of events was a [[Betrayal|double-cross]] planned all along by Woman to aid Sandman while psychologically destroying Douglas in the process. Douglas attempted to regain the championship in the following months, but left for the World Wrestling Federation before he was able. Sandman's first title defenses after winning the ECW Championship were against [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], with the latter never getting the upper hand due to interference by Woman, rival [[Terry Funk]], 'stickler' referee [[Bill Alfonso]], and Douglas, who was bitter over losing his title.\n\nSandman's feud with Cactus Jack lasted throughout 1995 and culminated in a series of matches involving [[barbed wire]]. In a Texas Death match in February 1995, Sandman was hit with a heavy metal [[frying pan]], giving Fullington a legitimate [[concussion]]. Throughout the remainder of the match, Fullington was visibly disoriented and forgot the scripted ending of the match; several times Cactus Jack hit Sandman with his signature double underhook DDT and again and again Sandman instinctively kicked out. This went on for about a minute before Cactus Jack delivered a legit maneuver, hoping it would keep Sandman down. The referee also had to resort to making the ten-count (as per the match's rules) at nearly double his original speed.\n\nOn October 25, Sandman lost the title to [[Mikey Whipwreck]] in a [[ladder match]]. Three days later, Sandman teamed up with then [[ECW World Television Championship|Television Champion]] [[2 Cold Scorpio]] to win the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship|ECW Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]]. On December 9, Sandman regained his World Heavyweight title by defeating Whipwreck and Steve Austin in a 3-Way Dance. At the end of the month, 2 Cold Scorpio lost both the Television and Tag Team Championships to Whipwreck in a singles match on December 29, while Sandman became embroiled in his feud with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]].\n\nSandman spent the time period from December 1995 through May 1997 engaged in a feud with Raven. On January 27, 1996, Sandman lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Raven and the two would subsequently trade the title back and forth. Sandman joined forces with Raven's nemesis Tommy Dreamer and on October 5, 1996, regained the title by pinning [[Stevie Richards]] in an Ultimate Jeopardy tag team match pitting Sandman and Dreamer against Brian Lee and Richards, who replaced Raven when he no-showed the event.\n\nDuring the feud, Raven allied himself to the returned Lori Fullington and [[mind control|brainwashed]] her and Sandman's real-life son into joining his cult-like following, turning him against his father. Raven psychologically attacked Sandman by having his son deny his relationship with his father, telling [[Tyler Fullington|Tyler]] that his parents' divorce was Sandman's fault, and making him perform Raven's trademark taunt \"The Raven's Crucifix\" and other mannerisms. On October 26, 1996, during one match, Tyler interfered to help his father. Afterward, the two embraced, but Raven came from behind with a Singapore Cane and smacked his enemy by piledriving Sandman through the table. Stevie Richards and [[The Blue Meanie]] came out with a giant wooden cross and [[Crucifixion|crucified]] him.<ref name=\"Loverro\">Thom Loverro, ''The Rise & Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling'', p. 172f.</ref> On December 7 at [[Holiday Hell (1995)|Holiday Hell]], Sandman again lost the title to Raven in a barbed wire match.\n\n====Various rivalries (1996\u20131998)====\nIn 1996, the team of Sandman and Tommy Dreamer became more permanent as the duo feuded with anti-ECW team of [[Sabu and Rob Van Dam]], as well as the [[Dudley Boyz]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> At [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF)'s 1996 [[In Your House 10: Mind Games|In Your House: Mind Games]], Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, [[Paul Heyman]] and a number of other ECW stars caused a [[kayfabe|storyline]] disturbance at ringside during a Caribbean Strap match between [[Savio Vega]] and [[John Layfield|Justin \"Hawk\" Bradshaw]]. The disturbance resulted in Sandman whacking Vega over the head with his signature Singapore cane and spitting beer in his face. This event marked the start of the on-air working relationship between [[Vince McMahon]]'s WWF and Paul Heyman's ECW and eventually led to ECW appearing on the February 24, 1997 WWF program ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''.\n\nAt the ECW premier pay-per-view event [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], Sandman wrestled a three-way dance with [[Terry Funk]] and [[Stevie Richards]], for a shot at the ECW title later that night, but fell short of the title. In the summer of 1997, the Sandman began a long feud with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. Although he was too injured to compete at [[Hardcore Heaven 1997]], Sandman got involved in a skirmish with Rob Van Damn and Sabu who then brutalized him to the point of hospitalization, however,he would return later that evening to interference in the main event by assaulting Sabu, leading to Sabu's elimination, costing Sabu the ECW title. In September of that year Sabu badly burned the Sandman in a scheduled contest between the two. The damage to Sandman from the burn was considered so bad that the match was discontinued. As a result, Sandman would be out of action until he once again attacked Van Dam & Sabu in the ring that November, earning a measure of revenge on Sabu. This led to their match at the November to Remember pay per view, which was promoted as a major cornerstone and culmination of all the events that year. In the match Sandman dodged an attempt by Sabu to burn him, however Sabu would go on to win the match. Over the next few months, they competed in high profile specialty matches such as ladder matches,table matches, and a dueling cane match. In one of the most notable examples, the Sandman fought Sabu in the 1st ever \"stairway to hell\" match involving tables ladders chairs and barbwire, which is especially note worthy because no barb wire matches had been scheduled in ECW since after barb wire ripped open Sabu's bicep and required over 100 stitches in august of 1997. The stairway to hell match proved to be one of the most violent in ECW history, coincidentally Sabu broke his jaw when missing a dive onto Sandman and inadvertently hit the guard rail, but continued to fight. After suffering heavy damage, Sandman earned the victory by finally pinning Sabu after hitting him with a cane. However, it wasn't until almost two months later that their feud effectively came to an end at Living Dangerously 1998. This match was heavily promoted and designated the penultimate which featured a dueling canes gimmick. During the match, the combination of Rob Van Dam and Sabu turned out to be too much for the Sandman, which led to him losing the contest.\n\nOver the spring and summer of 1998, Sandman teamed up with Dreamer and [[Matt Hyson|Spike Dudley]] to feud with the [[Dudley Boyz]], finally securing a victory in a six-man match at [[Heat Wave (1998)|Heat Wave]].\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1998-1999)===\nIn September 1998, Fullington joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), signing a 3-year deal believed to be worth $200,000 annually according to Dave Meltzer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/7vxj3t/wrestling_observer_rewind_sept_21_1998/|title=Wrestling Observer Rewind \u2605 Sept. 21, 1998|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref> He first appeared in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#V|vignettes]] promoting Raven as a spoiled rich kid and Fullington as his preppy neighbor. The original plan to debut under this gimmick were scrapped. He later debuted under his longtime nickname, Hak (The Sandman name was trademarked by ECW) when he called out [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and challenged him to a Hardcore match on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]''. During the match he was defeated by Bigelow and was not named on screen during the entire segment. In his short time there, Hak was mostly involved in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#A|angles]] featuring fellow ECW alumni Raven, Bigelow and Raven's [[Kayfabe|storyline]] sister Chastity, with whom he developed an on-screen relationship after she [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] on Raven. His presence also helped to bolster WCW's fledgling [[WCW Hardcore Championship|hardcore division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingNWA50/oct30_sandman.html|title=Sandman still bleeds ECW|publisher=Slam!|accessdate=September 12, 2011}}</ref> WCW started promoting hardcore wrestling within their product through utilizing wrestlers like Hak and Bam Bam Bigelow. At [[Uncensored (1999)|Uncensored 1999]], Hak defeated Bam Bam Bigelow and Raven in a Falls Count Anywhere Triple Threat match. At [[Spring Stampede (1999)|Spring Stampede 1999]], Hak lost to Bam Bam Bigelow in a Hardcore match. At [[The Great American Bash (1999)|The Great American Bash 1999]], Hak defeated [[Brian Knobs]] in another Hardcore match. And a month later at [[Bash at the Beach (1999)|Bash at the Beach 1999]], Hak competed in the [[Professional wrestling match types#Locale-based variations|Junkyard Invitational]], which was won by [[Fit Finlay]]. Fullington was released from his WCW contract in September 1999 as part of a cost-cutting measure by new WCW Executive VP Bill Busch.\n\n===Return to ECW (1999\u20132001)===\nAfter leaving WCW in late 1999, Fullington, as The Sandman, returned to ECW and remained with the company until its demise in January 2001. He began a feud with [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]] in 2000, losing to him at [[Hardcore Heaven]], [[ECW Heat Wave|Heat Wave]], and other shows. On January 7, 2001 at ECW's last pay-per-view, [[Guilty as Charged 2001|Guilty as Charged]], the Sandman won his fifth World Heavyweight Championship in a Tables, Ladders, Chairs, and Canes three-way dance with the champion [[Steve Corino]] and [[Justin Credible]]. After The Sandman won, however, the [[ECW World Television Championship|World Television Champion]] [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]] came out to the ring and challenged him to an impromptu title match. The Sandman accepted the challenge and after a 60-second match, Rhino defeated The Sandman to become the new World Heavyweight Champion, unifying ECW's two singles titles.\n\n===Xtreme Pro Wrestling (2001\u20132003)===\nAfter the closure of ECW The Sandman wrestled for [[Xtreme Pro Wrestling]] (XPW) for a time. In February 2002, at the event Free Fall, he won the [[XPW King of the Deathmatch Championship]] from Supreme, turning heel and aligning himself with heel faction 'The E'. On a number of occasions Sandman was accompanied to the ring by former [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) valet [[Tylene Buck]]. At XPW's 'Cold Day in Hell' reunion show, Sandman defeated Pogo the Clown, the wrestler he last feuded with before the company went out of business. While at XPW Sandman also wrestled within the fledgling [[Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling]] promotion. His most notable match was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|3-way dance]] with Sabu and [[New Jack]]. It is featured as a \"bonus match\" on the 3PW DVD ''Blood, Brawls and Broads''.\n\nIn late 2002 and early 2003, The Sandman had a tenure in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), joining former-ECW wrestlers Justin Credible and Raven, along with New Jack and [[Perry Saturn]] in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] known as \"Team Extreme\" and later \"Extreme Revolution\". He also competed in the [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling tournaments#TNA Hard 10 Tournament|Hard 10 Tournament]], where he partly feuded with [[Sonny Siaki]] before winning the overall event.\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003\u20132004, 2010)===\nThe Sandman made his surprise debut on February 12, 2003 where he was defeated by [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] in a falls count anywhere match. a week later on February 19 Sandman and [[Steve Corino]] faced Raven and Low Ki in a losing effort, on February 26 NWA/TNA Weekly PPV, Sandman lost to [[A.J. Styles]] after Raven hit Sandman with a steel chair. After several matches in the promotion, in June 2003 Sandman competed in a [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling tournaments#TNA Hard 10 Tournament|TNA Hard 10]], a tournament to proclamin the most hardcore wrestler in the company. Sandman defeated [[Crowbar (wrestler)|Devon Storm]] in the Quarter-finals, [[Sonny Siaki]] in the semi finals and New Jack in the finals to win the tournament. On July 9, Sandman accepted the Hard 10 Cup, and was attacked by Don Callous and [[Edward Chastaine|Iceberg]]. After a 3-month absence Sandman returned on the November 5 where he was defeated by Shane Douglas. He would still working for TNA until February 4, when Sandman and Terry Funk lost to The Gathering (CM Punk and Julio Dinero) and after the match The Sandman left TNA.\n\n===World Wrestling Entertainment===\n====ECW Originals (2005&ndash;2007)====\nIn 2005, Sandman participated in the ECW reunion show ''[[Hardcore Homecoming]]'' against longtime rival Raven. Two nights later he appeared at the [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) produced [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] pay-per-view event, another ECW reunion show, teaming with Tommy Dreamer to face The [[Dudley Boyz]]. The match would see Sandman and Dreamer lose to the Dudleys after Dreamer was powerbombed through a flaming table. In 2006, prior to the June 11 [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand]], The Sandman made a number of promotional appearances on WWE programming, first appearing, along with a number of other ECW stars, on ''Raw'' attacking [[John Cena]] then, two nights later, on the ''WWE vs. ECW Head to Head'' special taking part in a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]], in which it can be argued that he was the last ECW original eliminated. At One Night Stand, when [[Nick Dinsmore|Eugene]] made his way to the ring to read a poem expressing his love of ECW, The Sandman came out with his Singapore Cane and caned Eugene to the back.\n\n[[File:SANDMAN247.jpg|left|thumb|The Sandman wielding his signature [[Shinai|Singapore cane]] during [[ECW (WWE)|ECW's]] return in June 2006]]\nOn June 13, 2006 WWE [[ECW (WWE)|officially relaunched ECW]] as a [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] equal to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] with its own show on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]. In the new ECW, The Sandman was used for the first few weeks as a character who would emerge from the crowd when a non-ECW style character was annoying the audience. Once the character had a few minutes to talk Sandman appeared and destroyed the character with his cane, often ending the \"match\" with his signature [[#In wrestling|White Russian Legsweep]]. This gimmick escalated when Sandman confronted regular ECW fixture [[Mike Knox]] while he was attempting to stop his [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]] girlfriend, [[Kelly Kelly]], in the middle of her weekly \"expos\u00e9\" strip show. The Sandman began a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with Knox over this and eventually began teaming up with fellow ECW original Tommy Dreamer to take on Knox and [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] in a feud that many felt symbolized the original vision of ECW (Sandman and Dreamer) versus the \"new\" vision of ECW (Knox and Test). At the same time Sandman was feuding with Test and Knox, a debuting [[Matt Striker]] began to rub him the wrong way and he started a secondary feud with him.\n\nSubsequently, the Sandman has made several short appearances, mostly coming out through the crowd and caning someone whenever some injustice was done. After being briefly included in a feud with [[Elijah Burke]], he became part of the [[ECW Originals]] stable and joined their feud with [[New Breed (ECW)|the New Breed]]. On April 1, 2007 at [[WrestleMania 23]] he teamed with RVD, Sabu, and Dreamer to defeat [[Monty Brown|Marcus Cor Von]], Burke, Striker, and [[Kevin Thorn]]. On May 16, Sabu was released by WWE and soon after Rob Van Dam left to take a sabbatical from wrestling, leaving Sandman and Dreamer alone to feud with the New Breed. Sandman and Dreamer would team up with [[CM Punk]] on multiple occasions, who was also feuding with the New Breed. On the June 4 episode of ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]'', Sandman, Dreamer, and [[Balls Mahoney]] faced [[Bobby Lashley]] in a 3 on 1 Hardcore Handicap match, in which they were defeated.\n\n====Feuding with Carlito (2007)====\nOn June 17, 2007, Sandman was drafted to the Raw brand via the [[WWE Brand Extension#Supplemental Draft|WWE Supplemental Draft]]. On the June 18 edition of ''Raw'', Sandman debuted, going after [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]] with his Singapore cane. On the July 2 edition of ''Raw'', Sandman had his first match on Raw, facing Carlito. Carlito won the match due to a disqualification when Sandman struck him with his cane after Carlito tried to use it on him. This started a feud between the two. Sandman did a similar thing next week when he lost to [[William Regal]] by disqualification, after hitting Regal and Carlito with his cane. The next week, Sandman faced Carlito again, this time winning when Regal attacked him. The Sandman was saved when [[Jim Duggan]] (who had a confrontation with Regal earlier that night) came down to the ring. At [[The Great American Bash (2007)|The Great American Bash]] he lost to Carlito in a [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Singapore Cane on a Pole match]]. The Sandman lost in a battle royal to determine the new [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]] of ''Raw'' where he was the last one eliminated by Regal who had faked an injury and was not in the match until Sandman was the only superstar in the ring; Regal then won after he snuck up on The Sandman and hit him in the back of the head with his boot. His last match was on the September 10 edition of  ''Raw'' against [[Santino Marella]] which he won by disqualification. Fullington appeared to injure his ankle during a missed spot in this match and was released from his WWE contract on September 12, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/sandmanreleased|title=Sandman released| publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\n===Independent circuit (2007\u2013present)===\nThe Sandman appeared at [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South|IWA Mid-South]]'s ''[[Ian Rotten]] Retirement Show'' in [[Plainfield, Indiana]] on December 7, 2007 in a losing effort to [[Drake Younger]].

There he along with fellow ECW alumnus [[James Maritato|Little Guido]] teamed up to take on the team of EGO.\n\nFullington made appearances with the [[Shane Douglas]] promotion [[Extreme Rising]].

Fullington has held the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] a record five times. He also had stints in [[World Championship Wrestling]], [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], and [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]].\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Tri-State Wrestling (1989\u20131992)===\nFullington got his start in professional wrestling in the [[Philadelphia]]-based Tri-State Wrestling Alliance under the [[ring name]] Mr. Sandman, [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managed]] by his then real-life wife [[Lori Fullington|Peaches]]. He also performed in Memphis in 1991\u20131992.\n\n===Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling===\n====Surfer and pimp (1992\u20131994)====\nIn April 1992 he arrived in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]] (later renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling) as a crowd favorite. He won his first [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW Championship]] from [[Don Muraco]] on November 16, 1992, but lost it back to Muraco on April 3, 1993. At the end of 1992, he would change his name from Mr Sandman to The Sandman. For the rest of 1993, Sandman would team on and off with [[J.T. Smith (wrestler)|JT Smith]] and be featured regularly.\nIn 1994, Sandman changed his gimmick after ECW owner [[Tod Gordon]] suggested that he channel his own personality into his character, creating an edgier gimmick. He began a feud with his former tag team partner [[Tommy Cairo]], after The Sandman was temporarily blinded following a match and inadvertently struck Peaches. When The Sandman regained his sight and saw Cairo assisting Peaches to her feet, he attacked Cairo. The Sandman subsequently became estranged from his wife (claiming \"life's a bitch, and then you marry one\"). After losing a match against Cairo, that led to Peaches hitting him with a strap profusely, [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]] attacked Peaches and led her back to the ring where Sandman held her and Woman applied the strap to her skin before Cairo returned to save her. After this event Sandman adopted [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]] as his new manager. In keeping with The Sandman's character, Woman would open his beers and light his cigarettes prior to matches. She began carrying a [[Shinai|Singapore cane]] with which she would strike The Sandman's opponents.<ref name=Schramm>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/06/25/4290333.html|title=Looking back on the career of \"Woman\"|author=Chris Schramm|publisher=[[Qu\u00e9becor M\u00e9dia]]|work=[[Canoe.ca]]|accessdate=January 17, 2015|date=June 25, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Loverro2007\">{{cite book|author=Thom Loverro|title=The Rise & Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j0dlOLyCj6YC&pg=PA60|date=22 May 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-6156-9|pages=60\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"JohnsonMcCoy2007\">{{cite book|author1=Steven Johnson|author2=Heath McCoy|author3=Irv Muchnick|title=Benoit: Wrestling with the Horror That Destroyed a Family and Crippled a Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0rLnIRWqjUC&pg=PT48|date=1 November 2007|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-315-3|pages=48\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter Cairo insinuated that he was sleeping with Peaches, The Sandman stated that Cairo owed him \"$25 a romp\" and began demanding that Cairo \"pay your bills\".<ref name=\"Loverro2007\"/><ref name=\"JT\">T, J. \"[http://rajah.com/base/2005/3323 All In A Days Workrate: The Definitive History of ECW, part 1]\"</ref> Following the highly publicized [[Caning in Singapore|caning]] of [[Michael P. Fay]] in Singapore on May 5, 1994, Sandman adopted another defining attribute of his new gimmick as he began wielding a [[Shinai|kendo stick]], referred to as a [[Shinai|Singapore cane]], taking delight in caning other wrestlers such as rookie [[Tommy Dreamer]] or his \"estranged\" wife.<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/sandman.html|title=Sandman Profile|accessdate=2008-03-27|publisher=Online World Of Wrestling}}</ref> Sandman and Woman faced Cairo and Lori in a mixed Singapore Caning match on May 14, 1994. After Cairo and Lori defeated their opponents, Lori caned Sandman's [[Groin|crotch]] until Woman threw salt in her eyes, enabling Sandman to regroup and use his cane on both Lori and Cairo.<ref name=\"JT\"/>\n \nDuring a match against Tommy Dreamer, Sandman's valet: Woman attempted to attack Dreamer on his behalf when Dreamer planted a long kiss on her. After the match Sandman was told by Woman that Dreamer was with Cairo and that they were both sleeping with his wife, which enraged Sandman. Woman wanted to make Dreamer suffer and so lured Dreamer into a match with Sandman wherein whoever lost would have to receive 10 strikes from the other with a Singapore cane. After losing the match Tommy began to take the strokes, when it became clear that Woman intention was to humiliate him by making him beg her for mercy, which he did not much to her chagrin and Dreamer was idolized by the fans for his resolve and the level of disdain for the Sandman was increased. This would prove to be a defining moment for both men and for ECW in years to come.<ref>The Rise and Fall of ECW</ref>\n\nIn late 1994, The Sandman was once again (kayfabe) blinded after a lit cigarette was pushed into his eye during an [[\"I Quit\" match]] with Tommy Dreamer. Woman blamed Sandman for the injury and abandoned him. The Sandman subsequently claimed that he would have to retire as a result, with Dreamer responding by dedicating the remainder of his career to The Sandman. Cairo began mocking The Sandman, which led to Dreamer heavily beating him during a match at [[November to Remember (1994)|November to Remember]]. At Sandman's retirement ceremony during the same event, an attempted reconciliation with Lori was interrupted by Woman, who caned Lori and threatened Sandman. As Dreamer came to the rescue, Sandman revealed that he was not in fact blinded and attacked Dreamer. The Sandman later revealed that his blinding had been an elaborate ruse concocted to trick Dreamer into hurting Cairo on his behalf. Sandman had to wrestle Dreamer again the following month when he and now reconciled partner Tommy Cairo, teamed up against Cactus Jack & Dreamer, but were defeated by the duo.\n\n====ECW World Heavyweight Champion (1995\u20131996)====\nSandman challenged [[Shane Douglas]] for the ECW Championship in April 1995, but was attacked by his own valet, Woman, who helped Shane Douglas retain the title. In a rematch at [[Hostile City Showdown (1995)|Hostile City Showdown]] on April 15, 1995, Sandman faced Douglas (who had Woman in his corner) in a rematch. During the course of the match, Woman turned on the now overconfident Douglas, helping Sandman become the ECW Champion. It was revealed that the entire sequence of events was a [[Betrayal|double-cross]] planned all along by Woman to aid Sandman while psychologically destroying Douglas in the process. Douglas attempted to regain the championship in the following months, but left for the World Wrestling Federation before he was able. Sandman's first title defenses after winning the ECW Championship were against [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], with the latter never getting the upper hand due to interference by Woman, rival [[Terry Funk]], 'stickler' referee [[Bill Alfonso]], and Douglas, who was bitter over losing his title.\n\nSandman's feud with Cactus Jack lasted throughout 1995 and culminated in a series of matches involving [[barbed wire]]. In a Texas Death match in February 1995, Sandman was hit with a heavy metal [[frying pan]], giving Fullington a legitimate [[concussion]]. Throughout the remainder of the match, Fullington was visibly disoriented and forgot the scripted ending of the match; several times Cactus Jack hit Sandman with his signature double underhook DDT and again and again Sandman instinctively kicked out. This went on for about a minute before Cactus Jack delivered a legit maneuver, hoping it would keep Sandman down. The referee also had to resort to making the ten-count (as per the match's rules) at nearly double his original speed.\n\nOn October 25, Sandman lost the title to [[Mikey Whipwreck]] in a [[ladder match]]. Three days later, Sandman teamed up with then [[ECW World Television Championship|Television Champion]] [[2 Cold Scorpio]] to win the [[ECW World Tag Team Championship|ECW Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]]. On December 9, Sandman regained his World Heavyweight title by defeating Whipwreck and Steve Austin in a 3-Way Dance. At the end of the month, 2 Cold Scorpio lost both the Television and Tag Team Championships to Whipwreck in a singles match on December 29, while Sandman became embroiled in his feud with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]].\n\nSandman spent the time period from December 1995 through May 1997 engaged in a feud with Raven. On January 27, 1996, Sandman lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Raven and the two would subsequently trade the title back and forth. Sandman joined forces with Raven's nemesis Tommy Dreamer and on October 5, 1996, regained the title by pinning [[Stevie Richards]] in an Ultimate Jeopardy tag team match pitting Sandman and Dreamer against Brian Lee and Richards, who replaced Raven when he no-showed the event.\n\nDuring the feud, Raven allied himself to the returned Lori Fullington and [[mind control|brainwashed]] her and Sandman's real-life son into joining his cult-like following, turning him against his father. Raven psychologically attacked Sandman by having his son deny his relationship with his father, telling [[Tyler Fullington|Tyler]] that his parents' divorce was Sandman's fault, and making him perform Raven's trademark taunt \"The Raven's Crucifix\" and other mannerisms. On October 26, 1996, during one match, Tyler interfered to help his father. Afterward, the two embraced, but Raven came from behind with a Singapore Cane and smacked his enemy by piledriving Sandman through the table. Stevie Richards and [[The Blue Meanie]] came out with a giant wooden cross and [[Crucifixion|crucified]] him.<ref name=\"Loverro\">Thom Loverro, ''The Rise & Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling'', p. 172f.</ref> On December 7 at [[Holiday Hell (1995)|Holiday Hell]], Sandman again lost the title to Raven in a barbed wire match.\n\n====Various rivalries (1996\u20131998)====\nIn 1996, the team of Sandman and Tommy Dreamer became more permanent as the duo feuded with anti-ECW team of [[Sabu and Rob Van Dam]], as well as the [[Dudley Boyz]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> At [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF)'s 1996 [[In Your House 10: Mind Games|In Your House: Mind Games]], Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, [[Paul Heyman]] and a number of other ECW stars caused a [[kayfabe|storyline]] disturbance at ringside during a Caribbean Strap match between [[Savio Vega]] and [[John Layfield|Justin \"Hawk\" Bradshaw]]. The disturbance resulted in Sandman whacking Vega over the head with his signature Singapore cane and spitting beer in his face. This event marked the start of the on-air working relationship between [[Vince McMahon]]'s WWF and Paul Heyman's ECW and eventually led to ECW appearing on the February 24, 1997 WWF program ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''.\n\nAt the ECW premier pay-per-view event [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]], Sandman wrestled a three-way dance with [[Terry Funk]] and [[Stevie Richards]], for a shot at the ECW title later that night, but fell short of the title. In the summer of 1997, the Sandman began a long feud with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. Although he was too injured to compete at [[Hardcore Heaven 1997]], Sandman got involved in a skirmish with Rob Van Damn and Sabu who then brutalized him to the point of hospitalization, however,he would return later that evening to interference in the main event by assaulting Sabu, leading to Sabu's elimination, costing Sabu the ECW title. In September of that year Sabu badly burned the Sandman in a scheduled contest between the two. The damage to Sandman from the burn was considered so bad that the match was discontinued. As a result, Sandman would be out of action until he once again attacked Van Dam & Sabu in the ring that November, earning a measure of revenge on Sabu. This led to their match at the November to Remember pay per view, which was promoted as a major cornerstone and culmination of all the events that year. In the match Sandman dodged an attempt by Sabu to burn him, however Sabu would go on to win the match. Over the next few months, they competed in high profile specialty matches such as ladder matches,table matches, and a dueling cane match. In one of the most notable examples, the Sandman fought Sabu in the 1st ever \"stairway to hell\" match involving tables ladders chairs and barbwire, which is especially note worthy because no barb wire matches had been scheduled in ECW since after barb wire ripped open Sabu's bicep and required over 100 stitches in august of 1997. The stairway to hell match proved to be one of the most violent in ECW history, coincidentally Sabu broke his jaw when missing a dive onto Sandman and inadvertently hit the guard rail, but continued to fight. After suffering heavy damage, Sandman earned the victory by finally pinning Sabu after hitting him with a cane. However, it wasn't until almost two months later that their feud effectively came to an end at Living Dangerously 1998. This match was heavily promoted and designated the penultimate which featured a dueling canes gimmick. During the match, the combination of Rob Van Dam and Sabu turned out to be too much for the Sandman, which led to him losing the contest.\n\nOver the spring and summer of 1998, Sandman teamed up with Dreamer and [[Matt Hyson|Spike Dudley]] to feud with the [[Dudley Boyz]], finally securing a victory in a six-man match at [[Heat Wave (1998)|Heat Wave]].\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1998-1999)===\nIn September 1998, Fullington joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), signing a 3-year deal believed to be worth $200,000 annually according to Dave Meltzer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/7vxj3t/wrestling_observer_rewind_sept_21_1998/|title=Wrestling Observer Rewind \u2605 Sept. 21, 1998|accessdate=February 10, 2018}}</ref> He first appeared in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#V|vignettes]] promoting Raven as a spoiled rich kid and Fullington as his preppy neighbor. The original plan to debut under this gimmick were scrapped. He later debuted under his longtime nickname, Hak (The Sandman name was trademarked by ECW) when he called out [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and challenged him to a Hardcore match on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]''. During the match he was defeated by Bigelow and was not named on screen during the entire segment. In his short time there, Hak was mostly involved in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#A|angles]] featuring fellow ECW alumni Raven, Bigelow and Raven's [[Kayfabe|storyline]] sister Chastity, with whom he developed an on-screen relationship after she [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] on Raven. His presence also helped to bolster WCW's fledgling [[WCW Hardcore Championship|hardcore division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingNWA50/oct30_sandman.html|title=Sandman still bleeds ECW|publisher=Slam!|accessdate=September 12, 2011}}</ref> WCW started promoting hardcore wrestling within their product through utilizing wrestlers like Hak and Bam Bam Bigelow. At [[Uncensored (1999)|Uncensored 1999]], Hak defeated Bam Bam Bigelow and Raven in a Falls Count Anywhere Triple Threat match. At [[Spring Stampede (1999)|Spring Stampede 1999]], Hak lost to Bam Bam Bigelow in a Hardcore match. At [[The Great American Bash (1999)|The Great American Bash 1999]], Hak defeated [[Brian Knobs]] in another Hardcore match. And a month later at [[Bash at the Beach (1999)|Bash at the Beach 1999]], Hak competed in the [[Professional wrestling match types#Locale-based variations|Junkyard Invitational]], which was won by [[Fit Finlay]]. Fullington was released from his WCW contract in September 1999 as part of a cost-cutting measure by new WCW Executive VP Bill Busch.\n\n===Return to ECW (1999\u20132001)===\nAfter leaving WCW in late 1999, Fullington, as The Sandman, returned to ECW and remained with the company until its demise in January 2001. He began a feud with [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]] in 2000, losing to him at [[Hardcore Heaven]], [[ECW Heat Wave|Heat Wave]], and other shows. On January 7, 2001 at ECW's last pay-per-view, [[Guilty as Charged 2001|Guilty as Charged]], the Sandman won his fifth World Heavyweight Championship in a Tables, Ladders, Chairs, and Canes three-way dance with the champion [[Steve Corino]] and [[Justin Credible]]. After The Sandman won, however, the [[ECW World Television Championship|World Television Champion]] [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]] came out to the ring and challenged him to an impromptu title match. The Sandman accepted the challenge and after a 60-second match, Rhino defeated The Sandman to become the new World Heavyweight Champion, unifying ECW's two singles titles.\n\n===Xtreme Pro Wrestling (2001\u20132003)===\nAfter the closure of ECW The Sandman wrestled for [[Xtreme Pro Wrestling]] (XPW) for a time. In February 2002, at the event Free Fall, he won the [[XPW King of the Deathmatch Championship]] from Supreme, turning heel and aligning himself with heel faction 'The E'. On a number of occasions Sandman was accompanied to the ring by former [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) valet [[Tylene Buck]]. At XPW's 'Cold Day in Hell' reunion show, Sandman defeated Pogo the Clown, the wrestler he last feuded with before the company went out of business. While at XPW Sandman also wrestled within the fledgling [[Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling]] promotion. His most notable match was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|3-way dance]] with Sabu and [[New Jack]]. It is featured as a \"bonus match\" on the 3PW DVD ''Blood, Brawls and Broads''.\n\nIn late 2002 and early 2003, The Sandman had a tenure in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), joining former-ECW wrestlers Justin Credible and Raven, along with New Jack and [[Perry Saturn]] in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]] known as \"Team Extreme\" and later \"Extreme Revolution\". He also competed in the [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling tournaments#TNA Hard 10 Tournament|Hard 10 Tournament]], where he partly feuded with [[Sonny Siaki]] before winning the overall event.\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003\u20132004, 2010)===\nThe Sandman made his surprise debut on February 12, 2003 where he was defeated by [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] in a falls count anywhere match. a week later on February 19 Sandman and [[Steve Corino]] faced Raven and Low Ki in a losing effort, on February 26 NWA/TNA Weekly PPV, Sandman lost to [[A.J. Styles]] after Raven hit Sandman with a steel chair. After several matches in the promotion, in June 2003 Sandman competed in a [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling tournaments#TNA Hard 10 Tournament|TNA Hard 10]], a tournament to proclamin the most hardcore wrestler in the company. Sandman defeated [[Crowbar (wrestler)|Devon Storm]] in the Quarter-finals, [[Sonny Siaki]] in the semi finals and New Jack in the finals to win the tournament. On July 9, Sandman accepted the Hard 10 Cup, and was attacked by Don Callous and [[Edward Chastaine|Iceberg]]. After a 3-month absence Sandman returned on the November 5 where he was defeated by Shane Douglas. He would still working for TNA until February 4, when Sandman and Terry Funk lost to The Gathering (CM Punk and Julio Dinero) and after the match The Sandman left TNA.\n\n===World Wrestling Entertainment===\n====ECW Originals (2005&ndash;2007)====\nIn 2005, Sandman participated in the ECW reunion show ''[[Hardcore Homecoming]]'' against longtime rival Raven. Two nights later he appeared at the [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) produced [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] pay-per-view event, another ECW reunion show, teaming with Tommy Dreamer to face The [[Dudley Boyz]]. The match would see Sandman and Dreamer lose to the Dudleys after Dreamer was powerbombed through a flaming table. In 2006, prior to the June 11 [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand]], The Sandman made a number of promotional appearances on WWE programming, first appearing, along with a number of other ECW stars, on ''Raw'' attacking [[John Cena]] then, two nights later, on the ''WWE vs. ECW Head to Head'' special taking part in a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]], in which it can be argued that he was the last ECW original eliminated. At One Night Stand, when [[Nick Dinsmore|Eugene]] made his way to the ring to read a poem expressing his love of ECW, The Sandman came out with his Singapore Cane and caned Eugene to the back.\n\n[[File:SANDMAN247.jpg|left|thumb|The Sandman wielding his signature [[Shinai|Singapore cane]] during [[ECW (WWE)|ECW's]] return in June 2006]]\nOn June 13, 2006 WWE [[ECW (WWE)|officially relaunched ECW]] as a [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] equal to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] with its own show on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]. In the new ECW, The Sandman was used for the first few weeks as a character who would emerge from the crowd when a non-ECW style character was annoying the audience. Once the character had a few minutes to talk Sandman appeared and destroyed the character with his cane, often ending the \"match\" with his signature [[#In wrestling|White Russian Legsweep]]. This gimmick escalated when Sandman confronted regular ECW fixture [[Mike Knox]] while he was attempting to stop his [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]] girlfriend, [[Kelly Kelly]], in the middle of her weekly \"expos\u00e9\" strip show. The Sandman began a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with Knox over this and eventually began teaming up with fellow ECW original Tommy Dreamer to take on Knox and [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] in a feud that many felt symbolized the original vision of ECW (Sandman and Dreamer) versus the \"new\" vision of ECW (Knox and Test). At the same time Sandman was feuding with Test and Knox, a debuting [[Matt Striker]] began to rub him the wrong way and he started a secondary feud with him.\n\nSubsequently, the Sandman has made several short appearances, mostly coming out through the crowd and caning someone whenever some injustice was done. After being briefly included in a feud with [[Elijah Burke]], he became part of the [[ECW Originals]] stable and joined their feud with [[New Breed (ECW)|the New Breed]]. On April 1, 2007 at [[WrestleMania 23]] he teamed with RVD, Sabu, and Dreamer to defeat [[Monty Brown|Marcus Cor Von]], Burke, Striker, and [[Kevin Thorn]]. On May 16, Sabu was released by WWE and soon after Rob Van Dam left to take a sabbatical from wrestling, leaving Sandman and Dreamer alone to feud with the New Breed. Sandman and Dreamer would team up with [[CM Punk]] on multiple occasions, who was also feuding with the New Breed. On the June 4 episode of ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]'', Sandman, Dreamer, and [[Balls Mahoney]] faced [[Bobby Lashley]] in a 3 on 1 Hardcore Handicap match, in which they were defeated.\n\n====Feuding with Carlito (2007)====\nOn June 17, 2007, Sandman was drafted to the Raw brand via the [[WWE Brand Extension#Supplemental Draft|WWE Supplemental Draft]]. On the June 18 edition of ''Raw'', Sandman debuted, going after [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]] with his Singapore cane. On the July 2 edition of ''Raw'', Sandman had his first match on Raw, facing Carlito. Carlito won the match due to a disqualification when Sandman struck him with his cane after Carlito tried to use it on him. This started a feud between the two. Sandman did a similar thing next week when he lost to [[William Regal]] by disqualification, after hitting Regal and Carlito with his cane. The next week, Sandman faced Carlito again, this time winning when Regal attacked him. The Sandman was saved when [[Jim Duggan]] (who had a confrontation with Regal earlier that night) came down to the ring. At [[The Great American Bash (2007)|The Great American Bash]] he lost to Carlito in a [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Singapore Cane on a Pole match]]. The Sandman lost in a battle royal to determine the new [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|General Manager]] of ''Raw'' where he was the last one eliminated by Regal who had faked an injury and was not in the match until Sandman was the only superstar in the ring; Regal then won after he snuck up on The Sandman and hit him in the back of the head with his boot. His last match was on the September 10 edition of  ''Raw'' against [[Santino Marella]] which he won by disqualification. Fullington appeared to injure his ankle during a missed spot in this match and was released from his WWE contract on September 12, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/sandmanreleased|title=Sandman released| publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\n===Independent circuit (2007\u2013present)===\nThe Sandman appeared at [[Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South|IWA Mid-South]]'s ''[[Ian Rotten]] Retirement Show'' in [[Plainfield, Indiana]] on December 7, 2007 in a losing effort to [[Drake Younger]]. The next night, in [[Elizabeth, Pennsylvania]] at the International Wrestling Cartel's ''A Call To Arms 4: Controlled Chaos'', Sandman defeated Dennis Gregory in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] to capture the IWC Heavyweight Championship. The next night after that, he competed at the debut show for Firestorm Pro Wrestling, Destroy Erase Improve, in a match against [[Samoa Joe]] which he lost. On January 3, 2008, at the All Entertainment Action Wrestling event ''Crucifix Bombardment 2008'' Sandman defeated 'The Raging Rhino' Hans Wilkshire in a Hardcore Match to win the vacant AEAW American Heavyweight Championship and the AEAW Hardcore Wrestling Championship. On April 19, 2008, he appeared on 1PW's supershow, 'Know Your Enemy 2008', in a losing effort to Damned Nation in an 8-man tag team match, where he teamed up with [[El Ligero]] and [[Phil Blitz|Bubblegum]] (Hubba Bubba Lucha) and Iceman. The Sandman then took part in a No Limit Wrestling special, in which he participated in a tag team match,in which he and his partner, [[Joe E. Legend]], defeated [[Test (wrestler)|Test]] and [[Chris Masters]] after a cane from Sandman allowed Legend to make the pin.\n[[File:Sandman TNA July 2010.jpg|thumb|Sandman upon his return to TNA in July 2010]]\nIn October 2008, Sandman announced through a bulletin posted by his official MySpace account that he would be retiring from pro wrestling in the coming weeks.

[[AllMusic]] defines it as follows: \"Alternative rap refers to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] groups that refuse to conform to any of the traditional stereotypes of rap, such as [[Gangsta rap|gangsta]], [[Miami bass|bass]], [[hardcore hip hop|hardcore]], [[Pop-rap|pop]], and [[party rap]]. Instead, they blur genres drawing equally from [[funk]] and [[Pop rock|pop/rock]], as well as [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[reggae]], and even [[Folk music|folk]].\"<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/alternative-rap-ma0000012203|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|title=Alternative Rap Music Genre|accessdate=20 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlternative hip hop developed in the late 1980s and experienced a degree of [[Mainstream radio|mainstream]] recognition during the early-to-mid 1990s. While some groups such as [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]] and [[The Fugees]] managed to achieve commercial success before breaking up, most alternative rap acts tended to be embraced largely by [[alternative rock]] listeners rather than hip-hop or [[Pop music|pop]] audiences.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> The commercial and cultural momentum was impeded by the then also emerging, significantly harder-edged West Coast [[gangsta rap]]. A resurgence came about in the late 1990s and early 2000s at the dawn of the [[digital era]] with rejuvenated interest in [[independent music]] by the general public.\n\nDuring the 2000s, alternative hip hop reattained its place within the mainstream, due to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the [[Crossover music|crossover]] success of artists such as [[OutKast]] and [[Kanye West]]. The alternative hip hop movement has expanded beyond the United States to include the [[Somali people|Somali]]-Canadian poet [[K'naan]], Japanese rapper [[Shing02]], and English artist [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] Alternative hip hop acts have attained much critical acclaim, but receive relatively little exposure through radio and other media outlets.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin===\nOriginating in the late 1980s, in midst of the [[Golden age hip hop|golden age of hip hop]], alternative hip hop was headed primarily by [[East Coast hip hop|East Coast]] groups such as [[De La Soul]], [[Jungle Brothers]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and [[Digable Planets]] in subsidiary conjunction by [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] acts such as [[The Pharcyde]], [[Digital Underground]], and [[Freestyle Fellowship]] as well as certain [[Southern hip hop|Southern]] acts such as [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Goodie Mob]], and [[OutKast]]. Similar to the [[alternative rock]] movement, alternative hip hop segued into the mainstream at the dawn of the 1990s. Arrested Development along with [[The Fugees]], stand as some of the first few alternative rap to be recognized by mainstream audiences.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> The classic debut albums ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'', ''[[People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm]]'', and ''[[Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde]]'' achieved minor commercial success as they garnered immense acclaim from music critics, who described the records as managing to be both ambitiously innovative but playful masterpieces, hailing the artists as the future of hip hop music as a whole.<ref name=Erlewine/> Christened as \"The ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' of hip hop\", De La Soul's debut album ''3 Feet High and Rising'' was considered the forefront of the subgenre. As music critic Jon Bush wrote in retrospect:\n\n{{quote|The most inventive, assured, and playful debut in hip-hop history, ''3 Feet High and Rising'' not only proved that rappers didn't have to talk about the streets to succeed, but also expanded the palette of sampling material with a kaleidoscope of sounds and references culled from [[pop music|pop]], [[soul music|soul]], [[disco]], and even [[country music]]. Weaving clever wordplay and deft rhymes across two dozen tracks loosely organized around a game-show theme, De La Soul broke down boundaries all over the LP, moving easily from the groovy my-philosophy intro \"The Magic Number\" to an intelligent, caring inner-city vignette named \"Ghetto Thang\" to the freewheeling end-of-innocence tale \"Jenifa Taught Me (Derwin's Revenge).\" Rappers Posdnuos and Trugoy the Dove talked about anything they wanted (up to and including [[body odor]]), playing fast and loose on the mic like Biz Markie. Thinly disguised under a layer of humor, their lyrical themes ranged from true love (\"[[Eye Know]]\") to the destructive power of [[drugs]] (\"Say No Go\") to Daisy Age philosophy (\"Tread Water\") to [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] (\"Buddy\"). [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]] (from [[Stetsasonic]]) and DJ Pasemaster Mase led the way on the production end, with dozens of [[music sampling|samples]] from all sorts of left-field artists\u2014including [[Johnny Cash]], [[The Mad Lads]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[Hall & Oates]], and [[the Turtles]]. The pair didn't just use those samples as [[hook (music)|hooks]] or drumbreaks\u2014like most hip-hop producers had in the past\u2014but as split-second fills and in-jokes that made some tracks sound more like DJ records. Even \"Potholes on My Lawn,\" which samples a mouth harp and yodeling (for the chorus, no less), became a big R&B hit. If it was easy to believe the revolution was here from listening to the rapping and production on [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'', with De La Soul the Daisy Age seemed to promise a new era of positivity in hip-hop.|Jon Bush}}\n\n=== Mid\u2013late 1990s: Mainstream decline ===\nContrary to [[alternative rock]], which went on to become a mainstay in mainstream music and replaced the [[glam metal]] of the previous generation as the most popular form of rock music, alternative hip hop's commercial momentum was impeded by the then also newly emerging, significantly harder-edged West Coast [[gangsta rap]].<ref name=Erlewine>{{cite web |author=Erlewine, Stephen|title=De La Soul|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p69369/biography|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=March 25, 2007}}</ref> With its aggressive tone, nihilistic tendencies, and violent imagery, gangsta rap was considered to be the more entertaining, more lucrative subgenre as signified by the high chart placings, radio success and [[multi-platinum|multiplatinum]]-selling records of gangsta rappers such as [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Warren G]] and [[N.W.A]], who were widely embraced by [[major record label]]s and produced a legion of imitators.<ref name=Erlewine/> Albums such as ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', ''[[The Chronic]]'' and ''[[Doggystyle]]'' redefined the direction of hip hop, which resulted in lyricism concerning the gangsta lifestyle becoming the driving force of sales figures.<ref name=\"Caramanica\">Caramanica, Jon.

Similar to the [[alternative rock]] movement, alternative hip hop segued into the mainstream at the dawn of the 1990s. Arrested Development along with [[The Fugees]], stand as some of the first few alternative rap to be recognized by mainstream audiences.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> The classic debut albums ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'', ''[[People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm]]'', and ''[[Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde]]'' achieved minor commercial success as they garnered immense acclaim from music critics, who described the records as managing to be both ambitiously innovative but playful masterpieces, hailing the artists as the future of hip hop music as a whole.<ref name=Erlewine/> Christened as \"The ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' of hip hop\", De La Soul's debut album ''3 Feet High and Rising'' was considered the forefront of the subgenre. As music critic Jon Bush wrote in retrospect:\n\n{{quote|The most inventive, assured, and playful debut in hip-hop history, ''3 Feet High and Rising'' not only proved that rappers didn't have to talk about the streets to succeed, but also expanded the palette of sampling material with a kaleidoscope of sounds and references culled from [[pop music|pop]], [[soul music|soul]], [[disco]], and even [[country music]]. Weaving clever wordplay and deft rhymes across two dozen tracks loosely organized around a game-show theme, De La Soul broke down boundaries all over the LP, moving easily from the groovy my-philosophy intro \"The Magic Number\" to an intelligent, caring inner-city vignette named \"Ghetto Thang\" to the freewheeling end-of-innocence tale \"Jenifa Taught Me (Derwin's Revenge).\" Rappers Posdnuos and Trugoy the Dove talked about anything they wanted (up to and including [[body odor]]), playing fast and loose on the mic like Biz Markie. Thinly disguised under a layer of humor, their lyrical themes ranged from true love (\"[[Eye Know]]\") to the destructive power of [[drugs]] (\"Say No Go\") to Daisy Age philosophy (\"Tread Water\") to [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] (\"Buddy\"). [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]] (from [[Stetsasonic]]) and DJ Pasemaster Mase led the way on the production end, with dozens of [[music sampling|samples]] from all sorts of left-field artists\u2014including [[Johnny Cash]], [[The Mad Lads]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[Hall & Oates]], and [[the Turtles]]. The pair didn't just use those samples as [[hook (music)|hooks]] or drumbreaks\u2014like most hip-hop producers had in the past\u2014but as split-second fills and in-jokes that made some tracks sound more like DJ records. Even \"Potholes on My Lawn,\" which samples a mouth harp and yodeling (for the chorus, no less), became a big R&B hit. If it was easy to believe the revolution was here from listening to the rapping and production on [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'', with De La Soul the Daisy Age seemed to promise a new era of positivity in hip-hop.|Jon Bush}}\n\n=== Mid\u2013late 1990s: Mainstream decline ===\nContrary to [[alternative rock]], which went on to become a mainstay in mainstream music and replaced the [[glam metal]] of the previous generation as the most popular form of rock music, alternative hip hop's commercial momentum was impeded by the then also newly emerging, significantly harder-edged West Coast [[gangsta rap]].<ref name=Erlewine>{{cite web |author=Erlewine, Stephen|title=De La Soul|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p69369/biography|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=March 25, 2007}}</ref> With its aggressive tone, nihilistic tendencies, and violent imagery, gangsta rap was considered to be the more entertaining, more lucrative subgenre as signified by the high chart placings, radio success and [[multi-platinum|multiplatinum]]-selling records of gangsta rappers such as [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Warren G]] and [[N.W.A]], who were widely embraced by [[major record label]]s and produced a legion of imitators.<ref name=Erlewine/> Albums such as ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', ''[[The Chronic]]'' and ''[[Doggystyle]]'' redefined the direction of hip hop, which resulted in lyricism concerning the gangsta lifestyle becoming the driving force of sales figures.<ref name=\"Caramanica\">Caramanica, Jon.

For example, the measles vaccine is given to children between the ages of 9 and 12 months, and the short window between the disappearance of maternal antibody (before which the vaccine often fails to [[seroconversion|seroconvert]]) and natural infection means that vaccinated children are frequently still vulnerable. Herd immunity lessens this vulnerability if all the children are vaccinated. Increasing herd immunity during an outbreak or risk of outbreak is perhaps the most widely accepted justification for mass vaccination.

Originally called inoculation, this technique was later called [[variolation]] to avoid confusion with cowpox inoculation ([[vaccination]]) when that was introduced by [[Edward Jenner]]. Although variolation had a long history in China and India, it was first used in North America and England in 1721. [[Cotton Mather|Reverend Cotton Mather]] introduced variolation to Boston, Massachusetts, during the 1721 smallpox epidemic.<ref name=\"VaccineControversy\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/vaccinecontrover00arth |title=Vaccine: The Controversial Story of Medicine's Greatest Lifesaver |last=Allen |first=Arthur |publisher=W.

[[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] introduced variolation to England. She had seen it used in Turkey and, in 1718, had her son successfully variolated in Constantinople under the supervision of Dr. [[Charles Maitland (physician)|Charles Maitland]]. When she returned to England in 1721, she had her daughter variolated by Maitland. This aroused considerable interest, and Sir [[Hans Sloane]] organized the variolation of some inmates in [[Newgate Prison]]. These were successful, and after a further short trial in 1722, two daughters of [[Caroline of Ansbach]] Princess of Wales were variolated without mishap. With this royal approval, the procedure became common when smallpox epidemics threatened.<ref name=\"williams\">{{Cite book |title=Angel Of Death; the story of smallpox |last=Williams |first=Gareth |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-230-27471-6 |location=Basingstoke, UK |pages=87\u201394 |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>\n\n[[Vaccination and religion|Religious arguments against inoculation]] were soon advanced.

For example, the measles vaccine is given to children between the ages of 9 and 12 months, and the short window between the disappearance of maternal antibody (before which the vaccine often fails to [[seroconversion|seroconvert]]) and natural infection means that vaccinated children are frequently still vulnerable. Herd immunity lessens this vulnerability if all the children are vaccinated. Increasing herd immunity during an outbreak or risk of outbreak is perhaps the most widely accepted justification for mass vaccination.

Originally called inoculation, this technique was later called [[variolation]] to avoid confusion with cowpox inoculation ([[vaccination]]) when that was introduced by [[Edward Jenner]]. Although variolation had a long history in China and India, it was first used in North America and England in 1721. [[Cotton Mather|Reverend Cotton Mather]] introduced variolation to Boston, Massachusetts, during the 1721 smallpox epidemic.<ref name=\"VaccineControversy\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/vaccinecontrover00arth |title=Vaccine: The Controversial Story of Medicine's Greatest Lifesaver |last=Allen |first=Arthur |publisher=W.

[[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] introduced variolation to England. She had seen it used in Turkey and, in 1718, had her son successfully variolated in Constantinople under the supervision of Dr. [[Charles Maitland (physician)|Charles Maitland]]. When she returned to England in 1721, she had her daughter variolated by Maitland. This aroused considerable interest, and Sir [[Hans Sloane]] organized the variolation of some inmates in [[Newgate Prison]]. These were successful, and after a further short trial in 1722, two daughters of [[Caroline of Ansbach]] Princess of Wales were variolated without mishap. With this royal approval, the procedure became common when smallpox epidemics threatened.<ref name=\"williams\">{{Cite book |title=Angel Of Death; the story of smallpox |last=Williams |first=Gareth |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-230-27471-6 |location=Basingstoke, UK |pages=87\u201394 |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>\n\n[[Vaccination and religion|Religious arguments against inoculation]] were soon advanced.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated.\"</ref> The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.<ref name=Smith7 /><ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes [[Th\u00e9ophraste Renaudot]]: \"History is the record of things accomplished. A ''Gazette'' is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true.\"</ref><ref name=Pettegree3>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 3. \"Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market\u2014and by the sixteenth century it was a real market\u2014was humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information.\"</ref> Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.<ref name=Park675>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), pp. 675\u2013676. \"News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences.\"</ref> News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past\u2014or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some \"peg\", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.<ref name=Park675 /><ref>Schudson, \"When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History\"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff & Schudson; pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.<ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13\u201314.</ref> Hence the famous dictum that \"Dog Bites Man\" is not news, but \"Man Bites Dog\" is.<ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 678.</ref>\n\nAnother corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. \"It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced.\"</ref>\n\n===Commodity===\nAccording to some theories, \"news\" is whatever the news industry sells.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. \"... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public.\"</ref> Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. \"The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news.\"</ref><ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. \"[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media.\"</ref> From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.<ref>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. \"News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity.\"</ref> A news agency supplies this resource \"wholesale\" and publishers enhance it for retail.<ref name=Globalization6>Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. \"News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism.\"</ref><ref name=MacGregor>Phil MacGregor, \"International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\n===Tone===\nMost purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.<ref>Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. \"Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. [\u2026] After World War I, however, this changed.

News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals. Millions of people in countries such as the United States and South Korea have taken up blogging.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself.

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of \"impartiality\" on news broadcasters.<ref name=Wallace>Sue Wallace, \"Impartiality in the News\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref> Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20\u201323.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = \"The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880\u20131930\"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture & Society | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 557\u2013573 | year= 2000 | doi = 10.1177/016344300022005002 }}</ref> These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 15, 35.</ref> Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.<ref>Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.</ref>\n\nEven in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests.

The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others.

When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\">{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A.

After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.</ref>\n\nNews is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}</ref> The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98\u201399.</ref> The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. \"When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues.\"</ref> The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Influence of sponsorship==\nIt has been acknowledged that [[sponsorship]] has historically influenced various news stories.<ref name=marketrevealed>https://www.marketingweek.com/brands-set-to-stay-classy-with-anchorman-2/</ref><ref name=theweekreports>https://theweek.com/articles/453933/how-nonstop-marketing-killed-buzz-anchorman-2</ref><ref name=startribunereports>http://www.startribune.com/don-shelby-an-anchorman-s-take-on-anchorman-2/236808001/</ref> This history gained widespread attention following the release of the film [[Anchorman 2]].<ref name=marketrevealed /><ref name=theweekreports /><ref name=startribunereports /> One example in recent time is  the fact that Facebook has invested heavily in news sources and purchasing time on local news media outlets.<ref name=facebookbust>https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/</ref><ref name=nbcreports /> Tech Crunch journalist Josh Constine even stated in February 2018 that the company \"stole the news business\" and used sponsorship to make many news publishers its \"ghostwriters.\"<ref name=facebookbust /> In January 2019, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he will spend $300 million in local news buys over a three year period.<ref name=nbcreports>https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-announces-300-million-investment-local-news-n958726</ref><ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-investing-300-million-to-bolster-local-news/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Toronto School of communication theory]] [http://wikiglobals.com wikiglobals]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n* Allan, Stuart, ''News Culture''.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood.

In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322\u20131325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 110\u2013112.</ref> Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 120.</ref> These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''\u2014\"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition\"\u2014and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 121.</ref> In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 124.</ref> Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.<ref>Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. \"Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'.

A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself.

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias.

Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting.

[\u2026] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhiliration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is ''really happening'', right now, to real people.\"</ref> As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.<ref name=SilverblattZlobin28>Silverblatt & Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 28\u201331. \"A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence\u2014regardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 percent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, ''Family Circle'' and ''McCall's''' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels.\"</ref>\n\n===Public sphere===\nThis collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or [[public sphere]].<ref name=Starr24 /><ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 677.</ref> In this view, the news media constitute a [[fourth estate]] which serves to check and balance the operations of government.<ref name=\"Allen47\"/>\n\nThis idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.<ref>Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 140\u2013144.</ref> According to one interpretation of the [[CNN effect]], instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 179\u2013185.</ref> In 1989, local and global communications media enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. The news about Tiananmen Square traveled over fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.<ref>Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 70\u201372.</ref>\n\n===News events===\nAs the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the [[collective memory]] of a society.<ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 211\u2013213.</ref><ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), pp. 685\u2013686. \"In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events\u2014at least as listener if not as spectator\u2014as they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics, so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world.\"</ref>\n\nOne type of news event, the [[media event]], is a scripted pageant organized for mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 1\u201314.</ref> These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 25\u201353.</ref> Usually they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), p. 196.</ref> Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence, can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Chris | last2 = Andresen | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Hoxha | first3 = Abit | title = \"The manufacture of an international news event: The day Kosovo was born\"; | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103\u2013120 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1177/1464884911400846}}</ref>\n\nThe perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 57\u201361.</ref> Crises can also increase the effect of news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to \"rally\" behind its current leadership.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 73\u201376.</ref> The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of [[terrorism]] and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the [[Iran hostage crisis|capture of American hostages in Iran]] dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a \"crisis\", and influenced a presidential election.<ref>Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 73\u201377.</ref>\n\nSouth Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.<ref>Danie Du Plessis, \"What's News in South Africa?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 303. \"Virtually all references to political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response.\"</ref> In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]]), the 1969 [[moon landing]], the 1986 Challenger explosion, the 1997 death of Princess Diana, the [[Bush v. Gore|intervention of the Supreme Court]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] and the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>Elizabeth A. Skewes and Heather Black, \"What's News in the United States?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 329.</ref> In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of [[King Hussein]], Princess Diana, and [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin]]. Positive news stories found memorable by Jordanians featured political events affecting their lives and families\u2014such as the [[South Lebanon security belt|Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon]], and the [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty]].<ref>Mohammed Issa Taha Ali, \"What's News in Jordan?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 252.</ref>\n\nNews coverage can also shape collective memory in retrospect. A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.<ref>Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, \"Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory\"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed.

When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\">{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A. Schuster, et al., \"A National Survey of Stress Reactions After the September 11, 2011, Terrorist Attacks\", ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 345.20, 15 November 2001.</ref> Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Terr |display-authors=etal  | title = Children's symptoms in the wake of Challenger: a field study of distant-traumatic effects and an outline of related conditions | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 10| year = 1999 | pmid = 10518163 | doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536 | pages=1536\u201344}}</ref> Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.<ref>Gavin Rees, \"The Trauma Factor\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\nResearch also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Altheide | first1 = David L. | title = The News Media, the Problem Frame, and the Production of Fear | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 647\u2013668 | year= 1997 | doi = 10.1111/j.1533-8525.1997.tb00758.x }}</ref>\n\n===Influence===\nThe content and style of news delivery certainly have effects on the general public, with the magnitude and precise nature of these effects being tough to determine experimentally.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 1\u201310.</ref> In Western societies, television viewing has been so ubiquitous that its total effect on psychology and culture leave few alternatives for comparison.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 12. \"Some media may be so pervasive and so consistent in their effects that their impact is not noticeable. After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.</ref>\n\nNews is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}</ref> The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98\u201399.</ref> The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. \"When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues.\"</ref> The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Influence of sponsorship==\nIt has been acknowledged that [[sponsorship]] has historically influenced various news stories.<ref name=marketrevealed>https://www.marketingweek.com/brands-set-to-stay-classy-with-anchorman-2/</ref><ref name=theweekreports>https://theweek.com/articles/453933/how-nonstop-marketing-killed-buzz-anchorman-2</ref><ref name=startribunereports>http://www.startribune.com/don-shelby-an-anchorman-s-take-on-anchorman-2/236808001/</ref> This history gained widespread attention following the release of the film [[Anchorman 2]].<ref name=marketrevealed /><ref name=theweekreports /><ref name=startribunereports /> One example in recent time is  the fact that Facebook has invested heavily in news sources and purchasing time on local news media outlets.<ref name=facebookbust>https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/</ref><ref name=nbcreports /> Tech Crunch journalist Josh Constine even stated in February 2018 that the company \"stole the news business\" and used sponsorship to make many news publishers its \"ghostwriters.\"<ref name=facebookbust /> In January 2019, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he will spend $300 million in local news buys over a three year period.<ref name=nbcreports>https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-announces-300-million-investment-local-news-n958726</ref><ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-investing-300-million-to-bolster-local-news/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Toronto School of communication theory]] [http://wikiglobals.com wikiglobals]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n* Allan, Stuart, ''News Culture''.
