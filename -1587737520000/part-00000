{"title_page": "Terry Doran", "text_new": "{{short description|British music manager}}\n'''Terry Doran''' (1936 \u2013 19 April 2020) was an English pop band manager, known for managing the band [[Grapefruit (band)|Grapefruit]] and singer [[Mary Hopkin]], as well as having a business association with [[the Beatles]]. With the Beatles' own manager, [[Brian Epstein]], he co-owned Brydor Cars, which supplied sportscars to many figures in the [[Swinging London]] era, including members of the Beatles and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Doran managed the Beatles' company [[Apple Publishing]] in the late 1960s. Following the band's break-up in 1970, he worked as the estate manager at [[George Harrison]]'s [[Friar Park]] property.\n\nHe is often cited as the inspiration behind the line \"Meeting a man from the motor trade\" in the Beatles' 1967 song \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\", although [[Paul McCartney]] later denied the story.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=316}} Doran suggested the verb \"fill\" in the line \"Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall\", from \"[[A Day in the Life]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alan |first1=Aldridge|title=The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics|title-link=The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics|date=1969 |publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers |isbn=1-57912-058-X |page=29}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nDoran met [[Brian Epstein]], who was then managing the Epstein family's NEMS record stores, in a Liverpool pub in 1959 and the pair became immediate friends. Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] describes Doran as \"a car salesman with a sharp mind and a ready Liverpool wit\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=277}}\n\nHe met the Beatles in the early 1960s, shortly after Epstein had become the band's manager.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=570}} Doran worked for Hawthorne Motors, a [[car dealership]] in [[Warrington]], and sold the first car owned by a member of the Beatles \u2013 a blue [[Ford Anglia]] \u2013 to [[George Harrison]], the youngest member of the group.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|pp=618, 683}} In exchange for the reasonable terms offered by Doran, Harrison agreed to pose with his bandmates [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], and the car, in an advertisement for Hawthorne.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|pp=618, 683}} The ad appeared in the local ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' music newspaper in July 1962, at a time when the Beatles' popularity had yet to expand beyond the north of England and the club circuit in Hamburg.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=683}} Doran then supplied the band \u2013 who were soon to fire [[Pete Best]] as their drummer and probably lose Best's van as their means of transportion to gigs \u2013 with an eight-seater Ford Thames van, which NEMS purchased on the group's behalf.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=684}}\n\nIn 1963, Doran moved to London when Epstein relocated NEMS there with the growth of the Beatles' operation. He shared a flat in [[Shepherd Market]] in [[Mayfair]] with [[BBC Radio]] producer [[Bernie Andrews]].{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=151}} Doran co-owned (with Epstein) and ran the car dealership Brydor, based in [[Hounslow]], west of London.

was an English pop band manager, known for managing the band [[Grapefruit (band)|Grapefruit]] and singer [[Mary Hopkin]], as well as having a business association with [[the Beatles]]. With the Beatles' own manager, [[Brian Epstein]], he co-owned Brydor Cars, which supplied sportscars to many figures in the [[Swinging London]] era, including members of the Beatles and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Doran managed the Beatles' company [[Apple Publishing]] in the late 1960s. Following the band's break-up in 1970, he worked as the estate manager at [[George Harrison]]'s [[Friar Park]] property.\n\nHe is often cited as the inspiration behind the line \"Meeting a man from the motor trade\" in the Beatles' 1967 song \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\", although [[Paul McCartney]] later denied the story.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=316}} Doran suggested the verb \"fill\" in the line \"Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall\", from \"[[A Day in the Life]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Alan |first1=Aldridge|title=The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics|title-link=The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics|date=1969 |publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers |isbn=1-57912-058-X |page=29}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nDoran met [[Brian Epstein]], who was then managing the Epstein family's NEMS record stores, in a Liverpool pub in 1959 and the pair became immediate friends. Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] describes Doran as \"a car salesman with a sharp mind and a ready Liverpool wit\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=277}}\n\nHe met the Beatles in the early 1960s, shortly after Epstein had become the band's manager.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=570}} Doran worked for Hawthorne Motors, a [[car dealership]] in [[Warrington]], and sold the first car owned by a member of the Beatles \u2013 a blue [[Ford Anglia]] \u2013 to [[George Harrison]], the youngest member of the group.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|pp=618, 683}} In exchange for the reasonable terms offered by Doran, Harrison agreed to pose with his bandmates [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]], and the car, in an advertisement for Hawthorne.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|pp=618, 683}} The ad appeared in the local ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' music newspaper in July 1962, at a time when the Beatles' popularity had yet to expand beyond the north of England and the club circuit in Hamburg.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=683}} Doran then supplied the band \u2013 who were soon to fire [[Pete Best]] as their drummer and probably lose Best's van as their means of transportion to gigs \u2013 with an eight-seater Ford Thames van, which NEMS purchased on the group's behalf.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=684}}\n\nIn 1963, Doran moved to London when Epstein relocated NEMS there with the growth of the Beatles' operation. He shared a flat in [[Shepherd Market]] in [[Mayfair]] with [[BBC Radio]] producer [[Bernie Andrews]].{{sfn|Clayson|2003|p=151}} Doran co-owned (with Epstein) and ran the car dealership Brydor, based in [[Hounslow]], west of London.

Doran was represented in a [[Krishna]]-inspired painting that [[Tom Wilkes]] designed as an insert poster for Harrison's ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' triple album, although the poster was ultimately not used.{{sfn|Spizer|2005|pp=226, 228}} He worked at Harrison's company Oops Publishing until resigning in February 1975.{{sfn|Badman|2001|p=151}}\n\n==Death==\nDoran's death, at age 80, was announced by Mark Lewisohn on 19 April 2020.

While historical information can be useful, interesting and can provide insights to individuals, I don't think that it's the sure foundation of faith. The sure foundation of faith is spiritual and not physical. ... [T]he more an individual learns about the history of the Church, the greater that individual's understanding will be of the overall picture. Thus, every piece of evidence will be viewed against the total picture. Otherwise, people who do not have much knowledge of Church history may find themselves being tossed to and fro by tidbits from the past.<ref name=devotee/></blockquote>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book\n | author        = Turley, Richard E., Jr.\n | title         = Victims: The LDS Church and the Mark Hofmann Case\n | publisher     = [[University of Illinois Press]]\n | location      = Urbana, Illinois\n | year          = 1992\n | isbn          = 0-252-01885-0\n | url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=IqrDDrWR_X4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n | author1       = \u2014\u2014\n | author2       = Littke, Lael\n | title         = Stories from the Life of Joseph Smith\n | year          = 2003\n | publisher     = [[Deseret Book]]\n | location      = Salt Lake City, Utah\n | isbn          = 1-57008-915-9\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n | last1         = Walker\n | first1        = Ronald W.\n | author1-link  = Ronald W.

To tell the story from the perspectives of the murder victims and the LDS Church (which Turley believed had been misrepresented) he published ''Victims: The LDS Church and the Mark Hofmann Case'' in 1992 through the [[University of Illinois Press]]. Though he wrote the book without church direction, his trusted position granted him church leaders' support and access to interviews, diaries, journals, memoranda, and other records.<ref name=devotee/>\n\n===Expanded role===\nTurley was appointed Managing Director of the Historical Department in 1989,<ref>[[John K.

These comprise one of the largest collections of [[Mormon history]], [[Western United States|western]] history, and [[genealogy]] in the world.<ref name=newsroombio/> As a person of authority in LDS history and past defender of the church in the Hofmann controversy, Turley later became one of three official LDS Church respondents to a popular 2003 book critical of Mormonism, ''[[Under the Banner of Heaven]]'' by [[Jon Krakauer]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Church Response to Jon Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven | date=June 27, 2003 | work=Newsroom | publisher=LDS Church | url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/church-response-to-jon-krakauer-s-under-the-banner-of-heaven | accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref>\n\n===Digital projects===\nIn the department, Turley managed several notable electronic projects.

While historical information can be useful, interesting and can provide insights to individuals, I don't think that it's the sure foundation of faith. The sure foundation of faith is spiritual and not physical. ... [T]he more an individual learns about the history of the Church, the greater that individual's understanding will be of the overall picture. Thus, every piece of evidence will be viewed against the total picture. Otherwise, people who do not have much knowledge of Church history may find themselves being tossed to and fro by tidbits from the past.<ref name=devotee/></blockquote>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book\n | author        = Turley, Richard E., Jr.\n | title         = Victims: The LDS Church and the Mark Hofmann Case\n | publisher     = [[University of Illinois Press]]\n | location      = Urbana, Illinois\n | year          = 1992\n | isbn          = 0-252-01885-0\n | url           = https://books.google.com/books?id=IqrDDrWR_X4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n | author1       = \u2014\u2014\n | author2       = Littke, Lael\n | title         = Stories from the Life of Joseph Smith\n | year          = 2003\n | publisher     = [[Deseret Book]]\n | location      = Salt Lake City, Utah\n | isbn          = 1-57008-915-9\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n | last1         = Walker\n | first1        = Ronald W.\n | author1-link  = Ronald W.
