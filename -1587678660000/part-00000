Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized.

In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42</ref>\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

These land disputes included estates his father held [[Tenant-in-chief|in-chief]] from the crown and others which he had held from the Peverel family as [[Lord|overlords]].\n\nOther lawsuits concerned Whittington Castle held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Although he won the right to Whittington in or about 1195, he never received formal legal ''[[seisin]]'' and it remained in Welsh hands at the time of his death in 1197.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 35</ref>\n\n[[Whittington Castle]] lies on the English side of [[Offa's Dyke]], which during the Norman era and before was the border between England and [[Wales]]. The site was fortified as a castle by [[William Peverel]] in 1138, in support of Empress Matilda, the daughter of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] (1100\u20131135), in her struggle (known as [[The Anarchy]]) for the throne against King Stephen (1135\u20131154), grandson of [[William the Conqueror]]. In the late 1140s the [[Marcher lord|lordship]] of [[Whittington, Shropshire|Whittington]], like [[Oswestry]] and Overton ceased to be part of England and became part of the [[Kingdom of Powys]] and a Welsh [[marcher lord]]ship.<ref>P.

A rival claim was made by Fulk III FitzWarin (c. 1160\u20131258).<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\">Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 52</ref>\n\n===Rebellions===\nFulk III continued the claim to Whittington made by his father. After his father's death in 1197 Fulk III offered [[feudal relief|relief]] of \u00a3100 for the inheritance of Whittington. However Maurice of Powis (d.1200), the son of Roger of Powis, who had offered half that amount, on 11 April 1200 was granted Whittington by [[John, King of England|King John]]. Again, after Maurice's death in August 1200, King John granted it to Maurice's heirs.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 36</ref>\n\nIt is not known why King John refused to recognise Fulk's claim to Whittington as his rightful inheritance but by April 1201 Fulk was in open rebellion against the King. He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers but was clearly considerable as in the spring of 1201, while King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]], with 100 knights, to counter the rebellion of Fulk and William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 48, 84</ref>\n\nIn July 1202 Fulk and his men are reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\".  Yet another, Eustace de Kivilly, was pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned together with over thirty of his followers, including his brothers William,  Phillip and John and his cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L. Brandin (ed.), ''The History of Fulk Fitz-Warine'' (Alexander Moring Ltd., De La More Press, London 1904), p. xii.</ref> Whittington Castle thereafter descended in the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all subsequent holders bearing the first-name Fulk, until the death of [[Fulk XI FitzWarin, 7th Baron FitzWarin]] (1405\u20131420) in 1420.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pps. 51\u201352</ref>\n\nIn 1207 Fulk III was clearly highly regarded by many of the king's barons as evidenced by the identity of men known to have provided surety for Fulk's fine of 1,200 marks to marry the heiress daughter of Robert le Vavasur. The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] (d.1230), a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref>\n\nOn 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218 however Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered restored by the regents of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref>\n\nBy 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42</ref>\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*Firstly, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

He held several all-time receiving records when he retired.\n\n==Football career==\n[[File:NFL-Week02-SeaVSF001.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Banners of Largent and the [[12th man (football)|12th Man]] hang over [[CenturyLink Field]].]]\n\nIn 1974 at the [[University of Tulsa]], Largent had 884 yards receiving and 14 touchdown catches. In 1975, he had 51 catches for 1,000 yards and 14 touchdown catches.\n\nDespite an All-American career at Tulsa, Largent was not selected until the fourth round of the [[1976 NFL Draft]] by the [[Houston Oilers]] (117th pick). After four preseason games, he was slated to be cut, but was instead traded to the expansion [[Seattle Seahawks]] for a 1977 eighth-round pick. According to Largent, [[Bum Phillips]] called him into his office and told Largent he had all the receivers they needed, and that Houston would be releasing him. Largent feared his career was over before it began.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk8gVg9bdUU</ref>\n\nLargent spent 14 years with the Seahawks, initially reuniting with his college offensive coordinator, [[Jerry Rhome]]. His first practice with the team went horribly, as he suffered from sleep deprivation for 9 days while financially struggling to care for his mother and three younger brothers after their mother left her alcoholic and violent second husband.<ref>{{Citation|title=Steve Largent: A Football Life|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnjxRe5uyI|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> While not particularly fast, was extremely sure-handed and was able to get wide open due to his route-running discipline. He became the first Seahawk selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] in 1978, and was selected six more times during his career. In 1979 he led the league in receiving yards with 1,237, and six years later did it again with 1,287 in 1985. he is also a scrorpio.(I am one too) \n\n\nIn 1987, Largent ended his participation in the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] [[work stoppage|strike]] after the third and final week of the strike. With the retirement of [[Charlie Joiner]] the previous year, Largent became the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards, retaining that lead until his retirement in 1989. He broke Joiner's all-time record for receiving yards (12,146) in Week 3 of 1988. In the same season, he suffered a concussion and lost two teeth when he was hit by [[Mike Harden]] of  [[Denver Broncos]]. Harden was tackled by Largent and lost a fumble 14 weeks later after Harden's initial interception.\n\nIn 1989, Largent became the first Seahawks player to win the [[Steve Largent Award]] for his spirit, dedication, and integrity.<ref>Booth, Tim (December 19, 2008).

This also allowed him to quickly adjust from catching with left-handed [[Jim Zorn]] to right-handed [[Dave Krieg]].\n\nWhen Largent retired, he held all major NFL receiving records, including: most receptions in a career (819), most receiving yards in a career (13,089), and most touchdown receptions (100). He was also in possession of a then-record streak of 177 consecutive regular-season games with a reception. He also holds the distinction as the first receiver in NFL history to achieve 100 touchdown receptions in his career.\n\nLargent was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1995, his first year of eligibility. In 1999, he was ranked number 46 on ''[[The Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the only Seahawk to make the list.\n\nHis #80 was [[jersey retirement|retired]] in 1992; Largent is the first Seahawk player to be so honored. During [[Jerry Rice]]'s stint with the Seahawks in 2004, Largent's #80 was temporarily \"unretired\" after a conversation between Rice and Largent that was reportedly initiated by then Seahawks president [[Bob Whitsitt]].<ref>Greg Bishop, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2002076120_rice29.html \"Hawks offered No. 80, Rice says\"], ''[[Seattle Times]]'', October 29, 2004.</ref> Largent remains the most prolific receiver in team history.

Boren|David Boren]]. Largent won the election to succeed Inhofe in Congress; pursuant to an Oklahoma statute, Governor [[David Walters]] designated the special election in which Largent was elected to serve the remainder of Inhofe's term in the [[103rd Congress]] before beginning his term in the [[104th Congress]].<ref>[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000096 LARGENT, Steve, (1954\u2013 )]. bioguide.congress.gov</ref><ref>Jim Myers, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&articleid=485047&archive=yes \"Largent Takes Oath of Office\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', November 30, 1994.</ref>\n\nLargent took office on November 29, 1994 and was reelected to the three succeeding Congresses, never winning less than 60 percent of the vote in the heavily Republican [[Tulsa]]-based district.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080312190526/http://www.ok.gov/~elections/96gsum.html \"Oklahoma State Election Board\"].

November 7, 2000</ref>\n\nLike many in the Republican freshman class elected in 1994, when the Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years, Largent's voting record was solidly conservative. Largent was one of the \"true believers\" in that freshman class, devoting most of his time to issues important to the [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative Christians]].\n\nOne of his first bills was a \"parental rights\" bill that died in committee after it attracted opposition even from other Christian conservatives. Another of his bills would have abolished the federal tax code at the end of 2001. He opposed ending the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995\u20131996|1995 federal government shutdown]] and played a role in the failed attempt to oust [[Newt Gingrich]] as Speaker. Largent introduced a bill that would ban adoptions by gay and lesbian parents in Washington, D. C.\n\nHe was accused of being [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] due to his line of questioning of a House of Representatives [[chaplain]] in 2000, though he denied this.<ref>David van Biema, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,39948,00.html?iid=chix-sphere Catholic Bashing?], ''[[TIME]]'', February 27, 2000.</ref>\n\nAfter the Republicans lost five seats in the 1998 midterm elections, Largent tried to take advantage of discontent with [[Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] by challenging Armey for the post. Although Armey was not popular in the Republican caucus, Largent was thought to be far too conservative for the liking of some moderate Republicans, and Armey won on the third ballot.<ref>Guy Gugliotta and Juliet Eilperin. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/house111998.htm House Republicans Embrace Livingston, Armey, Watts]. [[Washington Post]], November 19, 1998.</ref>  However, when [[Bob Livingston]] of [[Louisiana]] stood down as Speaker-elect, Armey was still too wounded to make a bid for the job.\n\n====Run for Governor====\nLargent decided to run for [[Governor of Oklahoma]] in [[Oklahoma gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]]. He easily won the Republican nomination and resigned his House seat on February 15 to devote his energy to the race. Initially seen as an overwhelming favorite against Democratic state senator [[Brad Henry]], Largent lost to Henry by just under 7,000 votes.\n\nLargent's loss has been attributed by analysts to factors that included:\n* The presence of a well-funded independent ([[Gary Richardson (lawyer)|Gary Richardson]], a former Republican) on the general election ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\">David Averill, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/article.aspx?subjectid=215&articleid=20090322_215_G6_GaryRi652763 \"Eyeing another campaign: Richardson had impact on 2002 governor's race\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', March 22, 2009.</ref>\n* Henry's support of [[cockfighting]], garnering a last minute endorsement by rural cockfighting interests that turned out in large numbers in the election in which the legality of cockfighting was on the ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\" /><ref name=\"AP20021106\">[https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/state/2002-11-06-oklahoma-gov_x.htm \"Henry upsets Steve Largent in governor's race\"], [[Associated Press|AP]] at ''[[USA Today]]'', November 5, 2002.</ref><ref>John M.

Prior to his political career, Largent was a [[wide receiver]] for the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[National Football League]] for his entire 14-season [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] career. He held several all-time receiving records when he retired.\n\n==Football career==\n[[File:NFL-Week02-SeaVSF001.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Banners of Largent and the [[12th man (football)|12th Man]] hang over [[CenturyLink Field]].]]\n\nIn 1974 at the [[University of Tulsa]], Largent had 884 yards receiving and 14 touchdown catches. In 1975, he had 51 catches for 1,000 yards and 14 touchdown catches.\n\nDespite an All-American career at Tulsa, Largent was not selected until the fourth round of the [[1976 NFL Draft]] by the [[Houston Oilers]] (117th pick). After four preseason games, he was slated to be cut, but was instead traded to the expansion [[Seattle Seahawks]] for a 1977 eighth-round pick. According to Largent, [[Bum Phillips]] called him into his office and told Largent he had all the receivers they needed, and that Houston would be releasing him. Largent feared his career was over before it began.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk8gVg9bdUU</ref>\n\nLargent spent 14 years with the Seahawks, initially reuniting with his college offensive coordinator, [[Jerry Rhome]]. His first practice with the team went horribly, as he suffered from sleep deprivation for 9 days while financially struggling to care for his mother and three younger brothers after their mother left her alcoholic and violent second husband.<ref>{{Citation|title=Steve Largent: A Football Life|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnjxRe5uyI|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> While not particularly fast, was extremely sure-handed and was able to get wide open due to his route-running discipline. He became the first Seahawk selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] in 1978, and was selected six more times during his career. In 1979 he led the league in receiving yards with 1,237, and six years later did it again with 1,287 in 1985. \n\n\nIn 1987, Largent ended his participation in the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] [[work stoppage|strike]] after the third and final week of the strike. With the retirement of [[Charlie Joiner]] the previous year, Largent became the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards, retaining that lead until his retirement in 1989. He broke Joiner's all-time record for receiving yards (12,146) in Week 3 of 1988. In the same season, he suffered a concussion and lost two teeth when he was hit by [[Mike Harden]] of  [[Denver Broncos]]. Harden was tackled by Largent and lost a fumble 14 weeks later after Harden's initial interception.\n\nIn 1989, Largent became the first Seahawks player to win the [[Steve Largent Award]] for his spirit, dedication, and integrity.<ref>Booth, Tim (December 19, 2008).

Retrieved July 21, 2016.</ref>\n\nDuring his playing career Largent was given the nickname ''Yoda'' for his ability to catch anything thrown at him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/seahawks/2015/10/23/steve-largent-yoda-a-football-life-nfl-network/74455400/|title=Seahawks great Steve Largent was nicknamed for 'Star Wars' character|last=Davis|first=Nate|date=October 23, 2015|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}</ref> He attributes this ability from a [[skeet shooting]] buddy that focus only on the edge of the skeet, as he only focus on the tip of the ball to track and catch balls, in the era where receivers and defensive backs don't wear gloves. This also allowed him to quickly adjust from catching with left-handed [[Jim Zorn]] to right-handed [[Dave Krieg]].\n\nWhen Largent retired, he held all major NFL receiving records, including: most receptions in a career (819), most receiving yards in a career (13,089), and most touchdown receptions (100). He was also in possession of a then-record streak of 177 consecutive regular-season games with a reception. He also holds the distinction as the first receiver in NFL history to achieve 100 touchdown receptions in his career.\n\nLargent was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1995, his first year of eligibility. In 1999, he was ranked number 46 on ''[[The Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the only Seahawk to make the list.\n\nHis #80 was [[jersey retirement|retired]] in 1992; Largent is the first Seahawk player to be so honored. During [[Jerry Rice]]'s stint with the Seahawks in 2004, Largent's #80 was temporarily \"unretired\" after a conversation between Rice and Largent that was reportedly initiated by then Seahawks president [[Bob Whitsitt]].<ref>Greg Bishop, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2002076120_rice29.html \"Hawks offered No. 80, Rice says\"], ''[[Seattle Times]]'', October 29, 2004.</ref> Largent remains the most prolific receiver in team history.

Boren|David Boren]]. Largent won the election to succeed Inhofe in Congress; pursuant to an Oklahoma statute, Governor [[David Walters]] designated the special election in which Largent was elected to serve the remainder of Inhofe's term in the [[103rd Congress]] before beginning his term in the [[104th Congress]].<ref>[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000096 LARGENT, Steve, (1954\u2013 )]. bioguide.congress.gov</ref><ref>Jim Myers, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&articleid=485047&archive=yes \"Largent Takes Oath of Office\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', November 30, 1994.</ref>\n\nLargent took office on November 29, 1994 and was reelected to the three succeeding Congresses, never winning less than 60 percent of the vote in the heavily Republican [[Tulsa]]-based district.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080312190526/http://www.ok.gov/~elections/96gsum.html \"Oklahoma State Election Board\"].

November 7, 2000</ref>\n\nLike many in the Republican freshman class elected in 1994, when the Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years, Largent's voting record was solidly conservative. Largent was one of the \"true believers\" in that freshman class, devoting most of his time to issues important to the [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative Christians]].\n\nOne of his first bills was a \"parental rights\" bill that died in committee after it attracted opposition even from other Christian conservatives. Another of his bills would have abolished the federal tax code at the end of 2001. He opposed ending the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995\u20131996|1995 federal government shutdown]] and played a role in the failed attempt to oust [[Newt Gingrich]] as Speaker. Largent introduced a bill that would ban adoptions by gay and lesbian parents in Washington, D. C.\n\nHe was accused of being [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] due to his line of questioning of a House of Representatives [[chaplain]] in 2000, though he denied this.<ref>David van Biema, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,39948,00.html?iid=chix-sphere Catholic Bashing?], ''[[TIME]]'', February 27, 2000.</ref>\n\nAfter the Republicans lost five seats in the 1998 midterm elections, Largent tried to take advantage of discontent with [[Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] by challenging Armey for the post. Although Armey was not popular in the Republican caucus, Largent was thought to be far too conservative for the liking of some moderate Republicans, and Armey won on the third ballot.<ref>Guy Gugliotta and Juliet Eilperin. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/house111998.htm House Republicans Embrace Livingston, Armey, Watts]. [[Washington Post]], November 19, 1998.</ref>  However, when [[Bob Livingston]] of [[Louisiana]] stood down as Speaker-elect, Armey was still too wounded to make a bid for the job.\n\n====Run for Governor====\nLargent decided to run for [[Governor of Oklahoma]] in [[Oklahoma gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]]. He easily won the Republican nomination and resigned his House seat on February 15 to devote his energy to the race. Initially seen as an overwhelming favorite against Democratic state senator [[Brad Henry]], Largent lost to Henry by just under 7,000 votes.\n\nLargent's loss has been attributed by analysts to factors that included:\n* The presence of a well-funded independent ([[Gary Richardson (lawyer)|Gary Richardson]], a former Republican) on the general election ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\">David Averill, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/article.aspx?subjectid=215&articleid=20090322_215_G6_GaryRi652763 \"Eyeing another campaign: Richardson had impact on 2002 governor's race\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', March 22, 2009.</ref>\n* Henry's support of [[cockfighting]], garnering a last minute endorsement by rural cockfighting interests that turned out in large numbers in the election in which the legality of cockfighting was on the ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\" /><ref name=\"AP20021106\">[https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/state/2002-11-06-oklahoma-gov_x.htm \"Henry upsets Steve Largent in governor's race\"], [[Associated Press|AP]] at ''[[USA Today]]'', November 5, 2002.</ref><ref>John M.
