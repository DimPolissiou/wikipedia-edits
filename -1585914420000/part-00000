The Crofton family had come to Ireland from England in the sixteenth century and acquired substantial estates in Roscommon. The elder Sir Edward was noted for his loyalty to the [[Stuart dynasty]] during the [[English Civil War]], and at the [[Restoration of Charles II]] he was rewarded by  being created a  [[baronet]],  the first of the [[Crofton Baronets]]. Little is known for certain of Susanna's background, but there is a tradition in the Crofton family that she  belonged to a junior branch of the family of [[Baron Clifford of Chudleigh]].\n\nTwo years after his father's death in 1675 his mother remarried [[Garrett Dillon]], a prominent [[Roman Catholic]] [[barrister]] who during the reign of the Catholic King [[James II of England]] rose to a position of influence   in Ireland, and was appointed [[Recorder of Dublin]]. Garrett and his stepson seem to have been estranged by the time of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and Susanna's death sometime before 1689 broke any  family tie between them.\n\n==After the Glorious Revolution==\n\nWhen James II landed in Ireland, in order to recover  his three kingdoms, Edward's stepfather Garrett Dillon remained loyal to his cause and sat in the so-called [[Patriot Parliament]] of 1689. Edward, described as a young man of \"sturdy and resolute character\", was by contrast  a convinced supporter of the Revolution. He greatly admired King [[William III of England]], even composing verses in his honour. In consequence the Patriot Parliament [[attainted]] him, and he fled to London with his wife and two young sons; his wife died while they were in England. After the [[Battle of the Boyne]], which effectively destroyed the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause, Edward's lands were quickly restored to him. By contrast, his stepfather was subject to increasing harassment during the 1690s: he eventually fled the country and died in exile. There is no evidence that Edward interceded on his behalf: possibly  he was taking his revenge on Garrett for voting in the Patriot Parliament to attaint him.\n\nHe was MP for [[Boyle (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Boyle]] in the [[Parliament of Ireland]] of 1695\u201399, and for [[Roscommon County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Roscommon]] from 1703\u20131727. He was a member of the Privy Council in 1713-4. He died in 1729.\n\n==Descendants==\n\nHe married in 1685 Katherine, daughter of [[Sir Oliver St George, 1st Baronet]], and  his wife  Olivia Beresford. Katherine died in 1689 or 1690. They had two sons:\n\n*Sir Edward Crofton, 3rd Baronet\n*Oliver,  who became a soldier, and died during the [[Quebec Expedition]] of 1711; he was the father of\n\n*Sir Oliver Crofton, 5th Baronet.\n\nEdward's male line ended with the 5th  Baronet's death in 1780.

[[King Salman]], who reigns currently, first replaced the next crown prince, his brother Muqrin, with his nephew [[Muhammad bin Nayef]].

This period was marked by conquest of neighboring areas and by religious zeal. At its height, the First Saudi State included most of the territory of modern-day [[Saudi Arabia]], and raids by Al Saud's allies and followers reached into [[Yemen Eyalet|Yemen]], [[Oman proper|Oman]], [[Damascus Eyalet|Syria]], and [[Baghdad Eyalet|Iraq]]. Islamic Scholars, particularly [[Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab]] and his descendants, are believed to have played a significant role in Saudi rule during this period. The Saudis and their allies referred to themselves during this period as the ''Muwahhidun'' or ''Ahl al-Tawhid'' (\"the monotheists\"). Later they were referred to as the [[Wahhabism|Wahhabis]], a group of particularly strict, puritanical [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] sect, named for its founder.\n\nLeadership of the Al Saud during the time of their first state passed from father to son without incident. The first imam, [[Muhammad ibn Saud]], was succeeded by his eldest son [[Abdul-Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud|Abdulaziz]] in 1765. In 1802, Abdulaziz led ten thousand Wahhabi soldiers into an attack on the [[Shi'ite]] holy city of [[Karbala]], in what is now southern Iraq and where [[Hussein ibn Ali]], the grandson of the prophet [[Muhammad]] is buried.<ref name=mark/> Led by Abdulaziz, the Wahhabi soldiers killed more than two thousand people, including women and children.<ref name=mark>{{cite book|author=Mark Weston|title=Prophets and princes: Saudi Arabia from Muhammad to the present|year=2008|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0470182574|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EEEFsVYLko4C&pg=PA101&lpg=PA101&dq=wahhabi+sack+of+karbala+1802#v=onepage&q=wahhabi%20sack%20of%20karbala%201802&f=false}}</ref> The soldiers plundered the city, demolishing the massive golden dome above Hussein's tomb and loaded hundreds of camels with weapons, jewelry, coins and other valuable goods.<ref name=mark/>\n\nThe attack on Karbala convinced the Ottomans and the Egyptians that the Saudis were a threat to regional peace.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wayne H.

Abdul-Aziz was in turn succeeded by his son, [[Saud bin Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud|Saud]], under whose rule the Saudi state reached its greatest extent. By the time Saud died in 1814, his son and successor [[Abdullah ibn Saud]] had to contend with an Ottoman-Egyptian invasion in the [[Ottoman\u2013Wahhabi War]] seeking to retake lost [[Ottoman Empire]] territory. The mainly Egyptian force succeeded in defeating Abdullah's forces, taking over the Saudi capital of [[Diriyyah]] in 1818. Abdullah was taken prisoner and was soon beheaded by the Ottomans in Constantinople, putting an end to the First Saudi State. The Egyptians sent many members of the Al Saud clan and other members of the local nobility as prisoners to [[Eyalet of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Constantinople]], and razed the Saudi capital Diriyyah.\n\n===Second Saudi state===\n{{main|Emirate of Nejd}}\n[[File:Flag of the Second Saudi State.svg|thumb|Flag of the Second Saudi State]]\nA few years after the fall of Diriyah in 1818, the Saudis were able to re-establish their authority in [[Najd]], establishing the Emirate of Nejd, commonly known as the Second Saudi State, with its capital in [[Riyadh]].\n\nCompared to the First Saudi State, the second Saudi period was marked by less territorial expansion (it never reconquered the [[Hijaz]] or [['Asir]], for example) and less religious zeal, although the Saudi leaders continued to go by the title of ''imam'' and still employed [[Salafi]] religious scholars. The second state was also marked by severe internal conflicts within the Saudi family, eventually leading to the dynasty's downfall. In all but one instance, succession occurred by assassination or civil war, the exception being the passage of authority from [[Faisal ibn Turki ibn Abdullah Al Saud|Faisal ibn Turki]] to his son Abdullah ibn Faisal ibn Turki.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\n{{Main|Unification of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia}}\n{{Politics of Saudi Arabia}}\n[[File:Franklin D. Roosevelt with King Ibn Saud aboard USS Quincy (CA-71) on 14 February 1945 (USA-C-545).jpg|thumb|Ibn Saud and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in February 1945]]\n\nAfter his defeat at Mulayda, Abdul-Rahman ibn Faisal went with his family into exile in the deserts of eastern [[Arabia]] among the [[Al Murra]] [[bedouin]]. Soon afterward, however, he found refuge in [[Kuwait]] as a guest of the Kuwaiti [[emir]], [[Mubarak Al Sabah]]. In 1902, Abdul-Rahman's son, [[Ibn Saud|Abdul Aziz]], took on the task of restoring Saudi rule in Riyadh. Supported by a few dozen followers and accompanied by some of his brothers and relatives, Abdul Aziz was able to capture Riyadh's [[Masmak fort]] and kill the governor appointed there by Ibn Rashid. Abdul Aziz, reported to have been barely 20 at the time, was immediately proclaimed ruler in Riyadh. As the new leader of the House of Saud, Abdul Aziz became commonly known from that time onward as \"Ibn Saud\" in Western sources, though he is still called \"Abdul Aziz\" in the Arab world.\n\nIbn Saud spent the next three decades trying to re-establish his family's rule over central Arabia, starting with his native Najd. His chief rivals were the Al Rashid clan in Ha'il, the [[Sharifs of Mecca]] in the [[Hijaz]], and the [[Ottoman Turks]] in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]]. Ibn Saud also had to contend, however, with the descendants of his late uncle [[Saud ibn Faisal]] (later known as the \"Saud al-Kabir\" branch of the family), who posed as the rightful heirs to the throne. Though for a time acknowledging the sovereignty of the [[Ottoman Sultans]] and even taking the title of ''[[pasha]]'', Ibn Saud allied himself to the British, in opposition to the Ottoman-backed Al Rashid. From 1915 to 1927, Ibn Saud's dominions were a protectorate of the [[British Empire]], pursuant to the 1915 [[Treaty of Darin]].\n\nIbn Saud won final victory over the Rashidis in 1921, making him the ruler of most of central Arabia. He consolidated his dominions as the [[Sultanate of Nejd]]. He then turned his attention to the Hijaz, finally conquering it in 1926, just months before the British protectorate ended. For the next five and a half years, he administered the two parts of his dual realm, the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], as separate units.\n\nBy 1932, Ibn Saud had disposed of all his main rivals and consolidated his rule over much of the Arabian Peninsula. He united his dominions into the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] that year. Ibn Saud's father, [[Abdul Rahman ibn Faisal|Abdul Rahman]] retained the honorary title of \"imam.\" In 1937 near [[Dammam]], American surveyors discovered what later proved to be Saudi Arabia's vast [[petroleum|oil]] reserves. Before the discovery of oil, many family members were destitute.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Britain and the Rise of Islam and the House of Saud|author=Abdullah Mohammad Sindi|journal=Kana'an Bulletin|volume =IV|issue=361|date=16 January 2004|pages=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nIbn Saud sired dozens of children by his many wives. He had at most four wives at a time, divorcing many times. He made sure to marry into many of the noble clans and tribes within his territory, including the chiefs of the [[Bani Khalid]], [[Ajman (tribe)|Ajman]], and [[Shammar]] tribes, as well as the [[Al ash-Sheikh]] (descendants of [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]]). He also arranged for his sons and relatives to enter into similar marriages. He appointed his eldest surviving son, [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud]] as [[heir apparent]], to be succeeded by the next eldest son, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]]. The Saudi family became known as the \"royal family,\" and each member, male and female, was accorded the title ''amir'' (\"prince\") or ''amira'' (\"princess\"), respectively.\n\nIbn Saud died in 1953, after having cemented an alliance with the United States in 1945. He is still celebrated officially as the \"Founder,\" and only his direct descendants may take on the title of \"his or her Royal Highness.\"  The date of his recapture of Riyadh in 1902 was chosen to mark Saudi Arabia's centennial in 1999 (according to the Islamic [[lunar calendar]]).\n\nUpon Ibn Saud's death, his son [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud]] assumed the throne without incident, but his lavish spending led to a power struggle with his brother, Crown Prince [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]]. In 1964, the royal family forced Saud to abdicate in favor of Faisal, aided by an edict from the country's grand [[mufti]]. During this period, some of Ibn Saud's younger sons, led by [[Talal ibn Abdul Aziz]], defected to Egypt, calling themselves the \"[[Free Princes]]\" and calling for liberalization and reform, but were later induced to return by Faisal. They were fully pardoned but were also barred from any future positions in government.\n[[File:President and First Lady Obama, With Saudi King Salman, Shake Hands With Members of the Saudi Royal Family.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] offers condolences on death of Saudi King Abdullah, [[Riyadh]], 27 January 2015]]\n\nFaisal was assassinated in 1975 by a nephew, [[Faisal bin Musaid|Faisal ibn Musaid]], who was promptly executed. Another brother, [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|Khalid]], assumed the throne. The next prince in line had actually been [[Muhammad ibn Abdul Aziz|Prince Muhammad]], but he had relinquished his claim to the throne in favor of Khalid, his only full brother.\n\nKhalid died of a heart attack in 1982, and was succeeded by [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]], the eldest of the powerful \"[[Sudairi Seven]]\", so-called because they were all sons of Ibn Saud by his wife [[Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi|Hassa Al Sudairi]]. Fahd did away with the previous royal title of \"his Majesty\" and replaced it with the honorific \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in reference to the two Islamic holy sites in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], in 1986.\n\nA stroke in 1995 left Fahd largely incapacitated. His half-brother, Crown Prince [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] [who was descended on the maternal side from the rival [[Rashidi dynasty|Rashidi]]] , gradually took over most of the king's responsibilities until Fahd's death in August 2005. Abdullah was proclaimed king on the day of Fahd's death and promptly appointed his younger brother, [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz]], the minister of defense and Fahd's \"Second Deputy Prime Minister,\" as the new heir apparent. On 27 March 2009, Abdullah appointed [[Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Nayef]] Interior Minister as his \"second deputy prime minister\" and Crown Prince on 27 October.<ref name='BBC News Oct 27 2011'>{{cite news|title=Saudi Arabia names Prince Nayef as heir to throne|date=27 October 2011|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15487965|work=BBC|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> Sultan died in October 2011 while Nayef died in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] on 15 June 2012.

The King holds almost absolute political power. The King appoints ministers to his cabinet who supervise their respective ministries in his name. The key ministries of Defence, the Interior and Foreign Affairs are usually held by members of the Saud family, as are most of the thirteen regional governorships. Most portfolios, however, such as Finance, Labour, Information, Planning, Petroleum Affairs and Industry, have traditionally been given to commoners, often with junior Al Saud members serving as their deputies. House of Saud family members also hold many of the Kingdom's critical military and governmental departmental posts. Ultimate power in the Kingdom has always rested upon the Al Saud, though support from the [[Ulema]], the merchant community, and the population at large has been key to the maintenance of the royal family's political ''status quo''.\n\nLong-term political and government appointments have occurred, such as those of [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]], who was Foreign Minister almost continuously from 1932 to 1975, [[Abdullah ibn Abdul Aziz|King Abdullah]], who was Commander of the [[Saudi Arabian National Guard|National Guard]] from 1963 to 2010, and former [[Crown prince]] [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz]], who was Minister of Defence and Aviation from 1962 until his death in 2011.  Such terms of service have enabled senior princes to mingle their personal wealth with that of their respective domains. They have often appointed their own sons to senior positions within their own [[fiefdom]]. Examples of these include Prince [[Mutaib bin Abdullah]] as assistant commander in the National Guard until 2010; Prince [[Khalid bin Sultan]] as assistant minister of defence until 2013; Prince Mansour bin Mutaib as assistant minister for Municipal and Rural Affairs until he replaced his father in 2009; and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as assistant minister in the Interior Ministry. In cases, where portfolios have notably substantial budgets, appointments of younger, often full, brothers have been necessary, as deputies or vice ministers, ostensibly to share the wealth and the burdens of responsibility, of each fiefdom. Examples of these include [[Abdul-Rahman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Abdul Rahman]] who was vice minister of defence and aviation under [[Prince Sultan]]; [[Badr bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Badr]], deputy to [[Abdullah ibn Abdul Aziz|King Abdullah]] in the National Guard; [[Sattam bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Sattam]], who was Deputy [[Riyadh]] Governor during [[Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|King Salman]]'s term; and [[Ahmed bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Ahmed]], who held the deputy minister's portfolio under Prince Nayef's interior ministry.\n\nUnlike Western [[royal families]], the Saudi Monarchy has not had a clearly defined [[Line of succession to the Saudi Arabian Throne|order of succession]]. Historically, upon becoming King, the monarch has designated an [[heir apparent]] to the throne who serves as [[Crown Prince]] of the Kingdom. Upon the King's death the Crown Prince becomes King, and during the King's incapacitation the Crown Prince, likewise, assumes power as [[regent]]. Although other members of the Al Saud hold political positions in the Saudi government, it is only the King and Crown Prince who legally constitute the political institutions.\n\n==Succession==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n{{main|Succession to the Saudi Arabian throne}}\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Cyrus Vance meet with Crown Prince Fahd and King Khalid of Saudi Arabia. - NARA - 177434.tif|thumb|U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] meets with King [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|Khalid]] and Crown Prince [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]] in January 1978]]\n\nSuccession has been from brother to brother since the death of the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud was succeeded by his son [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud]]. Saud was succeeded by his brother [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]]. Faisal was succeeded by his brother [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|Khalid]] who, in turn, was succeeded by his brother [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]]. Fahd was succeeded by his brother [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], and Abdullah by his brother [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|Salman]], the current King. Salman appointed his half-brother [[Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Muqrin]] as Crown Prince in January 2015 and removed him in April 2015. Even Abdulaziz's youngest son was to turn 70 in 2015. Abdulaziz, in 1920, had said that the further succession would be from brother to brother, not from father to son.\n[[File:President Trump's Trip Abroad (34784285005).jpg|thumb|Crown Prince [[Muhammad bin Nayef]], Deputy Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud|Mohammad bin Salman]], [[Jared Kushner]], [[Ivanka Trump]], [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman bin Abdulaziz]] and [[Melania Trump]], Riyadh, 20 May 2017]]\nKing Salman ended the brother-to-brother succession and appointed his 56-year-old nephew [[Muhammad bin Nayef]] as Crown Prince in April 2015, thus making the next succession from uncle to nephew. At the same time, King Salman appointed his son, [[Mohammad bin Salman]], as Deputy Crown Prince, thus making the following succession from cousin to cousin, as Mohammad bin Salman is the cousin of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef.  However, in June 2017, Salman elevated Mohammad bin Salman to Crown Prince, following his decision to depose Muhammad bin Nayef of all positions, making his son heir apparent to the throne, and making the next succession father to son, for the first time since 1953, when [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] succeeded his father, the founder of Saudi Arabia, [[Ibn Saud]].<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAmid international outcry over the [[killing of Jamal Khashoggi]], members of Saudi's royal families are distressed over the Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]] becoming the next king.

This period was marked by conquest of neighboring areas and by religious zeal. At its height, the First Saudi State included most of the territory of modern-day [[Saudi Arabia]], and raids by Al Saud's allies and followers reached into [[Yemen Eyalet|Yemen]], [[Oman proper|Oman]], [[Damascus Eyalet|Syria]], and [[Baghdad Eyalet|Iraq]]. Islamic Scholars, particularly [[Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab]] and his descendants, are believed to have played a significant role in Saudi rule during this period. The Saudis and their allies referred to themselves during this period as the ''Muwahhidun'' or ''Ahl al-Tawhid'' (\"the monotheists\"). Later they were referred to as the [[Wahhabism|Wahhabis]], a group of particularly strict, puritanical [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] sect, named for its founder.\n\nLeadership of the Al Saud during the time of their first state passed from father to son without incident. The first imam, [[Muhammad ibn Saud]], was succeeded by his eldest son [[Abdul-Aziz ibn Muhammad ibn Saud|Abdulaziz]] in 1765. In 1802, Abdulaziz led ten thousand Wahhabi soldiers into an attack on the [[Shi'ite]] holy city of [[Karbala]], in what is now southern Iraq and where [[Hussein ibn Ali]], the grandson of the prophet [[Muhammad]] is buried.<ref name=mark/> Led by Abdulaziz, the Wahhabi soldiers killed more than two thousand people, including women and children.<ref name=mark>{{cite book|author=Mark Weston|title=Prophets and princes: Saudi Arabia from Muhammad to the present|year=2008|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0470182574|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EEEFsVYLko4C&pg=PA101&lpg=PA101&dq=wahhabi+sack+of+karbala+1802#v=onepage&q=wahhabi%20sack%20of%20karbala%201802&f=false}}</ref> The soldiers plundered the city, demolishing the massive golden dome above Hussein's tomb and loaded hundreds of camels with weapons, jewelry, coins and other valuable goods.<ref name=mark/>\n\nThe attack on Karbala convinced the Ottomans and the Egyptians that the Saudis were a threat to regional peace.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wayne H.

Abdul-Aziz was in turn succeeded by his son, [[Saud bin Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud|Saud]], under whose rule the Saudi state reached its greatest extent. By the time Saud died in 1814, his son and successor [[Abdullah ibn Saud]] had to contend with an Ottoman-Egyptian invasion in the [[Ottoman\u2013Wahhabi War]] seeking to retake lost [[Ottoman Empire]] territory. The mainly Egyptian force succeeded in defeating Abdullah's forces, taking over the Saudi capital of [[Diriyyah]] in 1818. Abdullah was taken prisoner and was soon beheaded by the Ottomans in Constantinople, putting an end to the First Saudi State. The Egyptians sent many members of the Al Saud clan and other members of the local nobility as prisoners to [[Eyalet of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Constantinople]], and razed the Saudi capital Diriyyah.\n\n===Second Saudi state===\n{{main|Emirate of Nejd}}\n[[File:Flag of the Second Saudi State.svg|thumb|Flag of the Second Saudi State]]\nA few years after the fall of Diriyah in 1818, the Saudis were able to re-establish their authority in [[Najd]], establishing the Emirate of Nejd, commonly known as the Second Saudi State, with its capital in [[Riyadh]].\n\nCompared to the First Saudi State, the second Saudi period was marked by less territorial expansion (it never reconquered the [[Hijaz]] or [['Asir]], for example) and less religious zeal, although the Saudi leaders continued to go by the title of ''imam'' and still employed [[Salafi]] religious scholars. The second state was also marked by severe internal conflicts within the Saudi family, eventually leading to the dynasty's downfall. In all but one instance, succession occurred by assassination or civil war, the exception being the passage of authority from [[Faisal ibn Turki ibn Abdullah Al Saud|Faisal ibn Turki]] to his son Abdullah ibn Faisal ibn Turki.\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\n{{Main|Unification of Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia}}\n{{Politics of Saudi Arabia}}\n[[File:Franklin D. Roosevelt with King Ibn Saud aboard USS Quincy (CA-71) on 14 February 1945 (USA-C-545).jpg|thumb|Ibn Saud and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in February 1945]]\n\nAfter his defeat at Mulayda, Abdul-Rahman ibn Faisal went with his family into exile in the deserts of eastern [[Arabia]] among the [[Al Murra]] [[bedouin]]. Soon afterward, however, he found refuge in [[Kuwait]] as a guest of the Kuwaiti [[emir]], [[Mubarak Al Sabah]]. In 1902, Abdul-Rahman's son, [[Ibn Saud|Abdul Aziz]], took on the task of restoring Saudi rule in Riyadh. Supported by a few dozen followers and accompanied by some of his brothers and relatives, Abdul Aziz was able to capture Riyadh's [[Masmak fort]] and kill the governor appointed there by Ibn Rashid. Abdul Aziz, reported to have been barely 20 at the time, was immediately proclaimed ruler in Riyadh. As the new leader of the House of Saud, Abdul Aziz became commonly known from that time onward as \"Ibn Saud\" in Western sources, though he is still called \"Abdul Aziz\" in the Arab world.\n\nIbn Saud spent the next three decades trying to re-establish his family's rule over central Arabia, starting with his native Najd. His chief rivals were the Al Rashid clan in Ha'il, the [[Sharifs of Mecca]] in the [[Hijaz]], and the [[Ottoman Turks]] in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]]. Ibn Saud also had to contend, however, with the descendants of his late uncle [[Saud ibn Faisal]] (later known as the \"Saud al-Kabir\" branch of the family), who posed as the rightful heirs to the throne. Though for a time acknowledging the sovereignty of the [[Ottoman Sultans]] and even taking the title of ''[[pasha]]'', Ibn Saud allied himself to the British, in opposition to the Ottoman-backed Al Rashid. From 1915 to 1927, Ibn Saud's dominions were a protectorate of the [[British Empire]], pursuant to the 1915 [[Treaty of Darin]].\n\nIbn Saud won final victory over the Rashidis in 1921, making him the ruler of most of central Arabia. He consolidated his dominions as the [[Sultanate of Nejd]]. He then turned his attention to the Hijaz, finally conquering it in 1926, just months before the British protectorate ended. For the next five and a half years, he administered the two parts of his dual realm, the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], as separate units.\n\nBy 1932, Ibn Saud had disposed of all his main rivals and consolidated his rule over much of the Arabian Peninsula. He united his dominions into the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] that year. Ibn Saud's father, [[Abdul Rahman ibn Faisal|Abdul Rahman]] retained the honorary title of \"imam.\" In 1937 near [[Dammam]], American surveyors discovered what later proved to be Saudi Arabia's vast [[petroleum|oil]] reserves. Before the discovery of oil, many family members were destitute.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Britain and the Rise of Islam and the House of Saud|author=Abdullah Mohammad Sindi|journal=Kana'an Bulletin|volume =IV|issue=361|date=16 January 2004|pages=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nIbn Saud sired dozens of children by his many wives. He had at most four wives at a time, divorcing many times. He made sure to marry into many of the noble clans and tribes within his territory, including the chiefs of the [[Bani Khalid]], [[Ajman (tribe)|Ajman]], and [[Shammar]] tribes, as well as the [[Al ash-Sheikh]] (descendants of [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab]]). He also arranged for his sons and relatives to enter into similar marriages. He appointed his eldest surviving son, [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud]] as [[heir apparent]], to be succeeded by the next eldest son, [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]]. The Saudi family became known as the \"royal family,\" and each member, male and female, was accorded the title ''amir'' (\"prince\") or ''amira'' (\"princess\"), respectively.\n\nIbn Saud died in 1953, after having cemented an alliance with the United States in 1945. He is still celebrated officially as the \"Founder,\" and only his direct descendants may take on the title of \"his or her Royal Highness.\"  The date of his recapture of Riyadh in 1902 was chosen to mark Saudi Arabia's centennial in 1999 (according to the Islamic [[lunar calendar]]).\n\nUpon Ibn Saud's death, his son [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud]] assumed the throne without incident, but his lavish spending led to a power struggle with his brother, Crown Prince [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]]. In 1964, the royal family forced Saud to abdicate in favor of Faisal, aided by an edict from the country's grand [[mufti]]. During this period, some of Ibn Saud's younger sons, led by [[Talal ibn Abdul Aziz]], defected to Egypt, calling themselves the \"[[Free Princes]]\" and calling for liberalization and reform, but were later induced to return by Faisal. They were fully pardoned but were also barred from any future positions in government.\n[[File:President and First Lady Obama, With Saudi King Salman, Shake Hands With Members of the Saudi Royal Family.jpg|thumb|U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] offers condolences on death of Saudi King Abdullah, [[Riyadh]], 27 January 2015]]\n\nFaisal was assassinated in 1975 by a nephew, [[Faisal bin Musaid|Faisal ibn Musaid]], who was promptly executed. Another brother, [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|Khalid]], assumed the throne. The next prince in line had actually been [[Muhammad ibn Abdul Aziz|Prince Muhammad]], but he had relinquished his claim to the throne in favor of Khalid, his only full brother.\n\nKhalid died of a heart attack in 1982, and was succeeded by [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]], the eldest of the powerful \"[[Sudairi Seven]]\", so-called because they were all sons of Ibn Saud by his wife [[Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi|Hassa Al Sudairi]]. Fahd did away with the previous royal title of \"his Majesty\" and replaced it with the honorific \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in reference to the two Islamic holy sites in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], in 1986.\n\nA stroke in 1995 left Fahd largely incapacitated. His half-brother, Crown Prince [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] [who was descended on the maternal side from the rival [[Rashidi dynasty|Rashidi]]] , gradually took over most of the king's responsibilities until Fahd's death in August 2005. Abdullah was proclaimed king on the day of Fahd's death and promptly appointed his younger brother, [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz]], the minister of defense and Fahd's \"Second Deputy Prime Minister,\" as the new heir apparent. On 27 March 2009, Abdullah appointed [[Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Nayef]] Interior Minister as his \"second deputy prime minister\" and Crown Prince on 27 October.<ref name='BBC News Oct 27 2011'>{{cite news|title=Saudi Arabia names Prince Nayef as heir to throne|date=27 October 2011|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15487965|work=BBC|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> Sultan died in October 2011 while Nayef died in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] on 15 June 2012.

The King holds almost absolute political power. The King appoints ministers to his cabinet who supervise their respective ministries in his name. The key ministries of Defence, the Interior and Foreign Affairs are usually held by members of the Saud family, as are most of the thirteen regional governorships. Most portfolios, however, such as Finance, Labour, Information, Planning, Petroleum Affairs and Industry, have traditionally been given to commoners, often with junior Al Saud members serving as their deputies. House of Saud family members also hold many of the Kingdom's critical military and governmental departmental posts. Ultimate power in the Kingdom has always rested upon the Al Saud, though support from the [[Ulema]], the merchant community, and the population at large has been key to the maintenance of the royal family's political ''status quo''.\n\nLong-term political and government appointments have occurred, such as those of [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]], who was Foreign Minister almost continuously from 1932 to 1975, [[Abdullah ibn Abdul Aziz|King Abdullah]], who was Commander of the [[Saudi Arabian National Guard|National Guard]] from 1963 to 2010, and former [[Crown prince]] [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz]], who was Minister of Defence and Aviation from 1962 until his death in 2011.  Such terms of service have enabled senior princes to mingle their personal wealth with that of their respective domains. They have often appointed their own sons to senior positions within their own [[fiefdom]]. Examples of these include Prince [[Mutaib bin Abdullah]] as assistant commander in the National Guard until 2010; Prince [[Khalid bin Sultan]] as assistant minister of defence until 2013; Prince Mansour bin Mutaib as assistant minister for Municipal and Rural Affairs until he replaced his father in 2009; and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as assistant minister in the Interior Ministry. In cases, where portfolios have notably substantial budgets, appointments of younger, often full, brothers have been necessary, as deputies or vice ministers, ostensibly to share the wealth and the burdens of responsibility, of each fiefdom. Examples of these include [[Abdul-Rahman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Abdul Rahman]] who was vice minister of defence and aviation under [[Prince Sultan]]; [[Badr bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Badr]], deputy to [[Abdullah ibn Abdul Aziz|King Abdullah]] in the National Guard; [[Sattam bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Sattam]], who was Deputy [[Riyadh]] Governor during [[Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|King Salman]]'s term; and [[Ahmed bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Ahmed]], who held the deputy minister's portfolio under Prince Nayef's interior ministry.\n\nUnlike Western [[royal families]], the Saudi Monarchy has not had a clearly defined [[Line of succession to the Saudi Arabian Throne|order of succession]]. Historically, upon becoming King, the monarch has designated an [[heir apparent]] to the throne who serves as [[Crown Prince]] of the Kingdom. Upon the King's death the Crown Prince becomes King, and during the King's incapacitation the Crown Prince, likewise, assumes power as [[regent]]. Although other members of the Al Saud hold political positions in the Saudi government, it is only the King and Crown Prince who legally constitute the political institutions.\n\n==Succession==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n{{main|Succession to the Saudi Arabian throne}}\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Cyrus Vance meet with Crown Prince Fahd and King Khalid of Saudi Arabia. - NARA - 177434.tif|thumb|U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] meets with King [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|Khalid]] and Crown Prince [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]] in January 1978]]\n\nSuccession has been from brother to brother since the death of the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud was succeeded by his son [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud]]. Saud was succeeded by his brother [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]]. Faisal was succeeded by his brother [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|Khalid]] who, in turn, was succeeded by his brother [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Fahd]]. Fahd was succeeded by his brother [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], and Abdullah by his brother [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|Salman]], the current King. Salman appointed his half-brother [[Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Muqrin]] as Crown Prince in January 2015 and removed him in April 2015. Even Abdulaziz's youngest son was to turn 70 in 2015. Abdulaziz, in 1920, had said that the further succession would be from brother to brother, not from father to son.\n[[File:President Trump's Trip Abroad (34784285005).jpg|thumb|Crown Prince [[Muhammad bin Nayef]], Deputy Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud|Mohammad bin Salman]], [[Jared Kushner]], [[Ivanka Trump]], [[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman bin Abdulaziz]] and [[Melania Trump]], Riyadh, 20 May 2017]]\nKing Salman ended the brother-to-brother succession and appointed his 56-year-old nephew [[Muhammad bin Nayef]] as Crown Prince in April 2015, thus making the next succession from uncle to nephew. At the same time, King Salman appointed his son, [[Mohammad bin Salman]], as Deputy Crown Prince, thus making the following succession from cousin to cousin, as Mohammad bin Salman is the cousin of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Nayef.  However, in June 2017, Salman elevated Mohammad bin Salman to Crown Prince, following his decision to depose Muhammad bin Nayef of all positions, making his son heir apparent to the throne, and making the next succession father to son, for the first time since 1953, when [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] succeeded his father, the founder of Saudi Arabia, [[Ibn Saud]].<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAmid international outcry over the [[killing of Jamal Khashoggi]], members of Saudi's royal families are distressed over the Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]] becoming the next king.

towards the overall World Cup totals.\n\nAll distance races, included individual stages in Tour de Ski and in World Cup Final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the distance standings. All sprint races, including the sprint races during the Tour de Ski and the first race of the World Cup final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the sprint standings.\n\nIn mass start races bonus points are awarded to the first 10 at each bonus station.\n\nThe Nations Cup ranking is calculated by adding each country's individual competitors' scores and scores from team events. Relay events count double (see World Cup final positions), with only one team counting towards the total, while in team sprint events two teams contribute towards the total, with the usual World Cup points (100 to winning team, etc.) awarded.\n\n==Achievements==\n;First World Cup career victory:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Men\n* {{flagathlete|[[Tim Tscharnke]]|GER}}, 23, in his 4th season \u2013 the WC 4 (15&nbsp;km C Mass Start) in Canmore;

towards the overall World Cup totals.\n\nAll distance races, included individual stages in Tour de Ski and in World Cup Final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the distance standings. All sprint races, including the sprint races during the Tour de Ski and the first race of the World Cup final (which counts as 50% of a normal race), count towards the sprint standings.\n\nIn mass start races bonus points are awarded to the first 10 at each bonus station.\n\nThe Nations Cup ranking is calculated by adding each country's individual competitors' scores and scores from team events. Relay events count double (see World Cup final positions), with only one team counting towards the total, while in team sprint events two teams contribute towards the total, with the usual World Cup points (100 to winning team, etc.) awarded.\n\n==Achievements==\n;First World Cup career victory:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Men\n* {{flagathlete|[[Tim Tscharnke]]|GER}}, 23, in his 4th season \u2013 the WC 4 (15&nbsp;km C Mass Start) in Canmore; his first podium\n{{col-2}}\n;Women\n* {{flagathlete|[[Mona-Liisa Malvalehto]]|FIN}}, 29, in her 12th season \u2013 the WC 8 (Sprint C) in Liberec; her first podium\n{{col-end}}\n\n;First World Cup podium:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Men\n* {{flagathlete|[[Sjur R\u00f8the]]|NOR}}, 24, in his 4th season - no. 2 in the WC 4 (15&nbsp;km C Mass Start) in Canmore\n{{col-2}}\n;Women\n* {{flagathlete|[[Anne Kyll\u00f6nen]]|FIN}}, 25, in her 6th season - no. 2 in the WC 4 (10&nbsp;km C Mass Start) in Canmore\n* {{flagathlete|[[Elizabeth Stephen]]|USA}}, 23, in her 5th season - no. 2 in the WC 7 (9 km F Final Climb) in Val di Fiemme\n* {{flagathlete|[[Nicole Fessel]]|GER}}, 30, in her 11th season - no. 3 in the WC 11 (15&nbsp;km Skiathlon) in Sochi\n{{col-end}}\n\n;Victories in this World Cup (all-time number of victories as of 2012/13 season in parentheses):\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Men\n* {{flagathlete|[[Petter Northug]]|NOR}}, 9 (33) first places\n* {{flagathlete|[[Alexey Poltoranin]]|KAZ}}, 4 (6) first places\n* {{flagathlete|[[Emil J\u00f6nsson]]|SWE}} 3 (13) first places\n* {{flagathlete|[[Alexander Legkov]]|RUS}}, 3 (8) first places\n* {{flagathlete|[[Maxim Vylegzhanin]]|RUS}}, 2 (4) first places\n* {{flagathlete|[[Finn H\u00e5gen Krogh]]|NOR}}, 2 (3) first places\n* {{flagathlete|[[Dario Cologna]]|SUI}}, 1 (11) first place\n* {{flagathlete|[[Eldar R\u00f8nning]]|NOR}}, 1 (11) first place\n* {{flagathlete|[[Marcus Hellner]]|SWE}}, 1 (4) first place\n* {{flagathlete|[[Nikita Kriukov]]|RUS}}, 1 (3) first place\n* {{flagathlete|[[Martin Johnsrud Sundby]]|NOR}}, 1 (2) first place\n* {{flagathlete|[[Maurice Manificat]]|FRA}}, 1 (2) first place\n* {{flagathlete|[[Johan Olsson (skier)|Johan Olsson]]|SWE}}, 1 (5) first place\n* {{flagathlete|[[Teodor Peterson]]|SWE}}, 1 (3) first place\n* {{flagathlete|[[Tim Tscharnke]]|GER}}, 1 (1) first place\n{{col-2}}\n;Women\n* {{flagathlete|[[Justyna Kowalczyk]]|POL}}, 11 (44) first places\n* {{flagathlete|[[Marit Bj\u00f8rgen]]|NOR}}, 9 (78) first places\n* {{flagathlete|[[Kikkan Randall]]|USA}} 5 (10) first places\n* {{flagathlete|[[Therese Johaug]]|NOR}}, 4 (13) first places\n* {{flagathlete|[[Maiken Caspersen Falla]]|NOR}}, 1 (2) first place\n* {{flagathlete|[[Mona-Liisa Malvalehto]]|FIN}}, 1 (1) first place\n* {{flagathlete|[[Kristin St\u00f8rmer Steira]]|NOR}}, 1 (3) first place\n{{col-end}}\n\n <!-- \n==Retirements==\nFollowing are notable athletes who announced their retirement:\n -->\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{FIS Cross-Country World Cup seasons}}\n{{Wintersport season 2012\u201313}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2012-13 FIS Cross-Country World Cup}}\n[[Category:2012\u201313 FIS Cross-Country World Cup| ]]\n[[Category:FIS Cross-Country World Cup seasons]]\n[[Category:2013 in cross-country skiing|World Cup 2012-13]]\n[[Category:2012 in cross-country skiing|World Cup 2012-13]]\n[[Category:Qualification events for the 2014 Winter Olympics]]\n[[Category:Test events for the 2014 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games|Cross Country]]\n", "name_user": "Reitimwinkl", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDistance", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%E2%80%9313_FIS_Cross-Country_World_Cup"}
