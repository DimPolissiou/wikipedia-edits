He was quickly hired by the then-pirate radio station [[Kiss (UK radio station)|Kiss]]. He began his show with [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] in October 1997. When he first arrived, his show went out between 17:00 and 19:00 on Saturday evenings, ahead of [[Danny Rampling]]'s show. Started \"Naughty but nice\" fridays at the Crystal Rooms in Hereford. Remained resident DJ for many years. From 31 July 2004, after the departure of [[Seb Fontaine]] from the station, his show was moved to between 19:00 and 21:00 on Saturday nights, ahead of [[Tim Westwood]]. The show was widely advertised as, \"The UK's Saturday Warmup\", or \"The Weekend Warm-Up\". The show kept this slot until September 2007.\n\nDuring those years, his music policy ranged from playing commercial to underground tracks, and much in between. The first segment of the show were taken by the Cut-Up Boys, who did a five or ten-minute mix featuring several dance tracks and a cappella tracks playing simultaneously. The rest of the first hour was generally taken up by [[house music]] and the second hour featured [[trance music]], although if they were broadcasting the show outside the studio, the music might vary.\n\nIn September 2007, the show was moved to 01:00 to 03:00 every Saturday morning. Because of his DJ commitments on Friday evenings, his show was now pre-recorded instead of being broadcast live. From September 2008, the show was moved forward by 2 hours to 23:00 to 01:00 every Friday evening. The reason for the move was the departure of [[Dave Pearce]], whose Dance Anthems show was moved to [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]. His show attracted a wide audience from around the world due to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]'s online internet connections and the [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] network in the United States and Canada. Through the radio show, he was responsible for launching many popular [[Trance music|trance]] tunes and acts in the UK, and was a pioneer for commercial contemporary dance music. Many people send their unreleased tracks to him. According to his own website, during the time when his show was being produced, he received between 250-300 promos per week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.judgejules.net/|title=The Official Judge Jules Site|website=Judgejules.net|accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref> His Radio 1 show was produced by independent production company [[Somethin' Else Sound Directions Ltd.|Somethin' Else]].\n\nO'Riordan was also a substitute presenter for the [[Essential Mix]], which included hosting the [[Benga (musician)|Benga]] mix in 2008.

He was quickly hired by the then-pirate radio station [[Kiss (UK radio station)|Kiss]]. He began his show with [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] in October 1997. When he first arrived, his show went out between 17:00 and 19:00 on Saturday evenings, ahead of [[Danny Rampling]]'s show. Started \"Naughty but nice\" fridays at the Crystal Rooms in Hereford. Remained resident DJ for many years. From 31 July 2004, after the departure of [[Seb Fontaine]] from the station, his show was moved to between 19:00 and 21:00 on Saturday nights, ahead of [[Tim Westwood]]. The show was widely advertised as, \"The UK's Saturday Warmup\", or \"The Weekend Warm-Up\". The show kept this slot until September 2007.\n\nDuring those years, his music policy ranged from playing commercial to underground tracks, and much in between. The first segment of the show were taken by the Cut-Up Boys, who did a five or ten-minute mix featuring several dance tracks and a cappella tracks playing simultaneously. The rest of the first hour was generally taken up by [[house music]] and the second hour featured [[trance music]], although if they were broadcasting the show outside the studio, the music might vary.\n\nIn September 2007, the show was moved to 01:00 to 03:00 every Saturday morning. Because of his DJ commitments on Friday evenings, his show was now pre-recorded instead of being broadcast live. From September 2008, the show was moved forward by 2 hours to 23:00 to 01:00 every Friday evening. The reason for the move was the departure of [[Dave Pearce]], whose Dance Anthems show was moved to [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]. His show attracted a wide audience from around the world due to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]'s online internet connections and the [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] network in the United States and Canada. Through the radio show, he was responsible for launching many popular [[Trance music|trance]] tunes and acts in the UK, and was a pioneer for commercial contemporary dance music. Many people send their unreleased tracks to him. According to his own website, during the time when his show was being produced, he received between 250-300 promos per week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.judgejules.net/|title=The Official Judge Jules Site|website=Judgejules.net|accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref> His Radio 1 show was produced by independent production company [[Somethin' Else Sound Directions Ltd.|Somethin' Else]].\n\nO'Riordan was also a substitute presenter for the [[Essential Mix]], which included hosting the [[Benga (musician)|Benga]] mix in 2008.

This track was eventually released, with remixes, on the Maelstrom Records label in 2007. O'Riordan has also released two albums via this label, \"Proven Worldwide\" in 2006 and \"Bring The Noise\" in 2009. Elsewhere, he has collaborated several times with Paul Masterson under the [[Hi-Gate]] name.

The show debuted at The Plug in Sheffield on Saturday 22 March, with four further dates announced in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol.

In 2014, Eden nightclub was rebranded \"Gatecrasher\" and Judgement Fridays moved over the road to Es Paradis and combined with the Fiesta del Agua (water party). In 2015, the \"Gatecrasher\" brand had disappeared from Eden and the nightclub was re-launched with a new logo, this also saw the return of O'Riordan's night, now branded \"Judgement\". Previously advertised as \"[[Sant Antoni de Portmany|San Antonio's]] busiest night\" it was later advertised as \"San Antonio's most legendary night\".

The mixer is plugged into a [[PA system]] for live events and/or broadcasting equipment (if the DJ is performing on radio, TV or [[Internet radio]]) so that a wider audience can hear the turntablist's music. Turntablists manipulate records on a turntable by moving the record with their hand to cue the stylus to exact points on a record, and by touching or moving the platter or record to stop, slow down, speed up or, spin the record backwards, or moving the turntable platter back and forth (the popular rhythmic \"[[scratching]]\" effect which is a key part of [[hip hop music]]), all while using a [[DJ mixer]]'s crossfader control and the mixer's gain and equalization controls to adjust the sound and level of each turntable. Turntablists typically use two or more turntables and headphones to cue up desired start points on different records.\n\nTurntablists, who are often called [[DJ]]s (or \"deejays\"), generally prefer [[direct-drive turntable]]s over [[Belt-drive turntable|belt-driven]] or other types, because the belt can be stretched or damaged by \"scratching\" and other turntable manipulation such as slowing down a record, whereas a direct drive turntable can be stopped, slowed down, or spun backwards without damaging the electric motor. The word ''turntablist'' was originated by Luis \"[[DJ Disk]]\" Quintanilla (Primus, [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]]).  After a phone conversation with Disk, it was later popularised in 1995 by [[DJ Babu]]<ref>Newman, Mark \"Markski\" (January 3, 2003). [http://downloads.pedestrian.info/PedestrianHistoryofTurntablism.pdf ''History of Turntablism''.]</ref> to describe the difference between a DJ who simply plays and mixes records and one who performs by physically manipulating the records, stylus, turntables, turntable speed controls and mixer to produce new sounds. The new term coincided with the resurgence of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] DJing in the 1990s.\n\n[[John Oswald (composer)|John Oswald]] described the art: \"A phonograph in the hands of a 'hiphop/scratch' artist who plays a record like an electronic [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] with a [[Stylus#Use in music recording and reproduction|phonographic needle]] as a [[plectrum]], produces sounds which are unique and ''not'' reproduced\u2014the record player becomes a musical instrument.\"<ref name=\"Cox2004\">{{cite book |last=Oswald |first=John |authorlink=John Oswald (composer)|chapter=Bettered by the Borrower: The Ethics of Musical Debt |editor=Christopher Cox and Daniel Warner |title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music |publisher=The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc |year=2004 | isbn=0-8264-1615-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgDgCOSHPysC&pg=PA132 |page=132}}</ref> Some turntablists use turntable techniques like [[beatmatching|beat mixing/matching]], [[scratching]], and [[beat juggling]]. Some turntablists seek to have themselves recognized as traditional musicians capable of interacting and [[musical improvisation|improvising]] with other performers. Depending on the records and tracks selected by the DJ and his/her turntablist style (e.g., [[hip hop music]]), a turntablist can create rhythmic accompaniment, percussion breaks, [[bassline]]s or beat loops, atmospheric \"pads\", \"stabs\" of sudden chords or interwoven melodic lines.\n\n==History==\n\n===Precursors===\n{{Main|Recording studio as an instrument}}\nThe use of the turntable as a [[musical instrument]] has its roots dating back to the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s when [[musique concr\u00e8te]] composers did experiments with audio equipment. [[Experimental music|Experimental]] composers (such as [[John Cage]], [[Halim El-Dabh]], and [[Pierre Schaeffer]]) used them to [[sampling (music)|sample]] and create music that was entirely produced by the turntable. Cage's ''[[Imaginary Landscape No. 1]]'' (1939) is composed for two variable speed turntables, frequency recordings, muted piano and [[cymbal]]. [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]] experimented with turntables even earlier in 1930, though he never formally produced any works using them. Though this school of thought and practice is not directly linked to the 1970s-2010 definition of turntablism within hip hop and DJ culture, it has had an influence on modern experimental sonic/artists such as [[Christian Marclay]], [[Janek Schaefer]], [[Otomo Yoshihide]], and [[Philip Jeck]]. However, turntablism as it is known today did not surface until the development of [[hip hop]] in the 1970s.\n\nExamples of turntable effects can also be found on popular records produced in the 1960s and 1970s.

[[Kool Herc]] (a Jamaican DJ who immigrated to New York City), [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]] are widely credited for having cemented the now established role of DJ as hip hop's foremost instrumentalist.<ref name=\"Hansen2000\">Hansen, Kjetil Falkenberg (2000). [http://www.speech.kth.se/~kjetil/files/papers/2000-NTNU-Hansen_Turntablemusic.pdf ''Turntable Music'']. Norway: NTNU and Sweden: KTH, p. 4</ref> Kool Herc's invention of [[Break (music)|break-beat]] DJing is generally regarded as the foundational development in hip hop history, as it gave rise to all other elements of the genre. His influence on the concept of \"DJ as turntablist\" is equally profound.\n\nTo understand the significance of this achievement, it is important to first define the \"[[break (music)|break]].\" Briefly, the \"break\" of a song is a musical fragment only seconds in length, which typically takes the form of an \"interlude\" in which all or most of the music stops except for the percussion. Kool Herc introduced the break-beat technique as a way of extending the break indefinitely. This is done by buying two of the same record, finding the break on each record, and switching from one to the other using the DJ mixer: e.g., as record ''A'' plays, the DJ quickly backtracks to the same break on record ''B'', which will again take the place of ''A'' at a specific moment where the audience will not notice that the DJ has switched records. Using that idea, Grandmaster Flash elaborated on Kool Herc's invention of break-beat DJing and came up with the [[Grandmaster Flash#Innovations|quick-mix theory]], in which Flash sectioned off a part of the record like a [[Clock face|clock]].<ref>[Chang, Jeff. ''Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation''. Picador, 2005, p 113.]</ref> He described it as being \"...like cutting, the backspin, and the double-back.\" <ref>[Chang 2005, p. 113]</ref>\n\nKool Herc's revolutionary techniques set the course for the development of turntablism as an art form in significant ways. Most important, however, he developed a new form of DJing that did not consist of just playing and mixing records one after the other. The type of DJ that specializes in mixing a set is well respected for his/her own set of unique skills, but playlist mixing is still DJing in the traditional sense. Kool Herc instead originated the idea of ''creating'' a sequence for his own purposes, introducing the idea of the DJ as the \"feature\" of parties, whose performance on any given night would be different than on another night, because the music would be created by the DJ, mixing a bassline from one song with a beat from another song. The DJ would be examined critically by the crowd on both a technical and entertainment level.\n\n[[Grand Wizzard Theodore]], an apprentice of Flash, who accidentally isolated the most recognizable technique of turntablism: [[scratching]]. He put his hand on a record one day, to silence the music on the turntable while his mother was calling out to him and thus accidentally discovered the sound of scratching by moving the record back and forth under the [[stylus]]. Though Theodore discovered scratching, it was Flash who helped push the early concept and showcase it to the public, in his live shows and on recordings. DJ [[Grand Mixer DXT]] is also credited with furthering the concept of scratching by practicing the rhythmic scratching of a record on one or more turntables (often two), using different velocities to alter the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of the note or sound on the recording (Alberts 2002). DXT appeared (as DST) on [[Herbie Hancock]]'s hit song \"[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]].\"<ref name=Hansen2000/> These early pioneers cemented the fundamental practice that would later become the emerging turntablist art form. Scratching would during the 1980s become a staple of hip hop music, being used by producers and DJs on records and in live shows. By the end of the 1980s it was very common to hear scratching on a record, generally as part of the chorus of a track or within its production.\n\nOn stage the DJ would provide the music for the MCs to rhyme and rap to, scratching records during the performance and showcasing his or her skills alongside the verbal skills of the MC. The most well known example of this 'equation' of MCs and DJ is probably [[Run-D.M.C.]] who were composed of two MCs and one DJ. The DJ, [[Jam Master Jay]], was an integral part of the group since his turntablism was critical to Run DMC's productions and performances. While Flash and Bambaataa were using the turntable to explore repetition, alter rhythm and create the instrumental stabs and punch phrasing that would come to characterize the sound of hip hop, Grandmaster DST was busy cutting \"real\" musicians on their own turf. His scratching on Herbie Hancock's 1983 single, \"Rockit,\" makes it perhaps the most influential DJ track of them all \u2013 even more than (Grandmaster Flash's) \"[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel|Wheels of Steel]],\" it established the DJ as the star of the record, even if he wasn't the frontman.  Compared to \"Rockit,\" [[West Street Mob]]'s \"Break Dancin' \u2013 Electric Boogie\" (1983) was punk negation. As great as \"Break Dancin'\" was, though, it highlighted the limited tonal range of scratching, which was in danger of becoming a short-lived fad like [[Human beatboxing|human beat-boxing]] until the emergence of Code Money's DJ Brethren from Philadelphia in the mid-1980s.\n\nDespite New York's continued pre-eminence in the hip-hop world, scratch DJing was modernized less than 100 miles down the road in [[Philadelphia]], where the climate for the return of the DJ was created by inventing transformer scratching. Developed by [[DJ Spinbad]], [[DJ Cash Money]] and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], transforming was basically clicking the fader on and off while moving a block of sound (a riff or a short verbal phrase) across the stylus. Expanding the tonal as well as rhythmic possibilities of scratching, the transformer scratch epitomized the chopped-up aesthetic of hip hop culture. Hip hop was starting to become big money and the cult of personality started to take over. Hip hop became very much at the service of the rapper and Cash Money and DJ Jazzy Jeff were accorded maybe one track on an album \u2013 for example, DJ Jazzy Jeff's \"[[Rock the House (album)|A Touch of Jazz]]\" (1987) and \"[[He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper|Jazzy's in the House]]\" (1988) and Cash Money's \"The Music Maker\" (1988). Other crucial DJ tracks from this period include [[Tuff Crew]]'s DJ Too Tuff's \"Behold the Detonator\"  \"Soul Food\" (both 1989),\" and [[Gang Starr]]'s \"[[DJ Premier]] in Deep Concentration\" (1990).\n\n===Decline in role of DJ in hip hop===\nThe appearance of turntablists and the birth of turntablism was prompted by one major factor \u2013 the disappearance or downplaying of the role of the DJ in hip-hop groups, on records and in live shows at the turn of the 1990s. This disappearance has been widely documented in books and documentaries (among them ''[[Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America|Black Noise]]'' and ''[[Scratch: The Movie]]''), and was linked to the increased use of [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT tapes]] and other studio techniques that would ultimately push the DJ further away from the original hip-hop equation of the MC as the vocalist and the DJ as the music provider alongside the producer. This push and disappearance of the DJ meant that the practices of the DJ, such as scratching, went back underground and were cultivated and built upon by a generation of people who grew up with hip hop, DJs and scratching. By the mid-90s the disappearance of the DJ in hip hop had created a sub-culture which would come to be known as turntablism and which focused entirely on the DJ utilizing his turntables and a mixer to manipulate sounds and create music. By pushing the practice of DJing away, hip hop created the grounds for this sub-culture to evolve.\n\n===Coining of terms===\nThe origin of the terms turntablist and turntablism are widely contested and argued about, but over the years some facts have been established by various documentaries (''Battlesounds'', [[Doug Pray]]'s ''[[Scratch (2001 film)|Scratch]]''), books (DJ Culture), conferences (Skratchcon 2000) and interviews in online and printed magazines. These facts are that the origins of the words most likely lay with practitioners on the US West Coast, centered on the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Some claim that [[DJ Disk]], a member of the [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]], was the first to coin the term, others claim that DJ Babu, a member of the [[Beat Junkies]], was responsible for coining and spreading the term turntablist after inscribing it on his mixtapes and passing them around. Another claim credits DJ Supreme, 1991 World Supremacy Champion and DJ for [[Lauryn Hill]]. The truth most likely lies somewhere in between all these facts.\n\nIn an interview with the ''Spin Science'' online resource in 2005, DJ Babu added the following comments about the birth and spread of the term:\n\n{{quote|It was around 95, I was heavily into the whole battling thing, working on the tables constantly, mastering new techniques and scratches...[I] made this mixtape called \"Comprehension,\" and on there was a track called \"Turntablism\" which featured [[Melo-D]] and D-Styles. And this is part of where this whole thing about turntablist came from. This was a time where all these new techniques were coming out, like flares and stuff, and there were probably 20 people or so, in around California between Frisco and LA, who knew about these. So we worked on them, talked about it and kicked about the ideas that these techniques and new ways of scratching gave us.}}{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Mid-to late 1990s===\nBy the mid to late 1990s the terms \"turntablism\" and \"turntablist\" had become established and accepted to define the practice and practitioner of using turntables and a mixer to create or manipulate sounds and music. This could be done by scratching a record or manipulating the rhythms on the record either by drumming, looping or beat juggling. The decade of the 1990s is also important in shaping the turntablist art form and culture as it saw the emergence of pioneering artists ([[Mix Master Mike]], [[DJ Q-Bert]], DJ Quest, [[DJ Krush]], [[A-Trak]], Ricci Rucker, Mike Boo, Pumpin' Pete, Prime Cuts) and crews (Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Beat Junkies, The Allies, [[X-Ecutioners]]), record labels ([[Asphodel Records|Asphodel]]), DJ Battles ([[DMC World DJ Championships|DMC]]) and the evolution of scratching and other turntablism practices such as Beat Juggling which are viewable in the IDA (International DJ Association/ITF) World Finals.\n\n===Techniques ===\nMore sophisticated methods of scratching were developed during that decade, with crews and individual DJs concentrating on the manipulation of the record in time with the manipulation of the cross fader on the mixer to create new rhythms and [[sonic artifact]]s with a variety of sounds. The evolution of scratching from a fairly simple sound and simple rhythmic cadences to more complicated sounds and more intricate rhythmical patterns allowed the practitioners to further evolve what could be done with scratching musically. These new ways of scratching were all given names, from [[flare (scratch)|flare]] to [[crab (scratch)|crab]] or [[orbit (scratch)|orbit]], and spread as DJs taught each other, practiced together or just showed off their new techniques to other DJs. Alongside the evolution of [[scratching]], other practices such as drumming (or scratch drumming) and [[beat juggling]] were also evolved significantly during the 1990s.\n\nBeat juggling was invented by [[Steve Dee]], a member of the X-Men (later renamed [[X-Ecutioners]]) crew. Beat juggling essentially involves the manipulation of two identical or different drum patterns on two different turntables via the mixer to create a new pattern. A simple example would be to use two copies of the same drum pattern to evolve the pattern by doubling the snares, syncopating the drum kick, adding rhythm and variation to the existing pattern. From this concept, which Steve Dee showcased in the early 1990s at DJ battles, Beat Juggling evolved throughout the decade to the point where by the end of it, it had become an intricate technique to create entirely new \"beats\" and rhythms out of existing, pre-recorded ones. These were now not just limited to using drum patterns, but could also consist of other sounds \u2013 the ultimate aim being to create a new rhythm out of the pre-recorded existing ones. While beat juggling is not as popular as scratching due to the more demanding rhythmical knowledge it requires, it has proved popular within DJ battles and in certain compositional situations.\n\n===Studies===\nOne of the earliest academic studies of turntablism (White 1996) argued for its designation as a legitimate electronic musical instrument\u2014a manual analog sampler\u2014and described turntable techniques such as backspinning, cutting, scratching and blending as basic tools for most hip hop DJs. White's study suggests the proficient hip-hop DJ must possess similar kinds of skills as those required by trained musicians, not limited to a sense of timing, hand\u2013eye coordination, technical competence and musical creativity. By the year 2000, turntablism and turntablists had become widely publicized and accepted in the mainstream and within hip hop as valid artists. Through this recognition came further evolution.\n\n===Evolution===\nThis evolution took many shapes and forms: some continued to concentrate on the foundations of the art form and its original links to hip hop culture, some became producers utilizing the skills they'd learnt as turntablists and incorporating those into their productions, some concentrated more on the DJing aspect of the art form by combining turntablist skills with the trademark skills of club DJs, while others explored alternative routes in utilizing the turntable as an instrument or production tool solely for the purpose of making music \u2013 either by using solely the turntable or by incorporating it into the production process alongside tools such as drum machines, samplers, computer software, and so on.  Digital turntablism techniques later was coined into a term called controllerism, which inspired a movement of new digital DJs such as DJ Buddy Holly and Moldover.  DJ Buddy and Moldover went on to create a song called \"Controllerism\" that pays homage to the sound of digitally emulated turntablism.\n[[File:Aron Rcm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DJ Aron Scott DJing a set for a French radio station. He is using digital [[CDJ]] decks instead of phonograph turntables.]]\n\nNew DJs, turntablists and crews owe a distinct debt to [[old school hip hop|old-school]] DJs like [[Kool DJ Herc]], [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and other DJs of [[the golden age of hip hop]], who originally developed many of the concepts and techniques that evolved into modern turntablism. Within the realm of hip hop, notable modern turntablists are the cinematic{{when defined as|date=December 2017}} [[DJ Shadow]], who influenced [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]] and [[RJD2]], among others,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} and the experimental [[DJ Spooky]], whose ''Optometry'' albums showed that the turntablist can perfectly fit within a jazz setting.{{according to whom|date=December 2017}} [[Mix Master Mike]] was a founding member of the influential turntablist group [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]] (begun in 1989 as Shadow of the Prophet) and later DJ for the [[Beastie Boys]]. [[Cut Chemist]], [[DJ Nu-Mark]], and [[Kid Koala]] are also known{{by whom|date=December 2017}} as virtuosi of the turntables.\n\n==Techniques==\n\n===Chopped and screwed===\n\n{{Main|Chopped and screwed}}\nStarting in the 1990s in the Southern United States and burgeoning in the 2000s, a meta-genre of hip hop called \"[[chopped and screwed]]\" became a significant and popular form of turntablism. Often utilizing a greater variety of [[vinyl emulation software]] rather than normal turntables, \"chopped and screwed\" stood out from previous standards of turntablism in its slowing of the pitch and tempo (\"screwing\") and syncopated beat skipping (\"chopping\"), among other added effects of sound manipulation.\n\n[[DJ Screw]] of Texas, innovated the art of chopping and screwing coining the phrase \"chopped n screwed,\" taking original contemporary hit records and replaying them in the \"chopped n screwed\" art form.  This gained a very large following finally paving the way for small, independent rap labels to turn a decent profit. However, it is thought by many that DJ Michael Price started slowing down vinyl recordings before the era of DJ Screw.\n\nThis form of turntablism, which is usually applied to prior studio recordings (in the form of custom mixtapes) and is not prominent as a feature of live performances, de-emphasizes the role of the rapper, singer or other vocalist by distorting the vocalist's voice along with the rest of the recording. Arguably, this combination of distortion and audial effects against the original recording grants greater freedom of improvisation to the DJ than did the previous forms of turntablism. Via the ChopNotSlop movement, \"Chopped and screwed\" has also been applied to other genres of music such as R&B and rock music, thus transcending its roots within the hip-hop genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/slow-life-and-fast-death-dj-screw|title=The Slow Life and Fast Death of DJ Screw|author=|date=January 20, 2013|website=texasmonthly.com}}</ref><ref>[[DJ Screw]]</ref>\n\n===Transform===\n[[File:N.A.S.A. (DJ Zegon & Squeak E. Clean).jpg|thumb|right|200px|N.A.S.A. (DJ Zegon & Squeak E. Clean). The DJ on the left can be seen cuing up a part of a record by listening to the cue channel on one of his headphones.]]\n\nA '''transform''' is a type of scratch used by turntablists.  It is made from a combination of moving the record on the turntable by hand and repeated movement of the [[crossfader]]. The name, which has been associated with [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/04/28/hip-hop-family-tree-dj-jazzy.html|title=Hip Hop Family Tree: DJ Jazzy Jeff / Boing Boing|author=|date=|website=boingboing.net}}</ref> comes from its similarity to the sound made by the [[robot]]s in the 1980s [[cartoon]], ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]''.\n\n===Tear===\nA '''tear''' is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is made from moving the record on the turntable by hand. The tear is much like a [[Scratching#Sophisticated techniques|baby scratch]] in that one does not need the fader to perform it, but unlike a baby scratch, when the DJ pulls the record back he or she pauses his or her hand for a split second in the middle of the stroke. The result is one forward sound and two distinct backward sounds. This scratch can also be performed by doing the opposite and placing the pause on the forward stroke instead. A basic tear is usually performed with the crossfader open the entire time, but it can also be combined with other scratches such as [[Flare (scratch)|flares]] for example by doing tears with the record hand and cutting the sound in and out with the fader hand.\n\n===Orbit===\nAn '''orbit''' is a type of scratch used by turntablists.  It is generally any scratch that incorporates both a forward and backward movement, or vice versa, of the record in sequence. The orbit was developed by [[DJ Disk]] who incorporated the [[flare (scratch)|flare]] after being shown by [[DJ Q-Bert]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Usually when someone is referring to an orbit, they are most likely talking about flare orbits. For example, A 1 click forward flare and a 1 click backward flare in quick succession (altogether creating 4 very quick distinct sounds) would be a 1 click orbit. A 2 click forward flare and a 2 click backward flare in quick succession (altogether creating 6 very distinct sounds) would be a 2 click orbit, etc. Orbits can be performed once as a single orbit move, or sequenced to produce a [[Frequency|cyclical]] never ending type of orbit sound.\n\n===Flare===\n[[File:Marlon Williams aka Dj Marley Marl.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marlon Williams aka DJ [[Marley Marl]].]]\n\n'''Flare''' is a type of scratch used by turntablists.  It is made from a combination of moving the record on the turntable by hand and quick movement of the crossfader. The flare was invented by its namesake, [[DJ Flare]] in 1987. This scratch technique is much like the \"transform\" in some ways, only instead of starting with the sound that is cutting up off, one starts with the sound on and concentrate on cutting the sound into pieces by bouncing the fader off the cut out side of the fader slot to make the sound cut out and then back in a split second.\n\nEach time the DJ bounces the fader off the side of the fader slot it makes a distinct clicking noise. For this reason, flares are named according to clicks. A simple one click forward flare would be a forward scratch starting with the sound on as the DJ bounces/clicks the fader against the side once extremely quickly in the middle of the forward stroke creating two distinct sounds in one stroke of your record hand and ending with the fader open. In the same manner, 2 clicks, 3 clicks, and even more clicks (if a DJ is fast enough) can be performed to do different types of flares. The discovery and development of the flare scratch was instrumental in elevating this art form to the level of speed and technical scratching that is seen in the 2010s.\n\n===Chirp===\n[[File:QbertInBerlin.JPG|thumb|right|200px|This photo of [[DJ Q-Bert]] shows the standard turntablist technique of manipulating the record with one hand while the other hand adjusts the controls on the [[DJ mixer]].]]\nA \"chirp\" is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is made with a mix of moving the record and incorporating movement with the crossfade mixer. It was invented by [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]]. The scratch is somewhat difficult to perform because it takes a good amount of coordination. The scratch starts out with the [[cross-fader]] open. The DJ then moves the [[Gramophone record|record]] forward while simultaneously closing the previously opened channel ending the first [[sound]]. Then, in a reverse fashion, the DJ opens the channel while moving the record backwards creating a more controlled sounding \"baby scratch\". Done in quick succession it sounds as though a chirp sound is being produced.\n\n===Stab===\n\nA \"stab\" is quite similar to the Chirp technique but requires the crossfade mixer to be \"closed\". The stab requires the user to push the record forward and back quickly and moving the crossfade mixer with your thumb pressed against it, which results in minimal sound coming out, producing a sharp \"stabbing\" noise\".\n\n===Crab===\n{{See also|Crab (scratch)}}\n\nA \"crab\" is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It was invented by [[DJ Qbert]]. It is one of the most difficult scratch techniques to master. The crab is done by pushing the record forward and back while pushing the crossfader mixer open or closed through a quick succession of 4 movements with the fingers. Variations can also include 3 or 2 fingers, and generally it is recommended for beginners to start with 2 fingers and work their way to 4. It is a difficult move to master but also versatile and quite rewarding if done right.\n\n==Visual turntablism==\nVisual turntablism is a more recent phenomenon in which \"visual turntablists,\" or \"VJs,\" incorporate pictures, video, and computer generated effects into their live performances utilizing a separate video mixer in combination with their turntablist equipment. It can contain visuals without the audio being necessarily directly associated or synchronized. Since video mixing became incorporated into DJ hardware from Pioneer, and DJ software such as [[Scratch Live]], visual turtablism have moved from being a DJ with a \"VJ,\" to being solely the DJ mixing music videos much the same way as music was mixed before. In 2005 the International Turntablist Federation World final introduced the 'Experimental' category, Australian DJ/VJ 'DJ J-red' took first place, becoming the first Australian to win a World DJ competition championship title as well as becoming a pioneer of the Visual Turntablist movement.\n\n==Contests==\nLike many other musical instrumentalists, turntablists compete to see who can develop the fastest, most innovative and most creative approaches to their instrument. The selection of a champion comes from the culmination of battles between turntablists. Battling involves each turntablist performing a routine (A combination of various technical scratches, beat juggles, and other elements, including body tricks) within a limited time period, after which the routine is judged by a panel of experts. The winner is selected based upon score. These organized competitions evolved from actual old school \"battles\" where DJs challenged each other at parties, and the \"judge\" was usually the audience, who would indicate their collective will by cheering louder for the DJ they thought performed better. The [[DMC World DJ Championships]] has been hosted since 1985. There are separate competitions for solo DJs and DJ teams, the title of World Champion being bestowed on the winners of each. They also maintain a turntablism hall of fame.<ref>DMC staff. [http://www.dmcworld.com/championships/worldchampions/ DMC World Champions].

However, there are relatively few women DJs or turntablists. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs. A 2013 ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' article stated that there are \"...few women in [[Music producer|record production]] and [[sound engineering]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}</ref> Ncube states that \"[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are female producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their male counterparts.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  The vast majority of students in music technology programs are male.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn [[hip hop music]], the low percentage of women DJs and turntablists may stem from the overall male domination of the entire hip hop music industry.

The mixer is plugged into a [[PA system]] for live events and/or broadcasting equipment (if the DJ is performing on radio, TV or [[Internet radio]]) so that a wider audience can hear the turntablist's music. Turntablists manipulate records on a turntable by moving the record with their hand to cue the stylus to exact points on a record, and by touching or moving the platter or record to stop, slow down, speed up or, spin the record backwards, or moving the turntable platter back and forth (the popular rhythmic \"[[scratching]]\" effect which is a key part of [[hip hop music]]), all while using a [[DJ mixer]]'s crossfader control and the mixer's gain and equalization controls to adjust the sound and level of each turntable. Turntablists typically use two or more turntables and headphones to cue up desired start points on different records.\n\nTurntablists, who are often called [[DJ]]s (or \"deejays\"), generally prefer [[direct-drive turntable]]s over [[Belt-drive turntable|belt-driven]] or other types, because the belt can be stretched or damaged by \"scratching\" and other turntable manipulation such as slowing down a record, whereas a direct drive turntable can be stopped, slowed down, or spun backwards without damaging the electric motor. The word ''turntablist'' was originated by Luis \"[[DJ Disk]]\" Quintanilla (Primus, [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]]).  After a phone conversation with Disk, it was later popularised in 1995 by [[DJ Babu]]<ref>Newman, Mark \"Markski\" (January 3, 2003). [http://downloads.pedestrian.info/PedestrianHistoryofTurntablism.pdf ''History of Turntablism''.]</ref> to describe the difference between a DJ who simply plays and mixes records and one who performs by physically manipulating the records, stylus, turntables, turntable speed controls and mixer to produce new sounds. The new term coincided with the resurgence of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] DJing in the 1990s.\n\n[[John Oswald (composer)|John Oswald]] described the art: \"A phonograph in the hands of a 'hiphop/scratch' artist who plays a record like an electronic [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] with a [[Stylus#Use in music recording and reproduction|phonographic needle]] as a [[plectrum]], produces sounds which are unique and ''not'' reproduced\u2014the record player becomes a musical instrument.\"<ref name=\"Cox2004\">{{cite book |last=Oswald |first=John |authorlink=John Oswald (composer)|chapter=Bettered by the Borrower: The Ethics of Musical Debt |editor=Christopher Cox and Daniel Warner |title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music |publisher=The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc |year=2004 | isbn=0-8264-1615-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgDgCOSHPysC&pg=PA132 |page=132}}</ref> Some turntablists use turntable techniques like [[beatmatching|beat mixing/matching]], [[scratching]], and [[beat juggling]]. Some turntablists seek to have themselves recognized as traditional musicians capable of interacting and [[musical improvisation|improvising]] with other performers. Depending on the records and tracks selected by the DJ and his/her turntablist style (e.g., [[hip hop music]]), a turntablist can create rhythmic accompaniment, percussion breaks, [[bassline]]s or beat loops, atmospheric \"pads\", \"stabs\" of sudden chords or interwoven melodic lines.\n\n==History==\n\n===Precursors===\n{{Main|Recording studio as an instrument}}\nThe use of the turntable as a [[musical instrument]] has its roots dating back to the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s when [[musique concr\u00e8te]] composers did experiments with audio equipment. [[Experimental music|Experimental]] composers (such as [[John Cage]], [[Halim El-Dabh]], and [[Pierre Schaeffer]]) used them to [[sampling (music)|sample]] and create music that was entirely produced by the turntable. Cage's ''[[Imaginary Landscape No. 1]]'' (1939) is composed for two variable speed turntables, frequency recordings, muted piano and [[cymbal]]. [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]] experimented with turntables even earlier in 1930, though he never formally produced any works using them. Though this school of thought and practice is not directly linked to the 1970s-2010 definition of turntablism within hip hop and DJ culture, it has had an influence on modern experimental sonic/artists such as [[Christian Marclay]], [[Janek Schaefer]], [[Otomo Yoshihide]], and [[Philip Jeck]]. However, turntablism as it is known today did not surface until the development of [[hip hop]] in the 1970s.\n\nExamples of turntable effects can also be found on popular records produced in the 1960s and 1970s. This was most prominent in Jamaican [[dub music]] of the 1960s,<ref name=\"cambridge49\">Nicholas Collins, Julio d' Escrivan Rinc\u00f3n (2007), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AJbdPZv1DjgC&pg=PA49 ''The Cambridge Companion to Electronic Music'', page 49], [[Cambridge University Press]]</ref> among [[deejay]]s in the Jamaican [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] culture.

As they experimented with the SL-1200 decks, they developed scratching techniques when they found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.<ref name=\"wired\"/> Since then, turntablism spread widely in hip hop culture, and the SL-1200 remained the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for the next several decades.<ref name=\"oxford\"/><ref name=\"wired\"/>\n\n===Hip-Hop===\n[[Image:Turntables and mixer.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A DJ vinyl turntable system, consisting of two turntables and a crossfader-equipped [[DJ mixer]].]]\nTurntablism as a modern art form and musical practice has its roots within African-American inner city [[Hip-Hop music|Hip-Hop]] and [[Hip-Hop culture]] of the late 1970s. [[Kool Herc]] (a Jamaican DJ who immigrated to New York City), [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]] are widely credited for having cemented the now established role of DJ as hip hop's foremost instrumentalist.<ref name=\"Hansen2000\">Hansen, Kjetil Falkenberg (2000). [http://www.speech.kth.se/~kjetil/files/papers/2000-NTNU-Hansen_Turntablemusic.pdf ''Turntable Music'']. Norway: NTNU and Sweden: KTH, p. 4</ref> Kool Herc's invention of [[Break (music)|break-beat]] DJing is generally regarded as the foundational development in hip hop history, as it gave rise to all other elements of the genre. His influence on the concept of \"DJ as turntablist\" is equally profound.\n\nTo understand the significance of this achievement, it is important to first define the \"[[break (music)|break]].\" Briefly, the \"break\" of a song is a musical fragment only seconds in length, which typically takes the form of an \"interlude\" in which all or most of the music stops except for the percussion. Kool Herc introduced the break-beat technique as a way of extending the break indefinitely. This is done by buying two of the same record, finding the break on each record, and switching from one to the other using the DJ mixer: e.g., as record ''A'' plays, the DJ quickly backtracks to the same break on record ''B'', which will again take the place of ''A'' at a specific moment where the audience will not notice that the DJ has switched records. Using that idea, Grandmaster Flash elaborated on Kool Herc's invention of break-beat DJing and came up with the [[Grandmaster Flash#Innovations|quick-mix theory]], in which Flash sectioned off a part of the record like a [[Clock face|clock]].<ref>[Chang, Jeff. ''Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation''. Picador, 2005, p 113.]</ref> He described it as being \"...like cutting, the backspin, and the double-back.\" <ref>[Chang 2005, p. 113]</ref>\n\nKool Herc's revolutionary techniques set the course for the development of turntablism as an art form in significant ways. Most important, however, he developed a new form of DJing that did not consist of just playing and mixing records one after the other. The type of DJ that specializes in mixing a set is well respected for his/her own set of unique skills, but playlist mixing is still DJing in the traditional sense. Kool Herc instead originated the idea of ''creating'' a sequence for his own purposes, introducing the idea of the DJ as the \"feature\" of parties, whose performance on any given night would be different than on another night, because the music would be created by the DJ, mixing a bassline from one song with a beat from another song. The DJ would be examined critically by the crowd on both a technical and entertainment level.\n\n[[Grand Wizzard Theodore]], an apprentice of Flash, who accidentally isolated the most recognizable technique of turntablism: [[scratching]]. He put his hand on a record one day, to silence the music on the turntable while his mother was calling out to him and thus accidentally discovered the sound of scratching by moving the record back and forth under the [[stylus]]. Though Theodore discovered scratching, it was Flash who helped push the early concept and showcase it to the public, in his live shows and on recordings. DJ [[Grand Mixer DXT]] is also credited with furthering the concept of scratching by practicing the rhythmic scratching of a record on one or more turntables (often two), using different velocities to alter the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of the note or sound on the recording (Alberts 2002). DXT appeared (as DST) on [[Herbie Hancock]]'s hit song \"[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]].\"<ref name=Hansen2000/> These early pioneers cemented the fundamental practice that would later become the emerging turntablist art form. Scratching would during the 1980s become a staple of hip hop music, being used by producers and DJs on records and in live shows. By the end of the 1980s it was very common to hear scratching on a record, generally as part of the chorus of a track or within its production.\n\nOn stage the DJ would provide the music for the MCs to rhyme and rap to, scratching records during the performance and showcasing his or her skills alongside the verbal skills of the MC. The most well known example of this 'equation' of MCs and DJ is probably [[Run-D.M.C.]] who were composed of two MCs and one DJ. The DJ, [[Jam Master Jay]], was an integral part of the group since his turntablism was critical to Run DMC's productions and performances. While Flash and Bambaataa were using the turntable to explore repetition, alter rhythm and create the instrumental stabs and punch phrasing that would come to characterize the sound of hip hop, Grandmaster DST was busy cutting \"real\" musicians on their own turf. His scratching on Herbie Hancock's 1983 single, \"Rockit,\" makes it perhaps the most influential DJ track of them all \u2013 even more than (Grandmaster Flash's) \"[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel|Wheels of Steel]],\" it established the DJ as the star of the record, even if he wasn't the frontman.  Compared to \"Rockit,\" [[West Street Mob]]'s \"Break Dancin' \u2013 Electric Boogie\" (1983) was punk negation. As great as \"Break Dancin'\" was, though, it highlighted the limited tonal range of scratching, which was in danger of becoming a short-lived fad like [[Human beatboxing|human beat-boxing]] until the emergence of Code Money's DJ Brethren from Philadelphia in the mid-1980s.\n\nDespite New York's continued pre-eminence in the hip-hop world, scratch DJing was modernized less than 100 miles down the road in [[Philadelphia]], where the climate for the return of the DJ was created by inventing transformer scratching. Developed by [[DJ Spinbad]], [[DJ Cash Money]] and [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], transforming was basically clicking the fader on and off while moving a block of sound (a riff or a short verbal phrase) across the stylus. Expanding the tonal as well as rhythmic possibilities of scratching, the transformer scratch epitomized the chopped-up aesthetic of hip hop culture. Hip hop was starting to become big money and the cult of personality started to take over. Hip hop became very much at the service of the rapper and Cash Money and DJ Jazzy Jeff were accorded maybe one track on an album \u2013 for example, DJ Jazzy Jeff's \"[[Rock the House (album)|A Touch of Jazz]]\" (1987) and \"[[He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper|Jazzy's in the House]]\" (1988) and Cash Money's \"The Music Maker\" (1988). Other crucial DJ tracks from this period include [[Tuff Crew]]'s DJ Too Tuff's \"Behold the Detonator\"  \"Soul Food\" (both 1989),\" and [[Gang Starr]]'s \"[[DJ Premier]] in Deep Concentration\" (1990).\n\n===Decline in role of DJ in hip hop===\nThe appearance of turntablists and the birth of turntablism was prompted by one major factor \u2013 the disappearance or downplaying of the role of the DJ in hip-hop groups, on records and in live shows at the turn of the 1990s. This disappearance has been widely documented in books and documentaries (among them ''[[Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America|Black Noise]]'' and ''[[Scratch: The Movie]]''), and was linked to the increased use of [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT tapes]] and other studio techniques that would ultimately push the DJ further away from the original hip-hop equation of the MC as the vocalist and the DJ as the music provider alongside the producer. This push and disappearance of the DJ meant that the practices of the DJ, such as scratching, went back underground and were cultivated and built upon by a generation of people who grew up with hip hop, DJs and scratching. By the mid-90s the disappearance of the DJ in hip hop had created a sub-culture which would come to be known as turntablism and which focused entirely on the DJ utilizing his turntables and a mixer to manipulate sounds and create music. By pushing the practice of DJing away, hip hop created the grounds for this sub-culture to evolve.\n\n===Coining of terms===\nThe origin of the terms turntablist and turntablism are widely contested and argued about, but over the years some facts have been established by various documentaries (''Battlesounds'', [[Doug Pray]]'s ''[[Scratch (2001 film)|Scratch]]''), books (DJ Culture), conferences (Skratchcon 2000) and interviews in online and printed magazines. These facts are that the origins of the words most likely lay with practitioners on the US West Coast, centered on the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Some claim that [[DJ Disk]], a member of the [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]], was the first to coin the term, others claim that DJ Babu, a member of the [[Beat Junkies]], was responsible for coining and spreading the term turntablist after inscribing it on his mixtapes and passing them around. Another claim credits DJ Supreme, 1991 World Supremacy Champion and DJ for [[Lauryn Hill]]. The truth most likely lies somewhere in between all these facts.\n\nIn an interview with the ''Spin Science'' online resource in 2005, DJ Babu added the following comments about the birth and spread of the term:\n\n{{quote|It was around 95, I was heavily into the whole battling thing, working on the tables constantly, mastering new techniques and scratches...[I] made this mixtape called \"Comprehension,\" and on there was a track called \"Turntablism\" which featured [[Melo-D]] and D-Styles. And this is part of where this whole thing about turntablist came from. This was a time where all these new techniques were coming out, like flares and stuff, and there were probably 20 people or so, in around California between Frisco and LA, who knew about these. So we worked on them, talked about it and kicked about the ideas that these techniques and new ways of scratching gave us.}}{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Mid-to late 1990s===\nBy the mid to late 1990s the terms \"turntablism\" and \"turntablist\" had become established and accepted to define the practice and practitioner of using turntables and a mixer to create or manipulate sounds and music. This could be done by scratching a record or manipulating the rhythms on the record either by drumming, looping or beat juggling. The decade of the 1990s is also important in shaping the turntablist art form and culture as it saw the emergence of pioneering artists ([[Mix Master Mike]], [[DJ Q-Bert]], DJ Quest, [[DJ Krush]], [[A-Trak]], Ricci Rucker, Mike Boo, Pumpin' Pete, Prime Cuts) and crews (Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Beat Junkies, The Allies, [[X-Ecutioners]]), record labels ([[Asphodel Records|Asphodel]]), DJ Battles ([[DMC World DJ Championships|DMC]]) and the evolution of scratching and other turntablism practices such as Beat Juggling which are viewable in the IDA (International DJ Association/ITF) World Finals.\n\n===Techniques ===\nMore sophisticated methods of scratching were developed during that decade, with crews and individual DJs concentrating on the manipulation of the record in time with the manipulation of the cross fader on the mixer to create new rhythms and [[sonic artifact]]s with a variety of sounds. The evolution of scratching from a fairly simple sound and simple rhythmic cadences to more complicated sounds and more intricate rhythmical patterns allowed the practitioners to further evolve what could be done with scratching musically. These new ways of scratching were all given names, from [[flare (scratch)|flare]] to [[crab (scratch)|crab]] or [[orbit (scratch)|orbit]], and spread as DJs taught each other, practiced together or just showed off their new techniques to other DJs. Alongside the evolution of [[scratching]], other practices such as drumming (or scratch drumming) and [[beat juggling]] were also evolved significantly during the 1990s.\n\nBeat juggling was invented by [[Steve Dee]], a member of the X-Men (later renamed [[X-Ecutioners]]) crew. Beat juggling essentially involves the manipulation of two identical or different drum patterns on two different turntables via the mixer to create a new pattern. A simple example would be to use two copies of the same drum pattern to evolve the pattern by doubling the snares, syncopating the drum kick, adding rhythm and variation to the existing pattern. From this concept, which Steve Dee showcased in the early 1990s at DJ battles, Beat Juggling evolved throughout the decade to the point where by the end of it, it had become an intricate technique to create entirely new \"beats\" and rhythms out of existing, pre-recorded ones. These were now not just limited to using drum patterns, but could also consist of other sounds \u2013 the ultimate aim being to create a new rhythm out of the pre-recorded existing ones. While beat juggling is not as popular as scratching due to the more demanding rhythmical knowledge it requires, it has proved popular within DJ battles and in certain compositional situations.\n\n===Studies===\nOne of the earliest academic studies of turntablism (White 1996) argued for its designation as a legitimate electronic musical instrument\u2014a manual analog sampler\u2014and described turntable techniques such as backspinning, cutting, scratching and blending as basic tools for most hip hop DJs. White's study suggests the proficient hip-hop DJ must possess similar kinds of skills as those required by trained musicians, not limited to a sense of timing, hand\u2013eye coordination, technical competence and musical creativity. By the year 2000, turntablism and turntablists had become widely publicized and accepted in the mainstream and within hip hop as valid artists. Through this recognition came further evolution.\n\n===Evolution===\nThis evolution took many shapes and forms: some continued to concentrate on the foundations of the art form and its original links to hip hop culture, some became producers utilizing the skills they'd learnt as turntablists and incorporating those into their productions, some concentrated more on the DJing aspect of the art form by combining turntablist skills with the trademark skills of club DJs, while others explored alternative routes in utilizing the turntable as an instrument or production tool solely for the purpose of making music \u2013 either by using solely the turntable or by incorporating it into the production process alongside tools such as drum machines, samplers, computer software, and so on.  Digital turntablism techniques later was coined into a term called controllerism, which inspired a movement of new digital DJs such as DJ Buddy Holly and Moldover.  DJ Buddy and Moldover went on to create a song called \"Controllerism\" that pays homage to the sound of digitally emulated turntablism.\n[[File:Aron Rcm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DJ Aron Scott DJing a set for a French radio station. He is using digital [[CDJ]] decks instead of phonograph turntables.]]\n\nNew DJs, turntablists and crews owe a distinct debt to [[old school hip hop|old-school]] DJs like [[Kool DJ Herc]], [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and other DJs of [[the golden age of hip hop]], who originally developed many of the concepts and techniques that evolved into modern turntablism. Within the realm of hip hop, notable modern turntablists are the cinematic{{when defined as|date=December 2017}} [[DJ Shadow]], who influenced [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]] and [[RJD2]], among others,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} and the experimental [[DJ Spooky]], whose ''Optometry'' albums showed that the turntablist can perfectly fit within a jazz setting.{{according to whom|date=December 2017}} [[Mix Master Mike]] was a founding member of the influential turntablist group [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]] (begun in 1989 as Shadow of the Prophet) and later DJ for the [[Beastie Boys]]. [[Cut Chemist]], [[DJ Nu-Mark]], and [[Kid Koala]] are also known{{by whom|date=December 2017}} as virtuosi of the turntables.\n\n==Techniques==\n\n===Chopped and screwed===\n\n{{Main|Chopped and screwed}}\nStarting in the 1990s in the Southern United States and burgeoning in the 2000s, a meta-genre of hip hop called \"[[chopped and screwed]]\" became a significant and popular form of turntablism. Often utilizing a greater variety of [[vinyl emulation software]] rather than normal turntables, \"chopped and screwed\" stood out from previous standards of turntablism in its slowing of the pitch and tempo (\"screwing\") and syncopated beat skipping (\"chopping\"), among other added effects of sound manipulation.\n\n[[DJ Screw]] of Texas, innovated the art of chopping and screwing coining the phrase \"chopped n screwed,\" taking original contemporary hit records and replaying them in the \"chopped n screwed\" art form.  This gained a very large following finally paving the way for small, independent rap labels to turn a decent profit. However, it is thought by many that DJ Michael Price started slowing down vinyl recordings before the era of DJ Screw.\n\nThis form of turntablism, which is usually applied to prior studio recordings (in the form of custom mixtapes) and is not prominent as a feature of live performances, de-emphasizes the role of the rapper, singer or other vocalist by distorting the vocalist's voice along with the rest of the recording. Arguably, this combination of distortion and audial effects against the original recording grants greater freedom of improvisation to the DJ than did the previous forms of turntablism. Via the ChopNotSlop movement, \"Chopped and screwed\" has also been applied to other genres of music such as R&B and rock music, thus transcending its roots within the hip-hop genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/slow-life-and-fast-death-dj-screw|title=The Slow Life and Fast Death of DJ Screw|author=|date=January 20, 2013|website=texasmonthly.com}}</ref><ref>[[DJ Screw]]</ref>\n\n===Transform===\n[[File:N.A.S.A. (DJ Zegon & Squeak E. Clean).jpg|thumb|right|200px|N.A.S.A. (DJ Zegon & Squeak E. Clean). The DJ on the left can be seen cuing up a part of a record by listening to the cue channel on one of his headphones.]]\n\nA '''transform''' is a type of scratch used by turntablists.  It is made from a combination of moving the record on the turntable by hand and repeated movement of the [[crossfader]]. The name, which has been associated with [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/04/28/hip-hop-family-tree-dj-jazzy.html|title=Hip Hop Family Tree: DJ Jazzy Jeff / Boing Boing|author=|date=|website=boingboing.net}}</ref> comes from its similarity to the sound made by the [[robot]]s in the 1980s [[cartoon]], ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]''.\n\n===Tear===\nA '''tear''' is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is made from moving the record on the turntable by hand. The tear is much like a [[Scratching#Sophisticated techniques|baby scratch]] in that one does not need the fader to perform it, but unlike a baby scratch, when the DJ pulls the record back he or she pauses his or her hand for a split second in the middle of the stroke. The result is one forward sound and two distinct backward sounds. This scratch can also be performed by doing the opposite and placing the pause on the forward stroke instead. A basic tear is usually performed with the crossfader open the entire time, but it can also be combined with other scratches such as [[Flare (scratch)|flares]] for example by doing tears with the record hand and cutting the sound in and out with the fader hand.\n\n===Orbit===\nAn '''orbit''' is a type of scratch used by turntablists.  It is generally any scratch that incorporates both a forward and backward movement, or vice versa, of the record in sequence. The orbit was developed by [[DJ Disk]] who incorporated the [[flare (scratch)|flare]] after being shown by [[DJ Q-Bert]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Usually when someone is referring to an orbit, they are most likely talking about flare orbits. For example, A 1 click forward flare and a 1 click backward flare in quick succession (altogether creating 4 very quick distinct sounds) would be a 1 click orbit. A 2 click forward flare and a 2 click backward flare in quick succession (altogether creating 6 very distinct sounds) would be a 2 click orbit, etc. Orbits can be performed once as a single orbit move, or sequenced to produce a [[Frequency|cyclical]] never ending type of orbit sound.\n\n===Flare===\n[[File:Marlon Williams aka Dj Marley Marl.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marlon Williams aka DJ [[Marley Marl]].]]\n\n'''Flare''' is a type of scratch used by turntablists.  It is made from a combination of moving the record on the turntable by hand and quick movement of the crossfader. The flare was invented by its namesake, [[DJ Flare]] in 1987. This scratch technique is much like the \"transform\" in some ways, only instead of starting with the sound that is cutting up off, one starts with the sound on and concentrate on cutting the sound into pieces by bouncing the fader off the cut out side of the fader slot to make the sound cut out and then back in a split second.\n\nEach time the DJ bounces the fader off the side of the fader slot it makes a distinct clicking noise. For this reason, flares are named according to clicks. A simple one click forward flare would be a forward scratch starting with the sound on as the DJ bounces/clicks the fader against the side once extremely quickly in the middle of the forward stroke creating two distinct sounds in one stroke of your record hand and ending with the fader open. In the same manner, 2 clicks, 3 clicks, and even more clicks (if a DJ is fast enough) can be performed to do different types of flares. The discovery and development of the flare scratch was instrumental in elevating this art form to the level of speed and technical scratching that is seen in the 2010s.\n\n===Chirp===\n[[File:QbertInBerlin.JPG|thumb|right|200px|This photo of [[DJ Q-Bert]] shows the standard turntablist technique of manipulating the record with one hand while the other hand adjusts the controls on the [[DJ mixer]].]]\nA \"chirp\" is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It is made with a mix of moving the record and incorporating movement with the crossfade mixer. It was invented by [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]]. The scratch is somewhat difficult to perform because it takes a good amount of coordination. The scratch starts out with the [[cross-fader]] open. The DJ then moves the [[Gramophone record|record]] forward while simultaneously closing the previously opened channel ending the first [[sound]]. Then, in a reverse fashion, the DJ opens the channel while moving the record backwards creating a more controlled sounding \"baby scratch\". Done in quick succession it sounds as though a chirp sound is being produced.\n\n===Stab===\n\nA \"stab\" is quite similar to the Chirp technique but requires the crossfade mixer to be \"closed\". The stab requires the user to push the record forward and back quickly and moving the crossfade mixer with your thumb pressed against it, which results in minimal sound coming out, producing a sharp \"stabbing\" noise\".\n\n===Crab===\n{{See also|Crab (scratch)}}\n\nA \"crab\" is a type of scratch used by turntablists. It was invented by [[DJ Qbert]]. It is one of the most difficult scratch techniques to master. The crab is done by pushing the record forward and back while pushing the crossfader mixer open or closed through a quick succession of 4 movements with the fingers. Variations can also include 3 or 2 fingers, and generally it is recommended for beginners to start with 2 fingers and work their way to 4. It is a difficult move to master but also versatile and quite rewarding if done right.\n\n==Visual turntablism==\nVisual turntablism is a more recent phenomenon in which \"visual turntablists,\" or \"VJs,\" incorporate pictures, video, and computer generated effects into their live performances utilizing a separate video mixer in combination with their turntablist equipment. It can contain visuals without the audio being necessarily directly associated or synchronized. Since video mixing became incorporated into DJ hardware from Pioneer, and DJ software such as [[Scratch Live]], visual turtablism have moved from being a DJ with a \"VJ,\" to being solely the DJ mixing music videos much the same way as music was mixed before. In 2005 the International Turntablist Federation World final introduced the 'Experimental' category, Australian DJ/VJ 'DJ J-red' took first place, becoming the first Australian to win a World DJ competition championship title as well as becoming a pioneer of the Visual Turntablist movement.\n\n==Contests==\nLike many other musical instrumentalists, turntablists compete to see who can develop the fastest, most innovative and most creative approaches to their instrument. The selection of a champion comes from the culmination of battles between turntablists. Battling involves each turntablist performing a routine (A combination of various technical scratches, beat juggles, and other elements, including body tricks) within a limited time period, after which the routine is judged by a panel of experts. The winner is selected based upon score. These organized competitions evolved from actual old school \"battles\" where DJs challenged each other at parties, and the \"judge\" was usually the audience, who would indicate their collective will by cheering louder for the DJ they thought performed better. The [[DMC World DJ Championships]] has been hosted since 1985. There are separate competitions for solo DJs and DJ teams, the title of World Champion being bestowed on the winners of each. They also maintain a turntablism hall of fame.<ref>DMC staff. [http://www.dmcworld.com/championships/worldchampions/ DMC World Champions].

However, there are relatively few women DJs or turntablists. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs. A 2013 ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' article stated that there are \"...few women in [[Music producer|record production]] and [[sound engineering]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}</ref> Ncube states that \"[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are female producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their male counterparts.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  The vast majority of students in music technology programs are male.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn [[hip hop music]], the low percentage of women DJs and turntablists may stem from the overall male domination of the entire hip hop music industry. Most of the top rappers, MCs, DJs, record producers and music executives are men. There are a small number of high-profile women, but they are rare. In 2007 Mark Katz's article \"Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle,\" stated that \"very few women [do turntablism] battle[s]; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Mark|date=December 12, 2007|title=Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle|url=https://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/580.full#fn-9|journal=The Musical Quarterly|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm007|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states \"the male-centricity of EDM culture\" contributes to \"a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces.\" <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Dance Floor: Female DJs, Technology and Electronic Dance Music Culture|last=Farrugia|first=Rebekah|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841505664|location=|pages=}}</ref> While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as \"male technophilia.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She explains: \"an exclusive focus on women's supposed failure to enter the field \u2026 is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put the burden of proof entirely on women and to blame them for their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values.
