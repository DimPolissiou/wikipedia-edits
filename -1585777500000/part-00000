The band currently consist of lead vocalist Dave Faber, lead guitarist Jordan Pritchett, bass guitarist Jeremy \"Krikit\" Liddle and drummer Seamus O'Neill.\n\n==Biography==\nFaber Drive is a four-piece Juno Award-nominated Canadian rock band from Mission, British Columbia. They have toured with bands such as Hedley, Stereos, Marianas Trench, Simple Plan and Metro Station. They have gained a huge amount of popularity in many parts of Canada. Already well known for a local fan base, Faber Drive released a limited-edition three-song EP under the band name Faber. Due to legal issues, the band changed their name to Faber Drive.\n\nDiscovered by [[Chad Kroeger]] of [[Nickelback]] and signed to his [[604 Records]] label, Faber Drive released their debut album ''Seven Second Surgery'' on May 1, 2007, which was followed by the release of four singles. The band's biggest influences are [[U2]], [[The Police]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Stryper]] and [[Winger (band)|Winger]]. The band also featured in the American drama television series ''[[Kyle XY]]''. Two of their songs, \"Killin' Me\" and \"Summer Fades to Fall\", had featured in the show. The band also made an appearance in episode 3.01, \"Psychic Friend\", which aired on January 19, 2009. The band's lead singer Dave Faber is married to Ricarda Faber and has four kids\u2014Faith, David Dayton, Patience and Isaiah.\n\n==Name==\nThe band got their name when Faber and Red were driving and Faber was playing guitar behind the wheel and drove through a red light. Red then said \"Faber drive!\", thus giving them the name Faber Drive. After winning the Fox Seeds competition, they changed their name to Faber Drive to avoid potential legal issues. One of the names they considered before electing Faber Drive was Seven Second Surgery, but they decided it made a better album title than band name.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nFaber taught \"Red\" how to play drums for a while and asked him if he wanted to audition for his band. Hinsley was referred to Faber by his brother. At first, Dave thought he wasn't what he was looking for. A couple days later, Hinsley invited Faber for some beverages and they just connected. Dave found his lead guitarist. Red and Faber saw Krikit playing bass at an Easter service at the local church. Faber gave him his number, Krikit thought he was trying to make him come to church more often but he was going to stop coming because he had started drinking and didn't feel it was right. When he found out Faber and Red weren't from the church he was overwhelmed. He learned all the songs and played without hesitation three days before the band's first gig. Since then, they have opened for bands such as Nickelback, Hedley and Simple Plan.\n\n===Early years and rise to fame===\nAfter forming Faber, Dave would sign to Chad Kroeger of Nickelback's 604 Records label and hook up with [[Joey Moi]] for pre-production and Brian Howes to co-write with Faber. They then joined Fox's Battle of the Bands and would eventually win. After the band's triumph, they released a [[Faber (EP)|limited edition self-titled EP]]. They would later change their name to Faber Drive to avoid potential legal issues and would go on tour to promote their debut album titled ''[[Seven Second Surgery]]''. Some concerts were partially taped on camera by band members and posted on YouTube. They would release three singles and music videos from ''Seven Second Surgery''. In April 2008, Ray was married and decided to leave the band. Calvin \"Poncho\" Lechner would join Faber Drive's line up and replace Red. They would later release a fourth single titled \"[[Sleepless Nights (Faber Drive song)|Sleepless Nights]]\", concerning a child's point of view of his parents fighting. In the summer of 2008, David Hinsley quit the band. Zubin Thakkar from the band Prize Fighter would come in to replace Hinsley and play in concerts until Faber Drive's last show in October 2008.\n\n===''Seven Second Surgery''===\nFaber Drive's debut album, ''[[Seven Second Surgery]]'', was released on May 1, 2007. Four singles were released from ''Seven Second Surgery'': \"[[Second Chance (Faber Drive song)|Second Chance]]\", \"[[Tongue Tied (Faber Drive song)|Tongue Tied]]\", \"[[When I'm with You (Faber Drive song)|When I'm with You]]\", and \"[[Sleepless Nights (Faber Drive song)|Sleepless Nights]]\" (featuring Brian Melo). While \"Second Chance\" and \"Tongue Tied\" had successful chart positions in the west of Canada, \"When I'm with You\" had its best chart positions in the east.\n\n===''Can't Keep a Secret''===\nThe band's second album, ''[[Can't Keep a Secret]]'', was released on November 10, 2009. The lead single, \"[[G-Get Up and Dance]]\", was produced by Faber, [[Dave Ogilvie|Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie]] ([[Nine Inch Nails]]) and Colin \"Crocker\" Friesen. The single premiered on July 13, 2009, and became available on iTunes on July 21, 2009. Guitarist Jordan Pritchett, son of country singer [[Aaron Pritchett]], and drummer Andrew Stricko joined, replacing Hinsley and Lechner. \"G-Get Up and Dance\" went Gold after five weeks and reached number 6 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\n===''Lost in Paradise''===\nThe band released their third studio album, ''Lost in Paradise'', on August 28, 2012. Since the album's release, Faber Drive has shot and released music videos for the songs \"Do It in Hollywood\", \"Candy Store\" and \"Life Is Waiting\". And before they released their new single \"Life Is Waiting\", [[Andrew Stricko]] left the band and Seamus O'Neill replaced him. The band headed across Canada on the successful Lost in Paradise tour in Fall/Winter 2012. They have since visited [[Singapore]] to perform two shows for Music Matters and performed at some music festivals during the summer of 2013. They have since released two more singles from their third studio album, \"Too Little Too Late\" (featuring [[Pierre Bouvier]] of [[Simple Plan]]) and \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" (featuring Proper Villains). But the Music Videos are still not made. Therefore, the Official Lyric Video of \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" is already made by [[Warner Music Philippines]]. Note: (The single \"Dead On The Dancefloor\" [featuring Proper Villains] is the promotional single in Philippines).\n\n===2014 to present===\nIn April 2014, Faber Drive announced that they would play at Spring Fest 2014 at Kal Tire Place in Vernon, British Columbia, featuring [[Kardinal Offishall]], [[Karl Wolf]], [[JRDN]] and [[These Kids Wear Crowns]]. On May 23, 2014, the show was cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. Simple Plan toured with Faber Drive in June 2014 in Kirkland Lake, Canada, marking Faber Drive's last show of 2014. They later released two demos from their fourth album, \"The Best of Me\" and \"Gonna Make It\". On July 24, 2015, the band held an acoustic mini-show at Highstreet in Abbotsford, British Columbia.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn January 2016, Faber Drive posted on their official Facebook account that they would have new exciting things possibly happening that year. Then, they started to post some photos from their past concerts and music videos from their previous albums. Six months later, the band posted a photo showing that Dave was already back in the studio and they hinted that they would release new music shortly. On December 4, 2016, they held a reunion concert with their friends and special guests at the Hard Rock Casino in Vancouver. Following this, they released a Christmas song called \"We 3 Kings\". On March 13, 2017, they released new demos from their upcoming album \u2015 \"More Than Perfect\",\"Without\",\"Without a Fight\", \"One Million\" and \"Done My Best\". On August 5, 2018, they released a new single called \"Surrender\".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Members==\n\n===Current members===\n*Dave Faber \u2013 lead vocals, guitar <small>(2004\u2013present)</small>\n*Jeremy \"Krikit\" Liddle \u2013 bass, vocals <small>(2004\u2013present)</small>\n*Jordan \"JP\" Pritchett \u2013 lead guitar, vocals <small>(2008\u2013present)</small>\n*Seamus O'Neill \u2013 drums, vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n\n===Former members===\n*Ray 'red' Bull \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] <small>(2004\u20132008)</small>\n*David Hinsley \u2013 [[lead guitar]], backing vocals <small>(2004\u20132008)</small>\n*Calvin Lechner \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n*[[Andrew Stricko]] \u2013 drums, backing vocals <small>(2009\u20132012)</small>\n\n===Touring members===\n* Zubin Thakkar \u2013 lead guitar and backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n* Simon Nagel \u2013 lead guitar and backing vocals <small>(2008)</small>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Faber Drive discography}}\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date of release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|May 1, 2007\n|''[[Seven Second Surgery]]''\n|rowspan=\"3\"| [[604 Records]]\n|-\n|November 10, 2009\n|''[[Can't Keep a Secret]]''\n|-\n|August 28, 2012\n|''[[Lost in Paradise (Faber Drive album)|Lost in Paradise]]''\n|}\n\n===EP===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date of release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|2005\n|''[[Faber (EP)|Faber]]''\n| [[604 Records]]\n|}\n\n==Awards==\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n| 2007 || \"[[Tongue Tied (Faber Drive song)|Tongue Tied]]\" || [[SOCAN]] No. 1 Song Award || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2008 || rowspan=\"2\"|\"[[Second Chance (Faber Drive song)|Second Chance]]\" || Canadian Radio Music Awards for Best New Group (Hot A/C) of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Juno Awards|Juno]] for Best New Group of the Year || {{nom}}\n|-\n{{end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Faber Drive discography]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/faberdrivetv Faber Drive TV] on [[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.faberdrivefreaks.ning.com Official Faber Drive Street Team]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{Faber Drive}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Canadian pop punk groups]]\n[[Category:People from Mission, British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Musical quartets]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from British Columbia]]\n[[Category:2004 establishments in British Columbia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian pop punk band}}\n{{Redirect|Ray Bull|the British psychologist|Ray Bull (psychologist)}}\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = \n| background      = group_or_band\n| image           = [[File:Faberdrivenow.jpg|250 px]]\n| caption         = Faber Drive in 2011.

At one stage it was reported that England alone would field teams under the UK banner (officially \"Great Britain\") for the 2012 Games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=650708&sec=england&cc=5901 |title=England to go solo with 2012 Olympic team? |publisher=ESPNsoccernet |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref> However, both the men's and women's Great Britain teams eventually fielded some players from the other home nations.

After sixty years of trying to gain social acceptance women's football was introduced to the college level. In the late 1970s, women's club teams started to appear on college campus, but it wasn't until the 1980s that they started to gain recognition and gained a varsity status. Brown University was the first college to grant full varsity level status to their women's soccer team. The Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) sponsored the first regional women's soccer tournament at college in the US, which was held at [[Brown University]]. The first national level tournament was held at Colorado College, which gained official AIAW sponsorship in 1981. The 1990s saw greater participation mainly due to the [[Title IX]] of 23 June 1972, which increased school's budgets and their addition of women's scholarships.<blockquote>\n\"Currently there are over 700 intercollegiate women's soccer teams playing for many types and sizes of colleges and universities. This includes colleges and universities that are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).\"\n</blockquote>\n\n== Attire ==\nThe majority of women footballers around the globe wear a traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] made up of a jersey, shorts, cleats and knee-length socks worn over [[shin guards]].\n\n=== Controversies ===\nIn 2004, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] suggested that women footballers should \"wear tighter shorts and low cut shirts... to create a more female aesthetic\" and attract more male fans.

After sixty years of trying to gain social acceptance women's football was introduced to the college level. In the late 1970s, women's club teams started to appear on college campus, but it wasn't until the 1980s that they started to gain recognition and gained a varsity status. Brown University was the first college to grant full varsity level status to their women's soccer team. The Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) sponsored the first regional women's soccer tournament at college in the US, which was held at [[Brown University]]. The first national level tournament was held at Colorado College, which gained official AIAW sponsorship in 1981. The 1990s saw greater participation mainly due to the [[Title IX]] of 23 June 1972, which increased school's budgets and their addition of women's scholarships.<blockquote>\n\"Currently there are over 700 intercollegiate women's soccer teams playing for many types and sizes of colleges and universities. This includes colleges and universities that are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), and the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).\"\n</blockquote>\n\n== Attire ==\nThe majority of women footballers around the globe wear a traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] made up of a jersey, shorts, cleats and knee-length socks worn over [[shin guards]].\n\n=== Controversies ===\nIn 2004, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] suggested that women footballers should \"wear tighter shorts and low cut shirts... to create a more female aesthetic\" and attract more male fans. His comment was criticized as [[Sexism|sexist]] by numerous people involved with women's football and several media outlets worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url =http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,1124460,00.html |title = Soccer chief's plan to boost women's game?

Denying that the kit change was merely a publicity stunt, club chairman Jan van den Elzen told [[Reuters]]:\n\n{{quote|''The girls asked us if they could make a team and asked specifically to play in skirts. We said we'd try but we didn't expect to get permission for that. We've seen reactions from Belgium and Germany already saying this could be something for them.

{"title_page": "History of the Bahamas", "text_new": "{{History of the Bahamas}}\nThe earliest arrival of humans in the islands now known as [[The Bahamas]] was in the first millennium AD. The first inhabitants of the islands were the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]], an [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Ta\u00edno people|Taino]] people, who arrived between about 500 and 800 AD from other islands of the [[Caribbean]]. Their ancestors came from mainland South America, where Arawakan-language peoples were present in most territories, and especially along the northeastern coast.\n\nRecorded history began on 12 October 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the island of [[Guanahani]], which he renamed [[San Salvador Island]] on his first voyage to the [[New World]]. The earliest permanent European settlement was in 1648 on [[Eleuthera]]. During the 18th century [[slave trade]], many Africans were brought to the Bahamas as slaves to work for free. Their descendants now constitute 85% of the Bahamian population. The Bahamas gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] on July 10, 1973.\n\n==Pre-history==\nSometime between 500 and 800 AD, Ta\u00ednos began crossing in [[dugout canoe]]s from [[Hispaniola]] and/or [[Cuba]] to the Bahamas. Suggested routes for the earliest migrations have been from Hispaniola to the [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Caicos Islands]], from Hispaniola or eastern Cuba to [[Great Inagua Island]], and from central Cuba to [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]] (in the central Bahamas). William Keegan argues that the most likely route was from Hispaniola or Cuba to Great Inagua. Granberry and Vescelius argue for two migrations, from Hispaniola to the Turks and Caicos Islands, and from Cuba to Great Inagua.<ref>Craton:17<br>Granberry and Vescelius:80-86<br>Keegan:48-62</ref>\n\nFrom the initial colonization(s), the Lucayan expanded throughout the Bahamas in some 800 years (c. 700 \u2013 c. 1500), growing to a population of about 40,000. Population density at the time of first European contact was highest in the south-central area of the Bahamas, declining towards the north, reflecting the migration pattern and progressively shorter time of occupation of the northern islands. Known Lucayan settlement sites are confined to the nineteen largest islands in the archipelago, or to smaller cays located less than one km. from those islands. Population density in the southern-most Bahamas remained lower, probably due to the drier climate there (less than 800&nbsp;mm of rain a year on Great Inagua Island and the Turks and Caicos Islands and only slightly higher on Acklins and Crooked Islands and Mayaguana).<ref>Keegan:25, 54-8, 86, 170-3</ref>\n\nIn 1492 [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed from [[Spain]] on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]] with three ships, the ''Ni\u00f1a,'' the ''Pinta,'' and the flagship, ''Santa Maria,'' seeking a direct route to [[Asia]]. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the 'discovery' of America. This island was called ''[[Guanahani]]'' by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept [[Samuel E. Morison]]'s identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to [[San Salvador Island|San Salvador]]. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.<ref>Albury:21-33<br>Craton:28-37<br>Keegan:175-205</ref>\n\nThe Bahamas held little interest to the Spanish except as a source of slave labor. Nearly the entire population of Lucayan (almost 40,000 people total) were transported to other islands as laborers over the next 30 years. When the Spanish decided to remove the remaining Lucayans to Hispaniola in 1520, they could find only eleven. The islands remained abandoned and depopulated for 130 years afterwards. With no gold to be found, and the population removed, the Spanish effectively abandoned the Bahamas. They retained titular claims to them until the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris in 1783]], when they ceded them to Britain in exchange for East Florida.<ref>Albury:34-7</ref><ref>Albury:34-7<br>Craton. pp. 37-39<br>Johnson:3<br>Keegan:212, 220-3</ref>\n\nWhen Europeans first landed on the islands, they reported the Bahamas were lushly forested. Cleared to develop the land for [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s, the forests have not regrown and have not been replanted.\n\n==Early English settlement==\nFor many years, historians believed that The Bahamas was not colonized until the 17th century. However, recent studies show that there may have been attempts of colonization by groups from Spain, France, Britain, and the Netherlands. The French settled in Abaco in 1565, and tried again in 1625. In 1648 a group from [[Bermuda]] called 'The Company of Adventurers for the Plantation of the Islands of Eleutheria,' which was led by [[William Sayle]], sailed to the Bahamas to found a colony. These early settlers were [[Puritan]]s and [[Classical republicanism|republicans]]. Bermuda was becoming overcrowded, and the Bahamas offered both religious and political freedom and economic opportunity. The larger of the company's two ships, the ''William'', wrecked on the reef at the north end of what is now called [[Eleuthera Island]], with the loss of all provisions. Despite the arrival of additional settlers, including Europeans, slaves and former African slaves from Bermuda and the receipt of relief supplies from [[Virginia]] and [[New England]], the Eleuthera colony struggled for many years, hampered by poor soil, fighting between settlers, and conflict with the Spanish. In the mid-1650s many of the settlers returned to Bermuda. The remaining settlers founded communities on [[Harbour Island, Bahamas|Harbour Island]] and Saint George's Cay ([[Spanish Wells]]) at the north end of Eleuthera. In 1670 about 20 families lived in the Eleuthera communities.<ref>Albury:41-6<br>Johnson:3-4</ref>\n\nIn 1666 other colonists from Bermuda settled on [[New Providence]], which soon became the center of population and commerce in the Bahamas, with almost 500 people living on the island by 1670. Unlike the Eleutherians, who were primarily farmers, the first settlers on New Providence made their living from the sea, salvaging (mainly Spanish) wrecks, making salt, and taking fish, turtles, [[conch]]s and [[ambergris]]. Farmers from Bermuda soon followed the seamen to New Providence, where they found good, plentiful land. Neither the Eleutherian colony nor the settlement on New Providence had any legal standing under English law. In 1670 the Proprietors of Carolina were issued a patent for the Bahamas, but the governors sent by the Proprietors had difficulty imposing their authority on the independent-minded residents of New Providence.<ref>Albury:47-51<br>Johnson:4</ref>\n\nThe early settlers continued to live much as they had in Bermuda, fishing, hunting turtles, whales, and seals, finding [[ambergris]], making salt on the drier islands, cutting the abundant hardwoods of the islands for lumber, [[dyewood]] and medicinal bark; and [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]], or salvaging wrecks. The Bahamas were close to the sailing routes between Europe and the Caribbean, so shipwrecks in the islands were common, and wrecking was the most lucrative occupation available to the Bahamians.<ref>Johnson:4-5</ref>\n\n==Wreckers, privateers and pirates==\nThe Bahamians soon came into conflict with the Spanish over the salvaging of wrecks. The Bahamian wreckers drove the Spanish away from their wrecked ships, and attacked Spanish salvagers, seizing goods the Spanish had already recovered from the wrecks. When the Spanish raided the Bahamas, the Bahamians in turn commissioned [[privateer]]s against Spain, even though England and Spain were at peace. In 1684 the Spanish [[Raid on Charles Town|burned the settlements]] on New Providence and Eleuthera, after which they were largely abandoned. New Providence was settled a second time in 1686 by colonists from [[Jamaica]].\n\nIn the 1690s English privateers (England was then at war with [[France]]) made a base in the Bahamas. In 1696 [[Henry Every]] (or Avery), using the assumed name Henry Bridgeman, brought his ship [[Fancy (ship)|''Fancy'']], loaded with pirates' loot, into Nassau harbor. Every bribed the governor, Nicholas Trott (uncle of the [[Nicholas Trott]] who presided at the trial of [[Stede Bonnet]]), with gold and silver, and by leaving him the ''Fancy'', still loaded with 50 tons of [[elephant#Tusks|elephant tusks]] and 100 barrels of gunpowder. Following peace with France in 1697, many of the privateers became [[pirates]]. From this time the pirates increasingly made Nassau, the Bahamian capital founded in 1694, their base. The governors appointed by the Proprietors usually made a show of suppressing the pirates, but most were accused of dealing with them. By 1701 England was at war with France and Spain. In 1703 and in 1706 combined French-Spanish fleets [[Raid on Nassau|attacked and sacked]] Nassau, after which some settlers left, and the Proprietors gave up on trying to govern the islands.<ref>Albury:51-5<br>Craton:70-87<br>Johnson:6<br>Woodard:12-14, 23-24</ref>\n\nWith no functioning government in the Bahamas, English privateers operated from Nassau as their base, in what has been called a \"[[Pirates' republic|privateers' republic]],\" which lasted for eleven years. The raiders attacked French and Spanish ships, while French and Spanish forces burned Nassau several times. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] ended in 1714, but some privateers were slow to get the news, or reluctant to accept it, and slipped into piracy. One estimate puts at least 1,000 pirates in the Bahamas in 1713, outnumbering the 200 families of more permanent settlers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Albury:58-68<br>Craton:89-90<br>Woodard:89-90, 140, 160</ref>\n\nThe \"privateers' republic\" in Nassau became a \"pirates' republic\". At least 20 pirate captains used Nassau or other places in the Bahamas as a home port during this period, including [[Henry Jennings]], [[Edward Teach]] (Blackbeard), [[Benjamin Hornigold]] and [[Stede Bonnet]]. Many settler families moved from New Providence to Eleuthera or [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] to escape harassment from the pirates. On the other hand, residents of Harbor Island were happy to serve as middlemen for the pirates, as merchants from [[New England]] and Virginia came there to exchange needed supplies for pirate plunder.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> As mentioned above, the activities of pirates provoked frequent and brutal retaliatory attacks by the French and Spanish.\n\n==Reclaiming Bahamas for the Crown ==\nStarting in 1713, [[Woodes Rogers]] had conceived the idea of leading an expedition to [[Madagascar]] to suppress the pirates there and establish it as a British colony. Rogers' friends [[Richard Steele]] and [[Joseph Addison]] eventually convinced him to tackle the pirates nest in the Bahamas, instead. Rogers and others formed a company to fund the venture. They persuaded the Proprietors of Carolina to surrender the government of the Bahamas to the king, while retaining title to the land. In 1717 [[George I of Great Britain|King George]] appointed Rogers governor of the Bahamas and issued a proclamation granting a pardon to any pirate who surrendered to a British governor within one year.<ref>Albury:69-74<br>Craton:93-6<br>Johnson:7-8<br>Woodard:117-121, 163-168</ref>\n\nWord of the appointment of a new governor and of the offer of pardons reached Nassau ahead of Rogers and his forces. Some of the pirates were willing to accept a pardon and retire from piracy. [[Henry Jennings]] and Christopher Winter, sailed off to find British authorities to confirm their acceptance of the amnesty.\n\nOthers were not ready to give up. Many of those were [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], supporters of the [[House of Stuart]], who identified as enemies of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King George. Still others simply identified as rebels, or thought they were better off as pirates than trying to earn an honest living. When a Royal Navy ship brought official word to Nassau of the pardon offer, many pirates planned to accept. Soon, however, the recalcitrant parties gained the upper hand, eventually forcing the Navy ship to leave.<ref>Woodard:226-29</ref>\n\n[[Blackbeard]], [[Stede Bonnet]], [[Nicholas Brown (pirate)|Nicholas Brown]] and Edmond Condent left the Bahamas for other territories. [[Charles Vane]], with \"[[Calico Jack]]\" Rackham and [[Edward England]] in his crew, came to prominence at this time. Vane worked to organize resistance to the anticipated arrival of Royal authority, even appealing to [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the Stuart [[pretender]], for aid in holding the Bahamas and capturing Bermuda for the Stuarts. As aid from the Stuarts failed to materialize and the date for Rogers' arrival approached, Vane and his crew prepared to leave Nassau.<ref>Woodard:236-40, 245-47, 259-61</ref>\n\nWoodes Rogers arrived in Nassau in late July 1718, with his own 460-ton warship, three ships belonging to his company, and an escort of three ships of the Royal Navy. Vane's ship was trapped in Nassau harbor. His crew set that ship on fire, sending it towards Rogers' ships, and escaped in the ensuing confusion in a smaller ship they had seized from another pirate. The remaining population welcomed Rogers; they comprised about 200 settlers and 500 to 700 pirates who wanted to receive pardons, most prominently [[Benjamin Hornigold]].<ref>Woodard:247-48, 262-67</ref> After the pirates' surrender, the Proprietors leased their land in the Bahamas to Rogers' company for 21 years.\n\nRogers controlled Nassau, but Charles Vane was loose and threatening to drive the governor and his forces out. Learning that the King of Spain wanted to expel English from the islands, Rogers worked to improve the defenses of Nassau. He lost nearly 100 men of the new forces due to an unidentified disease, and the Navy ships left for other assignments. Rogers sent four of his ships to Havana to assure the Spanish governor that he was suppressing piracy and to trade for supplies. The crews of ex-pirates and men who had come with Rogers all turned to piracy. The ex-pirate Benjamin Hornigold later caught ten men at [[Green Turtle Cay]] as part of Rogers' suppression effort. Eight were found guilty and hanged in front of the fort.<ref>Woodard:268-72, 286, 301-04</ref>\n\nVane attacked several small settlements in the Bahamas but, after he refused to attack a stronger French frigate, he was deposed for cowardice and replaced as captain by \"[[Calico Jack]]\" Rackham. Vane never returned to the Bahamas; he was eventually caught, convicted and executed in Jamaica. After nearly being captured by Jamaican privateers, and hearing that the king had extended the deadline for pardons for piracy, Rackham and his crew returned to Nassau to surrender to Woodes Rogers.\n\nIn Nassau Rackham became involved with [[Anne Bonny]]; he tried to arrange an annulment of her marriage to another ex-pirate, James Bonny. Rogers blocked the annulment, and Rackham and Bonny left Nassau to be pirates again, taking a small crew and Bonny's friend [[Mary Read]] with them. Within months, Rackham, Bonny and Read were captured and taken to Jamaica. They were convicted of piracy, and Rackham was executed. Bonny and Read were sent to prison, as both were pregnant and therefore excluded from execution. Read died in prison, while Bonny's fate is unknown.<ref>Woodard:304-10, 315-20</ref>\n\nWhen Britain and Spain went to war again in 1719, many of the ex-pirates were commissioned by the British government as privateers. A Spanish invasion fleet set out for the Bahamas, but was diverted to [[Pensacola, Florida]] when it was seized by the French. Rogers continued to improve the defenses of Nassau, spending his personal fortune and going heavily into debt to do so. In 1720, the [[Raid on Nassau (1720)|Spaniards finally attacked Nassau]]. Rogers returned to Britain in 1722 to plead for repayment of the money he had borrowed to build up Nassau, only to find he had been replaced as governor. He was sent to debtors' prison, although his creditors later absolved his debts, gaining him release.\n\nAfter the publication in 1724 of ''A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates,'' which praised Rogers' efforts to suppress piracy in the Bahamas, his fortunes began to improve. The king awarded him a pension, retroactive to 1721. In 1728 Rogers was appointed Governor of the Bahamas for a second term. He dissolved the colony's assembly when it would not approve taxes to repair Nassau's defenses. He died in Nassau in 1732.<ref>Woodard:311-14, 325-28</ref>\n\n==Mid-century==\nIn 1741, Governor [[John Tinker (governor)|John Tinker]] and Peter Henry Bruce constructed [[Fort Montague]]. Additionally, the Governor also reported a privateering boom in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America. He also reported that over 2300 sumptuous houses were built. In 1768 Governor William Shirley filled in mosquito-breeding swamps and extended Nassau.\n\n==Loyalists, slaves and Black Seminoles==\nDuring the [[American War of Independence]] the Bahamas [[Capture of the Bahamas (1782)|fell to Spanish forces]] under [[Bernardo de Galvez|General Galvez]] in 1782. A British-American Loyalist expedition led by Colonel [[Andrew Deveaux]], [[Capture of the Bahamas (1783)|recaptured the islands]] in 1783. After the [[American Revolution]], the British issued land grants to [[American Loyalists]] who  had gone into exile from the newly established United  States. The sparse population of the Bahamas tripled within a few years. The Loyalists developed cotton as a commodity crop, but it dwindled from insect damage and soil exhaustion. In addition to slaves they brought with them, the planters' descendants imported more African slaves for labour.\n\nMost of the current inhabitants in the islands are descended from the slaves brought to work on the Loyalist plantations. In addition, thousands of captive Africans, who were liberated from foreign slave ships by the British navy after the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolition of the British slave trade in 1807]], were resettled as free persons in the Bahamas.\n\nIn the early 1820s, following the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] ceding Florida from Spain to the United States, hundreds of African slaves and [[Black Seminoles]] escaped from Florida, most settling on [[Andros Island]] in the Bahamas. Three hundred escaped in a mass flight in 1823.<ref name=\"nps\">[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_details.htm?SPFID=9173&SPFTerritory=Florida&SPFType=Site&SPFKeywords=Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park \"Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park\"], ''Network to Freedom,'' National Park Service, 2010, accessed 10 April 2013.</ref> While the flow was reduced by federal construction of a lighthouse at [[Cape Florida Lighthouse|Cape Florida]] in 1825, slaves continued to find freedom in the Bahamas.<ref name=\"nps\"/>\n\nIn August 1834, the traditional plantation life ended with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|British emancipation of slaves throughout most of its colonies]].

These included the ''[[Hermosa (slave ship)|Hermosa]]'' (1840) and the ''[[Creole case|Creole]]'' (1841), the latter brought in after a slave revolt on board. Britain had notified nations that slaves brought into Bahama and Bermuda waters would be forfeited and freed the slaves, refusing US efforts to recover them.<ref name=\"horne\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=XTLFKrmJPgcC&dq=%22children+of+the+enterprise%22+musson Gerald Horne, ''Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation''], New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, pp. 107-108</ref> In 1853 Britain and the US signed a claims treaty and submitted to arbitration for claims dating to 1814; they paid each other in 1855.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the Bahamas prospered as a base for Confederate blockade-running, bringing in cotton to be shipped to the mills of England and running out arms and munitions. None of these provided any lasting prosperity to the islands, nor did attempts to grow different kinds of crops for export.\n\nWith emancipation, Caribbean societies inherited a rigid racial stratification that was reinforced by the unequal distribution of wealth and power. The three-tier race structure, of whites, [[mixed-race]], and primarily blacks, who comprised the large majority, existed well into the 1940s and in some societies beyond. Like African Americans, many also have European and Native American ancestry. Caribbean societies continue to struggle with racial issues.\n\n==Late-colonial period==\nIn 1911, there was a short-lived movement to make the Bahamas part of [[Canada]]. Although the movement enjoyed the support of many in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and from the head of [[Sun Life Financial|Sun Life]], a Canadian insurance company, the movement failed. The failure of the movement was, in part, due to the British government's opposition to uniting a predominantly Black colony with a predominantly white country.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2009. \"Thomas Bassett Macaulay and the Bahamas: Racism, Business and Canadian Sub-imperialism\".

Freeport, on the island of Grand Bahama, was established as a free trade zone in the 1950s and became the Bahama's second city. [[Bank secrecy]] combined with the lack of corporate and income taxes led to a rapid growth in the offshore financial sector during the postwar years.\n\nThe fourth [[James Bond films|James Bond film]], ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', was partly filmed in 1965 in Nassau.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the islands had become a major center for the drug trade, with 90% of all the [[cocaine]] entering the [[United States]] reportedly passing through the Bahamas. Diplomatic relations were established with [[Cuba]] in 1974. A decade later, as increased Cuban immigration to the islands strained the Bahamas\u2019 resources, Cuba refused to sign a letter of repatriation.\n\nIn September 2004, [[Hurricane Frances]] swept through the Bahamas, leaving widespread damage in its wake. Just three weeks later, Hurricane Jeanne uprooted trees, blew out windows, and sent seawater flooding through neighborhoods on the islands of [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] and [[Grand Bahama]]. Receding floodwaters left boats tossed on roads and homes battered.\n\nThe College of the Bahamas was founded in 1974 and provided the nation's higher or tertiary education. The College was chartered in 2016 as the [[University of the Bahamas]], offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, on three campuses and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas.\n\nBased on the twin pillars of tourism and offshore finance, the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. However, there remain significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti.\n\n==Political developments==\nModern political development began after World War II. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The [[Progressive Liberal Party]] was formed in 1953, and the [[United Bahamian Party]] was formed in 1956.\n\nBahamians achieved self-government in 1964, with [[Sir Roland Symonette]], of the United Bahamian Party, as the first Premier. The Bahamas achieved full independence as a [[Commonwealth realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 10 July 1973. Sir [[Lynden O. Pindling]], leader of the Progressive Liberal Party,  became the first black Premier of the colony in 1967, and in 1968 the title was changed to [[Prime Minister of the Bahamas|Prime Minister]]. [[Sir Milo Butler]] was appointed the first [[Governor-General of the Bahamas]] (the official representative of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]) shortly after independence. Pindling was prime minister until 1992, during which the Bahamas benefited from tourism and foreign investment. He was succeeded by [[Hubert Ingraham]], leader of the [[Free National Movement]], who was prime minister until 2002.\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of North America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of the Bahamas]]\n*[[Politics of the Bahamas]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Albury, Paul.

The first inhabitants of the islands were the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]], an [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Ta\u00edno people|Taino]] people, who arrived between about 500 and 800 AD from other islands of the [[Caribbean]]. Their ancestors came from mainland South America, where Arawakan-language peoples were present in most territories, and especially along the northeastern coast.\n\nRecorded history began on 12 October 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the island of [[Guanahani]], which he renamed [[San Salvador Island]] on his first voyage to the [[New World]]. The earliest permanent European settlement was in 1648 on [[Eleuthera]]. During the 18th century [[slave trade]], many Africans were brought to the Bahamas as slaves to work for free. Their descendants now constitute 85% of the Bahamian population. The Bahamas gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] on July 10, 1973.\n\n==Pre-history==\nSometime between 500 and 800 AD, Ta\u00ednos began crossing in [[dugout canoe]]s from [[Hispaniola]] and/or [[Cuba]] to the Bahamas. Suggested routes for the earliest migrations have been from Hispaniola to the [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Caicos Islands]], from Hispaniola or eastern Cuba to [[Great Inagua Island]], and from central Cuba to [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]] (in the central Bahamas). William Keegan argues that the most likely route was from Hispaniola or Cuba to Great Inagua. Granberry and Vescelius argue for two migrations, from Hispaniola to the Turks and Caicos Islands, and from Cuba to Great Inagua.<ref>Craton:17<br>Granberry and Vescelius:80-86<br>Keegan:48-62</ref>\n\nFrom the initial colonization(s), the Lucayan expanded throughout the Bahamas in some 800 years (c. 700 \u2013 c. 1500), growing to a population of about 40,000. Population density at the time of first European contact was highest in the south-central area of the Bahamas, declining towards the north, reflecting the migration pattern and progressively shorter time of occupation of the northern islands. Known Lucayan settlement sites are confined to the nineteen largest islands in the archipelago, or to smaller cays located less than one km. from those islands. Population density in the southern-most Bahamas remained lower, probably due to the drier climate there (less than 800&nbsp;mm of rain a year on Great Inagua Island and the Turks and Caicos Islands and only slightly higher on Acklins and Crooked Islands and Mayaguana).<ref>Keegan:25, 54-8, 86, 170-3</ref>\n\nIn 1492 [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed from [[Spain]] on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]] with three ships, the ''Ni\u00f1a,'' the ''Pinta,'' and the flagship, ''Santa Maria,'' seeking a direct route to [[Asia]]. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the 'discovery' of America. This island was called ''[[Guanahani]]'' by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept [[Samuel E. Morison]]'s identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to [[San Salvador Island|San Salvador]]. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.<ref>Albury:21-33<br>Craton:28-37<br>Keegan:175-205</ref>\n\nThe Bahamas held little interest to the Spanish except as a source of slave labor. Nearly the entire population of Lucayan (almost 40,000 people total) were transported to other islands as laborers over the next 30 years. When the Spanish decided to remove the remaining Lucayans to Hispaniola in 1520, they could find only eleven. The islands remained abandoned and depopulated for 130 years afterwards. With no gold to be found, and the population removed, the Spanish effectively abandoned the Bahamas. They retained titular claims to them until the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris in 1783]], when they ceded them to Britain in exchange for East Florida.<ref>Albury:34-7</ref><ref>Albury:34-7<br>Craton. pp. 37-39<br>Johnson:3<br>Keegan:212, 220-3</ref>\n\nWhen Europeans first landed on the islands, they reported the Bahamas were lushly forested. Cleared to develop the land for [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s, the forests have not regrown and have not been replanted.\n\n==Early English settlement==\nFor many years, historians believed that The Bahamas was not colonized until the 17th century. However, recent studies show that there may have been attempts of colonization by groups from Spain, France, Britain, and the Netherlands. The French settled in Abaco in 1565, and tried again in 1625. In 1648 a group from [[Bermuda]] called 'The Company of Adventurers for the Plantation of the Islands of Eleutheria,' which was led by [[William Sayle]], sailed to the Bahamas to found a colony. These early settlers were [[Puritan]]s and [[Classical republicanism|republicans]]. Bermuda was becoming overcrowded, and the Bahamas offered both religious and political freedom and economic opportunity. The larger of the company's two ships, the ''William'', wrecked on the reef at the north end of what is now called [[Eleuthera Island]], with the loss of all provisions. Despite the arrival of additional settlers, including Europeans, slaves and former African slaves from Bermuda and the receipt of relief supplies from [[Virginia]] and [[New England]], the Eleuthera colony struggled for many years, hampered by poor soil, fighting between settlers, and conflict with the Spanish. In the mid-1650s many of the settlers returned to Bermuda. The remaining settlers founded communities on [[Harbour Island, Bahamas|Harbour Island]] and Saint George's Cay ([[Spanish Wells]]) at the north end of Eleuthera. In 1670 about 20 families lived in the Eleuthera communities.<ref>Albury:41-6<br>Johnson:3-4</ref>\n\nIn 1666 other colonists from Bermuda settled on [[New Providence]], which soon became the center of population and commerce in the Bahamas, with almost 500 people living on the island by 1670. Unlike the Eleutherians, who were primarily farmers, the first settlers on New Providence made their living from the sea, salvaging (mainly Spanish) wrecks, making salt, and taking fish, turtles, [[conch]]s and [[ambergris]]. Farmers from Bermuda soon followed the seamen to New Providence, where they found good, plentiful land. Neither the Eleutherian colony nor the settlement on New Providence had any legal standing under English law. In 1670 the Proprietors of Carolina were issued a patent for the Bahamas, but the governors sent by the Proprietors had difficulty imposing their authority on the independent-minded residents of New Providence.<ref>Albury:47-51<br>Johnson:4</ref>\n\nThe early settlers continued to live much as they had in Bermuda, fishing, hunting turtles, whales, and seals, finding [[ambergris]], making salt on the drier islands, cutting the abundant hardwoods of the islands for lumber, [[dyewood]] and medicinal bark; and [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]], or salvaging wrecks. The Bahamas were close to the sailing routes between Europe and the Caribbean, so shipwrecks in the islands were common, and wrecking was the most lucrative occupation available to the Bahamians.<ref>Johnson:4-5</ref>\n\n==Wreckers, privateers and pirates==\nThe Bahamians soon came into conflict with the Spanish over the salvaging of wrecks. The Bahamian wreckers drove the Spanish away from their wrecked ships, and attacked Spanish salvagers, seizing goods the Spanish had already recovered from the wrecks. When the Spanish raided the Bahamas, the Bahamians in turn commissioned [[privateer]]s against Spain, even though England and Spain were at peace. In 1684 the Spanish [[Raid on Charles Town|burned the settlements]] on New Providence and Eleuthera, after which they were largely abandoned. New Providence was settled a second time in 1686 by colonists from [[Jamaica]].\n\nIn the 1690s English privateers (England was then at war with [[France]]) made a base in the Bahamas. In 1696 [[Henry Every]] (or Avery), using the assumed name Henry Bridgeman, brought his ship [[Fancy (ship)|''Fancy'']], loaded with pirates' loot, into Nassau harbor. Every bribed the governor, Nicholas Trott (uncle of the [[Nicholas Trott]] who presided at the trial of [[Stede Bonnet]]), with gold and silver, and by leaving him the ''Fancy'', still loaded with 50 tons of [[elephant#Tusks|elephant tusks]] and 100 barrels of gunpowder. Following peace with France in 1697, many of the privateers became [[pirates]]. From this time the pirates increasingly made Nassau, the Bahamian capital founded in 1694, their base. The governors appointed by the Proprietors usually made a show of suppressing the pirates, but most were accused of dealing with them. By 1701 England was at war with France and Spain. In 1703 and in 1706 combined French-Spanish fleets [[Raid on Nassau|attacked and sacked]] Nassau, after which some settlers left, and the Proprietors gave up on trying to govern the islands.<ref>Albury:51-5<br>Craton:70-87<br>Johnson:6<br>Woodard:12-14, 23-24</ref>\n\nWith no functioning government in the Bahamas, English privateers operated from Nassau as their base, in what has been called a \"[[Pirates' republic|privateers' republic]],\" which lasted for eleven years. The raiders attacked French and Spanish ships, while French and Spanish forces burned Nassau several times. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] ended in 1714, but some privateers were slow to get the news, or reluctant to accept it, and slipped into piracy. One estimate puts at least 1,000 pirates in the Bahamas in 1713, outnumbering the 200 families of more permanent settlers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Albury:58-68<br>Craton:89-90<br>Woodard:89-90, 140, 160</ref>\n\nThe \"privateers' republic\" in Nassau became a \"pirates' republic\". At least 20 pirate captains used Nassau or other places in the Bahamas as a home port during this period, including [[Henry Jennings]], [[Edward Teach]] (Blackbeard), [[Benjamin Hornigold]] and [[Stede Bonnet]]. Many settler families moved from New Providence to Eleuthera or [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] to escape harassment from the pirates. On the other hand, residents of Harbor Island were happy to serve as middlemen for the pirates, as merchants from [[New England]] and Virginia came there to exchange needed supplies for pirate plunder.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> As mentioned above, the activities of pirates provoked frequent and brutal retaliatory attacks by the French and Spanish.\n\n==Reclaiming Bahamas for the Crown ==\nStarting in 1713, [[Woodes Rogers]] had conceived the idea of leading an expedition to [[Madagascar]] to suppress the pirates there and establish it as a British colony. Rogers' friends [[Richard Steele]] and [[Joseph Addison]] eventually convinced him to tackle the pirates nest in the Bahamas, instead. Rogers and others formed a company to fund the venture. They persuaded the Proprietors of Carolina to surrender the government of the Bahamas to the king, while retaining title to the land. In 1717 [[George I of Great Britain|King George]] appointed Rogers governor of the Bahamas and issued a proclamation granting a pardon to any pirate who surrendered to a British governor within one year.<ref>Albury:69-74<br>Craton:93-6<br>Johnson:7-8<br>Woodard:117-121, 163-168</ref>\n\nWord of the appointment of a new governor and of the offer of pardons reached Nassau ahead of Rogers and his forces. Some of the pirates were willing to accept a pardon and retire from piracy. [[Henry Jennings]] and Christopher Winter, sailed off to find British authorities to confirm their acceptance of the amnesty.\n\nOthers were not ready to give up. Many of those were [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], supporters of the [[House of Stuart]], who identified as enemies of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King George. Still others simply identified as rebels, or thought they were better off as pirates than trying to earn an honest living. When a Royal Navy ship brought official word to Nassau of the pardon offer, many pirates planned to accept. Soon, however, the recalcitrant parties gained the upper hand, eventually forcing the Navy ship to leave.<ref>Woodard:226-29</ref>\n\n[[Blackbeard]], [[Stede Bonnet]], [[Nicholas Brown (pirate)|Nicholas Brown]] and Edmond Condent left the Bahamas for other territories. [[Charles Vane]], with \"[[Calico Jack]]\" Rackham and [[Edward England]] in his crew, came to prominence at this time. Vane worked to organize resistance to the anticipated arrival of Royal authority, even appealing to [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the Stuart [[pretender]], for aid in holding the Bahamas and capturing Bermuda for the Stuarts. As aid from the Stuarts failed to materialize and the date for Rogers' arrival approached, Vane and his crew prepared to leave Nassau.<ref>Woodard:236-40, 245-47, 259-61</ref>\n\nWoodes Rogers arrived in Nassau in late July 1718, with his own 460-ton warship, three ships belonging to his company, and an escort of three ships of the Royal Navy. Vane's ship was trapped in Nassau harbor. His crew set that ship on fire, sending it towards Rogers' ships, and escaped in the ensuing confusion in a smaller ship they had seized from another pirate. The remaining population welcomed Rogers; they comprised about 200 settlers and 500 to 700 pirates who wanted to receive pardons, most prominently [[Benjamin Hornigold]].<ref>Woodard:247-48, 262-67</ref> After the pirates' surrender, the Proprietors leased their land in the Bahamas to Rogers' company for 21 years.\n\nRogers controlled Nassau, but Charles Vane was loose and threatening to drive the governor and his forces out. Learning that the King of Spain wanted to expel English from the islands, Rogers worked to improve the defenses of Nassau. He lost nearly 100 men of the new forces due to an unidentified disease, and the Navy ships left for other assignments. Rogers sent four of his ships to Havana to assure the Spanish governor that he was suppressing piracy and to trade for supplies. The crews of ex-pirates and men who had come with Rogers all turned to piracy. The ex-pirate Benjamin Hornigold later caught ten men at [[Green Turtle Cay]] as part of Rogers' suppression effort. Eight were found guilty and hanged in front of the fort.<ref>Woodard:268-72, 286, 301-04</ref>\n\nVane attacked several small settlements in the Bahamas but, after he refused to attack a stronger French frigate, he was deposed for cowardice and replaced as captain by \"[[Calico Jack]]\" Rackham. Vane never returned to the Bahamas; he was eventually caught, convicted and executed in Jamaica. After nearly being captured by Jamaican privateers, and hearing that the king had extended the deadline for pardons for piracy, Rackham and his crew returned to Nassau to surrender to Woodes Rogers.\n\nIn Nassau Rackham became involved with [[Anne Bonny]]; he tried to arrange an annulment of her marriage to another ex-pirate, James Bonny. Rogers blocked the annulment, and Rackham and Bonny left Nassau to be pirates again, taking a small crew and Bonny's friend [[Mary Read]] with them. Within months, Rackham, Bonny and Read were captured and taken to Jamaica. They were convicted of piracy, and Rackham was executed. Bonny and Read were sent to prison, as both were pregnant and therefore excluded from execution. Read died in prison, while Bonny's fate is unknown.<ref>Woodard:304-10, 315-20</ref>\n\nWhen Britain and Spain went to war again in 1719, many of the ex-pirates were commissioned by the British government as privateers. A Spanish invasion fleet set out for the Bahamas, but was diverted to [[Pensacola, Florida]] when it was seized by the French. Rogers continued to improve the defenses of Nassau, spending his personal fortune and going heavily into debt to do so. In 1720, the [[Raid on Nassau (1720)|Spaniards finally attacked Nassau]]. Rogers returned to Britain in 1722 to plead for repayment of the money he had borrowed to build up Nassau, only to find he had been replaced as governor. He was sent to debtors' prison, although his creditors later absolved his debts, gaining him release.\n\nAfter the publication in 1724 of ''A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates,'' which praised Rogers' efforts to suppress piracy in the Bahamas, his fortunes began to improve. The king awarded him a pension, retroactive to 1721. In 1728 Rogers was appointed Governor of the Bahamas for a second term. He dissolved the colony's assembly when it would not approve taxes to repair Nassau's defenses. He died in Nassau in 1732.<ref>Woodard:311-14, 325-28</ref>\n\n==Mid-century==\nIn 1741, Governor [[John Tinker (governor)|John Tinker]] and Peter Henry Bruce constructed [[Fort Montague]]. Additionally, the Governor also reported a privateering boom in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in North America. He also reported that over 2300 sumptuous houses were built. In 1768 Governor William Shirley filled in mosquito-breeding swamps and extended Nassau.\n\n==Loyalists, slaves and Black Seminoles==\nDuring the [[American War of Independence]] the Bahamas [[Capture of the Bahamas (1782)|fell to Spanish forces]] under [[Bernardo de Galvez|General Galvez]] in 1782. A British-American Loyalist expedition led by Colonel [[Andrew Deveaux]], [[Capture of the Bahamas (1783)|recaptured the islands]] in 1783. After the [[American Revolution]], the British issued land grants to [[American Loyalists]] who  had gone into exile from the newly established United  States. The sparse population of the Bahamas tripled within a few years. The Loyalists developed cotton as a commodity crop, but it dwindled from insect damage and soil exhaustion. In addition to slaves they brought with them, the planters' descendants imported more African slaves for labour.\n\nMost of the current inhabitants in the islands are descended from the slaves brought to work on the Loyalist plantations. In addition, thousands of captive Africans, who were liberated from foreign slave ships by the British navy after the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolition of the British slave trade in 1807]], were resettled as free persons in the Bahamas.\n\nIn the early 1820s, following the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] ceding Florida from Spain to the United States, hundreds of African slaves and [[Black Seminoles]] escaped from Florida, most settling on [[Andros Island]] in the Bahamas. Three hundred escaped in a mass flight in 1823.<ref name=\"nps\">[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_details.htm?SPFID=9173&SPFTerritory=Florida&SPFType=Site&SPFKeywords=Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park \"Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park\"], ''Network to Freedom,'' National Park Service, 2010, accessed 10 April 2013.</ref> While the flow was reduced by federal construction of a lighthouse at [[Cape Florida Lighthouse|Cape Florida]] in 1825, slaves continued to find freedom in the Bahamas.<ref name=\"nps\"/>\n\nIn August 1834, the traditional plantation life ended with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|British emancipation of slaves throughout most of its colonies]]. [[Freedmen]] chose to work on their own small plots of land when possible.\n\n==Post-emancipation==\n{{Main|Bahamas and the American Civil War}}\nIn the 1830s and 1840s, tensions rose between Britain and the United States after American merchant ships, part of the coastwise slave trade, put into Nassau or were wrecked on its reefs. These included the ''[[Hermosa (slave ship)|Hermosa]]'' (1840) and the ''[[Creole case|Creole]]'' (1841), the latter brought in after a slave revolt on board. Britain had notified nations that slaves brought into Bahama and Bermuda waters would be forfeited and freed the slaves, refusing US efforts to recover them.<ref name=\"horne\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=XTLFKrmJPgcC&dq=%22children+of+the+enterprise%22+musson Gerald Horne, ''Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation''], New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, pp. 107-108</ref> In 1853 Britain and the US signed a claims treaty and submitted to arbitration for claims dating to 1814; they paid each other in 1855.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the Bahamas prospered as a base for Confederate blockade-running, bringing in cotton to be shipped to the mills of England and running out arms and munitions. None of these provided any lasting prosperity to the islands, nor did attempts to grow different kinds of crops for export.\n\nWith emancipation, Caribbean societies inherited a rigid racial stratification that was reinforced by the unequal distribution of wealth and power. The three-tier race structure, of whites, [[mixed-race]], and primarily blacks, who comprised the large majority, existed well into the 1940s and in some societies beyond. Like African Americans, many also have European and Native American ancestry. Caribbean societies continue to struggle with racial issues.\n\n==Late-colonial period==\nIn 1911, there was a short-lived movement to make the Bahamas part of [[Canada]]. Although the movement enjoyed the support of many in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and from the head of [[Sun Life Financial|Sun Life]], a Canadian insurance company, the movement failed. The failure of the movement was, in part, due to the British government's opposition to uniting a predominantly Black colony with a predominantly white country.<ref>Smith, Andrew. 2009. \"Thomas Bassett Macaulay and the Bahamas: Racism, Business and Canadian Sub-imperialism\".

Freeport, on the island of Grand Bahama, was established as a free trade zone in the 1950s and became the Bahama\u2018s second city. [[Bank secrecy]] combined with the lack of corporate and income taxes led to a rapid growth in the offshore financial sector during the postwar years.\n\nThe fourth [[James Bond films|James Bond film]], ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', was partly filmed in 1965 in Nassau.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the islands had become a major center for the drug trade, with 90% of all the [[cocaine]] entering the [[United States]] reportedly passing through the Bahamas. Diplomatic relations were established with [[Cuba]] in 1974. A decade later, as increased Cuban immigration to the islands strained the Bahamas\u2019 resources, Cuba refused to sign a letter of repatriation.\n\nIn September 2004, [[Hurricane Frances]] swept through the Bahamas, leaving widespread damage in its wake. Just three weeks later, Hurricane Jeanne uprooted trees, blew out windows, and sent seawater flooding through neighborhoods on the islands of [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]] and [[Grand Bahama]]. Receding floodwaters left boats tossed on roads and homes battered.\n\nThe College of the Bahamas was founded in 1974 and provided the nation\u2019s higher or tertiary education. The College was chartered in 2016 as the [[University of the Bahamas]], offering baccalaureate, masters and associate degrees, on three campuses and teaching and research centres throughout the Bahamas.\n\nBased on the twin pillars of tourism and offshore finance, the Bahamian economy has prospered since the 1950s. However, there remain significant challenges in areas such as education, health care, housing, international narcotics trafficking and illegal immigration from Haiti.\n\n==Political developments==\nModern political development began after World War II. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s. The [[Progressive Liberal Party]] was formed in 1953, and the [[United Bahamian Party]] was formed in 1956.\n\nBahamians achieved self-government in 1964, with [[Sir Roland Symonette]], of the United Bahamian Party, as the first Premier. The Bahamas achieved full independence as a [[Commonwealth realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 10 July 1973. Sir [[Lynden O. Pindling]], leader of the Progressive Liberal Party,  became the first black Premier of the colony in 1967, and in 1968 the title was changed to [[Prime Minister of the Bahamas|Prime Minister]]. [[Sir Milo Butler]] was appointed the first [[Governor-General of the Bahamas]] (the official representative of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]) shortly after independence. Pindling was prime minister until 1992, during which the Bahamas benefited from tourism and foreign investment. He was succeeded by [[Hubert Ingraham]], leader of the [[Free National Movement]], who was prime minister until 2002.\n\n==See also==\n*[[British colonization of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the Americas]]\n*[[History of the British West Indies]]\n*[[History of North America]]\n*[[History of the Caribbean]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of the Bahamas]]\n*[[Politics of the Bahamas]]\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Albury, Paul.

[2000] (2000). The Chinese Have a Word for it: The Complete Guide to Chinese thought and Culture. McGraw-Hill Professional. {{ISBN|0-658-01078-6}}</ref> From the late [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046\u2013256 BCE) onwards, traditional Chinese society was organized into a hierarchic system of socio-economic classes known as the [[four occupations]].\n\nHowever, this system did not cover all social groups while the distinctions between all groups became blurred ever since the [[commercialism|commercialization]] of Chinese culture in the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279 CE). [[History of education in China|Ancient Chinese education]] also has a long history; ever since the [[Sui dynasty]] (581\u2013618 CE) educated candidates prepared for the imperial examinations which drafted exam graduates into government as [[scholar-bureaucrats]]. This led to the creation of a [[meritocracy]], although success was available only to males who could afford test preparation. Imperial examinations required applicants to write essays and demonstrate mastery of the Confucian classics. Those who passed the highest level of the exam became elite scholar-officials known as ''[[jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]]'', a highly esteemed socio-economic position. A major mythological structure developed around the topic of the [[Imperial examination in Chinese mythology|mythology of the imperial exams]]. Trades and crafts were usually taught by a [[Sifu|shifu]]. The female historian [[Ban Zhao]] wrote the ''[[Lessons for Women]]'' in the [[Han dynasty]] and outlined the [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Han dynasty|four virtues women must abide to]], while scholars such as [[Zhu Xi]] and [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] would expand upon this. [[Chinese marriage]] and [[Taoist sexual practices]] are some of the rituals and customs found in society.\n\nWith the rise of European economic and military power beginning in the mid-19th century, non-Chinese systems of social and political organization gained adherents in China. Some of these would-be reformers totally rejected China's cultural legacy, while others sought to combine the strengths of Chinese and European cultures. In essence, the history of 20th-century China is one of experimentation with new systems of social, political, and economic organization that would allow for the reintegration of the nation in the wake of dynastic collapse.\n\n==Spiritual values==\n[[File:Hanging Monastery 02.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hanging Monastery]], a temple with the combination of [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].]]\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | header =\n | image1 = \u6cb3\u5357 \u6d1b\u9633 \u9f99\u95e8\u77f3\u7a9f - panoramio.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = The Fengxian cave (c. 675 AD) of the [[Longmen Grottoes]], commissioned by [[Wu Zetian]].\n | image2 = \u6d1b\u9633\u9f99\u95e8\u77f3\u7a9f\uff0cLuo Yang Dragon Gate Grottoes - panoramio (9).jpg\n | alt2 = Luo Yang Dragon Gate Grottoes\n | caption2 = Inside a cave of [[Longmen Grottoes]]\n}}\n{{Main|Chinese spiritual world concepts|Chinese Buddhism|Chinese mythology}}\nMost spirituality are derived from [[Chinese Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The subject of which school was the most influential is always debated as many concepts such as [[Neo-Confucianism]], [[Buddhism in China|Buddhism]] and many others have come about. [[Reincarnation]] and other [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] concept is a reminder of the connection between real-life and the after-life. In Chinese business culture, the concept of ''[[guanxi]]'', indicating the primacy of relations over rules, has been well documented.<ref>Alon, Ilan, ed. (2003), Chinese Culture, Organizational Behavior, and International Business Management, Westport, Connecticut: Praeger Publishers.</ref> While many [[Chinese mythology#Important mythologies and deities|deities]] are part of the tradition, some of the most recognized holy figures include [[Guan Yin]], the [[Jade Emperor]] and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].\n\nChinese Buddhism has shaped Chinese culture in a wide variety of areas including [[Chinese literature|art]], politics, [[Chinese literature|literature]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], [[Chinese medicine|medicine]], and material culture. The translation of a large body of Indian Buddhist scriptures into Chinese and the inclusion of these translations together with works composed in China into a printed canon had far-reaching implications for the dissemination of [[Buddhism]] throughout China. Chinese Buddhism is also marked by the interaction between [[religion in India|Indian religions]], Chinese religion, and [[Taoism]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in China|Taoism|Chinese folk religion|Fortune-telling#Eastern fortune telling}}\n\nChinese religion was originally oriented to worshipping the supreme god [[Shang Di]] during the Xia and Shang dynasties, with the king and diviners acting as priests and using [[oracle bones]]. The Zhou dynasty oriented it to worshipping the broader concept of heaven. A large part of Chinese culture is based on the notion that a spiritual world exists. Countless [[methods of divination]] have helped answer questions, even serving as an alternative to medicine. [[Chinese folklore|Folklores]] have helped fill the gap between things that cannot be explained. There is often a blurred line between myth, religion and unexplained phenomenon. Many of the stories have since evolved into [[traditional Chinese holidays]]. Other concepts have extended to the outside of mythology into spiritual symbols such as [[Door god]] and the [[Imperial guardian lions]]. Along with the belief of the holy, there is also the evil. Practices such as Taoist [[exorcism]] fighting [[Mogwai (Chinese culture)|mogwai]] and [[jiangshi]] with peachwood swords are just some of the concepts passed down from generations. A few [[Fortune-telling#Eastern fortune telling|Chinese fortune telling]] rituals are still in use today after thousands of years of refinement.\n\nTaoism is a religious or philosophical tradition of [[China|Chinese]] origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the ''[[Tao]]'' ({{lang|zh|[[Wikt:\u9053|\u9053]]}}, literally \"Way\", [[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanized as ''Dao'']]). The ''Tao'' is a fundamental idea in most [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosophical]] schools; in Taoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists.<ref name=\"Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor 2011 164\">{{Cite book | title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart |author1= Pollard |author2=Rosenberg |author3=Tignor  | first = Elizabeth; Clifford; Robert | publisher = Norton | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780393918472 | location = New York, New York | page = 164}}</ref><ref name=Creel>{{cite book | author = Creel | date = 1970 | title = What Is Taoism? | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&pg=PA48 | pages = 48, 62\u201363| isbn = 9780226120478 }}</ref> Taoism differs from [[Confucianism]] by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order.<ref name=\"Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor 2011 164\"/> Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize ''[[wu wei]]'' (effortless action), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]: \u6148 \"compassion\", \u5109/\u4fed \"frugality\", and \u8c26 \"humility\". The roots of Taoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yinyang]] (Naturalists), and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture, the ''[[I Ching|Yijing]]'', which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature. The \"[[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]\" [[Shen Buhai]] may also have been a major influence, expounding a [[realpolitik]] of wu wei.<ref name=Creel/><ref>S.Y.

A number of more [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] strains of thought have also been influential, such as [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].There was often conflict between the philosophies, e.g. the [[Song dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]] believed Legalism departed from the original spirit of Confucianism. Examinations and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today.

The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] and [[social consciousness]] up to the present day in China and across East Asia. The [[intellectual]] society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government, war, and diplomacy. This period ended with the rise of the imperial [[Qin Dynasty]] and the subsequent [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purge of dissent]]. A traditional source for this period is the ''Shiji'', or ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Sima Qian]]. The autobiographical section of the ''Shiji'', the \"Taishigong Zixu\" (\u592a\u53f2\u516c\u81ea\u5e8f), refers to the schools of thought described below.\n\nMohism was an [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese philosophy]] of [[logic]], [[rational]] thought and [[science]] developed by the [[academic]] [[scholars]] who studied under the ancient Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] (c. 470 BC\u2013c. 391 BC) and embodied in an eponymous book: the ''[[Mozi (book)|Mozi]]''. Another group is the School of the Military (\u5175\u5bb6; ''Bingjia'') that studied warfare and strategy; [[Sunzi]] and [[Sun Bin]] were influential leaders. The School of Naturalists was a [[Warring States]] era philosophy that synthesized the concepts of [[yin-yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]]; [[Zou Yan]] is considered the founder of this school.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang (light, hot, male, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth).\n\n==Language==\n[[File:Map of sinitic languages cropped-en.svg|thumb|right|Range of Chinese dialect groups according to the ''Language Atlas of China''.<ref>Wurm, Li, Baumann, Lee (1987) {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref>]]\n{{Main|Chinese language|History of Mandarin}}\n\nThe ancient written standard was [[Classical Chinese]]. It was used for thousands of years, but was mostly used by scholars and intellectuals which forms the \"top\" class of the society called \"shi da fu (\u58eb\u5927\u592b)\". It was difficult but possible for ordinary people to promote to this class by passing written exams. Calligraphy later became commercialized, and works by famous artists became prized possessions. [[Chinese literature]] has a long past; the earliest classic work in Chinese, the ''[[I Ching]]'' or \"Book of Changes\" dates to around 1000 BC. A flourishing of philosophy during the [[Warring States period]] produced such noteworthy works as Confucius's ''[[Analects]]'' and [[Laozi]]'s ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''. (See also: the [[Chinese classics]].) Dynastic histories were often written, beginning with [[Sima Qian]]'s seminal ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', which was written from 109 BC to 91 BC.The Tang dynasty witnessed a [[Chinese poetry|poetic]] flowering, while the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] of Chinese literature were written during the Ming and Qing dynasties. [[Printmaking]] in the form of [[movable type]] was developed during the [[Song dynasty]]. Academies of scholars sponsored by the empire were formed to comment on the classics in both printed and handwritten form. Royalty frequently participated in these discussions as well.\n\nChinese philosophers, writers and poets were highly respected and played key roles in preserving and promoting the culture of the empire. Some classical scholars, however, were noted for their daring depictions of the lives of the common people, often to the displeasure of authorities. At the start of the 20th century, most of the population were still [[illiterate]], and the many mutually-unintelligible languages spoken ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] ([[Cantonese]]), [[Min Nan]] (Ban-lam-gu), [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], [[Huizhou Chinese|Hui]], [[Pinghua|Ping]] etc.) in different regions prevented communication with people from other areas. Nevertheless, the written language keeps the communication open and passing the official orders and documentations throughout the entire region of China. Reformers set out to establish a national language, settling on the Beijing-based [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as the spoken form. After the [[May 4th Movement]], Classical Chinese was quickly replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]], modeled after the vocabulary and grammar of the standard spoken language.<ref>{{cite book\n  | first = S.

By the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese culture would embark on a new era with [[written vernacular Chinese]] for the common citizens. [[Hu Shih]] and [[Lu Xun]] would be pioneers in modern literature. After the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], the study of Chinese modern literature has gradually been increased over time.

''Ci'' use a set of [[poetic meter]]s derived from a base set of certain patterns, in fixed-rhythm, fixed-tone, and variable line-length formal types, or model examples: the rhythmic and tonal pattern of the ''ci'' are based upon certain, definitive musical song tunes. They are also known as ''Changduanju'' (\u9577\u77ed\u53e5/\u957f\u77ed\u53e5, \"lines of irregular lengths\") and ''Shiyu'' (\u8a69\u9918/\u8bd7\u9980, \"that which is beside poetry\").Typically the number of [[Chinese character|characters]] in each line and the arrangement of [[Tonal language|tones]] were determined by one of around 800 set patterns, each associated with a particular title, called ''c\u00edp\u00e1i'' \u8a5e\u724c/\u8bcd\u724c. Originally they were written to be sung to a tune of that title, with set rhythm, [[rhyme]], and tempo. The [[Song dynasty]] was also a period of great scientific literature, and saw the creation of works such as [[Su Song]]'s ''Xin Yixiang Fayao'' and [[Shen Kuo]]'s ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]''. There were also enormous works of historiography and large encyclopedias, such as [[Sima Guang]]'s ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' of 1084 or the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'' fully compiled and edited by the 11th century.\n\n[[Listing of noted Confucianists|Notable Confucianists]], [[Listing of noted Taoists|Taoists]] and scholars of all classes have made significant contributions to and from documenting history to authoring saintly concepts that seem hundreds of years ahead of time. Although the oldest surviving textual examples of surviving ''ci'' are from 8th century CE [[Dunhuang manuscripts]],<ref>Frankel, 216 {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> beginning in the [[Six dynasties poetry|poetry]] of the [[Liang dynasty]], the ''ci'' followed the tradition of the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' and the ''[[yuefu]]'': they were lyrics which developed from anonymous popular songs into a sophisticated literary genre; although in the case of the ''ci'' form some of its fixed-rhythm patterns have an origin in [[Central Asia]]. The form was further developed in the [[Tang dynasty]]. Although the contributions of [[Li Bai|Li Bo]] (also known as Li Po, 701 \u2013 762) are fraught with historical doubt, certainly the Tang poet [[Wen Tingyun]] (812\u2013870) was a great master of the ''ci'', writing it in its distinct and mature form.<ref>Davis, lxvii {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> One of the more notable practitioners and developers of this form was [[Li Houzhu|Li Yu]] of the [[Southern Tang]] Dynasty during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. However, the ''ci'' form of Classical Chinese poetry is especially associated with the [[Song poetry|poetry of the Song Dynasty]], during which it was indeed a popular poetic form. A revival of the ''ci'' poetry form occurred during the end of the [[Ming dynasty]] and the beginning of the [[Qing dynasty]] which was characterized by an exploration of the emotions connected with romantic love together with its valorization, often in a context of a brief poetic story narrative within a ''ci'' poem or a linked group of ''ci'' poems in an application of the ''[[chuanqi (short story)|chuanqi]]'' form of short story tales to poetry.<ref>Zhang, 76\u201380 {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Qu'' in Yuan dynasty===\n{{Main|Qu (poetry)}}\n\nThe ''Qu'' form of poetry is a type of [[Classical Chinese poetry forms|Classical Chinese poetry form]], consisting of words written in one of a number of certain, set [[tone pattern]]s, based upon the tunes of various songs. Thus '''''Qu''''' poems are lyrics with lines of varying longer and shorter lengths, set according to the certain and specific, fixed patterns of rhyme and tone of conventional musical pieces upon which they are based and after which these matched variations in lyrics (or individual '''''Qu''''' poems) generally take their name.<ref>Yip, 306\u2013308 {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> The fixed-tone type of verse such as the '''''Qu''''' and the ''[[Ci (poetry)|ci]]'' together with the ''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]'' and ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'' forms of poetry comprise the three main forms of [[Classical Chinese poetry]]. In [[Chinese literature]], the '''''Qu''''' ({{Zh|c=\u66f2|p=q\u01d4|w=ch\u00fc}}) form of poetry from the [[Yuan dynasty]] may be called ''Yuanqu'' (\u5143\u66f2 P: ''Yu\u00e1nq\u01d4'', W: ''Y\u00fcan-ch\u00fc''). Qu may be derived from [[Chinese opera]], such as the ''[[Zaju]]'' (\u96dc\u5287/\u6742\u5267), in which case these Qu may be referred to as ''[[Chinese Sanqu poetry|sanqu]]'' (\u6563\u66f2). The ''San'' in ''Sanqu'' refers to the detached status of the ''Qu'' lyrics of this verse form: in other words, rather than being embedded as part of an opera performance the lyrics stand separately on their own. Since the ''Qu'' became popular during the late [[Southern Song]] dynasty, and reached a special height of popularity in the [[Yuan poetry|poetry]] of the Yuan dynasty, therefore it is often called ''Yuanqu'' (\u5143\u66f2), specifying the type of ''Qu'' found in [[Chinese opera]] typical of the Yuan dynasty era. Both ''Sanqu'' and ''Ci'' are lyrics written to fit a different melodies, but ''Sanqu'' differs from ''Ci'' in that it is more colloquial, and is allowed to contain ''Chenzi'' (\u896f\u5b57/\u886c\u5b57 \"filler words\" which are additional words to make a more complete meaning). ''Sanqu'' can be further divided into ''Xiaoling'' (\u5c0f\u4ee4) and ''Santao'' (\u6563\u5957), with the latter containing more than one melody.\n\n===The novels in Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty===\n[[File:Ming Dynasty wood carving books in Tian Yi Chamber colllection.JPG|thumb|Ming dynasty wood carving books in the [[Tian Yi Chamber]] collection]]\n{{Main|Four Great Classical Novels}}\nThe Four Great Classical<ref>{{citation |title=The Encyclopedia of the Novel |series=''Encyclopedia of Literature'', Vol. 2 |contribution=Paper and Print Technology |last=Shep |first=Sydney J. |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |date=2011 |isbn=9781405161848 |page=596 |quote=''Dream of the Red Chamber''... is considered one of China's four great classical novels... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvFSRPx2uokC&printsec=frontcover }}</ref> or Classic Novels of [[Chinese literature]]<ref>{{citation |last=Li |first=Xiaobing |authormask=Li Xiaobing |url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=XJDcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |title=Modern China |series=Understanding Modern Nations |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=2016 |location=Sta Barbara |p=[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=XJDcCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA269 269] |contribution=Literature and Drama |quote=''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', ''Outlaws of the Marsh'', ''A Dream of Red Mansions'', and ''Journey to the West'' have become the Four Great Classic Novels of Chinese literature. |isbn=9781610696265 }}</ref>{{efn|Also known more simply as the '''Four Classic Novels'''.<ref>{{citation |editor-last=Cline |editor-first=Eric |editor2-last= Tak\u00e1cs |editor2-first=Sarolta Anna |url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=SPcvCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |p=[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=SPcvCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA508 508] |title=The Ancient World, ''Vol. V'' |date=2015 |contribution=Language and Writing: Chinese Literature |quote=Chinese authors finally produced novels during the Yuan dynasty... when two of China's 'Four Classic Novels' \u2013 ''Water Margin'' and ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' \u2013 were published.|isbn=9781317458395 }}</ref>}} are the four [[novels]] commonly regarded by Chinese literary criticism to be the greatest and most influential of pre-modern Chinese fiction.  Dating from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, they are well known to most Chinese either directly or through their many adaptations to [[Chinese opera]] and other forms of [[popular culture]]. They are among the world's longest and oldest novels and are considered to be the pinnacle of China's literary achievement in classic novels, influencing the creation of many stories, plays, movies, games, and other forms of entertainment across other parts of East Asia.\n\nChinese fiction, rooted in narrative classics such as ''[[A New Account of the Tales of the World|Shishuo Xinyu]]'', ''[[Soushen Ji|Sou Shen Ji]]'', ''[[Wenyuan Yinghua]]'', ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions|Da Tang Xiyu Ji]]'', ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang|Youyang Zazu]]'', ''[[Taiping Guangji]]'', and official histories, developed into the [[novel]] as early as the [[Song dynasty]]. The novel as an extended prose narrative which realistically creates a believable world of its own evolved in China and in Europe from the 14th to 18th centuries, though a little earlier in China. Chinese audiences were more interested in history and were more historically minded. They appreciated relative optimism, moral humanism, and relative emphasis on collective behavior and the welfare of the society.<ref>Ropp, 1990, p310-311 {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of a money economy and urbanization beginning in the Song era led to a professionalization of entertainment which was further encouraged by the spread of printing, the rise of literacy, and education. In both China and Western Europe, the novel gradually became more autobiographical and serious in exploration of social, moral, and philosophical problems. Chinese fiction of the late [[Ming dynasty]] and early [[Qing dynasty]] was varied, self-conscious, and experimental. In China, however, there was no counterpart to the 19th-century European explosion of novels. The novels of the Ming and early Qing dynasties represented a pinnacle of classic Chinese fiction.<ref>Ropp, 1990, p311 {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> The scholar and literary critic [[Andrew H. Plaks]] argues that ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', ''Water Margin'', ''Journey to the West'', and ''[[Jin Ping Mei|The Golden Lotus]]'' collectively constituted a technical breakthrough reflecting new cultural values and intellectual concerns. Their educated editors, authors, and commentators used the [[Narrative|narrative conventions]] developed from [[Huaben (Chinese novella)|earlier story-tellers]], such as the episodic structure, interspersed songs and folk sayings, or speaking directly to the reader, but they fashioned self-consciously ironic narratives whose seeming familiarity camouflaged a Neo-Confucian moral critique of late Ming decadence. Plaks explores the textual history of the novels (all published after their author's deaths, usually anonymously) and how the ironic and satiric devices of these novels paved the way for the great novels of the 18th century.<ref>Andrew H. Plaks, ''Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1987), esp. pp. 497\u201398.</ref> Plaks further shows these Ming novels share formal characteristics.\n\n==Fashion and clothing==\n{{Main|Chinese clothing|Ancient Chinese clothing|Qipao}}\nChina's fashion history covers hundreds of years with some of the most colorful and diverse arrangements. Different social classes in different eras boast different fashion trends, the color yellow was usually reserved for the emperor during China's Imperial era.\n\n===Pre-Qing===\n\n[[File:\u7ae0\u61f7\u592a\u5b50\u5893\u58c1\u756b\u79ae\u8cd3\u5716a.jpg|thumb|Tang dynasty mural from [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Li Xian]]'s tomb in [[Qianling Mausoleum|Qianling]] showing Han nobility clothing of the era.]]\n\nFrom the beginning of its history, [[Ancient Chinese clothing|Han clothing]] (especially in elite circles) was inseparable from [[silk]], supposedly discovered by the [[Yellow Emperor|Yellow Emperor's]] consort, [[Leizu]]. The dynasty to follow the Shang, the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]], established a strict hierarchical society that used clothing as a status meridian, and inevitably, the height of one's rank influenced the ornateness of a costume. Such markers included the length of a skirt, the wideness of a sleeve and the degree of ornamentation. In addition to these class-oriented developments, Han Chinese clothing became looser, with the introduction of wide sleeves and jade decorations hung from the sash which served to keep the ''yi'' closed. The ''yi'' was essentially wrapped over, in a style known as ''jiaoling youren'', or wrapping the right side over before the left, because of the initially greater challenge to the right-handed wearer (people of Zhongyuan discouraged [[left-handedness]] like many other historical cultures, considering it unnatural, barbarian, uncivilized, and unfortunate). The [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600 BC \u2013 1046 BC), developed the rudiments of Chinese clothing; it consisted of a ''yi'', a narrow-cuffed, knee-length tunic tied with a sash, and a narrow, ankle-length skirt, called ''chang'', worn with a ''bixi'', a length of fabric that reached the knees.  Vivid primary colors and green were used, due to the degree of technology at the time.\n\n===Qipao===\n[[File:Portrait of the Qianlong Emperor in Court Dress.jpg|thumb|left|[[Qianlong Emperor]] (A [[Chinese Emperor]] of [[Qing Dynasty]]) wore Manchurian Chinese-clothing \u2013 [[Qipao]].(\u65d7\u888d)]]\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], China's last imperial dynasty, a dramatic shift of clothing occurred, examples of which include the [[cheongsam]] (or qipao in Mandarin). The clothing of the era before the Qing dynasty is referred to as [[Hanfu]] or traditional [[Han Chinese clothing]]. Many symbols such as [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] have been used for decorative as well as economic purposes. Among them were the ''[[Banner system|Banners]]'' (''q\u00ed''), mostly Manchu, who as a group were called ''Banner People'' ([[wikt:\u65d7\u4eba|\u65d7\u4eba]] [[pinyin]]: ''q\u00ed r\u00e9n''). [[Manchu]] women typically wore a one-piece dress that retrospectively came to be known as the ''q\u00edp\u00e1o'' ([[wikt:\u65d7\u888d|\u65d7\u888d]], [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: ''sijigiyan'' or ''banner gown''). The generic term for both the male and the female forms of Manchu dress, essentially similar garments, was ''ch\u00e1ngp\u00e1o'' ([[wikt:\u957f\u888d|\u9577\u888d]]/\u957f\u888d). The ''qipao'' fitted loosely and hung straight down the body, or flared slightly in an A-line. Under the dynastic laws after 1636, all [[Han Chinese]] in the banner system were forced to adopt the Manchu male hairstyle of wearing a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] as did all Manchu men and dress in Manchu ''qipao.'' However, the order for ordinary non-Banner Han civilians to wear Manchu clothing was lifted and only Han who served as officials were required to wear Manchu clothing, with the rest of the civilian Han population dressing however they wanted. Qipao covered most of the woman's body, revealing only the head, hands, and the tips of the toes.  The baggy nature of the clothing also served to conceal the figure of the wearer regardless of age.  With time, though, the ''qipao'' were tailored to become more form fitting and revealing. The modern version, which is now recognized popularly in China as the \"standard\" ''qipao'', was first developed in [[Shanghai]] in the 1920s, partly under the influence of Beijing styles. People eagerly sought a more modernized style of dress and transformed the old ''qipao'' to suit their tastes.  Slender and form fitting with a high cut, it had great differences from the traditional ''qipao''. It was high-class [[courtesans]] and celebrities in the city that would make these redesigned tight fitting ''qipao'' popular at that time.<ref>[http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/14703448.html \u65d7\u888d\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0e\u54ea\u4e2a\u6c11\u65cf?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In Shanghai it was first known as ''zansae'' or \"long dress\" (\u9577\u886b\u2014Mandarin Chinese: ch\u00e1ngsh\u0101n; [[Shanghainese]]: ''zansae''; Cantonese: ''ch\u00e8uhngs\u0101am''), and it is this name that survives in English as the \"cheongsam\". Most Han civilian men eventually voluntarily adopted Manchu clothing while Han women continued wearing Han clothing. Until 1911, the changpao was required clothing for Chinese men of a certain class, but Han Chinese women continued to wear loose jacket and trousers, with an overskirt for formal occasions.  The ''qipao'' was a new fashion item for Han Chinese women when they started wearing it around 1925.The original ''qipao'' was wide and loose. As hosiery in turn declined in later decades, cheongsams nowadays have come to be most commonly worn with bare legs.\n\n==Arts==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Ts'ui Po 002.jpg\n | alt1 = Ts'ui Po 002\n | caption1 = Close up on ''Double Happiness (Cui Bai)''.

The Chinese art in the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and that of [[overseas Chinese]] can also be considered part of Chinese art where it is based in or draws on Chinese heritage and Chinese culture. Early \"[[stone age]] art\" dates back to 10,000 BC, mostly consisting of simple [[pottery]] and sculptures. After this early period Chinese art, like Chinese history, is typically classified by the succession of ruling [[Dynasty|dynasties]] of [[Chinese emperors]], most of which lasted several hundred years.\n\nChinese art has arguably the oldest continuous tradition in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the [[Renaissance]] as the [[decorative arts]] are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in [[Chinese ceramics]].\n\nDifferent forms of art have swayed under the influence of great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political figures. Chinese art encompasses all facets of [[fine art]], [[Chinese folk art|folk art]] and [[performance art]]. [[Chinese ceramics|Porcelain pottery]] was one of the first forms of art in the [[List of Palaeolithic sites in China|Palaeolithic]] period. Early Chinese music and poetry was influenced by the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Book of Songs]]'', and the Chinese poet and statesman [[Qu Yuan]].\n\n[[Chinese painting]] became a highly appreciated art in court circles encompassing a wide variety of [[Shan shui]] with specialized styles such as [[Ming dynasty painting]]. Early [[List of traditional Chinese musical instruments|Chinese music]] was based on percussion instruments, which later gave away to stringed and reed instruments. By the [[Han dynasty]] [[Chinese Paper Cutting|papercutting]] became a new art form after the invention of paper. [[Chinese opera]] would also be introduced and branched regionally in addition to other performance formats such as [[Chinese variety arts|variety arts]].\n\n===Chinese lantern===\n[[File:Red lanterns, Spring Festival, Ditan Park Beijing.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Red lanterns are hung from the trees during the Chinese New Year celebrations in Ditan Park (Temple of Earth) in Beijing.]]\n{{Main|Paper lantern|Sky lantern}}\nThe Chinese paper lantern (\u7d19\u71c8\u7c60, \u7eb8\u706f\u7b3c) is a [[lantern]] made of thin, brightly colored paper.<ref name=freedictionary_lantern>{{cite web|title=Chinese lantern|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Chinese+lantern|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> Paper lanterns come in various shapes and sizes, as well as various methods of construction. In their simplest form, they are simply a [[paper bag]] with a [[candle]] placed inside, although more complicated [[lantern]]s consist of a collapsible [[bamboo]] or metal frame of hoops covered with tough [[paper]]. Sometimes, other lanterns can be made out of colored silk (usually red) or vinyl. Silk lanterns are also collapsible with a metal expander and are decorated with Chinese characters and/or designs. The vinyl lanterns are more durable; they can resist rain, sunlight, and wind. Paper lanterns do not last very long, they soon break, and silk lanterns last longer. The gold paper on them will soon fade away to a pale white, and the red silk will become a mix between pink and red. Often associated with [[festival]]s, paper lanterns are common in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and similarly in [[Chinatown]]s with large communities of [[Overseas Chinese]], where they are often hung outside of businesses to attract attention. In Japan [[Traditional lighting equipment of Japan|the traditional styles]] include ''[[bonbori]]'' and ''ch\u014dchin'' and there is a special style of lettering called ''[[edomoji|ch\u014dchin moji]]'' used to write on them. Airborne paper lanterns are called [[sky lanterns]], and are often released into the night sky for aesthetic effect at [[lantern festival]]s.\n\nThe Chinese sky lantern (\u5929\u71c8, \u5929\u706f), also known as ''Kongming lantern'', is a small [[hot air balloon]] made of paper, with an opening at the bottom where a small fire is suspended. In Asia and elsewhere around the world, sky lanterns have been traditionally made for centuries, to be launched for play or as part of long-established festivities. The name \"sky lantern\" is a translation of the [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] name but they have also been referred to as ''sky candles'' or ''fire balloons''. The general design is a thin paper shell, which may be from about 30 [[centimetre|cm]] to a couple of [[metre]]s across, with an opening at the bottom. The opening is usually about 10 to 30&nbsp;cm wide (even for the largest shells), and is surrounded by a stiff collar that serves to suspend the [[flame]] source and to keep it away from the walls. When lit, the flame heats the air inside the lantern, thus lowering its density and causing the lantern to rise into the air. The sky lantern is only airborne for as long as the flame stays alight, after which the lantern sinks back to the ground.\n\n===Chinese hand fan===\n[[File:Non electric fan aka solfjader.jpg|thumb|A commercially produced scented wood folding fan, featuring a drawing of the [[Great Wall of China]].]]\nThe oldest existing Chinese fans are a pair of woven [[bamboo]], wood or paper side-mounted fans from the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutdecorativestyle.com/articles/history_fans.htm|title=articles \u2013 brief history of fans|work=aboutdecorativestyle.com}}</ref> The [[Chinese character]] for \"fan\" (\u6247) is etymologically derived from a picture of feathers under a roof. A particular status and gender would be associated with a specific type of fan. During the [[Song dynasty]], famous artists were often commissioned to paint fans.  The Chinese dancing fan was developed in the 7th century. The Chinese form of the hand fan was a row of feathers mounted in the end of a handle. In the later centuries, Chinese poems and four-word idioms were used to decorate the fans by using Chinese calligraphy pens.  In ancient China, fans came in various shapes and forms (such as in a leaf, oval or a half-moon shape), and were made in different materials such as silk, bamboo, feathers, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hand-fan.org/chinese_hand_fans.html|title=Chinese Hand Fans|work=hand-fan.org}}</ref>\n\n===Carved lacquer===\n[[File:Lacquered box with character for luck, Qianlong Period.JPG|thumb|left|Box with the character for \"Spring\" ({{lang|zh|\u6625}}), [[Qianlong]] period, [[Qing Dynasty]]. [[Nanjing Museum]]]]\n{{Main|Carved lacquer}}\nCarved lacquer or  ''Q\u012bdi\u0101o'' ({{zh|\u6f06\u96d5}}) is a distinctive Chinese form of decorated [[lacquerware]].  While lacquer has been used in China for at least 3,000 years,<ref name=\"Grove\">Grove</ref> the technique of carving into very thick coatings of it appears to have been developed in the 12th century CE. It is extremely time-consuming to produce, and has always been a luxury product, essentially restricted to China,<ref>Grove; Cinnabar</ref> though imitated in [[Japanese lacquerware|Japanese lacquer]] in somewhat different styles.  The producing process is called '''Di\u0101oq\u012b''' ({{lang|zh|\u96d5\u6f06}}/\u5f6b\u6f06, carving lacquer).Though most surviving examples are from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the main types of subject matter for the carvings were all begun under the [[Song dynasty]], and the development of both these and the technique of carving were essentially over by the early Ming.  These types were the abstract ''guri'' or Sword-Pommel pattern, figures in a landscape, and birds and plants.  To these some designs with religious symbols, animals, auspicious characters ''(right)'' and imperial dragons can be added.<ref name=\"Grove\"/> The objects made in the technique are a wide range of small types, but are mostly practical vessels or containers such as boxes, plates and trays. Some screens and pieces of [[Chinese furniture]] were made. Carved lacquer is only rarely combined with painting in lacquer and other lacquer techniques.<ref>Watt and Ford, 3</ref>\n\nLater Chinese writers dated the introduction of carved lacquer to the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013906), and many modern writers have pointed to some late Tang pieces of armour found on the [[Silk Road]] by [[Aurel Stein]] and now in the [[British Museum]].

This style uses a family of repeated two-branched scrolling shapes cut with a rounded profile at the surface, but below that a \"V\" section through layers of lacquer in different colours (black, red and yellow, and later green), giving a \"marbled\" effect from the contrasted colours; this technique is called ''t\u00ecx\u012b'' ({{lang|zh|\u5254\u7280}}/\u5243\u7280) in Chinese.  This style continued to be used up to the [[Ming dynasty]], especially on small boxes and jars with covers, though after the Song only red was often used, and the motifs were often carved with wider flat spaces at the bottom level to be exposed.<ref>Watt and Ford, 26\u201327, 46\u201361, 60 for the use of green; Rawson, 178; Grove, \"Song\"; Kuwayama, 13\u201317 on the Song</ref>\n\n===Folding screen===\n[[File:Hofmobiliendepot - Chinesischer Paravent.jpg|thumb|Chinese folding screen used at the Austrian imperial court, 18th century, the [[Imperial Furniture Collection]]]]\n{{Main|Folding screen}}\nA folding screen ({{zh|s=\u5c4f\u98ce|t=\u5c4f\u98a8}}) is a type of free-standing [[furniture]].

The earliest music of the Zhou dynasty recorded in ancient Chinese texts includes the ritual music called ''[[yayue]]'' and each piece may be associated with a dance. Some of the oldest written music dates back to [[Confucius]]'s time.  The first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was exemplified through the popularization of the [[Guqin|''qin'']] (plucked instrument with seven strings) during the [[Tang Dynasty]], although the instrument is known to have played a major role before the Han Dynasty.\n\n[[File:Bianlian.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bian Lian]](\"Face-Changing\") Performer]]\n\nThere are many [[musical instrument]]s that are integral to Chinese culture, such as the [[Xun (instrument)|Xun]] ([[Ocarina]]-type instrument that is also integral in Native American cultures), [[Guzheng]] (zither with movable bridges), [[guqin]] (bridgeless zither), [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]] and [[xiao (flute)|xiao]] (vertical flute), the [[erhu]] (alto fiddle or bowed lute), [[pipa]] (pear-shaped plucked lute), and many others.\n\nDance in China is a highly varied art form, consisting of many modern and traditional dance genres. The dances cover a wide range, from folk dances to performances in opera and ballet, and may be used in public celebrations, rituals and ceremonies. There are also 56 officially recognized [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups in China]], and each ethnic minority group in China also has its own folk dances.

The structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Since the Tang dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of East Asia such as [[Japanese architecture|Japan]] and [[Korean architecture|Korea]]. Chinese architecture, examples for which can be found from more than 2,000 years ago, is almost as old as Chinese civilization and has long been an important hallmark of Chinese culture. There are certain features common to Chinese architecture, regardless of specific regions, different provinces or use. The most important is [[symmetry]], which connotes a sense of grandeur as it applies to everything from palaces to farmhouses. One notable exception is in the design of gardens, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow, to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself. [[Feng shui]] has played a very important part in structural development.  The Chinese garden is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperors]] and members of the imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between [[man and nature]].<ref name=\"Michel Baridon p. 348\">Michel Baridon, ''Les Jardins \u2013 paysagistes, jardiners, po\u1e15ts''.  p. 348</ref> A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, rock works, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries.

The Chinese character ''gong'' (\u5bae; meaning \"palace\") represents two connected rooms (\u5442) under a roof (\u5b80). Originally the character applied to any residence or mansion, but it was used in reference to solely the imperial residence since the [[Qin dynasty]] (3rd century BC). A Chinese palace is composed of many buildings. It has large areas surrounded by walls and moats. It contains large halls (\u6bbf) for ceremonies and official business, as well as smaller buildings, [[Chinese temple|temples]], towers, residences, galleries, courtyards, [[Chinese garden|gardens]], and outbuildings. Apart from the main imperial palace, [[Chinese dynasties]] also had several other imperial palaces in the capital city where the empress, crown prince, or other members of the imperial family dwelled. There also existed palaces outside of the capital city called \"away palaces\" (\u96e2\u5bae/\u79bb\u5bab) where the emperors resided when traveling. Empress dowager [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Cixi]] (\u6148\u79a7\u592a\u540e) built the [[Summer Palace]] or Yiheyuan (\u9824\u548c\u5712/\u9890\u548c\u56ed \u2013 \"The Garden of Nurtured Harmony\") near the [[Old Summer Palace]], but on a much smaller scale than the Old Summer Palace.<ref>There are currently some projects in China to rebuild the Imperial Gardens, but this appears as a colossal undertaking, and no rebuilding has started.</ref>\n\n===Paifang===\n{{Main|Paifang}}\n\n''Paifang'', also known as a ''Pailou'', is a traditional style of [[China|Chinese]] [[Chinese architecture|architectural]] [[arch]] or gateway structure that is related to the [[India]]n ''[[Torana]]'' from which it is derived.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.H.

The largest division within a city in ancient China was a ''fang'' ({{zh|c=\u574a|hp=f\u0101ng|labels=no}}), equivalent to a current day [[ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]]. Each fang was enclosed by walls or fences, and the gates of these enclosures were shut and guarded every night. Each fang was further divided into several ''pai'' ({{zh|c=\u724c|hp=p\u00e1i|l=placard|labels=no}}), which is equivalent to a current day (unincorporated) community. Each pai, in turn, contained an area including several [[hutong]]s (alleyways). This system of urban administrative division and subdivision reached an elaborate level during the [[Tang dynasty]], and continued in the following dynasties. For example, during the [[Ming dynasty]], [[Beijing]] was divided into a total of 36 fangs. Originally, the word ''paifang'' referred to the gate of a fang and the marker for an entrance of a building complex or a town; but by the [[Song dynasty]], a paifang had evolved into a purely decorative monument.\n\n===Chinese garden===\n[[File:Jichang Yuan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Jichang Garden]] in [[Wuxi]] (1506\u20131521), built during the Ming Dynasty, is an exemplary work of South Chinese style garden.]]\n{{Main|Chinese garden}}\n\nThe Chinese garden is a landscape garden cantonese style which has evolved over the years. It includes both the vast gardens of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperors]] and members of the imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.<ref name=\"Michel Baridon p. 348\"/> A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, rock works, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings. The earliest recorded Chinese gardens were created in the valley of the [[Yellow River]], during the [[Shang dynasty]] (1600\u20131046 BC). These gardens were large enclosed parks where the kings and nobles hunted game, or where fruit and vegetables were grown. Early inscriptions from this period, carved on tortoise shells, have three Chinese characters for garden, ''you'', ''pu'' and ''yuan''.  ''You'' was a royal garden where birds and animals were kept, while pu was a garden for plants. During the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013206 BC), ''[[wikt:\u5712|yuan]]'' became the character for all gardens.<ref>Feng Chaoxiong, ''The Classical Gardens of Suzhou'', preface, and Bing Chiu, ''Jardins de Chine, ou la quete du paradis'', Editions de La Martiniere, Paris 2010, p. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\n[[File:Yellow Register Archives of the Ming Dynasty, Nanjing (flickr 1559896574).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Moon gate]] in a Chinese garden]]\n\nThe old character for  ''yuan'' is a small picture of a garden; it is enclosed in a square which can represent a wall, and has symbols which can represent the plan of a structure, a small square which can represent a pond, and a symbol for a plantation or a pomegranate tree.<ref>Tong Jun, Records of Jiang Gardens, cited in Feng Chanoxiong, ''The Classical Gardens of Suzhou''.</ref> According to the ''Shiji'', one of the most famous features of this garden was the ''Wine Pool and Meat Forest'' (\u9152\u6c60\u8089\u6797). A large pool, big enough for several small boats, was constructed on the palace grounds, with inner linings of polished oval shaped stones from the sea shores. The pool was then filled with wine. A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had skewers of roasted meat hanging from their branches. King Zhou and his friends and concubines drifted in their boats, drinking the wine with their hands and eating the roasted meat from the trees. Later Chinese philosophers and historians cited this garden as an example of decadence and bad taste.<ref name=Che>Che Bing Chiu, \"Jardins de Chine, ou la quete du paradis\"</ref>{{rp|11}} During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722\u2013481 BC), in 535 BC, the ''Terrace of Shanghua'', with lavishly decorated palaces, was built by [[King Jing of Zhou (Gui)|King Jing]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]]. In 505 BC, an even more elaborate garden, the ''Terrace of Gusu'', was begun. It was located on the side of a mountain, and included a series of terraces connected by galleries, along with a lake where boats in the form of blue dragons navigated. From the highest terrace, a view extended as far as [[Lake Tai]], the Great Lake.<ref name=Che/>{{rp|12}}\n\n==Martial arts==\n{{Main|Chinese martial arts|List of Chinese martial arts}}\nChina is one of the [[Origins of Asian martial arts|main birth places]] of Eastern martial arts. Chinese martial arts, often named under the [[umbrella term]]s ''[[Kung fu (term)|kung fu]]'' and ''[[Wushu (sport)|wushu]]'', are the [[Styles of Chinese martial arts|several hundred fighting styles]] that have developed over the centuries in China. These fighting styles are often classified according to common traits, identified as ''\"families\"'' (\u5bb6; {{transl|zh|''ji\u0101''}}), ''\"sects\"'' (\u6d3e; {{transl|zh|''p\u00e0i''}}) or ''\"schools\"'' (\u95e8/\u9580; {{transl|zh|''m\u00e9n''}}) of martial arts. Examples of such traits include ''[[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolinquan]]''  ({{zh|c=\u5c11\u6797\u62f3|labels=no}}) physical exercises involving [[Five Animals]] ({{zh|c=\u4e94\u5f62|labels=no}}) mimicry, or training methods inspired by [[Chinese philosophies|Old Chinese philosophies]], religions and legends. Styles that focus on [[qi]] manipulation are called ''\"[[Internal martial arts|internal]] \"''(\u5167\u5bb6\u62f3/\u5185\u5bb6\u62f3; {{transl|zh|''n\u00e8iji\u0101qu\u00e1n''}}), while others that concentrate on improving muscle and cardiovascular fitness are called ''\"[[External martial arts|external]]\"'' (\u5916\u5bb6\u62f3; {{transl|zh|''w\u00e0iji\u0101qu\u00e1n''}}).

China also includes the home to the well-respected [[Shaolin Monastery]] and [[Wudang Mountains]]. The first generation of art started more for the purpose of survival and warfare than art. Over time, some art forms have branched off, while others have retained a distinct Chinese flavor. Regardless, China has produced some of the most renowned martial artists including [[Wong Fei Hung]] and [[Chinese martial arts#Notable practitioners|many others]]. The arts have also co-existed with a variety of [[:Category:Chinese melee weapons|weapons]] including the more standard [[Eighteen Arms of Wushu|18 arms]]. Legendary and controversial moves like [[Dim Mak]] are also praised and talked about within the culture.\nMartial arts schools also teach the art of [[lion dance]], which has evolved from a pugilistic display of Kung Fu to an entertaining dance performance.\n\n==Leisure==\nA number of [[:Category:Chinese games|games]] and pastimes are popular within Chinese culture. The most common game is [[Mahjong]]. The same pieces are used for other styled games such as [[mahjong solitaire|Shanghai Solitaire]]. Others include [[pai gow]], [[pai gow poker]] and other [[Chinese dominoes|bone domino]] games. [[Weiqi]] and [[xiangqi]] are also popular. Ethnic games like [[Chinese yo-yo]] are also part of the culture where it is performed during social events. Qigong pronounced (Chi Kung) is the practice of spiritual, physical, and medical techniques. It is as a form of exercise and although it is commonly used among the elderly, any one of any age can practice it during their free time. With its combination of physical flexibility and movement, breathing technique, and constant state of focus and mediation, it has also been a way to cleanse and heal the body and helps get in touch with your inner-self. Qigong has continuous rhythmic movements that help reduce stress and build stamina as well as to improve certain functions of the body such as cardiovascular and digestive.\n\n==Cuisine==\n[[File:VegetableSpringRolls.JPG|thumb|[[Spring rolls]] are a large variety of filled, rolled appetizers or dim sum found in Chinese cuisine.

[[History of education in China|Ancient Chinese education]] also has a long history; ever since the [[Sui dynasty]] (581\u2013618 CE) educated candidates prepared for the imperial examinations which drafted exam graduates into government as [[scholar-bureaucrats]]. This led to the creation of a [[meritocracy]], although success was available only to males who could afford test preparation. Imperial examinations required applicants to write essays and demonstrate mastery of the Confucian classics. Those who passed the highest level of the exam became elite scholar-officials known as ''[[jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]]'', a highly esteemed socio-economic position. A major mythological structure developed around the topic of the [[Imperial examination in Chinese mythology|mythology of the imperial exams]]. Trades and crafts were usually taught by a [[Sifu|shifu]]. The female historian [[Ban Zhao]] wrote the ''[[Lessons for Women]]'' in the [[Han dynasty]] and outlined the [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Han dynasty|four virtues women must abide to]], while scholars such as [[Zhu Xi]] and [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] would expand upon this. [[Chinese marriage]] and [[Taoist sexual practices]] are some of the rituals and customs found in society.\n\nWith the rise of European economic and military power beginning in the mid-19th century, non-Chinese systems of social and political organization gained adherents in China. Some of these would-be reformers totally rejected China's cultural legacy, while others sought to combine the strengths of Chinese and European cultures. In essence, the history of 20th-century China is one of experimentation with new systems of social, political, and economic organization that would allow for the reintegration of the nation in the wake of dynastic collapse.\n\n==Spiritual values==\n[[File:Hanging Monastery 02.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hanging Monastery]], a temple with the combination of [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].]]\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | header =\n | image1 = \u6cb3\u5357 \u6d1b\u9633 \u9f99\u95e8\u77f3\u7a9f - panoramio.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = The Fengxian cave (c. 675 AD) of the [[Longmen Grottoes]], commissioned by [[Wu Zetian]].\n | image2 = \u6d1b\u9633\u9f99\u95e8\u77f3\u7a9f\uff0cLuo Yang Dragon Gate Grottoes - panoramio (9).jpg\n | alt2 = Luo Yang Dragon Gate Grottoes\n | caption2 = Inside a cave of [[Longmen Grottoes]]\n}}\n{{Main|Chinese spiritual world concepts|Chinese Buddhism|Chinese mythology}}\nMost spirituality are derived from [[Chinese Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The subject of which school was the most influential is always debated as many concepts such as [[Neo-Confucianism]], [[Buddhism in China|Buddhism]] and many others have come about. [[Reincarnation]] and other [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] concept is a reminder of the connection between real-life and the after-life. In Chinese business culture, the concept of ''[[guanxi]]'', indicating the primacy of relations over rules, has been well documented.<ref>Alon, Ilan, ed. (2003), Chinese Culture, Organizational Behavior, and International Business Management, Westport, Connecticut: Praeger Publishers.</ref> While many [[Chinese mythology#Important mythologies and deities|deities]] are part of the tradition, some of the most recognized holy figures include [[Guan Yin]], the [[Jade Emperor]] and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].\n\nChinese Buddhism has shaped Chinese culture in a wide variety of areas including [[Chinese literature|art]], politics, [[Chinese literature|literature]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], [[Chinese medicine|medicine]], and material culture. The translation of a large body of Indian Buddhist scriptures into Chinese and the inclusion of these translations together with works composed in China into a printed canon had far-reaching implications for the dissemination of [[Buddhism]] throughout China. Chinese Buddhism is also marked by the interaction between [[religion in India|Indian religions]], Chinese religion, and [[Taoism]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in China|Taoism|Chinese folk religion|Fortune-telling#Eastern fortune telling}}\n\nChinese religion was originally oriented to worshipping the supreme god [[Shang Di]] during the Xia and Shang dynasties, with the king and diviners acting as priests and using [[oracle bones]]. The Zhou dynasty oriented it to worshipping the broader concept of heaven. A large part of Chinese culture is based on the notion that a spiritual world exists. Countless [[methods of divination]] have helped answer questions, even serving as an alternative to medicine. [[Chinese folklore|Folklores]] have helped fill the gap between things that cannot be explained. There is often a blurred line between myth, religion and unexplained phenomenon. Many of the stories have since evolved into [[traditional Chinese holidays]]. Other concepts have extended to the outside of mythology into spiritual symbols such as [[Door god]] and the [[Imperial guardian lions]]. Along with the belief of the holy, there is also the evil. Practices such as Taoist [[exorcism]] fighting [[Mogwai (Chinese culture)|mogwai]] and [[jiangshi]] with peachwood swords are just some of the concepts passed down from generations. A few [[Fortune-telling#Eastern fortune telling|Chinese fortune telling]] rituals are still in use today after thousands of years of refinement.\n\nTaoism is a religious or philosophical tradition of [[China|Chinese]] origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the ''[[Tao]]'' ({{lang|zh|[[Wikt:\u9053|\u9053]]}}, literally \"Way\", [[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanized as ''Dao'']]). The ''Tao'' is a fundamental idea in most [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosophical]] schools; in Taoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists.<ref name=\"Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor 2011 164\">{{Cite book | title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart |author1= Pollard |author2=Rosenberg |author3=Tignor  | first = Elizabeth; Clifford; Robert | publisher = Norton | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780393918472 | location = New York, New York | page = 164}}</ref><ref name=Creel>{{cite book | author = Creel | date = 1970 | title = What Is Taoism? | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&pg=PA48 | pages = 48, 62\u201363| isbn = 9780226120478 }}</ref> Taoism differs from [[Confucianism]] by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order.<ref name=\"Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor 2011 164\"/> Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize ''[[wu wei]]'' (effortless action), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]: \u6148 \"compassion\", \u5109/\u4fed \"frugality\", and \u8c26 \"humility\". The roots of Taoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yinyang]] (Naturalists), and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture, the ''[[I Ching|Yijing]]'', which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature.

The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] and [[social consciousness]] up to the present day in China and across East Asia. The [[intellectual]] society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government, war, and diplomacy. This period ended with the rise of the imperial [[Qin Dynasty]] and the subsequent [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purge of dissent]]. A traditional source for this period is the ''Shiji'', or ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' by [[Sima Qian]]. The autobiographical section of the ''Shiji'', the \"Taishigong Zixu\" (\u592a\u53f2\u516c\u81ea\u5e8f), refers to the schools of thought described below.\n\nMohism was an [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese philosophy]] of [[logic]], [[rational]] thought and [[science]] developed by the [[academic]] [[scholars]] who studied under the ancient Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] (c. 470 BC\u2013c. 391 BC) and embodied in an eponymous book: the ''[[Mozi (book)|Mozi]]''. Another group is the School of the Military (\u5175\u5bb6; ''Bingjia'') that studied warfare and strategy; [[Sunzi]] and [[Sun Bin]] were influential leaders. The School of Naturalists was a [[Warring States]] era philosophy that synthesized the concepts of [[yin-yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]]; [[Zou Yan]] is considered the founder of this school.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang (light, hot, male, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth).\n\n==Language==\n[[File:Map of sinitic languages cropped-en.svg|thumb|right|Range of Chinese dialect groups according to the ''Language Atlas of China''.<ref>Wurm, Li, Baumann, Lee (1987) {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref>]]\n{{Main|Chinese language|History of Mandarin}}\n\nThe ancient written standard was [[Classical Chinese]]. It was used for thousands of years, but was mostly used by scholars and intellectuals which forms the \"top\" class of the society called \"shi da fu (\u58eb\u5927\u592b)\". It was difficult but possible for ordinary people to promote to this class by passing written exams. Calligraphy later became commercialized, and works by famous artists became prized possessions. [[Chinese literature]] has a long past; the earliest classic work in Chinese, the ''[[I Ching]]'' or \"Book of Changes\" dates to around 1000 BC. A flourishing of philosophy during the [[Warring States period]] produced such noteworthy works as Confucius's ''[[Analects]]'' and [[Laozi]]'s ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''. (See also: the [[Chinese classics]].) Dynastic histories were often written, beginning with [[Sima Qian]]'s seminal ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', which was written from 109 BC to 91 BC.The Tang dynasty witnessed a [[Chinese poetry|poetic]] flowering, while the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] of Chinese literature were written during the Ming and Qing dynasties. [[Printmaking]] in the form of [[movable type]] was developed during the [[Song dynasty]]. Academies of scholars sponsored by the empire were formed to comment on the classics in both printed and handwritten form. Royalty frequently participated in these discussions as well.\n\nChinese philosophers, writers and poets were highly respected and played key roles in preserving and promoting the culture of the empire. Some classical scholars, however, were noted for their daring depictions of the lives of the common people, often to the displeasure of authorities. At the start of the 20th century, most of the population were still [[illiterate]], and the many mutually-unintelligible languages spoken ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] ([[Cantonese]]), [[Min Nan]] (Ban-lam-gu), [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], [[Huizhou Chinese|Hui]], [[Pinghua|Ping]] etc.) in different regions prevented communication with people from other areas. Nevertheless, the written language keeps the communication open and passing the official orders and documentations throughout the entire region of China. Reformers set out to establish a national language, settling on the Beijing-based [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as the spoken form. After the [[May 4th Movement]], Classical Chinese was quickly replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]], modeled after the vocabulary and grammar of the standard spoken language.<ref>{{cite book\n  | first = S.

''Ci'' use a set of [[poetic meter]]s derived from a base set of certain patterns, in fixed-rhythm, fixed-tone, and variable line-length formal types, or model examples: the rhythmic and tonal pattern of the ''ci'' are based upon certain, definitive musical song tunes. They are also known as ''Changduanju'' (\u9577\u77ed\u53e5/\u957f\u77ed\u53e5, \"lines of irregular lengths\") and ''Shiyu'' (\u8a69\u9918/\u8bd7\u9980, \"that which is beside poetry\").Typically the number of [[Chinese character|characters]] in each line and the arrangement of [[Tonal language|tones]] were determined by one of around 800 set patterns, each associated with a particular title, called ''c\u00edp\u00e1i'' \u8a5e\u724c/\u8bcd\u724c. Originally they were written to be sung to a tune of that title, with set rhythm, [[rhyme]], and tempo. The [[Song dynasty]] was also a period of great scientific literature, and saw the creation of works such as [[Su Song]]'s ''Xin Yixiang Fayao'' and [[Shen Kuo]]'s ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]''. There were also enormous works of historiography and large encyclopedias, such as [[Sima Guang]]'s ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' of 1084 or the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'' fully compiled and edited by the 11th century.\n\n[[Listing of noted Confucianists|Notable Confucianists]], [[Listing of noted Taoists|Taoists]] and scholars of all classes have made significant contributions to and from documenting history to authoring saintly concepts that seem hundreds of years ahead of time. Although the oldest surviving textual examples of surviving ''ci'' are from 8th century CE [[Dunhuang manuscripts]],<ref>Frankel, 216 {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> beginning in the [[Six dynasties poetry|poetry]] of the [[Liang dynasty]], the ''ci'' followed the tradition of the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shi Jing]]'' and the ''[[yuefu]]'': they were lyrics which developed from anonymous popular songs into a sophisticated literary genre; although in the case of the ''ci'' form some of its fixed-rhythm patterns have an origin in [[Central Asia]]. The form was further developed in the [[Tang dynasty]]. Although the contributions of [[Li Bai|Li Bo]] (also known as Li Po, 701 \u2013 762) are fraught with historical doubt, certainly the Tang poet [[Wen Tingyun]] (812\u2013870) was a great master of the ''ci'', writing it in its distinct and mature form.<ref>Davis, lxvii {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> One of the more notable practitioners and developers of this form was [[Li Houzhu|Li Yu]] of the [[Southern Tang]] Dynasty during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. However, the ''ci'' form of Classical Chinese poetry is especially associated with the [[Song poetry|poetry of the Song Dynasty]], during which it was indeed a popular poetic form. A revival of the ''ci'' poetry form occurred during the end of the [[Ming dynasty]] and the beginning of the [[Qing dynasty]] which was characterized by an exploration of the emotions connected with romantic love together with its valorization, often in a context of a brief poetic story narrative within a ''ci'' poem or a linked group of ''ci'' poems in an application of the ''[[chuanqi (short story)|chuanqi]]'' form of short story tales to poetry.<ref>Zhang, 76\u201380 {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Qu'' in Yuan dynasty===\n{{Main|Qu (poetry)}}\n\nThe ''Qu'' form of poetry is a type of [[Classical Chinese poetry forms|Classical Chinese poetry form]], consisting of words written in one of a number of certain, set [[tone pattern]]s, based upon the tunes of various songs. Thus '''''Qu''''' poems are lyrics with lines of varying longer and shorter lengths, set according to the certain and specific, fixed patterns of rhyme and tone of conventional musical pieces upon which they are based and after which these matched variations in lyrics (or individual '''''Qu''''' poems) generally take their name.<ref>Yip, 306\u2013308 {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> The fixed-tone type of verse such as the '''''Qu''''' and the ''[[Ci (poetry)|ci]]'' together with the ''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]'' and ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'' forms of poetry comprise the three main forms of [[Classical Chinese poetry]]. In [[Chinese literature]], the '''''Qu''''' ({{Zh|c=\u66f2|p=q\u01d4|w=ch\u00fc}}) form of poetry from the [[Yuan dynasty]] may be called ''Yuanqu'' (\u5143\u66f2 P: ''Yu\u00e1nq\u01d4'', W: ''Y\u00fcan-ch\u00fc''). Qu may be derived from [[Chinese opera]], such as the ''[[Zaju]]'' (\u96dc\u5287/\u6742\u5267), in which case these Qu may be referred to as ''[[Chinese Sanqu poetry|sanqu]]'' (\u6563\u66f2). The ''San'' in ''Sanqu'' refers to the detached status of the ''Qu'' lyrics of this verse form: in other words, rather than being embedded as part of an opera performance the lyrics stand separately on their own. Since the ''Qu'' became popular during the late [[Southern Song]] dynasty, and reached a special height of popularity in the [[Yuan poetry|poetry]] of the Yuan dynasty, therefore it is often called ''Yuanqu'' (\u5143\u66f2), specifying the type of ''Qu'' found in [[Chinese opera]] typical of the Yuan dynasty era. Both ''Sanqu'' and ''Ci'' are lyrics written to fit a different melodies, but ''Sanqu'' differs from ''Ci'' in that it is more colloquial, and is allowed to contain ''Chenzi'' (\u896f\u5b57/\u886c\u5b57 \"filler words\" which are additional words to make a more complete meaning). ''Sanqu'' can be further divided into ''Xiaoling'' (\u5c0f\u4ee4) and ''Santao'' (\u6563\u5957), with the latter containing more than one melody.\n\n===The novels in Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty===\n[[File:Ming Dynasty wood carving books in Tian Yi Chamber colllection.JPG|thumb|Ming dynasty wood carving books in the [[Tian Yi Chamber]] collection]]\n{{Main|Four Great Classical Novels}}\nThe Four Great Classical<ref>{{citation |title=The Encyclopedia of the Novel |series=''Encyclopedia of Literature'', Vol. 2 |contribution=Paper and Print Technology |last=Shep |first=Sydney J. |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |date=2011 |isbn=9781405161848 |page=596 |quote=''Dream of the Red Chamber''... is considered one of China's four great classical novels... |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvFSRPx2uokC&printsec=frontcover }}</ref> or Classic Novels of [[Chinese literature]]<ref>{{citation |last=Li |first=Xiaobing |authormask=Li Xiaobing |url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=XJDcCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |title=Modern China |series=Understanding Modern Nations |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=2016 |location=Sta Barbara |p=[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=XJDcCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA269 269] |contribution=Literature and Drama |quote=''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', ''Outlaws of the Marsh'', ''A Dream of Red Mansions'', and ''Journey to the West'' have become the Four Great Classic Novels of Chinese literature. |isbn=9781610696265 }}</ref>{{efn|Also known more simply as the '''Four Classic Novels'''.<ref>{{citation |editor-last=Cline |editor-first=Eric |editor2-last= Tak\u00e1cs |editor2-first=Sarolta Anna |url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=SPcvCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |p=[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=SPcvCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA508 508] |title=The Ancient World, ''Vol. V'' |date=2015 |contribution=Language and Writing: Chinese Literature |quote=Chinese authors finally produced novels during the Yuan dynasty... when two of China's 'Four Classic Novels' \u2013 ''Water Margin'' and ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' \u2013 were published.|isbn=9781317458395 }}</ref>}} are the four [[novels]] commonly regarded by Chinese literary criticism to be the greatest and most influential of pre-modern Chinese fiction.  Dating from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, they are well known to most Chinese either directly or through their many adaptations to [[Chinese opera]] and other forms of [[popular culture]]. They are among the world's longest and oldest novels and are considered to be the pinnacle of China's literary achievement in classic novels, influencing the creation of many stories, plays, movies, games, and other forms of entertainment across other parts of East Asia.\n\nChinese fiction, rooted in narrative classics such as ''[[A New Account of the Tales of the World|Shishuo Xinyu]]'', ''[[Soushen Ji|Sou Shen Ji]]'', ''[[Wenyuan Yinghua]]'', ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions|Da Tang Xiyu Ji]]'', ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang|Youyang Zazu]]'', ''[[Taiping Guangji]]'', and official histories, developed into the [[novel]] as early as the [[Song dynasty]]. The novel as an extended prose narrative which realistically creates a believable world of its own evolved in China and in Europe from the 14th to 18th centuries, though a little earlier in China. Chinese audiences were more interested in history and were more historically minded. They appreciated relative optimism, moral humanism, and relative emphasis on collective behavior and the welfare of the society.<ref>Ropp, 1990, p310-311 {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of a money economy and urbanization beginning in the Song era led to a professionalization of entertainment which was further encouraged by the spread of printing, the rise of literacy, and education. In both China and Western Europe, the novel gradually became more autobiographical and serious in exploration of social, moral, and philosophical problems. Chinese fiction of the late [[Ming dynasty]] and early [[Qing dynasty]] was varied, self-conscious, and experimental. In China, however, there was no counterpart to the 19th-century European explosion of novels. The novels of the Ming and early Qing dynasties represented a pinnacle of classic Chinese fiction.<ref>Ropp, 1990, p311 {{full citation needed|date=March 2019}}</ref> The scholar and literary critic [[Andrew H. Plaks]] argues that ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', ''Water Margin'', ''Journey to the West'', and ''[[Jin Ping Mei|The Golden Lotus]]'' collectively constituted a technical breakthrough reflecting new cultural values and intellectual concerns. Their educated editors, authors, and commentators used the [[Narrative|narrative conventions]] developed from [[Huaben (Chinese novella)|earlier story-tellers]], such as the episodic structure, interspersed songs and folk sayings, or speaking directly to the reader, but they fashioned self-consciously ironic narratives whose seeming familiarity camouflaged a Neo-Confucian moral critique of late Ming decadence. Plaks explores the textual history of the novels (all published after their author's deaths, usually anonymously) and how the ironic and satiric devices of these novels paved the way for the great novels of the 18th century.<ref>Andrew H. Plaks, ''Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel'' (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1987), esp. pp. 497\u201398.</ref> Plaks further shows these Ming novels share formal characteristics.\n\n==Fashion and clothing==\n{{Main|Chinese clothing|Ancient Chinese clothing|Qipao}}\nChina's fashion history covers hundreds of years with some of the most colorful and diverse arrangements. Different social classes in different eras boast different fashion trends, the color yellow was usually reserved for the emperor during China's Imperial era.\n\n===Pre-Qing===\n\n[[File:\u7ae0\u61f7\u592a\u5b50\u5893\u58c1\u756b\u79ae\u8cd3\u5716a.jpg|thumb|Tang dynasty mural from [[Emperor Zhongzong of Tang|Li Xian]]'s tomb in [[Qianling Mausoleum|Qianling]] showing Han nobility clothing of the era.]]\n\nFrom the beginning of its history, [[Ancient Chinese clothing|Han clothing]] (especially in elite circles) was inseparable from [[silk]], supposedly discovered by the [[Yellow Emperor|Yellow Emperor's]] consort, [[Leizu]]. The dynasty to follow the Shang, the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]], established a strict hierarchical society that used clothing as a status meridian, and inevitably, the height of one's rank influenced the ornateness of a costume. Such markers included the length of a skirt, the wideness of a sleeve and the degree of ornamentation. In addition to these class-oriented developments, Han Chinese clothing became looser, with the introduction of wide sleeves and jade decorations hung from the sash which served to keep the ''yi'' closed. The ''yi'' was essentially wrapped over, in a style known as ''jiaoling youren'', or wrapping the right side over before the left, because of the initially greater challenge to the right-handed wearer (people of Zhongyuan discouraged [[left-handedness]] like many other historical cultures, considering it unnatural, barbarian, uncivilized, and unfortunate). The [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600 BC \u2013 1046 BC), developed the rudiments of Chinese clothing; it consisted of a ''yi'', a narrow-cuffed, knee-length tunic tied with a sash, and a narrow, ankle-length skirt, called ''chang'', worn with a ''bixi'', a length of fabric that reached the knees.  Vivid primary colors and green were used, due to the degree of technology at the time.\n\n===Qipao===\n[[File:Portrait of the Qianlong Emperor in Court Dress.jpg|thumb|left|[[Qianlong Emperor]] (A [[Chinese Emperor]] of [[Qing Dynasty]]) wore Manchurian Chinese-clothing \u2013 [[Qipao]].(\u65d7\u888d)]]\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]], China's last imperial dynasty, a dramatic shift of clothing occurred, examples of which include the [[cheongsam]] (or qipao in Mandarin). The clothing of the era before the Qing dynasty is referred to as [[Hanfu]] or traditional [[Han Chinese clothing]]. Many symbols such as [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] have been used for decorative as well as economic purposes. Among them were the ''[[Banner system|Banners]]'' (''q\u00ed''), mostly Manchu, who as a group were called ''Banner People'' ([[wikt:\u65d7\u4eba|\u65d7\u4eba]] [[pinyin]]: ''q\u00ed r\u00e9n''). [[Manchu]] women typically wore a one-piece dress that retrospectively came to be known as the ''q\u00edp\u00e1o'' ([[wikt:\u65d7\u888d|\u65d7\u888d]], [[Manchu language|Manchu]]: ''sijigiyan'' or ''banner gown''). The generic term for both the male and the female forms of Manchu dress, essentially similar garments, was ''ch\u00e1ngp\u00e1o'' ([[wikt:\u957f\u888d|\u9577\u888d]]/\u957f\u888d). The ''qipao'' fitted loosely and hung straight down the body, or flared slightly in an A-line. Under the dynastic laws after 1636, all [[Han Chinese]] in the banner system were forced to adopt the Manchu male hairstyle of wearing a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] as did all Manchu men and dress in Manchu ''qipao.'' However, the order for ordinary non-Banner Han civilians to wear Manchu clothing was lifted and only Han who served as officials were required to wear Manchu clothing, with the rest of the civilian Han population dressing however they wanted. Qipao covered most of the woman's body, revealing only the head, hands, and the tips of the toes.  The baggy nature of the clothing also served to conceal the figure of the wearer regardless of age.  With time, though, the ''qipao'' were tailored to become more form fitting and revealing. The modern version, which is now recognized popularly in China as the \"standard\" ''qipao'', was first developed in [[Shanghai]] in the 1920s, partly under the influence of Beijing styles. People eagerly sought a more modernized style of dress and transformed the old ''qipao'' to suit their tastes.  Slender and form fitting with a high cut, it had great differences from the traditional ''qipao''. It was high-class [[courtesans]] and celebrities in the city that would make these redesigned tight fitting ''qipao'' popular at that time.<ref>[http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/14703448.html \u65d7\u888d\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0e\u54ea\u4e2a\u6c11\u65cf?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In Shanghai it was first known as ''zansae'' or \"long dress\" (\u9577\u886b\u2014Mandarin Chinese: ch\u00e1ngsh\u0101n; [[Shanghainese]]: ''zansae''; Cantonese: ''ch\u00e8uhngs\u0101am''), and it is this name that survives in English as the \"cheongsam\". Most Han civilian men eventually voluntarily adopted Manchu clothing while Han women continued wearing Han clothing. Until 1911, the changpao was required clothing for Chinese men of a certain class, but Han Chinese women continued to wear loose jacket and trousers, with an overskirt for formal occasions.  The ''qipao'' was a new fashion item for Han Chinese women when they started wearing it around 1925.The original ''qipao'' was wide and loose. As hosiery in turn declined in later decades, cheongsams nowadays have come to be most commonly worn with bare legs.\n\n==Arts==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Ts'ui Po 002.jpg\n | alt1 = Ts'ui Po 002\n | caption1 = Close up on ''Double Happiness (Cui Bai)''.

The Chinese art in the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and that of [[overseas Chinese]] can also be considered part of Chinese art where it is based in or draws on Chinese heritage and Chinese culture. Early \"[[stone age]] art\" dates back to 10,000 BC, mostly consisting of simple [[pottery]] and sculptures. After this early period Chinese art, like Chinese history, is typically classified by the succession of ruling [[Dynasty|dynasties]] of [[Chinese emperors]], most of which lasted several hundred years.\n\nChinese art has arguably the oldest continuous tradition in the world, and is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and consciousness of, that tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western collapse and gradual recovery of classical styles. The media that have usually been classified in the West since the [[Renaissance]] as the [[decorative arts]] are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially unknown artists, especially in [[Chinese ceramics]].\n\nDifferent forms of art have swayed under the influence of great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political figures. Chinese art encompasses all facets of [[fine art]], [[Chinese folk art|folk art]] and [[performance art]]. [[Chinese ceramics|Porcelain pottery]] was one of the first forms of art in the [[List of Palaeolithic sites in China|Palaeolithic]] period. Early Chinese music and poetry was influenced by the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Book of Songs]]'', and the Chinese poet and statesman [[Qu Yuan]].\n\n[[Chinese painting]] became a highly appreciated art in court circles encompassing a wide variety of [[Shan shui]] with specialized styles such as [[Ming dynasty painting]]. Early [[List of traditional Chinese musical instruments|Chinese music]] was based on percussion instruments, which later gave away to stringed and reed instruments. By the [[Han dynasty]] [[Chinese Paper Cutting|papercutting]] became a new art form after the invention of paper. [[Chinese opera]] would also be introduced and branched regionally in addition to other performance formats such as [[Chinese variety arts|variety arts]].\n\n===Chinese lantern===\n[[File:Red lanterns, Spring Festival, Ditan Park Beijing.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Red lanterns are hung from the trees during the Chinese New Year celebrations in Ditan Park (Temple of Earth) in Beijing.]]\n{{Main|Paper lantern|Sky lantern}}\nThe Chinese paper lantern (\u7d19\u71c8\u7c60, \u7eb8\u706f\u7b3c) is a [[lantern]] made of thin, brightly colored paper.<ref name=freedictionary_lantern>{{cite web|title=Chinese lantern|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Chinese+lantern|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> Paper lanterns come in various shapes and sizes, as well as various methods of construction. In their simplest form, they are simply a [[paper bag]] with a [[candle]] placed inside, although more complicated [[lantern]]s consist of a collapsible [[bamboo]] or metal frame of hoops covered with tough [[paper]]. Sometimes, other lanterns can be made out of colored silk (usually red) or vinyl. Silk lanterns are also collapsible with a metal expander and are decorated with Chinese characters and/or designs. The vinyl lanterns are more durable; they can resist rain, sunlight, and wind. Paper lanterns do not last very long, they soon break, and silk lanterns last longer. The gold paper on them will soon fade away to a pale white, and the red silk will become a mix between pink and red. Often associated with [[festival]]s, paper lanterns are common in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and similarly in [[Chinatown]]s with large communities of [[Overseas Chinese]], where they are often hung outside of businesses to attract attention. In Japan [[Traditional lighting equipment of Japan|the traditional styles]] include ''[[bonbori]]'' and ''ch\u014dchin'' and there is a special style of lettering called ''[[edomoji|ch\u014dchin moji]]'' used to write on them. Airborne paper lanterns are called [[sky lanterns]], and are often released into the night sky for aesthetic effect at [[lantern festival]]s.\n\nThe Chinese sky lantern (\u5929\u71c8, \u5929\u706f), also known as ''Kongming lantern'', is a small [[hot air balloon]] made of paper, with an opening at the bottom where a small fire is suspended. In Asia and elsewhere around the world, sky lanterns have been traditionally made for centuries, to be launched for play or as part of long-established festivities. The name \"sky lantern\" is a translation of the [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] name but they have also been referred to as ''sky candles'' or ''fire balloons''. The general design is a thin paper shell, which may be from about 30 [[centimetre|cm]] to a couple of [[metre]]s across, with an opening at the bottom. The opening is usually about 10 to 30&nbsp;cm wide (even for the largest shells), and is surrounded by a stiff collar that serves to suspend the [[flame]] source and to keep it away from the walls. When lit, the flame heats the air inside the lantern, thus lowering its density and causing the lantern to rise into the air. The sky lantern is only airborne for as long as the flame stays alight, after which the lantern sinks back to the ground.\n\n===Chinese hand fan===\n[[File:Non electric fan aka solfjader.jpg|thumb|A commercially produced scented wood folding fan, featuring a drawing of the [[Great Wall of China]].]]\nThe oldest existing Chinese fans are a pair of woven [[bamboo]], wood or paper side-mounted fans from the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutdecorativestyle.com/articles/history_fans.htm|title=articles \u2013 brief history of fans|work=aboutdecorativestyle.com}}</ref> The [[Chinese character]] for \"fan\" (\u6247) is etymologically derived from a picture of feathers under a roof. A particular status and gender would be associated with a specific type of fan. During the [[Song dynasty]], famous artists were often commissioned to paint fans.  The Chinese dancing fan was developed in the 7th century. The Chinese form of the hand fan was a row of feathers mounted in the end of a handle. In the later centuries, Chinese poems and four-word idioms were used to decorate the fans by using Chinese calligraphy pens.  In ancient China, fans came in various shapes and forms (such as in a leaf, oval or a half-moon shape), and were made in different materials such as silk, bamboo, feathers, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hand-fan.org/chinese_hand_fans.html|title=Chinese Hand Fans|work=hand-fan.org}}</ref>\n\n===Carved lacquer===\n[[File:Lacquered box with character for luck, Qianlong Period.JPG|thumb|left|Box with the character for \"Spring\" ({{lang|zh|\u6625}}), [[Qianlong]] period, [[Qing Dynasty]].

While lacquer has been used in China for at least 3,000 years,<ref name=\"Grove\">Grove</ref> the technique of carving into very thick coatings of it appears to have been developed in the 12th century CE. It is extremely time-consuming to produce, and has always been a luxury product, essentially restricted to China,<ref>Grove; Cinnabar</ref> though imitated in [[Japanese lacquerware|Japanese lacquer]] in somewhat different styles.  The producing process is called '''Di\u0101oq\u012b''' ({{lang|zh|\u96d5\u6f06}}/\u5f6b\u6f06, carving lacquer).Though most surviving examples are from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the main types of subject matter for the carvings were all begun under the [[Song dynasty]], and the development of both these and the technique of carving were essentially over by the early Ming.  These types were the abstract ''guri'' or Sword-Pommel pattern, figures in a landscape, and birds and plants.  To these some designs with religious symbols, animals, auspicious characters ''(right)'' and imperial dragons can be added.<ref name=\"Grove\"/> The objects made in the technique are a wide range of small types, but are mostly practical vessels or containers such as boxes, plates and trays.

The [[music]] of China dates back to the [[History of China|dawn of Chinese civilization]] with documents and artifacts providing evidence of a well-developed musical culture as early as the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1122 BCE \u2013 256 BCE).  The earliest music of the Zhou dynasty recorded in ancient Chinese texts includes the ritual music called ''[[yayue]]'' and each piece may be associated with a dance. Some of the oldest written music dates back to [[Confucius]]'s time.  The first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was exemplified through the popularization of the [[Guqin|''qin'']] (plucked instrument with seven strings) during the [[Tang Dynasty]], although the instrument is known to have played a major role before the Han Dynasty.\n\n[[File:Bianlian.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bian Lian]](\"Face-Changing\") Performer]]\n\nThere are many [[musical instrument]]s that are integral to Chinese culture, such as the [[Xun (instrument)|Xun]] ([[Ocarina]]-type instrument that is also integral in Native American cultures), [[Guzheng]] (zither with movable bridges), [[guqin]] (bridgeless zither), [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]] and [[xiao (flute)|xiao]] (vertical flute), the [[erhu]] (alto fiddle or bowed lute), [[pipa]] (pear-shaped plucked lute), and many others.\n\nDance in China is a highly varied art form, consisting of many modern and traditional dance genres. The dances cover a wide range, from folk dances to performances in opera and ballet, and may be used in public celebrations, rituals and ceremonies. There are also 56 officially recognized [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups in China]], and each ethnic minority group in China also has its own folk dances. The best known Chinese dances today are the [[Dragon dance]] and the [[Lion Dance]].\n\n==Architecture==\n{{Main|Chinese architecture}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 250\n | image_style = border:none;\n | perrow = 2\n | image1 = Dingzhou Liaodi Pagoda 3.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Liaodi Pagoda]], Song dynasty \n | image2 = People's Republic of China Beijing Tianningsi Tianing Temple David McBride Photography-0045 02.jpg\n | caption2 = The Pagoda of [[Tianning Temple (Beijing)|Tianing Temple]], [[Liao Dynasty]] \n | image3 = Hohhot White Pagoda 2.jpg\n | caption3 = The Ten Thousand Copies of the Huayan Sutra Pagoda, commonly known as the White Pagoda, Liao dynasty \n | image4 = Poyang Yongfu Si Ta 2017.11.25 10-04-37.jpg\n | caption4 = Poyang Yongfu Temple Pagoda, Song dynasty \n}}\n\nChinese architecture is a style of [[architecture]] that has taken shape through the ages and influenced the architecture of East Asia for many centuries. The structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Since the Tang dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of East Asia such as [[Japanese architecture|Japan]] and [[Korean architecture|Korea]]. Chinese architecture, examples for which can be found from more than 2,000 years ago, is almost as old as Chinese civilization and has long been an important hallmark of Chinese culture. There are certain features common to Chinese architecture, regardless of specific regions, different provinces or use. The most important is [[symmetry]], which connotes a sense of grandeur as it applies to everything from palaces to farmhouses. One notable exception is in the design of gardens, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow, to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself. [[Feng shui]] has played a very important part in structural development.  The Chinese garden is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperors]] and members of the imperial family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between [[man and nature]].<ref name=\"Michel Baridon p. 348\">Michel Baridon, ''Les Jardins \u2013 paysagistes, jardiners, po\u1e15ts''.  p. 348</ref> A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, rock works, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries.

It symbols imperial class in ancient China.\n}}\n\nThe Chinese palace is an imperial complex where the royal court and the civil government resided. Its structures are considerable and elaborate. The Chinese character ''gong'' (\u5bae; meaning \"palace\") represents two connected rooms (\u5442) under a roof (\u5b80). Originally the character applied to any residence or mansion, but it was used in reference to solely the imperial residence since the [[Qin dynasty]] (3rd century BC). A Chinese palace is composed of many buildings. It has large areas surrounded by walls and moats. It contains large halls (\u6bbf) for ceremonies and official business, as well as smaller buildings, [[Chinese temple|temples]], towers, residences, galleries, courtyards, [[Chinese garden|gardens]], and outbuildings. Apart from the main imperial palace, [[Chinese dynasties]] also had several other imperial palaces in the capital city where the empress, crown prince, or other members of the imperial family dwelled. There also existed palaces outside of the capital city called \"away palaces\" (\u96e2\u5bae/\u79bb\u5bab) where the emperors resided when traveling. Empress dowager [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Cixi]] (\u6148\u79a7\u592a\u540e) built the [[Summer Palace]] or Yiheyuan (\u9824\u548c\u5712/\u9890\u548c\u56ed \u2013 \"The Garden of Nurtured Harmony\") near the [[Old Summer Palace]], but on a much smaller scale than the Old Summer Palace.<ref>There are currently some projects in China to rebuild the Imperial Gardens, but this appears as a colossal undertaking, and no rebuilding has started.</ref>\n\n===Paifang===\n{{Main|Paifang}}\n\n''Paifang'', also known as a ''Pailou'', is a traditional style of [[China|Chinese]] [[Chinese architecture|architectural]] [[arch]] or gateway structure that is related to the [[India]]n ''[[Torana]]'' from which it is derived.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.H.

The largest division within a city in ancient China was a ''fang'' ({{zh|c=\u574a|hp=f\u0101ng|labels=no}}), equivalent to a current day [[ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]]. Each fang was enclosed by walls or fences, and the gates of these enclosures were shut and guarded every night. Each fang was further divided into several ''pai'' ({{zh|c=\u724c|hp=p\u00e1i|l=placard|labels=no}}), which is equivalent to a current day (unincorporated) community. Each pai, in turn, contained an area including several [[hutong]]s (alleyways). This system of urban administrative division and subdivision reached an elaborate level during the [[Tang dynasty]], and continued in the following dynasties. For example, during the [[Ming dynasty]], [[Beijing]] was divided into a total of 36 fangs. Originally, the word ''paifang'' referred to the gate of a fang and the marker for an entrance of a building complex or a town; but by the [[Song dynasty]], a paifang had evolved into a purely decorative monument.\n\n===Chinese garden===\n[[File:Jichang Yuan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Jichang Garden]] in [[Wuxi]] (1506\u20131521), built during the Ming Dynasty, is an exemplary work of South Chinese style garden.]]\n{{Main|Chinese garden}}\n\nThe Chinese garden is a landscape garden cantonese style which has evolved over the years.

The earliest recorded Chinese gardens were created in the valley of the [[Yellow River]], during the [[Shang dynasty]] (1600\u20131046 BC). These gardens were large enclosed parks where the kings and nobles hunted game, or where fruit and vegetables were grown. Early inscriptions from this period, carved on tortoise shells, have three Chinese characters for garden, ''you'', ''pu'' and ''yuan''.  ''You'' was a royal garden where birds and animals were kept, while pu was a garden for plants. During the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013206 BC), ''[[wikt:\u5712|yuan]]'' became the character for all gardens.<ref>Feng Chaoxiong, ''The Classical Gardens of Suzhou'', preface, and Bing Chiu, ''Jardins de Chine, ou la quete du paradis'', Editions de La Martiniere, Paris 2010, p. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\n[[File:Yellow Register Archives of the Ming Dynasty, Nanjing (flickr 1559896574).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Moon gate]] in a Chinese garden]]\n\nThe old character for  ''yuan'' is a small picture of a garden; it is enclosed in a square which can represent a wall, and has symbols which can represent the plan of a structure, a small square which can represent a pond, and a symbol for a plantation or a pomegranate tree.<ref>Tong Jun, Records of Jiang Gardens, cited in Feng Chanoxiong, ''The Classical Gardens of Suzhou''.</ref> According to the ''Shiji'', one of the most famous features of this garden was the ''Wine Pool and Meat Forest'' (\u9152\u6c60\u8089\u6797). A large pool, big enough for several small boats, was constructed on the palace grounds, with inner linings of polished oval shaped stones from the sea shores. The pool was then filled with wine. A small island was constructed in the middle of the pool, where trees were planted, which had skewers of roasted meat hanging from their branches. King Zhou and his friends and concubines drifted in their boats, drinking the wine with their hands and eating the roasted meat from the trees. Later Chinese philosophers and historians cited this garden as an example of decadence and bad taste.<ref name=Che>Che Bing Chiu, \"Jardins de Chine, ou la quete du paradis\"</ref>{{rp|11}} During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722\u2013481 BC), in 535 BC, the ''Terrace of Shanghua'', with lavishly decorated palaces, was built by [[King Jing of Zhou (Gui)|King Jing]] of the [[Zhou dynasty]]. In 505 BC, an even more elaborate garden, the ''Terrace of Gusu'', was begun. It was located on the side of a mountain, and included a series of terraces connected by galleries, along with a lake where boats in the form of blue dragons navigated.

Chinese martial arts, often named under the [[umbrella term]]s ''[[Kung fu (term)|kung fu]]'' and ''[[Wushu (sport)|wushu]]'', are the [[Styles of Chinese martial arts|several hundred fighting styles]] that have developed over the centuries in China. These fighting styles are often classified according to common traits, identified as ''\"families\"'' (\u5bb6; {{transl|zh|''ji\u0101''}}), ''\"sects\"'' (\u6d3e; {{transl|zh|''p\u00e0i''}}) or ''\"schools\"'' (\u95e8/\u9580; {{transl|zh|''m\u00e9n''}}) of martial arts. Examples of such traits include ''[[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolinquan]]''  ({{zh|c=\u5c11\u6797\u62f3|labels=no}}) physical exercises involving [[Five Animals]] ({{zh|c=\u4e94\u5f62|labels=no}}) mimicry, or training methods inspired by [[Chinese philosophies|Old Chinese philosophies]], religions and legends. Styles that focus on [[qi]] manipulation are called ''\"[[Internal martial arts|internal]] \"''(\u5167\u5bb6\u62f3/\u5185\u5bb6\u62f3; {{transl|zh|''n\u00e8iji\u0101qu\u00e1n''}}), while others that concentrate on improving muscle and cardiovascular fitness are called ''\"[[External martial arts|external]]\"'' (\u5916\u5bb6\u62f3; {{transl|zh|''w\u00e0iji\u0101qu\u00e1n''}}). Geographical association, as in \"''northern\"(''\u5317\u62f3; {{transl|zh|''b\u011biqu\u00e1n''}}) and ''\"southern\"'' (\u5357\u62f3; {{transl|zh|''n\u00e1nqu\u00e1n''}}), is another popular classification method.\n\nChinese martial arts are collectively given the name [[Kung Fu]] (gong) \"achievement\" or \"merit\", and (fu) \"man\", thus \"human achievement\") or (previously and in some modern contexts) [[Wushu (term)|Wushu]] (\"martial arts\" or \"military arts\"). China also includes the home to the well-respected [[Shaolin Monastery]] and [[Wudang Mountains]]. The first generation of art started more for the purpose of survival and warfare than art. Over time, some art forms have branched off, while others have retained a distinct Chinese flavor. Regardless, China has produced some of the most renowned martial artists including [[Wong Fei Hung]] and [[Chinese martial arts#Notable practitioners|many others]]. The arts have also co-existed with a variety of [[:Category:Chinese melee weapons|weapons]] including the more standard [[Eighteen Arms of Wushu|18 arms]]. Legendary and controversial moves like [[Dim Mak]] are also praised and talked about within the culture.\nMartial arts schools also teach the art of [[lion dance]], which has evolved from a pugilistic display of Kung Fu to an entertaining dance performance.\n\n==Leisure==\nA number of [[:Category:Chinese games|games]] and pastimes are popular within Chinese culture. The most common game is [[Mahjong]]. The same pieces are used for other styled games such as [[mahjong solitaire|Shanghai Solitaire]]. Others include [[pai gow]], [[pai gow poker]] and other [[Chinese dominoes|bone domino]] games. [[Weiqi]] and [[xiangqi]] are also popular. Ethnic games like [[Chinese yo-yo]] are also part of the culture where it is performed during social events. Qigong pronounced (Chi Kung) is the practice of spiritual, physical, and medical techniques. It is as a form of exercise and although it is commonly used among the elderly, any one of any age can practice it during their free time. With its combination of physical flexibility and movement, breathing technique, and constant state of focus and mediation, it has also been a way to cleanse and heal the body and helps get in touch with your inner-self. Qigong has continuous rhythmic movements that help reduce stress and build stamina as well as to improve certain functions of the body such as cardiovascular and digestive.\n\n==Cuisine==\n[[File:VegetableSpringRolls.JPG|thumb|[[Spring rolls]] are a large variety of filled, rolled appetizers or dim sum found in Chinese cuisine.

It replaced the Sassanid capital of [[Ctesiphon|Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] some 35&nbsp;km to the south-east, which was mostly depopulated by the end of the 8th century. Baghdad was the center of the Arab caliphate during the \"[[Golden Age of Islam]]\" of the 9th and 10th centuries, growing to be the [[List of largest cities throughout history|largest city worldwide]]  by the beginning of the 10th century. It began to decline in the \"[[Iranian Intermezzo]]\" of the 9th to 11th centuries, and was destroyed in the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongolian invasion]] [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|in 1258]].\n\nThe city was rebuilt and flourished under [[Ilkhanid]] rule but never rose to its former glory again. It was again sacked by [[Timur]] in 1401 and fell under Turkic rule. It was briefly taken by  [[Safavid Persia]] in 1508, before falling to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1534. With the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], Baghdad fell under the [[Mandatory Iraq|British Mandate]] in 1920 and became the capital of the independent [[Kingdom of Iraq]] in 1932 (converted to a [[Iraqi Republic (1958\u201368)|Republic]] in 1958).\n\nAs the capital of the modern [[Republic of Iraq]], Baghdad has  a [[metropolitan area]] estimated at a population of 7,000,000 divided into [[List of neighborhoods and districts in Baghdad|numerous neighbourhoods in nine districts]]. It is the largest city in Iraq. It is the second-largest city in the [[Arab world]] (after [[Cairo]]) and the second-largest city in [[Western Asia]] (after [[Tehran]]). In [[History of Iraq (2011\u2013present)|recent history]], Baghdad has been affected by the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|Iraqi civil war]], most notably by recurring [[Terrorist incidents in Iraq in 2015|bombings]].\n\n==Early history== \n{{tone|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:Baghdad 150 to 300 AH.png|thumb|[[Round city of Baghdad]]]]\nBaghdad was founded 1,258 years ago on the 30 July 762.

The outer wall was 80ft high, crowned with battlements and flanked by bastions. A deep moat ringed the outer wall perimeter.\n\n[[File:Baghdad-Zumurrud-Khaton.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Zumurrud Khaton tomb in Baghdad,1932]]\nThousands of architects and engineers, legal experts, surveyors and carpenters, blacksmiths, diggers and ordinary labourers were recruited from across the [[Abbasid]] empire. First they surveyed, measured and excavated the foundations. [[Ya'qubi]] reckoned there were 100,000 workers involved. \"They say that no other round city is known in all the regions of the world,\" [[Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]] noted. Four equidistant gates pierced the outer walls where straight roads led to the centre of the city. The Kufa Gate to the south-west and the Basra Gate to the south-east both opened on to the Sarat canal \u2013 a key part of the network of waterways that drained the waters of the Euphrates into the Tigris. The Sham (Syrian) Gate to the north-west led to the main road on to Anbar, and across the desert wastes to Syria. To the north-east the Khorasan Gate lay close to the Tigris, leading to the bridge of boats across it.\n\nThe four straight roads that ran towards the centre of the city from the outer gates were lined with vaulted arcades containing merchants' shops and bazaars. Smaller streets ran off these four main arteries, giving access to a series of squares and houses; the limited space between the main wall and the inner wall answered to Mansur's desire to maintain the heart of the city as a royal preserve.\n\nBy 766 Mansur's Round City was complete. The ninth-century essayist, polymath and polemicist [[al-Jahiz]] said. \"I have seen the great cities, including those noted for their durable construction. I have seen such cities in the districts of Syria, in Byzantine territory, and in other provinces, but I have never seen a city of greater height, more perfect circularity, more endowed with superior merits or possessing more spacious gates or more perfect defenses than Al Zawra (Baghdad), that is to say the city of Abu Jafar al-Mansur.\n\n==Center of learning (8th to 9th centuries)==\n{{further|Islamic Golden Age}}\n\nFounder, caliph [[al-Mansur]] of the Abbasid caliphate, chose the city's location because of its critical link in trade routes, mild climate, topography (critical for fortification), and proximity to water. All of these factors made the city a breeding ground of culture and knowledge. Baghdad is set right on the [[Khurasan Road]], which was an established meeting place for caravan routes from all cardinal directions.<ref name=\"Bearman 2012\" /> During the construction of the city, gates were placed at the entrances of the major roads into the city, in order to funnel traffic into the city. The Kufah Gate was on a major road that pilgrims took to [[Mecca]], and the Anbar gate linked the bridges over the canals and Euphrates River to the city.

Under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Baghdad fell into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and [[Iran|Persia]]. For a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East before being overtaken by [[Constantinople]] in the 16th century. The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century under the [[Mamluk dynasty of Iraq|Mamluk dynasty]].

Iraq was given formal independence in 1932, and increased autonomy in 1946. In 1958 the Ira, [[Faisal II]]. The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950. [[File:Bagdad2 i juni 1977.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Baghdad in the 1970s]] During the 1970s Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the price of [[petroleum]], Iraq's main [[export]]. New [[infrastructure]] including modern [[sewage]], water, and [[highway]] facilities were built during this period. However, the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money flowed into the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of [[missile]] attacks against Baghdad, although they caused relatively little damage and few casualties.  In 1991 the first [[Gulf War]] caused damage to Baghdad's [[transportation]], [[Electricity generation|power]], and sanitary infrastructure.\n\n[[File:baghdad nima 2003.jpg|thumb|250px|2003 street map of Baghdad]]\n\nBaghdad was bombed very heavily in March and April 2003 in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and fell under US control by April 7\u20139.

With the deposition of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime, the city was occupied by [[United States Army|U.S. troops]]. The [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] established a three-square-mile (8&nbsp;km\u00b2) \"[[Green Zone]]\" within the heart of the city from which it governed Iraq during the period before the new Iraqi government was established.

In April 2004, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that a follow-up [[Gallup poll]] in Baghdad indicated that \"only 13 percent of the people now say the invasion of Iraq was morally justifiable.

It replaced the Sassanid capital of [[Ctesiphon|Seleucia-Ctesiphon]] some 35&nbsp;km to the south-east, which was mostly depopulated by the end of the 8th century. Baghdad was the center of the Arab caliphate during the \"[[Golden Age of Islam]]\" of the 9th and 10th centuries, growing to be the [[List of largest cities throughout history|largest city worldwide]]  by the beginning of the 10th century. It began to decline in the \"[[Iranian Intermezzo]]\" of the 9th to 11th centuries, and was destroyed in the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongolian invasion]] [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|in 1258]].\n\nThe city was rebuilt and flourished under [[Ilkhanid]] rule but never rose to its former glory again. It was again sacked by [[Timur]] in 1401 and fell under Turkic rule. It was briefly taken by  [[Safavid Persia]] in 1508, before falling to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1534. With the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], Baghdad fell under the [[Mandatory Iraq|British Mandate]] in 1920 and became the capital of the independent [[Kingdom of Iraq]] in 1932 (converted to a [[Iraqi Republic (1958\u201368)|Republic]] in 1958).\n\nAs the capital of the modern [[Republic of Iraq]], Baghdad has  a [[metropolitan area]] estimated at a population of 7,000,000 divided into [[List of neighborhoods and districts in Baghdad|numerous neighbourhoods in nine districts]]. It is the largest city in Iraq. It is the second-largest city in the [[Arab world]] (after [[Cairo]]) and the second-largest city in [[Western Asia]] (after [[Tehran]]).

The outer wall was 80ft high, crowned with battlements and flanked by bastions. A deep moat ringed the outer wall perimeter.\n\n[[File:Baghdad-Zumurrud-Khaton.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Zumurrud Khaton tomb in Baghdad,1932]]\nThousands of architects and engineers, legal experts, surveyors and carpenters, blacksmiths, diggers and ordinary labourers were recruited from across the [[Abbasid]] empire. First they surveyed, measured and excavated the foundations. [[Ya'qubi]] reckoned there were 100,000 workers involved. \"They say that no other round city is known in all the regions of the world,\" [[Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]] noted. Four equidistant gates pierced the outer walls where straight roads led to the centre of the city. The Kufa Gate to the south-west and the Basra Gate to the south-east both opened on to the Sarat canal \u2013 a key part of the network of waterways that drained the waters of the Euphrates into the Tigris. The Sham (Syrian) Gate to the north-west led to the main road on to Anbar, and across the desert wastes to Syria. To the north-east the Khorasan Gate lay close to the Tigris, leading to the bridge of boats across it.\n\nThe four straight roads that ran towards the centre of the city from the outer gates were lined with vaulted arcades containing merchants' shops and bazaars. Smaller streets ran off these four main arteries, giving access to a series of squares and houses; the limited space between the main wall and the inner wall answered to Mansur's desire to maintain the heart of the city as a royal preserve.\n\nBy 766 Mansur's Round City was complete. The ninth-century essayist, polymath and polemicist [[al-Jahiz]] said. \"I have seen the great cities, including those noted for their durable construction. I have seen such cities in the districts of Syria, in Byzantine territory, and in other provinces, but I have never seen a city of greater height, more perfect circularity, more endowed with superior merits or possessing more spacious gates or more perfect defenses than Al Zawra (Baghdad), that is to say the city of Abu Jafar al-Mansur.\n\n==Center of learning (8th to 9th centuries)==\n{{further|Islamic Golden Age}}\n\nFounder, caliph [[al-Mansur]] of the Abbasid caliphate, chose the city's location because of its critical link in trade routes, mild climate, topography (critical for fortification), and proximity to water.

Baghdad is set right on the [[Khurasan Road]], which was an established meeting place for caravan routes from all cardinal directions.<ref name=\"Bearman 2012\" /> During the construction of the city, gates were placed at the entrances of the major roads into the city, in order to funnel traffic into the city.

It became a provincial capital controlled by the [[Jalayirid]] (1400&ndash;1411), [[Black Sheep Turkmen|Qara Qoyunlu]] (1411&ndash;1469), [[White Sheep Turkmen|Aq Quyunlu]] (1469&ndash;1508), and [[Safavid]] Persian (1508&ndash;1534) - (1604&ndash;1638) empires.\n\n==Ottoman Baghdad (16th to 19th centuries)==\nIn 1534, Baghdad was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]]. Under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Baghdad fell into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and [[Iran|Persia]]. For a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East before being overtaken by [[Constantinople]] in the 16th century. The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century under the [[Mamluk dynasty of Iraq|Mamluk dynasty]]. ''[[The Nuttall Encyclopedia]]'' reports the 1907 population of Baghdad as 185,000.\n\n==20th century\u2013present==\n[[File:Baghdad LOC 13186.jpg|thumb|Baghdad in 1932]]\n\nBaghdad remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule until the establishment of the kingdom of [[Iraq]] under British control in 1921. British control was established by a systematic suppression of Iraqi [[Arab]] and [[Kurdish nationalism|Kurdish]] national aspirations. Iraq was given formal independence in 1932, and increased autonomy in 1946. In 1958 the Ira, [[Faisal II]]. The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950. [[File:Bagdad2 i juni 1977.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Baghdad in the 1970s]] During the 1970s Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the price of [[petroleum]], Iraq's main [[export]]. New [[infrastructure]] including modern [[sewage]], water, and [[highway]] facilities were built during this period. However, the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money flowed into the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of [[missile]] attacks against Baghdad, although they caused relatively little damage and few casualties.  In 1991 the first [[Gulf War]] caused damage to Baghdad's [[transportation]], [[Electricity generation|power]], and sanitary infrastructure.\n\n[[File:baghdad nima 2003.jpg|thumb|250px|2003 street map of Baghdad]]\n\nBaghdad was bombed very heavily in March and April 2003 in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and fell under US control by April 7\u20139. Additional damage was caused by the severe [[looting]]<ref>JOHNSON, I.M. \"The impact on libraries and archives in Iraq of war and looting in 2003 \u2013 a preliminary assessment of the damage and subsequent reconstruction efforts.\" ''International Information and Library Review'', 37 (3), 2005, 209\u2013271.</ref> during the days following the end of the war. With the deposition of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime, the city was occupied by [[United States Army|U.S. troops]]. The [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] established a three-square-mile (8&nbsp;km\u00b2) \"[[Green Zone]]\" within the heart of the city from which it governed Iraq during the period before the new Iraqi government was established. The [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] ceded power to the interim government at the end of June 2004 and dissolved itself.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n[[File:Baghdad-smoke-satellite.jpg|thumb|250px|A satellite [[false-color]] image of Baghdad, taken March 31, 2003.

As time passed, however, support for the occupation declined dramatically. In April 2004, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that a follow-up [[Gallup poll]] in Baghdad indicated that \"only 13 percent of the people now say the invasion of Iraq was morally justifiable. In the 2003 poll, more than twice that number saw it as the right thing to do.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2004-04-28-poll-cover_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=Poll: Iraqis out of patience |first1=Cesar G. |last1=Soriano |first2=Steven |last2=Komarow |date=2004-04-30 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref>\n\nMost residents of Baghdad became impatient with the coalition forces because essential services such as [[electricity]] were still unreliable more than a year after the invasion. In the hot summer of 2004, electricity was only available intermittently in most areas of the city. An additional pressing concern was the lack of security. The [[curfew]] imposed immediately after the invasion had been lifted in the winter of 2003, but the city that had once had a vibrant [[nightlife (activity)|night life]] was still considered too dangerous after dark for many citizens. Those dangers included [[kidnapping]] and the risk of being caught in fighting between security forces and [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurgents]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nOn 10 April 2007, the United States military began construction of a three-mile (5&nbsp;km) long 3.5 metre tall [[Baghdad Wall|wall]] around the [[Sunni]] district of Baghdad.<ref>{{cite news |title=Latest US solution to Iraq's civil war: a three-mile wall |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/21/iraq.iraqtimeline |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Ewen |last=MacAskill |date=2007-04-21 |accessdate=2009-08-21 |location=London}}</ref> On 23 April, the [[Iraq]]i Prime Minister, [[Nouri Maliki]], called for construction to be halted on the wall.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iraqi PM calls for halt to Baghdad wall |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/23/iraq.usa |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2007-04-23 |accessdate=2009-08-21 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Iraqi PM criticises Baghdad wall |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6582225.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-04-22 |accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Baghdad]]\n*[[History of Iraq]]\n*[[History of the Jews in Baghdad]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{see also|Timeline of Baghdad#Bibliography}}\n*Hagan, John, Joshua Kaiser, Anna Hanson (all [[Northwestern University]]), and Patricia Parker ([[University of Toronto]]). \"[http://sociology.arizona.edu/sites/sociology.arizona.edu/files/files-page/rights_paper_hagan.pdf Neighborhood Sectarian Displacement and the Battle for Baghdad: The Self-fulfilling Prophecy of Crimes Against Humanity in Iraq]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6eJDEMJRC Archive]).

Many Ghanaian films are co-produced with [[Cinema of Nigeria|Nollywood]], the Nigerian film industry, and some are distributed by Nigerian marketers. Also, Nigerian filmmakers often feature Ghanaian actors and actresses in their movies and Ghanaian filmmakers feature Nigerian actors and actresses in theirs. [[Nadia Buari]], [[Yvonne Nelson]], [[Lydia Forson]] and [[Jackie Appiah]] all popular Ghanaian actresses and [[Van Vicker]] and [[Majid Michel]] both popular Ghanaian actors, have starred in many Nigerian movies. As a result of these collaborations, Western viewers often confuse Ghanaian movies with Nollywood and count their sales as one; however, they are two independent industries that sometimes share ''Nollywood''. In 2009, [[Unesco]] described Nollywood as the second-biggest film industry in the world after [[Bollywood]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article7086248.ece |title=Nollywood success puts Nigeria's film industry in regional spotlight |work=The Times|first=Jonathan|last=Clayton|date=3 April 2010|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{Main|Media of Ghana}}\n[[File:Ghana Trustworthiness of Media.jpg|thumb|Ghana mass media, [[news]] and information provided by television.]]\n\nThe [[media of Ghana]] are amongst the most free in Africa.
