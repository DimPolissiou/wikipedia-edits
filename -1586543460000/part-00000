Production started after the introduction of Honda's first car, called the [[Honda S500]], and joined the market segment that was already represented by the [[Datsun Fairlady]], and the [[Daihatsu Compagno]].\n\nThe car had aerodynamic styling by Shozo Sato, a designer on loan from Datsun, and Toyota engineer [[Tatsuo Hasegawa]].

The aluminum [[targa top]] could be stored in the trunk, when not in use.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1969 approximately 3,131 units were built by Toyota subcontractor [[Kanto Auto Works]].

(Okinawa, having been American occupied, drove on the \"other side\" from the rest of Japan.)

The basic body design, however, remained unchanged.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nAn air-cooled 790&nbsp;cc horizontally opposed two-cylinder [[Flat-twin|boxer]] engine powered the vehicle.

The aluminum [[targa top]] could be stored in the trunk, when not in use.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1969 approximately 3,131 units were built by Toyota subcontractor [[Kanto Auto Works]]. Only about 10% of those vehicles are known to have survived, most being in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanto-aw.co.jp/en/corporate/history/|title=\u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|publisher=Kanto-aw.co.jp|accessdate=2012-10-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508094505/http://www.kanto-aw.co.jp/en/corporate/history/|archivedate=2012-05-08}}</ref>\n\nProduction Tables{{Where|date=July 2011}} show 1,235 cars manufactured in 1965, 703 in 1966, 538 in 1967, 440 in 1968, and 215 in 1969.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n[[File:1967 Toyota Sports 800.jpg|thumb|A 1967 Toyota Sports 800 in [[left-hand drive]] configuration]]\n[[File:1965 Toyota Sports-800 02.jpg|thumb|Rear view of 1965 Sports 800 with roof panel removed]]\n\nThe vast majority of the 3,131 cars were right hand drive, but some 300 were [[left hand drive]] models, built primarily for the [[Okinawa]] market. (Okinawa, having been American occupied, drove on the \"other side\" from the rest of Japan.) A very limited number of left hand drive cars were used by Toyota to \"test drive\" in the US, but Toyota made a decision not to import or sell the cars in the US market.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThere are subtle design differences between the years. Noticeable differences have included: change over from non-synchro to [[Syncromesh|synchro]] first gear in 1967; a grill and bumperette change in 1968; and side marker lights in 1969. The basic body design, however, remained unchanged.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nAn air-cooled 790&nbsp;cc horizontally opposed two-cylinder [[Flat-twin|boxer]] engine powered the vehicle.

He played for several Italian clubs in [[Serie A]] throughout his career, coming to prominence with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], where he won several domestic and international titles. At international level he also played for the [[Italy national football team|Italian national side]] in two [[FIFA World Cup]]s and two [[UEFA European Football Championship]]s, reaching the final of [[UEFA Euro 2000]].\n\nDuring his playing career he was known as ''soldatino'' (toy soldier) or ''soldatino Di Livio'', a nickname his Juventus teammate at the time [[Roberto Baggio]] gave him because of Di Livio's characteristic way of running up and down the flank.<ref name=\"soldatino\">{{cite news|url=http://www.pianeta-calcio.it/?page=vedi_incontri_vip&id=257|title=Io, \"Soldatino\" Di Livio|date= 23 September 2011 |accessdate= 10 March 2013 |work = Pianeta-Calcio.it }}</ref><ref name=\"cinquantamila\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinquantamila.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=DI+LIVIO+Angelo|title=Biografia di Angelo Di Livio|publisher=www.cinquantamila.it|language=Italian|author1=Maria Elena Ribezzo|author2=Giorgio Dell'Arti|date=17 January 2014|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in Rome, Di Livio began his career with [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in 1984. Having failed to make an appearance in his only season for the club, Di Livio played for [[A.C. Reggiana|Reggiana]] (1985\u201386), [[A.G. Nocerina 1910|Nocerina]] (1986\u201387), [[A.C. Perugia|Perugia]] (1987\u201389), [[Padova Calcio|Padova]] (1989\u201393), [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] (1993\u201399) and [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] (1999\u20132005).\n\nHis tireless running and quality crossing made him an important element in the dominant Juventus starting lineup from 1993 to 1999, during one of the most successful periods in the club's history. With Juventus, he won three ''[[Scudetto|scudetti]]'' (Italian A League; [[1994\u201395 Serie A|1995]], [[1996\u201397 Serie A|1997]], [[1997\u201398 Serie A|1998]]) and one [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] title ([[1996 UEFA Champions League Final|1996]]), in addition to two [[Italian Supercup]]s ([[1995 Supercoppa Italiana|1995]], [[1997 Supercoppa Italiana|1997]]), a [[1994\u201395 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], an [[UEFA Supercup]] ([[1996 UEFA Super Cup|1996]]), and an [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] ([[1996 Intercontinental Cup|1996]]); he also reached the final of the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup]].\n\nIn 1999, he moved to Fiorentina, where he [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the team to win the [[2000\u201301 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] during the [[2000\u201301 Serie A|2000\u201301 season]]. In 2002, when AC Fiorentina went bankrupt and was reborn as ''Florentia Viola'' in [[Serie C2]], Di Livio showed his dedication by being the only player to stay with the team, as he played through the depths of Italian football on the climb back to [[Serie A]] in 2004, finally retiring after the conclusion of the [[2004\u201305 Serie A]] season.\n\n==International career==\nDi Livio was capped 40 times for [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. He played for Italy at [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]], the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] (where Italy finished in 2nd place), and the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. His first cap came on 6 September 1995 against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]; his last on 18 June 2002 against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. At Euro 1996, he set-up [[Pierluigi Casiraghi]]'s first goal in the team's 2\u20131 win in the opening group match against [[Russia national football team|Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1996/matches/round=227/match=52507/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Instinctive Casiraghi helps Italy sink Russia|publisher=UEFA.com|date=6 October 2003}}</ref> For Italy, he was often used as a holding player to shut down games when the team was ahead, thus sealing the win.\n\n==After retirement==\nAfter retiring, Di Livio worked as a coach in the A.S. Roma Youth System (''Allievi \"Coppa Lazio\"'').<ref>[http://www.asroma.it/GiovaniliList.aspx?Categoria=18 Official AS Roma's site]</ref>\n\n==Style of play==\nA quick, experienced, energetic, combative, reliable, and tactically versatile player, Di Livio was usually deployed on the right wing, although he was capable of playing on either flank, as a [[Midfielder#Winger|wide midfielder]], or as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-back]]; he was also capable of playing in the [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|centre]], as a [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to-box]] or [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], or even in [[Defender (association football)|defence]]. Although he was not the most naturally talented or skilled footballer, he was a highly consistent player, who was known for his pace, stamina, work-rate, strength, tenacity, mentality, man-marking ability, and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] accuracy, as well as his ability to make attacking runs down the flank, but also track back, which enabled him to cover the wing effectively, and have a successful career.<ref name=\"soldatino\"/><ref name=\"cinquantamila\"/><ref name=\"euro2000\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/italy/squad/774613.stm|title=Euro 2000 Profile: Angelo Di Livio|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"tuttomercatoweb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/rassegna-stampa/di-livio-capello-non-mi-volle-alla-roma-41347|title=Di Livio: \"Capello non mi volle alla Roma\"|publisher=TuttoMercatoWeb.com|language=Italian|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"tuttojuve\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-angelo-di-livio-26504|title=Gli eroi in bianconero: Angelo DI LIVIO|publisher=Tutto Juve|language=Italian|author=Stefano Bedeschi|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"glance\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1022803.stm|title=Italy squad at a glance|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 November 2015|date=14 November 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/euro2000/italy/player/delivio.html|title=Profile: Angelo Di Livio|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Phil Cole|date=13 July 2000|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it//1998/luglio/03/Niente_paura_noi_siamo_Italia_ga_0_9807033059.shtml |title=\" Niente paura, noi siamo l' Italia \" |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=Italian |author1=Germano Bovolenta |author2=Nicola Cecere |date=3 July 1998 |accessdate=13 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAngelo's son, [[Lorenzo Di Livio|Lorenzo]], is also a footballer;<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.italianfootballdaily.com/serie-keeping-la-famiglia/|title=Serie A- Keeping in it in La Famiglia {{!}} IFD|last=Mason|first=Joshua|date=12 September 2016|work=www.italianfootballdaily.com|publisher=Italian Football Daily|language=en-US|access-date=25 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126005507/http://www.italianfootballdaily.com/serie-keeping-la-famiglia/|archivedate=26 November 2016}}</ref> a Roma youth product, he currently plays for [[Urbs Sportiva Reggina 1914|Reggina]], on loan from Roma.\n\n==Endorsements==\nAs one of the most popular footballers from his generation, Di Livio has kept his public influence and positive reputation till today.

He played for several Italian clubs in [[Serie A]] throughout his career, coming to prominence with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], where he won several domestic and international titles. At international level he also played for the [[Italy national football team|Italian national side]] in two [[FIFA World Cup]]s and two [[UEFA European Football Championship]]s, reaching the final of [[UEFA Euro 2000]].\n\nDuring his playing career he was known as ''soldatino'' (toy soldier) or ''soldatino Di Livio'', a nickname his Juventus teammate at the time [[Roberto Baggio]] gave him because of Di Livio's characteristic way of running up and down the flank.<ref name=\"soldatino\">{{cite news|url=http://www.pianeta-calcio.it/?page=vedi_incontri_vip&id=257|title=Io, \"Soldatino\" Di Livio|date= 23 September 2011 |accessdate= 10 March 2013 |work = Pianeta-Calcio.it }}</ref><ref name=\"cinquantamila\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinquantamila.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=DI+LIVIO+Angelo|title=Biografia di Angelo Di Livio|publisher=www.cinquantamila.it|language=Italian|author1=Maria Elena Ribezzo|author2=Giorgio Dell'Arti|date=17 January 2014|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in Rome, Di Livio began his career with [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in 1984. Having failed to make an appearance in his only season for the club, Di Livio played for [[A.C. Reggiana|Reggiana]] (1985\u201386), [[A.G. Nocerina 1910|Nocerina]] (1986\u201387), [[A.C. Perugia|Perugia]] (1987\u201389), [[Padova Calcio|Padova]] (1989\u201393), [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] (1993\u201399) and [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] (1999\u20132005).\n\nHis tireless running and quality crossing made him an important element in the dominant Juventus starting lineup from 1993 to 1999, during one of the most successful periods in the club's history. With Juventus, he won three ''[[Scudetto|scudetti]]'' (Italian A League; [[1994\u201395 Serie A|1995]], [[1996\u201397 Serie A|1997]], [[1997\u201398 Serie A|1998]]) and one [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] title ([[1996 UEFA Champions League Final|1996]]), in addition to two [[Italian Supercup]]s ([[1995 Supercoppa Italiana|1995]], [[1997 Supercoppa Italiana|1997]]), a [[1994\u201395 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], an [[UEFA Supercup]] ([[1996 UEFA Super Cup|1996]]), and an [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] ([[1996 Intercontinental Cup|1996]]); he also reached the final of the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup]].\n\nIn 1999, he moved to Fiorentina, where he [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the team to win the [[2000\u201301 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] during the [[2000\u201301 Serie A|2000\u201301 season]]. In 2002, when AC Fiorentina went bankrupt and was reborn as ''Florentia Viola'' in [[Serie C2]], Di Livio showed his dedication by being the only player to stay with the team, as he played through the depths of Italian football on the climb back to [[Serie A]] in 2004, finally retiring after the conclusion of the [[2004\u201305 Serie A]] season.\n\n==International career==\nDi Livio was capped 40 times for [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. He played for Italy at [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]], the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] (where Italy finished in 2nd place), and the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. His first cap came on 6 September 1995 against [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]]; his last on 18 June 2002 against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. At Euro 1996, he set-up [[Pierluigi Casiraghi]]'s first goal in the team's 2\u20131 win in the opening group match against [[Russia national football team|Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1996/matches/round=227/match=52507/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Instinctive Casiraghi helps Italy sink Russia|publisher=UEFA.com|date=6 October 2003}}</ref> For Italy, he was often used as a holding player to shut down games when the team was ahead, thus sealing the win.\n\n==After retirement==\nAfter retiring, Di Livio worked as a coach in the A.S.

Although he was not the most naturally talented or skilled footballer, he was a highly consistent player, who was known for his pace, stamina, work-rate, strength, tenacity, mentality, man-marking ability, and [[Cross (football)|crossing]] accuracy, as well as his ability to make attacking runs down the flank, but also track back, which enabled him to cover the wing effectively, and have a successful career.<ref name=\"soldatino\"/><ref name=\"cinquantamila\"/><ref name=\"euro2000\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/italy/squad/774613.stm|title=Euro 2000 Profile: Angelo Di Livio|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"tuttomercatoweb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/rassegna-stampa/di-livio-capello-non-mi-volle-alla-roma-41347|title=Di Livio: \"Capello non mi volle alla Roma\"|publisher=TuttoMercatoWeb.com|language=Italian|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"tuttojuve\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-angelo-di-livio-26504|title=Gli eroi in bianconero: Angelo DI LIVIO|publisher=Tutto Juve|language=Italian|author=Stefano Bedeschi|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"glance\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1022803.stm|title=Italy squad at a glance|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 November 2015|date=14 November 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/euro2000/italy/player/delivio.html|title=Profile: Angelo Di Livio|publisher=ESPN FC|author1=Phil Cole|date=13 July 2000|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it//1998/luglio/03/Niente_paura_noi_siamo_Italia_ga_0_9807033059.shtml |title=\" Niente paura, noi siamo l' Italia \" |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=Italian |author1=Germano Bovolenta |author2=Nicola Cecere |date=3 July 1998 |accessdate=13 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAngelo's son, [[Lorenzo Di Livio|Lorenzo]], is also a footballer;<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.italianfootballdaily.com/serie-keeping-la-famiglia/|title=Serie A- Keeping in it in La Famiglia {{!}} IFD|last=Mason|first=Joshua|date=12 September 2016|work=www.italianfootballdaily.com|publisher=Italian Football Daily|language=en-US|access-date=25 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126005507/http://www.italianfootballdaily.com/serie-keeping-la-famiglia/|archivedate=26 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> a Roma youth product, he currently plays for [[Urbs Sportiva Reggina 1914|Reggina]], on loan from Roma.\n\n==Endorsements==\nAs one of the most popular footballers from his generation, Di Livio has kept his public influence and positive reputation till today.

Anne de Detroit Catholic Church|Ste. Anne de D\u00e9troit]], founded in 1701, is the second oldest continuously operating [[Roman Catholic]] parish in the [[United States]]. The present church was completed in 1887.]]\n\nBefore the Diocese of Detroit was formed, Michigan had been under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Diocese of Quebec]] from 1701 until sometime after 1796; ''de facto'' American sovereignty was established in that year. At the time, the [[Diocese of Baltimore]] encompassed the whole of the United States. Upon the creation of diocesan seats at [[Diocese of Bardstown|Bardstown]] (1808) and later, at [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]] (1821), Detroit and Michigan were assigned to those sees.\n\n[[Pope Gregory XVI]] formed the Diocese of Detroit March 8, 1833, and named [[Frederick Rese]] as its first bishop.  At the time it covered [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]] and the [[Dakotas]] to the [[Missouri River]]. In 1843, all territory of the diocese not incorporated into the State of Michigan was transferred to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee|Diocese of Milwaukee]].\n\nOn July 29, 1853, [[Pope Pius IX]] formed the [[Vicarate Apostolic of Upper Michigan]], with responsibility for the [[Upper Peninsula]]. The territory of the diocese would be further reduced to its current size by the organization of the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids|Grand Rapids]] (1882), [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing|Lansing]] (1937), and shortly after the see was elevated to the status of an archdiocese, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saginaw|Saginaw]] (1938).<ref name=\"Catholic_Hierarchy\"/>\n\nThe son of Prussian Polish immigrants, Rev. John A. Lemke, born in Detroit on February 10, 1866, was the first native-born Roman Catholic priest of Polish descent to be ordained in America.  He was baptized at [[St. Mary Roman Catholic Church (Detroit, Michigan)|St. Mary Roman Catholic Church]] (1843), at the corner of St. Antoine and Croghan (Monroe Street), on February 18, 1866, attended [[St. Albertus Roman Catholic Church|St. Albertus]] for his primary education, and studied at Detroit College (now the [[University of Detroit Mercy]]), where he received a bachelor's degree in 1884. After attending St. Mary's in Baltimore, he completed his theological studies at St. Francis Seminary in Monroe, Michigan, and he was ordained by Bishop John Samuel Foley in 1889. His added confirmation name was Aloysius.<ref name=Treppa>Treppa, Alan R. [http://www.stalbertus.org/revLemke.pdf Rev. John A.

At the time, the [[Diocese of Baltimore]] encompassed the whole of the United States. Upon the creation of diocesan seats at [[Diocese of Bardstown|Bardstown]] (1808) and later, at [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]] (1821), Detroit and Michigan were assigned to those sees.\n\n[[Pope Gregory XVI]] formed the Diocese of Detroit March 8, 1833, and named [[Frederick Rese]] as its first bishop.  At the time it covered [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota]] and the [[Dakotas]] to the [[Missouri River]]. In 1843, all territory of the diocese not incorporated into the State of Michigan was transferred to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee|Diocese of Milwaukee]].\n\nOn July 29, 1853, [[Pope Pius IX]] formed the [[Vicarate Apostolic of Upper Michigan]], with responsibility for the [[Upper Peninsula]]. The territory of the diocese would be further reduced to its current size by the organization of the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids|Grand Rapids]] (1882), [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing|Lansing]] (1937), and shortly after the see was elevated to the status of an archdiocese, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saginaw|Saginaw]] (1938).<ref name=\"Catholic_Hierarchy\"/>\n\nThe son of Prussian Polish immigrants, Rev. John A. Lemke, born in Detroit on February 10, 1866, was the first native-born Roman Catholic priest of Polish descent to be ordained in America.  He was baptized at [[St. Mary Roman Catholic Church (Detroit, Michigan)|St. Mary Roman Catholic Church]] (1843), at the corner of St. Antoine and Croghan (Monroe Street), on February 18, 1866, attended [[St. Albertus Roman Catholic Church|St. Albertus]] for his primary education, and studied at Detroit College (now the [[University of Detroit Mercy]]), where he received a bachelor's degree in 1884. After attending St. Mary's in Baltimore, he completed his theological studies at St. Francis Seminary in Monroe, Michigan, and he was ordained by Bishop John Samuel Foley in 1889.

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!
