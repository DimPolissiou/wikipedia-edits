A \"\u2014\" indicates that a candidate is not yet on the ballot, but the deadline to appear on the ballot has not yet passed. A \u201cW\u201d indicates a candidate qualified for the ballot but withdrew from the primary, color indicating if the candidate\u2019s name appeared on the ballot (red for not on the ballot, green for on the ballot).

He has a master's degree and a degree in law.\nAs a poet, Jnanpith award winner Prof. O. N. V. Kurup complimented him saying \"He has inherited the subtle poetic richness of the eminent poet Vyloppilly sreedhara Menon, who himself picked up the quality from Kumaranasan'. The late Prof. M. Krishnan Nair, an eminent critic, wrote 'Prabha Varma is a born poet'. His poems are composed of a confluence of tradition and modernity. They have soft romantic emotions, a plethora of poetic images, original and innovative narrative skill, philosophical insights, and a deep understanding of the meaning of life. Prabha Varma is an Academy award-winning Indian poet in Malayalam.The multi-faceted litterateur has published nine collections of poems, three novels in verse,four books on the contemporary socio-political milieu and literature, four collections of essays in criticism, a study on the media, and a travelogue. He was born in 1959 at Kadapra, Thiruvalla as the youngest son of T.K. Narayanan Namboothiri and N. Pankajakshi Thampuratty. Before he became a poet of eminence, he was a student activist associated with the Students Federation of India when in college. During the interregnum of Internal Emergency between 1975 and 1977, he was the Chengannour taluk secretary of the SFI and was elected to executive of the Kerala University Union during the academic year of 1979\u201380. His first collection of poems was Sourparnika, published in 1990. It won for him the prestigious Vyloppilli Award and also the Ankanam Award. His second anthology Arkkapoornima came out soon afterwards, and at the age of 37, he won the Kerala Sahitya Academy award for it. This was followed by poetical collections like Chandananazhi, Aaardram, Kalaprayaga, Avicharitham, Manjinotu Veyil Enna Poleyum, and Aparigraham.The film songs Oru Chembaneer Pooviruthu(2003), Poonthen nermozhi etc.. became instantaneous hits. His magnum - opus SHYAMA MADHAVAM a novel in verse, is a 15 chapter kaavyakhyayika. It revolves around Lord Krishna and the lives of those who come across him during his earthly sojourn, which the poet says is not a series of ecstasies as many believe, but agonies. It is the touching portrayal of the travails of a solitary soul and the rare courage with which Krishna deals with life.The work begins in a dramatically poignant and pensive mood and culminates in his swargaarohana, between which he lapses into a series of confessions and repentance. Shyama Madhavam offers a wide spectrum of Chhandas, Alankaaras and metric patterns such as Dandakas on the one hand and brings out the genuine concern of the lonely inner voice of the legendary hero against the backdrop of changing times. Vayalar Award(2013) was conferred on him for his this work, which bagged for him the National Sahitya Academy Award too. Shyama madhavam won the prestigious Malayattoor Award(2013) too. KANAL CHILAMBU (Anklet of Fire) is a novella in verse.The story, told in seven chapters of around five thousand words,is about love, lust, intrigue, power, revenge and incest. In short all the elements that go into the making of tragedies are at full play here. Most importantly this poignant story of love and revenge answers an age old riddle which posits the question:\"why did the milkmaid laugh when her earthen pot of milk fell to doom?\" Anklet of Fire is the second narrative poem written by Prabha Varma after Shyama madhavam. He has been the honoured recipient of numerous awards. They include the Asan Prize, Ulloor Award, Vallathol Award,Vyloppilli Award (1990), Kunchupillai Award (1993), Krishnageethi Puraskar (1994), Mooloor Award (1995), Changampuzha Award (1997), Mahakavi P Puraskaram (1997), Kadavanad Award (1999), Abudhabi Shakthi Award (1988), Vennikulam Award (2003), A.P.

He has a master's degree and a degree in law.\nAs a poet, Jnanpith award winner Prof. O. N. V. Kurup complimented him saying \"He has inherited the subtle poetic richness of the eminent poet Vyloppilly sreedhara Menon, who himself picked up the quality from Kumaranasan'. The late Prof. M. Krishnan Nair, an eminent critic, wrote 'Prabha Varma is a born poet'. His poems are composed of a confluence of tradition and modernity. They have soft romantic emotions, a plethora of poetic images, original and innovative narrative skill, philosophical insights, and a deep understanding of the meaning of life. Prabha Varma is an Academy award-winning Indian poet in Malayalam.The multi-faceted litterateur has published nine collections of poems, three novels in verse,four books on the contemporary socio-political milieu and literature, four collections of essays in criticism, a study on the media, and a travelogue. He was born in 1959 at Kadapra, Thiruvalla as the youngest son of T.K. Narayanan Namboothiri and N. Pankajakshi Thampuratty. Before he became a poet of eminence, he was a student activist associated with the Students Federation of India when in college. During the interregnum of Internal Emergency between 1975 and 1977, he was the Chengannour taluk secretary of the SFI and was elected to executive of the Kerala University Union during the academic year of 1979\u201380. His first collection of poems was Sourparnika, published in 1990. It won for him the prestigious Vyloppilli Award and also the Ankanam Award. His second anthology Arkkapoornima came out soon afterwards, and at the age of 37, he won the Kerala Sahitya Academy award for it. This was followed by poetical collections like Chandananazhi, Aaardram, Kalaprayaga, Avicharitham, Manjinotu Veyil Enna Poleyum, and Aparigraham.The film songs Oru Chembaneer Pooviruthu(2003), Poonthen nermozhi etc.. became instantaneous hits. His magnum - opus SHYAMA MADHAVAM a novel in verse, is a 15 chapter kaavyakhyayika. It revolves around Lord Krishna and the lives of those who come across him during his earthly sojourn, which the poet says is not a series of ecstasies as many believe, but agonies. It is the touching portrayal of the travails of a solitary soul and the rare courage with which Krishna deals with life.The work begins in a dramatically poignant and pensive mood and culminates in his swargaarohana, between which he lapses into a series of confessions and repentance. Shyama Madhavam offers a wide spectrum of Chhandas, Alankaaras and metric patterns such as Dandakas on the one hand and brings out the genuine concern of the lonely inner voice of the legendary hero against the backdrop of changing times. Vayalar Award(2013) was conferred on him for his this work, which bagged for him the National Sahitya Academy Award too. Shyama madhavam won the prestigious Malayattoor Award(2013) too. KANAL CHILAMBU (Anklet of Fire) is a novella in verse.The story, told in seven chapters of around five thousand words,is about love, lust, intrigue, power, revenge and incest. In short all the elements that go into the making of tragedies are at full play here. Most importantly this poignant story of love and revenge answers an age old riddle which posits the question:\"why did the milkmaid laugh when her earthen pot of milk fell to doom?\" Anklet of Fire is the second narrative poem written by Prabha Varma after Shyama madhavam. He has been the honoured recipient of numerous awards. They include the Asan Prize, Ulloor Award, Vallathol Award,Vyloppilli Award (1990), Kunchupillai Award (1993), Krishnageethi Puraskar (1994), Mooloor Award (1995), Changampuzha Award (1997), Mahakavi P Puraskaram (1997), Kadavanad Award (1999), Abudhabi Shakthi Award (1988), Vennikulam Award (2003), A.P.

It was directed by [[Eric Darnell]] and [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] from a screenplay by [[Mark Burton (writer)|Mark Burton]], [[Billy Frolick]], Darnell, and McGrath, and features an [[ensemble cast]], consisting of [[Ben Stiller]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Schwimmer]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Andy Richter]], [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]], [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Christopher Knights]], [[Conrad Vernon]], [[Eric Darnell]], David P. Smith, [[Elisa Gabrielli]], [[Bob Saget]], David Cowgill, and Stephen Apostolina.\n\nReleased on May 27, 2005, it received mixed reviews from critics, but was a success at the box office, and was one of the biggest-selling films of 2005. The film launched a [[Madagascar (franchise)|franchise]] with a series of films, including the sequel, ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'' in 2008. Another film, ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' was released in 2012, and a spin-off featuring the series' penguin characters, ''[[Penguins of Madagascar]]'', was released on November 26, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[Central Park Zoo]], Marty the [[zebra]] celebrates his tenth birthday but has grown bored with his daily routine and longs to experience the wild. Marty's best friend is Alex the [[lion]], who enjoys showing off for the public and his celebrity status as \"the king of New York\". Alex attempts to cheer Marty up, but Marty, still unsatisfied, learns that the zoo's [[penguin]]s\u2014Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private\u2014are trying to escape, and follows them out. Alex, Melman the [[giraffe]], and Gloria the [[hippopotamus]] pursue Marty and attempt to convince him to return. The four, along with the penguins and two [[chimpanzee]]s named Mason and Phil, converge at [[Grand Central Station]] where the authorities sedate them using [[tranquilizer gun]]s. Under pressure from anti-captivity activists, the zoo is forced to ship the escaped animals by sea to a [[Kenya]]n wildlife preserve. During their travels, the penguins escape and take over the ship, intent on taking it to [[Antarctica]]. Their antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria to fall overboard and wash ashore on [[Madagascar]].\n\nInitially believing themselves to be at the [[San Diego Zoo]], the animals come across a pack of [[lemur]]s led by King Julien XIII. The predatory [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] attack the lemurs, but are scared off by Alex's fearsome appearance. Alex blames Marty for the group's predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, and Gloria and Melman soon join him in enjoying the island. Alex eventually comes around, but without the raw [[steak]]s he was provided at the zoo, hunger sets in and his [[prey drive]] begins to show. King Julien has the lemurs befriend the zoo animals in the hope that Alex's presence will keep the fossa at bay, despite his adviser Maurice's warnings about Alex's predatory nature. When Alex loses control and attacks Marty, Julien realizes that he is a threat and banishes him to the predator side of the island, where the fossa live. Seeing what has happened to Alex, and how dangerous the wild can be, Marty begins to regret his decision to leave the zoo.\n\nThe penguins, having been to Antarctica and found it inhospitable, land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing the chance to return Alex to New York, Marty crosses over to the predator side and attempts to convince the grizzled, starving Alex to return, but Alex refuses out of fear that he will attack Marty again. The fossa attack Marty, and though Gloria, Melman, and the penguins come to the rescue, they are outnumbered. Alex overcomes his predatory instincts, rescues his friends, and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory forever. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex, and the penguins satisfy his hunger by feeding him [[sushi]]. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to break the news that the ship has run out of fuel.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:David Schwimmer 2005 Madagascar.jpg|thumb|[[David Schwimmer]] at the film's British premiere in London]]\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Alex, a [[lion]].

It was directed by [[Eric Darnell]] and [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] from a screenplay by [[Mark Burton (writer)|Mark Burton]], [[Billy Frolick]], Darnell, and McGrath, and features an [[ensemble cast]], consisting of [[Ben Stiller]], [[Chris Rock]], [[David Schwimmer]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Andy Richter]], [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]], [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Christopher Knights]], [[Conrad Vernon]], [[Eric Darnell]], David P. Smith, [[Elisa Gabrielli]], [[Bob Saget]], David Cowgill, and Stephen Apostolina.\n\nReleased on May 27, 2005, it received mixed reviews from critics, but was a success at the box office, and was one of the biggest-selling films of 2005. The film launched a [[Madagascar (franchise)|franchise]] with a series of films, including the sequel, ''[[Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa]]'' in 2008. Another film, ''[[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted]]'' was released in 2012, and a spin-off featuring the series' penguin characters, ''[[Penguins of Madagascar]]'', was released on November 26, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nAt the [[Central Park Zoo]], Marty the [[zebra]] celebrates his tenth birthday but has grown bored with his daily routine and longs to experience the wild. Marty's best friend is Alex the [[lion]], who enjoys showing off for the public and his celebrity status as \"the king of New York\". Alex attempts to cheer Marty up, but Marty, still unsatisfied, learns that the zoo's [[penguin]]s\u2014Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private\u2014are trying to escape, and follows them out. Alex, Melman the [[giraffe]], and Gloria the [[hippopotamus]] pursue Marty and attempt to convince him to return. The four, along with the penguins and two [[chimpanzee]]s named Mason and Phil, converge at [[Grand Central Station]] where the authorities sedate them using [[tranquilizer gun]]s. Under pressure from anti-captivity activists, the zoo is forced to ship the escaped animals by sea to a [[Kenya]]n wildlife preserve. During their travels, the penguins escape and take over the ship, intent on taking it to [[Antarctica]]. Their antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria to fall overboard and wash ashore on [[Madagascar]].\n\nInitially believing themselves to be at the [[San Diego Zoo]], the animals come across a pack of [[lemur]]s led by King Julien XIII. The predatory [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] attack the lemurs, but are scared off by Alex's fearsome appearance. Alex blames Marty for the group's predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, and Gloria and Melman soon join him in enjoying the island. Alex eventually comes around, but without the raw [[steak]]s he was provided at the zoo, hunger sets in and his [[prey drive]] begins to show. King Julien has the lemurs befriend the zoo animals in the hope that Alex's presence will keep the fossa at bay, despite his adviser Maurice's warnings about Alex's predatory nature. When Alex loses control and attacks Marty, Julien realizes that he is a threat and banishes him to the predator side of the island, where the fossa live. Seeing what has happened to Alex, and how dangerous the wild can be, Marty begins to regret his decision to leave the zoo.\n\nThe penguins, having been to Antarctica and found it inhospitable, land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing the chance to return Alex to New York, Marty crosses over to the predator side and attempts to convince the grizzled, starving Alex to return, but Alex refuses out of fear that he will attack Marty again. The fossa attack Marty, and though Gloria, Melman, and the penguins come to the rescue, they are outnumbered. Alex overcomes his predatory instincts, rescues his friends, and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory forever. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex, and the penguins satisfy his hunger by feeding him [[sushi]]. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to break the news that the ship has run out of fuel.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:David Schwimmer 2005 Madagascar.jpg|thumb|[[David Schwimmer]] at the film's British premiere in London]]\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Alex, a [[lion]].

The glacier flows at a rate of {{convert|20|-|35|m|abbr=on}} per day, resulting in around 20 billion tonnes of [[icebergs]] calved off and passing out of the fjord every year.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1149 The official website of UNESCO World Heritage Site Ilulissat Icefjord]</ref>\n\nIcebergs breaking from the glacier are often so large \u2014up to a kilometer (3,300&nbsp;ft) in height\u2014 that they are too tall to float down the fjord and lie stuck on the bottom of its shallower areas, sometimes for years, until they are broken up by the force of the glacier and icebergs further up the fjord. On breaking up the icebergs emerge into the open sea and initially travel north with ocean currents before turning south and running into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Larger icebergs typically do not melt until they reach [[40th parallel north|40]]-[[45th parallel north|45 degrees north]] \u2014further south than the [[United Kingdom]] and level with [[New York City]].<ref>[http://www.geus.dk/viden_om/voii/ilulissat-uk/index-uk.html Explore Ilulissat Icefjord \u2013 teaching material from GEUS]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of fjords of Greenland]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120213211305/http://www.geus.dk/publications/boeger/ilulissat-uk.htm Ilulissat Icefjord].
