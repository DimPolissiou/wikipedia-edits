They are also known for their songs \"Gata Salvaje\" (featuring [[Daddy Yankee]] and [[Nicky Jam]]), \"Morena\" (featuring [[Glory (singer)|Glory]] and [[Don Omar]]) and \"Amor de Colegio\" (featuring Don Omar).\n\nH\u00e9ctor & Tito started their career in the 1990s going by the name of \"Los Bambinos\" after singing with other reggaeton artists. Together, they released several albums and rose to fame in all Latin America.\n\nIn 2004, the duo announced they were separating. Since then, they have gone on with their careers separately. Although not really in a tiraera war, their friendship remained tense for a time though both have publicly reconciled in present time. The singers are now known as [[H\u00e9ctor el Father]] and [[Tito El Bambino]] would go on to be two of the most successful solo acts in Latin music history. [[H\u00e9ctor el Father]] retired in 2008 to become an evangelical pastor in Puerto Rico, while [[Tito El Bambino]] remains active in the music industry.\n\n== Beginnings ==\nEfrain Fines (Tito) and Hector Delgado were born in 1981 and 1979 respectively in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Both artists resided in the neighborhood of Parque Ecuestre and began their artistic pursuits in their teens. Hector El Father was part of the rap group \"Masters Of Funk\" alongside Rey and [[Julio Voltio]], while [[Tito El Bambino]] recorded with various local DJs gaining an appearance in the famous [[reggaeton]] series \"The Noise vol. 5\" which was considered his big break into the music scene. Thanks to local DJs such as Chiclin and Estefano, Tito and Hector form a friendship which evolved into a duo when Hector separated from Masters Of Funk. After appearances on many compilations from local DJs and producers from Puerto Rico, the duo connect with DJ Goldy and sign to [[VI Music]] in order to prepare their first album \"[[Violencia Musical]]\". Violencia Musical was released in 1998 and became a huge commercial and critical success in Puerto Rico, selling over 100,000 copies at the time and turning the duo into one of the most popular music groups in the island.<ref>http://www.coveralia.com/biografias/Hector-y-Tito.php Coveralia biography</ref>\n\n== International recognition ==\nOver the course of time, the [[reggaeton]] genre gained prominence outside of Puerto Rico and despite Hector y Tito's temporary loss of popularity due to a Christian album which didn't sell well and rap battles against Rubio y Joel and Baby Rasta y Gringo which also affected their sales; by 2002 Hector y Tito won their lyrical battle against Rubio y Joel and regained their position as one of the most popular acts in Puerto Rico. This was good news for the company [[Universal Latino]] which entered in a partnership with [[VI Music]] to distribute Hector y Tito's much anticipated \"[[A La Reconquista]]\", which became one of the first widely distributed reggaeton albums during the genre's boom period of 2002-2006. Thanks to international hits such as \"Duele (Cuando El Amor Se Va)\", \"Gata Salvaje\" featuring [[Daddy Yankee]] and [[Nicky Jam]] and \"Felina\". The positive reception of these songs throughout [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]] made Hector y Tito protagonists in the expansion of the reggaeton [[culture]] alongside artists such as [[Don Omar]], [[Tego Calderon]] and the hitmaking production duo [[Luny Tunes]]. \"A La Reconquista\" also served as a launching pad for the career of Don Omar whom was signed to Hector 'El Father' and VI Music leading to Omar writing many of the songs from the album including his featurings. \"A La Reconquista\" is recognized as one of the greatest reggaeton albums of all-time and was both a commercial and critical success winning a [[Billboard Latin Music Award]] for best Latin rap album.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71168/2003-billboard-latin-music-award-winners Billboard list of winners for 2003</ref> The [[Live music|live]] version of the album A La Reconquista \"[[La Historia Live|La Historia: Live]]\" which includes additional live performances of some of the duo's earlier hits was certified Latin platinum by the RIAA in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|title=Gold & Platinum|website=RIAA}}</ref>\n\n== Separation ==\nDue to unforeseen pressures from the unexpected success, tensions arose between the fellow artists and both decided to pursue solo ambitions amid an inamicable split.

They are also known for their songs \"Gata Salvaje\" (featuring [[Daddy Yankee]] and [[Nicky Jam]]), \"Morena\" (featuring [[Glory (singer)|Glory]] and [[Don Omar]]) and \"Amor de Colegio\" (featuring Don Omar).\n\nH\u00e9ctor & Tito started their career in the 1990s going by the name of \"Los Bambinos\" after singing with other reggaeton artists. Together, they released several albums and rose to fame in all Latin America.\n\nIn 2004, the duo announced they were separating. Since then, they have gone on with their careers separately. Although not really in a tiraera war, their friendship remained tense for a time though both have publicly reconciled in present time. The singers are now known as [[H\u00e9ctor el Father]] and [[Tito El Bambino]] would go on to be two of the most successful solo acts in Latin music history. [[H\u00e9ctor el Father]] retired in 2008 to become an evangelical pastor in Puerto Rico, while [[Tito El Bambino]] remains active in the music industry.\n\n== Beginnings ==\nEfrain Fines (Tito) and Hector Delgado were born in 1981 and 1979 respectively in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Both artists resided in the neighborhood of Parque Ecuestre and began their artistic pursuits in their teens. Hector El Father was part of the rap group \"Masters Of Funk\" alongside Rey and [[Julio Voltio]], while [[Tito El Bambino]] recorded with various local dj's gaining an appearance in the famous [[reggaeton]] series \"The Noise vol. 5\" which was considered his big break into the music scene. Thanks to local dj's such as Chiclin and Estefano, Tito and Hector form a friendship which evolved into a duo when Hector separated from Masters Of Funk. After appearances on many compilations from local dj's and producers from Puerto Rico, the duo connect with DJ Goldy and sign to [[VI Music]] in order to prepare their first album \"[[Violencia Musical]]\". Violencia Musical was released in 1998 and became a huge commercial and critical success in Puerto Rico, selling over 100,000 copies at the time and turning the duo into one of the most popular music groups in the island.<ref>http://www.coveralia.com/biografias/Hector-y-Tito.php Coveralia biography</ref>\n\n== International recognition ==\nOver the course of time, the [[reggaeton]] genre gained prominence outside of Puerto Rico and despite Hector y Tito's temporary loss of popularity due to a Christian album which didn't sell well and rap battles against Rubio y Joel and Baby Rasta y Gringo which also affected their sales; by 2002 Hector y Tito won their lyrical battle against Rubio y Joel and regained their position as one of the most popular acts in Puerto Rico. This was good news for the company [[Universal Latino]] which entered in a partnership with [[VI Music]] to distribute Hector y Tito's much anticipated \"[[A La Reconquista]]\", which became one of the first widely distributed reggaeton albums during the genre's boom period of 2002-2006. Thanks to international hits such as \"Duele (Cuando El Amor Se Va)\", \"Gata Salvaje\" featuring [[Daddy Yankee]] and [[Nicky Jam]] and \"Felina\". The positive reception of these songs throughout [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]] made Hector y Tito protagonists in the expansion of the reggaeton [[culture]] alongside artists such as [[Don Omar]], [[Tego Calderon]] and the hitmaking production duo [[Luny Tunes]]. \"A La Reconquista\" also served as a launching pad for the career of Don Omar whom was signed to Hector 'El Father' and VI Music leading to Omar writing many of the songs from the album including his featurings. \"A La Reconquista\" is recognized as one of the greatest reggaeton albums of all-time and was both a commercial and critical success winning a [[Billboard Latin Music Award]] for best Latin rap album.<ref>https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/71168/2003-billboard-latin-music-award-winners Billboard list of winners for 2003</ref> The [[Live music|live]] version of the album A La Reconquista \"[[La Historia Live|La Historia: Live]]\" which includes additional live performances of some of the duo's earlier hits was certified Latin platinum by the RIAA in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|title=Gold & Platinum|website=RIAA}}</ref>\n\n== Separation ==\nDue to unforeseen pressures from the unexpected success, tensions arose between the fellow artists and both decided to pursue solo ambitions amid an inamicable split.

[[Julio Zinser]] piloted the maiden flight on the Mexico City \u2013 [[Acapulco]] route on 14 September 1934.\n[[File:Aeromexico Mexico Acapulco ca 1935.jpg|thumb|An early [[Bellanca Aircraft Company|Bellanca]] aircraft of Aerom\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico City \u2013 Acapulco ca. 1935.]]\n[[File:Bristol 175 302 XA-MED Aeronaves JFK 1958 edited-2.jpg|thumb|Aeronaves de Mexico Bristol Britannia at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]] in 1958.]]\n\n===1940s===\nWhen World War II began, the airline continued to grow with the help of [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], which owned 25% of the new Mexican airline. Aerom\u00e9xico saw few changes for the next two decades. However, during the 1950s, renovation began, and the airline took over various small competitor companies across the country, including Aerov\u00edas Guest (the second airline of the country at that time) that held the routes to [[Madrid]] and Paris. Aerom\u00e9xico added aircraft including the [[Douglas DC-3]] and its successor, the [[Douglas DC-4]].\n\n===1950s===\nDuring the late 1950s, the Douglas DC-4s were replaced by some pressurized [[Douglas DC-6]]s and two [[Bristol Britannia]]s (the first turboprop passenger aircraft in the fleet) and in 1958, services were inaugurated to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]] (now JFK) using the Britannias. The Mexico City-[[New York City|New York]] route would prove profitable for \"Aeronaves\" and its North American competitors. The airline was [[nationalization|nationalised]] in 1959.\n\n===1960s===\nIn the early 1960s, the fleet of Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico (Aerom\u00e9xico) included Douglas DC-3, Douglas DC-6, and Bristol Britannia aircraft. Starting in 1961, \"Aeronaves\" began replacing its piston-engined aircraft with new jets. The first jet-engined aircraft were a pair of [[Douglas DC-8]]s. The DC-8s were used on routes within Mexico and to New York City. In 1963, Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico (Aerom\u00e9xico) took over [[Aerovias Guest]] airlines and they were merged under the name Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico. Later in the 1960s, more DC-8s were added and service to Europe was resumed, operated by two [[de Havilland Comet 4C]] jet aircraft dry-leased by Aerov\u00edas Guest prior to the merger.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Douglas DC-8-51 XA-SID Aeronaves TOR 26.03.71 edited-3.jpg|thumb|An Aeronaves de Mexico [[Douglas DC-8]] at [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] in 1971.]]\n[[File:Douglas DC-9-30 XA-DEK Aeromexico MIA 03.08.75 edited-2.jpg|thumb|An Aerom\u00e9xico Douglas DC-9-32 at [[Miami International Airport]] in 1975.]]\nThe 1970s brought dramatic changes for Aerom\u00e9xico. In 1970, under a government plan, Mexican domestic airlines were nationalized into an integrated air transport system under the control of Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico. The system included eight smaller carriers, although these were later disbanded.<ref name=\"FI\"/>\nDuring the early 1970s, the remaining Douglas DC-6 and Bristol Britannia aircraft were retired. A new color scheme (orange and black) was introduced and the airline changed its name from \"Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico\" to its current, shortened version of Aerom\u00e9xico in February 1972.\n\nAerom\u00e9xico, as one of the launch customers of the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30]] program, received the first of its aircraft in 1974. That same year the airline also took delivery of its first seven [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32s]]. During this period the airline's popularity and visibility grew dramatically. This was due in part to Aerom\u00e9xico's involvement in [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican movies]]. Basically, every time characters in any movie produced in Mexico had to fly somewhere, they were depicted as flying on Aerom\u00e9xico aircraft. Service to Canada was initiated and in the early 1970s, two more DC-9-15s were added to the fleet.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\n===1980s===\nThe early 1980s were marked by expansion. A new color scheme was introduced (orange paint and silver), two DC-10-15s and a DC-10-30 were added in 1981 and in 1984. Aerom\u00e9xico, one of the launch customers of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|McDonnell Douglas MD-82]] (an elongated version of the DC-9), received its first two in late 1981. Between 1980 and 1981, eight more DC-9-32 aircraft were added.\nOn 31 August 1986, the company suffered its only fatal accident outside Mexico when [[Aerom\u00e9xico Flight 498]], a Douglas DC-9, approaching [[Los Angeles International Airport]] was struck by a [[light aircraft]]. Both aircraft then fell to earth in the Los Angeles suburb of [[Cerritos, California]]. All 64 passengers and crew on board the DC-9-32 were killed, as were the three people in the light aircraft and 15 people on the ground. After three years and a long trial, the aircraft's crew and the airline were found not to blame. This was because the pilot of the Piper had strayed into an air traffic control zone reserved for commercial flights. That same year, the airline acquired the charter carrier [[GATSA]] and used it for charter operations until December.\nIn April 1988, the state-owned company was declared bankrupt and grounded for three months because of lack of organization, a fleet with an average of 20 years without a renovation plan and a depredating administration by the Mexican Government. In August, a privatization program was underway. This involved retiring the eight Douglas DC-8s along with the remaining ten DC-9-15 aircraft. Starting the privatization process included a new corporate name (Aerovias de Mexico SA de CV). The airline restarted operations with its predecessor's assets, including the headquarters building, maintenance hangar, some aircraft, and some former Aeronaves de Mexico employees.\n[[File:Aeromexico Boeing 767-300ER at Los Cabos International Airport.jpg|thumb|An Aerom\u00e9xico [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-300]] At [[Los Cabos International Airport]].]]\n\n===1990s===\nThe early 1990s were turbulent times, with the rise in fuel costs due to the [[Gulf War]], and a domestic fare war caused by start-up airlines like [[TAESA]], [[Servicios A\u00e9reos Rutas Oriente]], [[Aviacsa]], among others, as well as constant labor problems. In April 1991 the first two 767-200ERs were introduced to the fleet starting to replace DC-10s in services to Europe, New York, and Tijuana, another two 767-300ERs joined the fleet later that year. This was all a part of a renovation and expansion program to introduce 24 direct flights to [[Barajas Airport|Madrid]] and [[Charles De Gaulle Airport|Paris]] from [[Mexico City International Airport|Mexico City]] with Boeing 767s as well as services to [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]] via Paris and Rome via Madrid.\n\nIn 1992 Grupo Aerom\u00e9xico was among other investors that failed to consummate the acquisition of [[Continental Airlines]]. After failing to invest in Continental, Aerom\u00e9xico acquired the bankrupt Aeroper\u00fa from the [[Politics of Peru|Peruvian government]].\n\nIn 1993 Aerom\u00e9xico Group took over [[Mexicana de Aviaci\u00f3n|Mexicana]], the second-largest airline in the Mexican market under the same management. There was a great dispute in June 1993 with the pilot union regarding the transfer of flights to regional subsidiary Aeromonterrey, which had non-union pilots.<ref>{{cite book|title=ITF News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bV5ZAAAAYAAJ|year=1994|publisher=International Transport Workers' Federation}}</ref> Between 1994 and 1995, the six DC-10 aircraft in the fleet were finally retired. Their last revenue flight was in 1995.\n\nIn December 1994 (three weeks after Carlos Salinas de Gortari left the office), the first of several devaluations in the next 18 months started, giving way to an economic crisis in [[Mexico]]. As a consequence, Aerom\u00e9xico had to cut capacity and flights to Frankfurt and Rome were canceled, four McDonnell Douglas MD-80s and four [[Boeing 767]]s were returned to their lessors, early retirement for pilots and other staff was underway, and a new Boeing 767 due for delivery in April 1995 was instead transferred to another airline. Flights to Madrid and Paris were operated only by two Boeing 767-300ER jets.\n\nIn 1996 Cintra was created to prevent the two main carriers from going bankrupt. Some [[Boeing 757]]s of Aerom\u00e9xico's original renovation program were transferred to Mexicana and [[Aeroper\u00fa]]. The market and the airline recovered between 1996 and 1998; eight McDonnell Douglas MD80s were leased back along with two Boeing 767-200ERs.\n\nThe sale of Grupo Cintra was scheduled after several delays in September 1999, and with the looming presidential elections in 2000, everything was delayed once again. The ruling party lost the election after 70 years in office and all the policies changed. Due to the recession in 2000, the new government put everything on hold, waiting for better economic conditions to start the stock sell-off, and just when everything was about to start, the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] occurred and nothing materialized since the two main carriers, Mexicana and Aerom\u00e9xico, were losing large amounts of money.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:Aeromexico Boeing 737-700 Airwim-1.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-700]] in the airline's old livery.]]\nBetween 2000 and 2005, Aerom\u00e9xico had an average fleet of 60 aircraft in mainline operation, plus 20 in [[Aerolitoral]], as well as five CEOs during this time. On 22 June 2000, the airline, along with [[Air France]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], and [[Korean Air]], founded the [[SkyTeam]] global airline alliance. After 9/11 and the Iraq War, it pursued a fleet renovation program. In 2003, the airline acquired its first [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-700]] instead of the [[Boeing 717]] as a replacement for its aging DC-9 aircraft. On 29 March 2006 Aerom\u00e9xico CEO, Andr\u00e9s Conesa announced the inauguration of direct flights between Japan and Mexico City via [[Tijuana]]. This was after the purchase of two [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ERs]], making Aerom\u00e9xico the third airline in [[Latin America]] to fly regularly to Asia, after [[Varig]] and the now-defunct [[VASP]]. Since Varig's demise, Aerom\u00e9xico is currently the only airline with this service. Aerom\u00e9xico resumed its Mexico City-Tijuana-Shanghai route twice a week as of 30 March 2010. Suspension of this flight was due to the [[2009 flu pandemic]].\n\nOn 29 June 2006, the [[International Lease Finance Corporation]] (ILFC) and Aerom\u00e9xico announced that the airline would operate three [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]s. Aerom\u00e9xico's deliveries were scheduled to begin in early 2012. From 2006, Consorcio Aerom\u00e9xico S.A. de C.V., the parent company of Aerom\u00e9xico at the time, faced large debts and had no profits to pay them off, so it offered Aerom\u00e9xico for sale in 2007. In early October, a week-long auction was held, with [[Grupo Financiero Banamex]], a unit of [[Citigroup]], competing against the Saba family. On 17 October 2007, Banamex offered the highest bid and purchased the airline for US$249.1 million. In October 2010, Aerom\u00e9xico's largest competitor, Mexicana de Aviacion, filed for bankruptcy and was placed in administration.\n\n===2010s===\n====Delta/Aerom\u00e9xico alliance====\nIn 2011, Delta Air Lines and Aerom\u00e9xico signed an enhanced commercial alliance, building on an original agreement from 1994.<ref name=delta2015>{{cite web|url=http://news.delta.com/delta-and-aerom-xico-21-year-partnership|title=Delta and Aerom\u00e9xico: A 21-year partnership|website=Delta News Hub|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref> The 2011 agreement provided for codeshare on all the carriers' Mexico\u2013US flights; Delta investing US$65 million in Aerom\u00e9xico shares; and Delta gaining a seat on the Aerom\u00e9xico board of directors. \n* In March 2014, the airlines opened Tech Ops Mexico, a US$55 million joint maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility in [[Queretaro City]], Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delta-and-aeromexico-create-enhanced-commercial-alliance-127450473.html|title=Delta and Aeromexico Create Enhanced Commercial Alliance|first=Delta Air|last=Lines|website=Prnewswire.com|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref> \n*In March 2015, the airlines filed applications for antitrust immunity, a first step in the creation of a US$1.5 billion joint cooperation agreement (JCA) that will allow Delta and Aerom\u00e9xico to jointly sell, and share costs and profits on all Mexico\u2013U.S. routes.<ref name=delta2015/> \n*In May 2015, Mexican regulator approved the JCA; and in the same month, the [[Senate of the Republic (Mexico)|Mexican Senate]] approved [[Open Skies]] between the U.S. and Mexico. \n* In November 2016, the DOT approved the joint venture under strict conditions that the airlines give up slots in both Mexico City and New York-JFK.\n*In December 2016 the two airlines made the final agreement to go forward with the JV and antitrust immunity was granted.<ref name=strib>{{cite news|last=Painter |first=Kristen Leigh |url=http://www.startribune.com/delta-to-move-forward-with-aeromexico-joint-venture/407788926/ |title=Delta to move forward with Aeromexico joint venture |website=Startribune.com |publisher=Star Tribune Media Company LLC |date=21 December 2016 |access-date=5 January 2017}}</ref>\n* In February 2017, Delta announced an offer to acquire additional shares of Aerom\u00e9xico, up to 49%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.delta.com/delta-announces-launch-cash-tender-offer-acquire-additional-shares-grupo-aeromexico|title=Delta announces launch of cash tender offer to acquire additional shares of Grupo Aeromexico|website=Delta News Hub|accessdate=4 August 2017}}</ref>\n*On 8 May 2017, the joint commercial agreement went into effect, whereby the airlines share information and jointly determine routes and pricing on all U.S.-Mexico flights, and share costs and profits.<ref name=dpr/>\n\n====Dreamliners====\nOn 25 July 2012, Aerom\u00e9xico CEO Andr\u00e9s Conesa announced the purchase of six Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners.

[[Julio Zinser]] piloted the maiden flight on the Mexico City \u2013 [[Acapulco]] route on 14 September 1934.\n[[File:Aeromexico Mexico Acapulco ca 1935.jpg|thumb|An early [[Bellanca Aircraft Company|Bellanca]] aircraft of Aerom\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico City \u2013 Acapulco ca. 1935.]]\n[[File:Bristol 175 302 XA-MED Aeronaves JFK 1958 edited-2.jpg|thumb|Aeronaves de Mexico Bristol Britannia at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]] in 1958.]]\n\n===1940s===\nWhen World War II began, the airline continued to grow with the help of [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], which owned 25% of the new Mexican airline. Aerom\u00e9xico saw few changes for the next two decades. However, during the 1950s, renovation began, and the airline took over various small competitor companies across the country, including Aerov\u00edas Guest (the second airline of the country at that time) that held the routes to [[Madrid]] and Paris. Aerom\u00e9xico added aircraft including the [[Douglas DC-3]] and its successor, the [[Douglas DC-4]].\n\n===1950s===\nDuring the late 1950s, the Douglas DC-4s were replaced by some pressurized [[Douglas DC-6]]s and two [[Bristol Britannia]]s (the first turboprop passenger aircraft in the fleet) and in 1958, services were inaugurated to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]] (now JFK) using the Britannias. The Mexico City-[[New York City|New York]] route would prove profitable for \"Aeronaves\" and its North American competitors. The airline was [[nationalization|nationalised]] in 1959.\n\n===1960s===\nIn the early 1960s, the fleet of Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico (Aerom\u00e9xico) included Douglas DC-3, Douglas DC-6, and Bristol Britannia aircraft. Starting in 1961, \"Aeronaves\" began replacing its piston-engined aircraft with new jets. The first jet-engined aircraft were a pair of [[Douglas DC-8]]s. The DC-8s were used on routes within Mexico and to New York City. In 1963, Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico (Aerom\u00e9xico) took over [[Aerovias Guest]] airlines and they were merged under the name Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico. Later in the 1960s, more DC-8s were added and service to Europe was resumed, operated by two [[de Havilland Comet 4C]] jet aircraft dry-leased by Aerov\u00edas Guest prior to the merger.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Douglas DC-8-51 XA-SID Aeronaves TOR 26.03.71 edited-3.jpg|thumb|An Aeronaves de Mexico [[Douglas DC-8]] at [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] in 1971.]]\n[[File:Douglas DC-9-30 XA-DEK Aeromexico MIA 03.08.75 edited-2.jpg|thumb|An Aerom\u00e9xico Douglas DC-9-32 at [[Miami International Airport]] in 1975.]]\nThe 1970s brought dramatic changes for Aerom\u00e9xico. In 1970, under a government plan, Mexican domestic airlines were nationalized into an integrated air transport system under the control of Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico. The system included eight smaller carriers, although these were later disbanded.<ref name=\"FI\"/>\nDuring the early 1970s, the remaining Douglas DC-6 and Bristol Britannia aircraft were retired. A new color scheme (orange and black) was introduced and the airline changed its name from \"Aeronaves de M\u00e9xico\" to its current, shortened version of Aerom\u00e9xico in February 1972.\n\nAerom\u00e9xico, as one of the launch customers of the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30]] program, received the first of its aircraft in 1974. That same year the airline also took delivery of its first seven [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32s]]. During this period the airline's popularity and visibility grew dramatically. This was due in part to Aerom\u00e9xico's involvement in [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican movies]]. Basically, every time characters in any movie produced in Mexico had to fly somewhere, they were depicted as flying on Aerom\u00e9xico aircraft. Service to Canada was initiated and in the early 1970s, two more DC-9-15s were added to the fleet.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\n===1980s===\nThe early 1980s were marked by expansion. A new color scheme was introduced (orange paint and silver), two DC-10-15s and a DC-10-30 were added in 1981 and in 1984. Aerom\u00e9xico, one of the launch customers of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|McDonnell Douglas MD-82]] (an elongated version of the DC-9), received its first two in late 1981. Between 1980 and 1981, eight more DC-9-32 aircraft were added.\nOn 31 August 1986, the company suffered its only fatal accident outside Mexico when [[Aerom\u00e9xico Flight 498]], a Douglas DC-9, approaching [[Los Angeles International Airport]] was struck by a [[light aircraft]]. Both aircraft then fell to earth in the Los Angeles suburb of [[Cerritos, California]]. All 64 passengers and crew on board the DC-9-32 were killed, as were the three people in the light aircraft and 15 people on the ground. After three years and a long trial, the aircraft's crew and the airline were found not to blame. This was because the pilot of the Piper had strayed into an air traffic control zone reserved for commercial flights. That same year, the airline acquired the charter carrier [[GATSA]] and used it for charter operations until December.\nIn April 1988, the state-owned company was declared bankrupt and grounded for three months because of lack of organization, a fleet with an average of 20 years without a renovation plan and a depredating administration by the Mexican Government. In August, a privatization program was underway. This involved retiring the eight Douglas DC-8s along with the remaining ten DC-9-15 aircraft. Starting the privatization process included a new corporate name (Aerovias de Mexico SA de CV). The airline restarted operations with its predecessor's assets, including the headquarters building, maintenance hangar, some aircraft, and some former Aeronaves de Mexico employees.\n[[File:Aeromexico Boeing 767-300ER at Los Cabos International Airport.jpg|thumb|An Aerom\u00e9xico [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-300]] At [[Los Cabos International Airport]].]]\n\n===1990s===\nThe early 1990s were turbulent times, with the rise in fuel costs due to the [[Gulf War]], and a domestic fare war caused by start-up airlines like [[TAESA]], [[Servicios A\u00e9reos Rutas Oriente]], [[Aviacsa]], among others, as well as constant labor problems. In April 1991 the first two 767-200ERs were introduced to the fleet starting to replace DC-10s in services to Europe, New York, and Tijuana, another two 767-300ERs joined the fleet later that year. This was all a part of a renovation and expansion program to introduce 24 direct flights to [[Barajas Airport|Madrid]] and [[Charles De Gaulle Airport|Paris]] from [[Mexico City International Airport|Mexico City]] with Boeing 767s as well as services to [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]] via Paris and Rome via Madrid.\n\nIn 1992 Grupo Aerom\u00e9xico was among other investors that failed to consummate the acquisition of [[Continental Airlines]]. After failing to invest in Continental, Aerom\u00e9xico acquired the bankrupt Aeroper\u00fa from the [[Politics of Peru|Peruvian government]].\n\nIn 1993 Aerom\u00e9xico Group took over [[Mexicana de Aviaci\u00f3n|Mexicana]], the second-largest airline in the Mexican market under the same management. There was a great dispute in June 1993 with the pilot union regarding the transfer of flights to regional subsidiary Aeromonterrey, which had non-union pilots.<ref>{{cite book|title=ITF News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bV5ZAAAAYAAJ|year=1994|publisher=International Transport Workers' Federation}}</ref> Between 1994 and 1995, the six DC-10 aircraft in the fleet were finally retired. Their last revenue flight was in 1995.\n\nIn December 1994 (three weeks after Carlos Salinas de Gortari left the office), the first of several devaluations in the next 18 months started, giving way to an economic crisis in [[Mexico]]. As a consequence, Aerom\u00e9xico had to cut capacity and flights to Frankfurt and Rome were canceled, four McDonnell Douglas MD-80s and four [[Boeing 767]]s were returned to their lessors, early retirement for pilots and other staff was underway, and a new Boeing 767 due for delivery in April 1995 was instead transferred to another airline. Flights to Madrid and Paris were operated only by two Boeing 767-300ER jets.\n\nIn 1996 Cintra was created to prevent the two main carriers from going bankrupt. Some [[Boeing 757]]s of Aerom\u00e9xico's original renovation program were transferred to Mexicana and [[Aeroper\u00fa]]. The market and the airline recovered between 1996 and 1998; eight McDonnell Douglas MD80s were leased back along with two Boeing 767-200ERs.\n\nThe sale of Grupo Cintra was scheduled after several delays in September 1999, and with the looming presidential elections in 2000, everything was delayed once again. The ruling party lost the election after 70 years in office and all the policies changed. Due to the recession in 2000, the new government put everything on hold, waiting for better economic conditions to start the stock sell-off, and just when everything was about to start, the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] occurred and nothing materialized since the two main carriers, Mexicana and Aerom\u00e9xico, were losing large amounts of money.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:Aeromexico Boeing 737-700 Airwim-1.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-700]] in the airline's old livery.]]\nBetween 2000 and 2005, Aerom\u00e9xico had an average fleet of 60 aircraft in mainline operation, plus 20 in [[Aerolitoral]], as well as five CEOs during this time. On 22 June 2000, the airline, along with [[Air France]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], and [[Korean Air]], founded the [[SkyTeam]] global airline alliance. After 9/11 and the Iraq War, it pursued a fleet renovation program. In 2003, the airline acquired its first [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-700]] instead of the [[Boeing 717]] as a replacement for its aging DC-9 aircraft. On 29 March 2006 Aerom\u00e9xico CEO, Andr\u00e9s Conesa announced the inauguration of direct flights between Japan and Mexico City via [[Tijuana]]. This was after the purchase of two [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ERs]], making Aerom\u00e9xico the third airline in [[Latin America]] to fly regularly to Asia, after [[Varig]] and the now-defunct [[VASP]]. Since Varig's demise, Aerom\u00e9xico is currently the only airline with this service. Aerom\u00e9xico resumed its Mexico City-Tijuana-Shanghai route twice a week as of 30 March 2010.

On 17 October 2007, Banamex offered the highest bid and purchased the airline for US$249.1 million.

The character first appeared in 1930. The books are [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by a number of authors and published under the collective [[pseudonym]] [[Carolyn Keene]].<ref>Peters (2007), 542.</ref> <!-- These two sentences did not relate to each other enough to be connected with a semi-colon, so I split them into two separate sentences.

Launched in 2004, the ''[[Girl Detective]]'' series features Nancy driving a [[hybrid electric vehicle]] and using a cell phone.<!-- I reworded this sentence to make the dates more clearly correspond to the events that took place. I also split the sentence into two sentences to eliminate the need for excessive commas. --> In 2012, the ''Girl Detective'' series ended, and a new series, ''Nancy Drew Diaries'', was launched in 2013. Illustrations of the character evolved over time to reflect contemporary styles.<ref name=\"Stowe\">Stowe (1999).</ref> The character proves continuously popular worldwide: at least 80&nbsp;million copies of the books have been sold,<ref>Inness (1997), 79.</ref> and the books have been translated into over 45 languages. Nancy Drew is featured in five films, three television shows, and a number of popular computer games; she also appears in a variety of merchandise sold around the world.\n\nA cultural [[icon]], Nancy Drew is cited as a formative influence by a number of women, from [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Justices]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]<ref>McFeatters (2005), 36.</ref> and [[Sonia Sotomayor]] to former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]]<ref name=\"Burrell\">Burrell (2007).</ref> and former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]].<ref>Argetsinger and Roberts (2007), C03.</ref> [[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist literary critics]] have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic [[hero]], an expression of wish fulfillment,<ref>Sherrie A. Inness writes that in \"many respects, Nancy Drew exists as a wish fulfillment.\" See Inness (1997), 175.</ref> or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about [[femininity]].<ref>Chamberlain (1994).</ref>\n\n== The Nancy Drew character ==\nNancy Drew is a fictional amateur sleuth. In the original versions of the series, she is a 16-year-old high school graduate, and in later versions, is rewritten and aged to be an 18-year-old high school graduate and detective. In the series, she lives in the fictional town of River Heights<ref>Fisher (2004), 71.</ref> with her father, attorney [[Carson Drew]], and their housekeeper, Hannah Gruen.<ref>Macleod (1995), 31.</ref> As a child (age ten in the original versions and age three in the later version), she loses her mother. Her loss is reflected in her early independence\u2014running a household since the age of ten with a clear-cut servant in early series and deferring to the servant as a surrogate parent in later ones. <!-- These two sentences were reworded and separated by a period instead of a semi-colon for the sake of clarity. --> As a teenager, she spends her time solving mysteries, some of which she stumbles upon and some of which begin as cases of her father's. Nancy is often<!-- often or always? --> assisted in solving mysteries by her two closest friends: cousins Bess Marvin and [[George Fayne]]. Bess is delicate and feminine, while George is a tomboy. Nancy is also occasionally joined by her boyfriend [[Ned Nickerson]], a student at Emerson College. <!-- This sentence has too many relative clauses beginning with \u201cwho.\u201d I reworded the sentences to eliminate this problem. -->\n\nNancy is often described as a super girl. In the words of [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], she is \"as immaculate and self-possessed as a [[Miss America]] on tour. She is as cool as [[Mata Hari]] and as sweet as [[Betty Crocker]].\"<ref name=\"mason-50\">Mason (1995), 50.</ref> Nancy is well-off, attractive, and amazingly talented:\n\n{{quote|At sixteen she 'had studied psychology in school, and was familiar with the power of suggestion and association.' Nancy was a fine painter, spoke French, and had frequently run motor boats. She was a skilled driver who at sixteen 'flashed into the garage with a skill born of long practice.' The prodigy was a sure shot, an excellent swimmer, skillful oarsman, expert seamstress, gourmet cook, and a fine bridge player. Nancy brilliantly played tennis and golf, and rode like a cowboy. Nancy danced like [[Ginger Rogers]] and could administer first aid like the [[Mayo clinic|Mayo]] brothers.<ref>Jones (1973), 708.</ref>}}\n\nNancy never lacks money, and in later volumes of the series often travels to faraway locations, such as [[France]] in ''[[The Mystery of the 99 Steps]]'' (1966), [[Nairobi]] in ''[[The Spider Sapphire Mystery]]'' (1968), [[Austria]] in ''[[Captive Witness]]'' (1981), [[Japan]] in ''[[The Runaway Bride (Nancy Drew)|The Runaway Bride]]'' (1994), Costa Rica in ''Scarlet Macaw Scandal'' (2004), and [[Alaska]] in ''Curse of The Arctic Star'' (2013). Nancy is also able to travel freely about the United States, thanks in part to her car, which is a blue [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] in the original series and a blue [[Convertible (car)|convertible]] in the later books.<ref>Inness (1997), 91.</ref> Despite the trouble and presumed expense to which she goes to solve mysteries, Nancy never accepts monetary compensation; however, by implication, her expenses are often paid by a client of her father's, as part of the costs of solving one of his cases.<ref>Keene (1961), 198.</ref>\n\n=== Creation of character ===\n[[File:Stratemeyerposing.jpg|thumb|Edward Stratemeyer conceived the character and wrote plot outlines but hired [[Mildred Benson|Mildred Wirt Benson]] to [[ghostwrite]] the first volumes in the series under the pseudonym [[Carolyn Keene]].]]\nThe character was conceived by [[Edward Stratemeyer]], founder of the [[Stratemeyer Syndicate]]. In 1926 Stratemeyer created the [[The Hardy Boys|Hardy Boys]] series (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which was such a success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine. While Stratemeyer believed that a woman's place was in the home,<ref>Johnson (1982), xxvi.</ref> he was aware that the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.<ref>Johnson (1993), 12.</ref>\n\nStratemeyer initially pitched the new series to Hardy Boys publishers [[Grosset & Dunlap]] as the \"Stella Strong Stories\", adding that \"they might also be called 'Diana Drew Stories', 'Diana Dare Stories', 'Nan Nelson Stories', 'Nan Drew Stories', or 'Helen Hale Stories'.\"<ref>Rehak (2006), 113\u2013114.</ref> Editors at Grosset & Dunlap preferred \"Nan Drew\" of these options, but decided to lengthen \"Nan\" to \"Nancy\".<ref>Rehak (2006), 113.</ref> Stratemeyer accordingly began writing plot outlines and hired [[Mildred Benson|Mildred Wirt]], later Mildred Wirt Benson, to [[ghostwrite]] the first volumes in the series under the [[pseudonym]] [[Carolyn Keene]].<ref>Carpan (2008), 50.</ref> Subsequent titles have been written by a number of different ghostwriters, all under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene.\n\nThe first four titles were published in 1930 and were an immediate success. Exact sales figures are not available for the years prior to 1979, but an indication of the books' popularity can be seen in a letter that Laura Harris, a Grosset and Dunlap editor, wrote to the Syndicate in 1931: \"Can you let us have the manuscript as soon as possible, and no later than July 10? There will only be three or four titles brought out then and the Nancy Drew is one of the most important.\"<ref>Quoted in Rehak (2006), 121.</ref> The 6,000 copies that [[Macy's]] ordered for the 1933 Christmas season sold out within days.<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 27.</ref> In 1934 [[Fortune magazine|''Fortune'' magazine]] featured the Syndicate in a cover story and singled Nancy Drew out for particular attention: \"Nancy is the greatest phenomenon among all the fifty-centers. She is a best seller. How she crashed a Valhalla that had been rigidly restricted to the male of her species is a mystery even to her publishers.\"<ref>Quoted in Plunkett-Powell (1993), 18.</ref>\n\n=== Evolution of character ===\n{{see also|Category:Nancy Drew characters}}\n\nThe character of Nancy Drew has gone through many permutations over the years. The Nancy Drew Mystery series was revised beginning in 1959;<ref>Dyer and Romalov (1995), 194.</ref> with commentators agreeing that Nancy's character changed significantly from the original Nancy of the books written in the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>See, for example, Betsy Caprio, Geoffrey Lapin, Karen Plunkett-Powell, and Melanie Rehak.</ref> Observers also often see a difference between the Nancy Drew of the original series, the Nancy of ''The Nancy Drew Files'', and the Nancy of ''[[Girl Detective]]'' series.<ref>See, for example, [[Maureen Corrigan]], Catherine Foster.</ref> Nevertheless, some find no significant difference among the permutations of Nancy Drew, finding Nancy to be simply a good role model for girls.<ref>See, for example, Gerstel (2007), Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), and Plunkett-Powell (1993).</ref> Despite revisions, \"What hasn't changed, however, are [Nancy's] basic values, her goals, her humility, and her magical gift for having at least nine lives. For more than six decades, her essence has remained intact.\"<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 55.</ref> Nancy is a \"teen detective queen\" who \"offers girl readers something more than action-packed adventure: she gives them something original. Convention has it that girls are passive, respectful, and emotional, but with the energy of a girl shot out of a cannon, Nancy bends conventions and acts out every girl's fantasies of power.\"<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 8.</ref>\n\nOther commentators see Nancy as \"a paradox\u2014which may be why feminists can laud her as a formative 'girl power' icon and conservatives can love her well-scrubbed middle-class values.\"<ref>O'Rourke (2004).</ref>\n\n==== 1930\u20131959: Early stories ====\nThe earliest Nancy Drew books were published as dark blue hardcovers with the titles stamped in orange lettering with dark blue outlines and no other images on the cover.  The covers went through several changes in early years: leaving the orange lettering with no outline and adding an orange silhouette of Nancy peering through a magnifying glass; then changing to a lighter blue board with dark blue lettering and silhouette; then changing the position of the title and silhouette on the front with black lettering and a more \"modern\" silhouette. Nancy Drew is depicted as an independent-minded 16-year-old who has already completed her high school education (16 was the minimum age for graduation at the time); the series also occurs over time, as she is 18 by the early 1940s. Apparently affluent (her father is a successful lawyer), she maintains an active social, volunteer, and sleuthing schedule, as well as participating in athletics and the arts, but is never shown as working for a living or acquiring job skills. Nancy is affected neither by the Great Depression\u2014although many of the characters in her early cases need assistance as they are poverty-stricken\u2014nor by World War II. Nancy lives with her lawyer father, Carson Drew, and their housekeeper, Mrs. Hannah Gruen. Some critics prefer the Nancy of these volumes, largely written by Mildred Benson. Benson is credited with \"[breathing]&nbsp;... a feisty spirit into Nancy's character.\"<ref name=\"Fisher\">Fisher, \"Nancy Drew, Sleuth.\"</ref> The original Nancy Drew is sometimes claimed \"to be a lot like [Benson] herself&nbsp;\u2013 confident, competent, and totally independent, quite unlike the cardboard character that [Edward] Stratemeyer had outlined.\"<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 24.</ref>\n\nThis original Nancy is frequently outspoken and authoritative, so much so that Edward Stratemeyer told Benson that the character was \"much too flip, and would never be well received.\"<ref>Quoted in Plunkett-Powell (1993), 33.</ref><ref>While Benson stated repeatedly in interviews that Stratemeyer used these words to her (Keeline 25), James Keeline states that there is no independent confirmation of this; Stratemeyer's written comments to Benson upon receipt of the manuscript for ''The Secret of the Old Clock'' contain no such criticism (Keeline 26).</ref> The editors at Grosset & Dunlap disagreed,<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 33.</ref> but Benson also faced criticism from her next Stratemeyer Syndicate editor, Harriet Adams, who felt that Benson should make Nancy's character more \"sympathetic, kind-hearted and lovable.\" Adams repeatedly asked Benson to, in Benson's words, \"make the sleuth less bold&nbsp;... 'Nancy said' became 'Nancy said sweetly,' 'she said kindly,' and the like, all designed to produce a less abrasive, more caring type of character.\"<ref>Quoted in Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 28.</ref> Many readers and commentators, however, admire Nancy's original outspoken character.<ref>See, for example, Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), Lapin (1986), and Fisher.</ref>\n\nA prominent critic of the Nancy Drew character, at least the Nancy of these early Nancy Drew stories,<ref>while Mason's book was originally published in 1975, after the Drew books began to be revised and re-written, Mason cites the unrevised volumes almost exclusively.</ref> is mystery writer [[Bobbie Ann Mason]]. Mason contends that Nancy owes her popularity largely to \"the appeal of her high-class advantages.\"<ref>Mason (1995), 49.</ref> Mason also criticizes the series for its [[racism]] and [[classism]],<ref>Mason (1995), 69\u201371.</ref> arguing that Nancy is the upper-class [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] defender of a \"fading aristocracy, threatened by the restless lower classes.\"<ref>Mason (1995), 73.</ref> Mason further contends that the \"most appealing elements of these daredevil girl sleuth adventure books are (secretly) of this kind: tea and fancy cakes, romantic settings, food eaten in quaint places (never a [[Howard Johnson's|Ho-Jo's]]), delicious pauses that refresh, old-fashioned picnics in the woods, precious jewels and heirlooms&nbsp;.... The word dainty is a subversive affirmation of a feminized universe.\"<ref name=\"mason-60\">Mason (1995), 60.</ref>\n\nAt bottom, says Mason, the character of Nancy Drew is that of a girl who is able to be \"perfect\" because she is \"free, white, and sixteen\"<ref name=\"mason-50\" /> and whose \"stories seem to satisfy two standards&nbsp;\u2013 adventure and domesticity. But adventure is the superstructure, domesticity the bedrock.\"<ref name=\"mason-60\" />\n\nOthers argue that \"Nancy, despite her traditionally feminine attributes, such as good looks, a variety of clothes for all social occasions, and an awareness of good housekeeping, is often praised for her seemingly masculine traits&nbsp;... she operates best independently, has the freedom and money to do as she pleases, and outside of a telephone call or two home, seems to live for solving mysteries rather than participating in family life.\"<ref>Parry (1997), 148.</ref>\n\n==== 1959\u20131979: Revisions at Grosset & Dunlap ====\nAt the insistence of publishers Grosset & Dunlap, the Nancy Drew books were revised beginning in 1959, both to make the books more modern and to eliminate racist stereotypes.<ref>Carpan (2008), 15.</ref> Although Harriet Adams felt that these changes were unnecessary, she oversaw a complete overhaul of the series, as well as writing new volumes in keeping with the new guidelines laid down by Grosset & Dunlap.<ref name=\"rehak-243\" /> The series did not so much eliminate racial stereotypes, however, as eliminate non-white characters altogether.<ref name=\"rehak-248\" /> For example, in the original version of ''[[The Hidden Window Mystery]]'' (1956), Nancy visits friends in the south whose [[African-American]] servant, \"lovable old Beulah&nbsp;... serves squabs, sweet potatoes, corn pudding, piping hot biscuits, and strawberry shortcake.\"<ref name=\"mason-70\">Mason (1995), 70.</ref> The mistress of the house waits until Beulah has left the room and then says to Nancy, \"I try to make things easier for Beulah but she insists on cooking and serving everything the old-fashioned way. I must confess, though, that I love it.\"<ref>Keene (1956), 64. Quoted in Mason (1995), 70.</ref> In the revised 1975 version, Beulah is changed to Anna, a \"plump, smiling housekeeper\".<ref>Keene (1975), 35.</ref>\n\nMany other changes were relatively minor. The new books were bound in yellow with color illustrations on the front covers.  Nancy's age was raised from 16 to 18, her mother was said to have died when Nancy was three, rather than ten, and other small changes were made.<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> Housekeeper Hannah Gruen, sent off to the kitchen in early stories, became less a servant and more a mother surrogate.<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 94.</ref>\n\nCritics saw this Nancy of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s as an improvement in some ways, a step back in others: \"In these new editions, an array of elements had been modified&nbsp;... and most of the more overt elements of racism had been excised. In an often overlooked alteration, however, the tomboyishness of the text's title character was also tamed.\"<ref>Abate (2008), 167.</ref>\n\nNancy becomes much more respectful of male authority figures in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, leading some to claim that the revised Nancy simply becomes too agreeable, and less distinctive, writing of her,  \"In the revised books, Nancy is relentlessly upbeat, puts up with her father's increasingly protective tendencies, and, when asked if she goes to church in the 1969 ''[[The Clue of the Tapping Heels]]'', replies, 'As often as I can'&nbsp;... Nancy learns to hold her tongue; she doesn't sass the dumb cops like she used to.\"<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\n==== 1980\u20132003: Continuing the original series ====\nHarriet Adams continued to oversee the series, after switching publishers to Simon & Schuster, until her death in 1982. After her death, Adams' prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Nancy Axelrad and Lilo Wuenn, and her three children, oversaw production of the Nancy Drew books and other Stratemeyer Syndicate series. In 1985, the five sold the Syndicate and all rights to Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster turned to book packager Mega-Books for new writers.<ref name=\"plunkett-29\" /> These books continued to have the characters solve mysteries in the present day, while still containing the same basic formula and style of the books during the Syndicate.\n\n==== 1986\u20131997: ''Files'', ''Super Mystery'', and ''On Campus'' ====\n{{main|The Nancy Drew Files|Super Mystery|Nancy Drew on Campus}}\n[[File:Ndharh.jpg|thumb|''The Nancy Drew Files'' showcased a more mature version of the character, as seen on the cover of ''Hit and Run Holiday'' (1986). Here, Nancy is in swimwear, in proximity to an attractive young man, rather than a clue.|upright]]\n\nIn 1985, as the sale of the Stratemeyer Syndicate to Simon & Schuster was being finalized, Simon & Schuster wanted to launch a spin-off series, that focused on more mature mysteries, and incorporated romance into the stories. To test whether this would work, the final two novels before the sale, ''The Bluebeard Room'' and ''The Phantom of Venice'', were used as backdoor pilots for the new series. The books read drastically different from the preceding novels of the past 55 years. For example, ''The Phantom of Venice'' (1985) opens with Nancy wondering in italics, \"''Am I or am I not in love with Ned Nickerson?''\"<ref>Keene (1985), 1.</ref> Nancy begins dating other young men and acknowledges sexual desires: \"'I saw [you kissing him]&nbsp;... You don't have to apologize to me if some guy turns you on.' 'Gianni ''doesn't'' turn me on!&nbsp;... Won't you please let me explain.'\"<ref>Keene (1985), 111\u2013112. Cited by Shangraw Fox.</ref> The next year, Simon & Schuster launched the first Nancy Drew spin-off, titled ''The Nancy Drew Files''.\n\nThe Nancy Drew character of the ''Files'' series has earned mixed reviews among fans. Some contend that Nancy's character becomes \"more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [version] since 1956.\"<ref>Caprio (1992), 27.</ref> Others criticize the series for its increasing incorporation of romance and \"[dilution] of pre-feminist [[wikt:moxie|moxie]].\"<ref>Torrance (2007), D01.</ref> One reviewer noticed \"Millie [Mildred Wirt Benson] purists tend to look askance upon the ''Files'' series, in which fleeting pecks bestowed on Nancy by her longtime steady, Ned Nickerson, give way to lingering embraces in a Jacuzzi.\"<ref name=\"leighbrown-1d\" /> Cover art for ''Files'' titles, such as ''Hit and Run Holiday'' (1986), reflects these changes; Nancy is often dressed provocatively, in short skirts, shirts that reveal her stomach or cleavage, or a bathing suit. She is often pictured with an attentive, handsome male in the background, and frequently appears aware of and interested in that male. Nancy also becomes more vulnerable, being often [[chloroform]]ed into unconsciousness, or defenseless against [[chokehold]]s.<ref>Foster (1986), 31.</ref> The books place more emphasis on violence and character relationships, with Nancy Drew and Ned Nickerson becoming a more on-off couple, and both having other love interests that can span multiple books.\n\nThe ''Files'' also launched its own spin off. A crossover spin-off series with ''The Hardy Boys'', titled the ''[[Super Mystery]]'' series, began in 1988. These books were in continuity with the similar ''Hardy Boys'' spin-off, ''[[List of Hardy Boys books#The Hardy Boys Casefiles (1987\u20131998)|The Hardy Boys Casefiles]]''.\n\nIn 1995, Nancy Drew finally goes to college in the ''[[Nancy Drew on Campus]]'' series. These books read more similar to soap opera books, such as the ''[[Sweet Valley High]]'' series. The ''On Campus'' books focus more on romance plots, and also centered around other characters; the mysteries were merely used as subplots.

The ''Files'' series ran until the end of 1997, while both the ''Super Mystery'' and ''on Campus'' series ran until the beginning of 1998.\n\n==== 2003\u20132012: ''Girl Detective'' and graphic novels ====\n{{see also|Girl Detective}}\nIn 2003, publishers Simon & Schuster ended the original Nancy Drew series and began featuring Nancy's character in a new mystery series, ''Girl Detective''. The Nancy Drew of the ''Girl Detective'' series drives a hybrid car, uses a mobile phone, and recounts her mysteries in the first person. Many applaud these changes, arguing that Nancy has not really changed at all other than learning to use a cell phone.<ref>Springen and Meadows(2005).</ref> Others praise the series as more realistic; Nancy, these commentators argue, is now a less-perfect and therefore more likable being, one whom girls can more easily relate to&nbsp;\u2013 a better role model than the old Nancy because she can actually be emulated, rather than a \"prissy automaton of perfection.\"<ref>Benfer (2004), A15.</ref>\n\nSome, mostly fans, vociferously lament the changes, seeing Nancy as a silly, air-headed girl whose trivial adventures (discovering who squished the zucchini in 2004's ''Without a Trace'') \"hold a shallow mirror to a pre-teen's world.\"<ref>Corrigan (2004).</ref> Leona Fisher argues that the new series portrays an increasingly white River Heights, partially because \"the clumsy first-person narrative voice makes it nearly impossible to interlace external authorial attitudes into the discourse\", while it continues and worsens \"the implicitly xenophobic cultural representations of racial, ethnic, and linguistic others\" by introducing gratuitous speculations on characters' national and ethnic origins.<ref>Fisher, Leona (2008), 73.</ref>\n\nThe character is also the heroine of a series of [[graphic novel]]s, begun in 2005 and produced by Papercutz. The graphic novels are written by [[Stefan Petrucha]] and illustrated in [[manga]]-style artwork by Sho Murase. The character's graphic novel incarnation has been described as \"a fun, sassy, modern-day teen who is still hot on the heels of criminals.\"<ref>\"Sleuths Go Graphic\" (2008).</ref>\n\nWhen the 2007 film was released, a non-canon novelization of the movie was written to look like the older books. A new book was written for each of the ''Girl Detective'' and ''Clue Crew'' series, both of which deal with a mystery on a movie set. In 2008, the ''Girl Detective'' series was re-branded into trilogies with a model on the cover. These mysteries became deeper, with the mystery often spread across three books, and multiple culprits. These trilogies also met with negative fan reception due to Nancy's constant mistakes, shortness of the books, and lack of action. With the new trilogy format, sales began slipping. In 2010, Simon & Schuster then cut back from six ''Nancy Drew'' books per year, to four books per year. In December 2011, they finally announced that the series was cancelled along with the Hardy Boys ''Undercover Brothers'' series.\n\n==== 2013\u2013present: ''Diaries'' ====\n{{Expand section|date=November 2017}}\n\nWith the sudden cancellation of the ''Girl Detective'' series, the ''Diaries'' series began in 2013. The series is similar to its predecessor, in that the books are narrated in first person, Nancy is still absent-minded and awkward, and references are made to pop culture and technology.\n\n== Ghostwriters ==\nConsistent with other Stratemeyer Syndicate properties, the Nancy Drew novels were written by various writers, all under the [[pen name]] Carolyn Keene.<ref name=\"SS1\">{{cite web| last=Andrews|first=Dale| title=The Hardy Boys Mystery | url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/08/the-hardy-boys-mystery_27.html |work=Children's books |publisher=SleuthSayers| location=Washington| date=2013-08-27}}</ref> In accordance with the customs of Stratemeyer Syndicate series production, ghostwriters for the Syndicate signed contracts that have sometimes been interpreted as requiring authors to sign away all rights to authorship or future royalties.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 24.</ref> Contracts stated that authors could not use their Stratemeyer Syndicate pseudonyms independently of the Syndicate.<ref>Keeline (2008), 21.</ref> In the early days of the Syndicate, ghostwriters were paid a fee of $125, \"roughly equivalent to two month's wages for a typical newspaper reporter, the primary day job of the syndicate ghosts.\"<ref>Keeline (2008), 22.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]] this fee was lowered to $100 and eventually $75.<ref>Rehak (2006), 149.</ref> All royalties went to the Syndicate, and all correspondence with the publisher was handled through a Syndicate office. The Syndicate was able to enlist the cooperation of libraries in hiding the ghostwriters' names; when [[Walter Karig]], who wrote volumes eight through ten of the original ''[[Nancy Drew Mystery Stories]]'', tried to claim rights with the [[Library of Congress]] in 1933, the Syndicate instructed the Library of Congress not to reveal the names of any Nancy Drew authors, a move with which the Library of Congress complied.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nThe Syndicate's process for creating the Nancy Drew books consisted of creating a detailed plot outline, drafting a manuscript, and editing the manuscript. Edward Stratemeyer and his daughters [[Harriet Adams]] and Edna Stratemeyer Squier wrote most of the outlines for the original Nancy Drew series until 1979. Volume 30, ''[[The Clue of the Velvet Mask]]'' (1953), was outlined by [[Andrew Svenson]]. Usually, other writers wrote the manuscripts. Most of the early volumes were written by [[Mildred Benson|Mildred Wirt Benson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mildred Augustine Wirt Benson Papers |url=http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/BensonMildred.htm |work=Iowa Women's Archives |publisher=University of Iowa Libraries |accessdate=27 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510065205/http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/BensonMildred.htm |archivedate=10 May 2013 }}</ref>  Other volumes were written by [[Walter Karig]], George Waller, Jr., Margaret Scherf, Wilhelmina Rankin, Alma Sasse, [[Charles S. Strong]], Iris Vinton,<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 39.</ref> and Patricia Doll. Edward Stratemeyer edited the first three volumes, and Harriet Adams edited most subsequent volumes until her death in 1982. In 1959, the earlier titles were revised, largely by Adams.<ref>Rehak (2006), 245.</ref> From the late 1950s until her death in 1982, Harriet Adams herself wrote the manuscripts for most of the books.<ref>Farah (2005), 431\u2013521; Rehak (2006), 249.</ref>\n\nAfter Adams' death, series production was overseen by Nancy Axelrad (who also wrote several volumes). The rights to the character were sold in 1984, along with the Stratemeyer Syndicate itself, to [[Simon & Schuster]]. [[Book packager]] Mega-Books subsequently hired authors to write the main Nancy Drew series and a new series, ''[[The Nancy Drew Files]]''.<ref name=\"plunkett-29\">Plunkett-Powell (1993), 29.</ref>\n\n=== Legal disputes ===\nIn 1980, Harriet Adams switched publishers to Simon & Schuster, dissatisfied with the lack of creative control at Grosset & Dunlap and the lack of publicity for the Hardy Boys' 50th anniversary in 1977. Grosset & Dunlap filed suit against the Syndicate and the new publishers, Simon & Schuster, citing \"breach of contract, copyright infringement, and unfair competition.\"<ref>Johnson (1993), 16.</ref>\n\nAdams filed a countersuit, claiming the case was in poor taste and frivolous, and that, as author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953, and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author. When Mildred Benson was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.<ref>Johnson (1993), 17.</ref>\n\n== Evolution of character's appearance ==\nNancy Drew has been illustrated by many artists over the years, and her look constantly updated. Both the Stratemeyer Syndicate and the books' publishers have exercised control over the way Nancy is depicted.<ref>Rehak (2006), 228.</ref>\n\nSome aspects of Nancy's portrayal have remained relatively constant through the decades. Arguably her most characteristic physical depiction is that she is shown holding a flashlight.<ref name=\"EW\">\"The Top 20 Heroes,\" ''Entertainment Weekly'' 1041 (April 3, 2009): 36.</ref>\n\n=== Russell H. Tandy ===\nCommercial artist [[Russell H. Tandy]] was the first artist to illustrate Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style is that of a flatfoot [[flapper]]: heeled [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]] accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and [[cloche hat]] on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags.<ref>Stowe (1999), 15.</ref> By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]].<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 44.</ref> In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.<ref name=\"Plunkett-Powell 1993, 43\u201344\">Plunkett-Powell (1993), 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nTandy drew the inside sketches for the first 26 volumes of the series as well as painting the covers of the first 26 volumes with the exception of volume 11&nbsp;\u2013 the cover artist for volume 11 is unknown. Tandy read each text before he began sketching, so his early covers were closely connected to specific scenes in the plots. He also hand-painted the cover lettering and designed the original Nancy Drew logo: a silhouette of Nancy bending slightly and looking at the ground through a [[quizzing glass]].<ref name=\"Plunkett-Powell 1993, 43\u201344\"/>\n\nTandy often portrays Nancy Drew with confident, assertive body language. She never appears \"shocked, trepidatious, or scared\".<ref>Stowe (1999), 26.</ref> Nancy is shown either boldly in the center of the action or actively, but secretively, investigating a clue.<ref>Stowe (1999), 28.</ref> She is often observed by a menacing figure and appears to be in imminent danger, but her confident expression suggests to viewers that she is in control of the situation.<ref name=\"stowe-32\">Stowe (1999), 32.</ref>\n\nTandy's home was struck by fire in 1962, and most of his original paintings and sketches were destroyed. As a result, the Tandy dust-jackets are considered very valuable by collectors.<ref name=\"plunkett-46\">Plunkett-Powell (1993), 46.</ref>\n\n=== Bill Gillies and others ===\nBeginning with Tandy in 1948 and continuing into the early 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the prevailing styles. In postwar opulence, a trend emerged for young adults to have their own casual style, instead of dressing in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy becomes less constrained. Sweater or blouse and skirt ensembles, as well as a [[pageboy]] hairstyle, were introduced in 1948, and continued with new artist Bill Gillies, who updated 10 covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952. Gillies used his wife for a model, and Nancy reflects the conservative 1950s, with immaculately waved hair and a limited wardrobe&nbsp;\u2013 she wears similar sweater, blouse, and skirt ensembles, in different combinations, on most of these covers. Gillies also designed the modern-era trademark as a spine symbol which was used for decades: Nancy's head in profile, looking through a quizzing glass.<ref name=\"plunkett-46\" />\n\nIn the later Tandy period (1946&nbsp;\u2013 1949) and continuing throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less frequently in the center of the action. ''The Ghost of Blackwood Hall'' shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up the front steps of the haunted house, and marks a transition to later illustrations. From 1949 forward, she is likely to be observing others, often hiding or concealing herself.<ref>Stowe (1999), 30.</ref> Her mouth is often open in surprise, and she hides her body from view.<ref>Stowe (1999), 30\u201331.</ref> However, although Nancy \"expresses surprise, she is not afraid. She appears to be a bit taken aback by what she sees, but she looks as if she is still in control of the situation.\"<ref name=\"stowe-32\" /> Many of these covers feature Nancy poised in the observation of a clue, spying on criminal activity, or displaying her discoveries to others involved in the mystery. Only occasionally is she shown in action, such as running from the scene of a fire, riding a horse, or actively sleuthing with a flashlight. At times she is only involved in action as her hiding place has been discovered by others. In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.<!-- try to find a source for this in history -->\n\n=== Rudy Nappi and others ===\nJoseph Rudolf \"Rudy\" Nappi, the artist from 1953 to 1979, illustrated a more average teenager. Nappi was asked by [[Grosset & Dunlap]]'s art director to update Nancy's appearance, especially her wardrobe. Nappi gave Nancy [[Peter Pan collar]]s, shirtwaist dresses, a pageboy (later a flip) haircut, and the occasional pair of jeans. Nancy's hair color was changed from blonde to strawberry-blonde, reddish-blonde, or [[red hair|titian]] by the end of the decade. The change was long rumored to have been the result of a printing ink error, but was considered so favorable that it was adopted in the text for books published after 1959, and by illustrator Polly Bolian for volumes she created for a special book club in 1959\u201360.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 48.</ref>\n\nIn 1962, all [[Grosset & Dunlap]] books become \"picture covers\", books with artwork and advertising printed directly on their covers, as opposed to books with a dust jacket over a tweed volume. The change was to reduce production costs. Several of the 1930s and 1940s cover illustrations were updated by Nappi for this change, depicting a Nancy of the Kennedy era, though the stories themselves were not updated. Internal illustrations, which were dropped in 1937, were returned to the books beginning in 1954, as pen and ink line drawings, mostly by uncredited artists, but usually corresponding with Nappi's style of drawing Nancy on the covers.<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> Nappi followed trends initiated by Gillies and often illustrated Nancy wearing the same clothing more than once, including a mustard shirtwaist dress.\n\nUnlike Tandy, Nappi did not read the books before illustrating them; instead, his wife read them and provided him with a brief plot summary before Nappi began painting.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 49.</ref> Nappi's first cover was for ''[[The Clue of the Velvet Mask]]'', where he began a trend of portraying Nancy as \"bobby-soxer&nbsp;... a contemporary sixteen-year-old. This Nancy was perky, clean-cut, and extremely animated. In the majority of his covers Nancy looks startled&nbsp;\u2013 which, no doubt, she was.\"<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 47.</ref> Nancy's style is considerably conservative, and remains so during the psychedelic period. Although she wears bold colors and prints, or the background colors are shades of electric yellow, shocking pink, turquoise, or apple green, her clothing is high-necked and with long hemlines. Earlier Nappi covers show Nancy in poses similar to those in the covers by Tandy and Gillies; for many updated covers he simply updated the color scheme, clothing style, and hairstyles of the characters but retains their original poses in similar settings. Later Nappi covers show only Nancy's head or part of her body, surrounded by spooky or startling elements or clues from the story. These Nappi covers would later be used for the opening credits of the television production, with photos of [[Pamela Sue Martin]] inserted on the book covers.\n\nOften, \"Nancy's face wears the blank expression of one lost in thought,\"<ref name=\"stowe-35\">Stowe (1999), 35.</ref> making her appear passive.<ref name=\"stowe-36\">Stowe (1999), 36.</ref> On the cover of ''[[The Strange Message in the Parchment]]'' (1977), for example, in contrast to earlier covers, Nancy \"is not shown in the midst of danger or even watching a mystery unfold from a distance. Instead, Nancy is shown thinking about the clues\";<ref>Stowe (1999), 33.</ref> in general, Nancy becomes less confident and more puzzled.<ref name=\"stowe-35\" />\n\n=== Nancy in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s ===\n[[File:Ndtcotvv.jpg|thumb|Nancy is shown in danger on the cover of ''The Case of the Vanishing Veil'' (1988) and other covers from the 1980s. Unlike in earlier covers from the series, she is not completely in control of the situation.|upright]]\n\n[[Ruth Sanderson]] and Paul Frame provided cover art and interior illustrations for the first Nancy Drew paperbacks, published under the Wanderer imprint. Other artists, including Aleta Jenks and others whose names are unknown,<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 52.</ref> provided cover art, but no interior illustrations, for later paperbacks. Nancy is portrayed as \"a wealthy, privileged sleuth who looks pretty and alert.... The colors, and Nancy's facial features, are often so vivid that some of the covers look more like glossy photographs than paintings.\"<ref name=\"plunkett-51\">Plunkett-Powell (1993), 51.</ref>\n\nNancy is frequently portrayed pursuing a suspect,<ref name=\"stowe-36\" /> examining a clue, or observing action. She is often also shown in peril:<ref>Stowe (1999), 38.</ref> being chased, falling off a boat, or hanging by a rope from rafters. These covers are \"characterized by frenetic energy on Nancy's part; whether she is falling, limbs flailing, an alarmed look on her face, or whether she is running, hair flying, body bent, face breathless. Nancy does not have any control over the events that are happening in these covers. She is shown to be a victim, being hunted and attacked by unseen foes.\"<ref>Stowe (1999), 40.</ref>\n\nNancy is also sometimes pursued by a visibly threatening foe, as on the cover of ''The Case of the Vanishing Veil'' (1988).\n\nThe covers of ''The Nancy Drew Files'' and ''[[Girl Detective]]'' series represent further departures from the bold, confident character portrayed by Tandy. The Nancy portrayed on the covers of ''The Nancy Drew Files'' is \"a markedly sexy Nancy, with a handsome young man always lurking in the background. Her clothes often reveal an ample bustline and her expression is mischievous.\"<ref name=\"plunkett-51\" /> In the ''Girl Detective'' series, Nancy's face is depicted on each cover in fragments. Her eyes, for example, are confined to a strip across the top of the cover while her mouth is located near the spine in a box independent of her eyes. The artwork for Nancy's eyes and mouth is taken from Rudy Nappi's cover art for the revised version of ''[[The Secret of the Old Clock]]''.<ref name=\"Fisher\" />\n\n== Books ==\n{{main|List of Nancy Drew books}}\n\nThe longest-running series of books to feature Nancy Drew is the original Nancy Drew series, whose 175 volumes were published from 1930 to 2003. Nancy also appeared in 124 titles in ''The Nancy Drew Files'' and then became the heroine of the ''Diaries'' series. Various other series feature the character, such as the ''[[Nancy Drew Notebooks]]'' and ''[[Nancy Drew on Campus]]''. While Nancy Drew is the central character in each series, continuity is preserved only within one series, not between them all; for example, in concurrently published titles in the Nancy Drew series and the ''Nancy Drew on Campus'' series, Nancy is respectively dating her boyfriend Ned Nickerson or broken up with Ned Nickerson.  The two exceptions are the series ''Super Mystery'' (also called ''A Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys Super Mystery'') that ran concurrently with the ''Files'', and shares continuity with those stories and the then-running  ''Hardy Boys Casefiles'', and in 2007 a new ''A Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys Super Mystery'' series shared continuity with the ''Girl Detective'' series.\n\n''Nancy Drew Diaries'' started in 2013. This is a reboot of the ''Nancy Drew: Girl Detective'' series.  The series is described as \"A classic Nancy Drew with her modern twist\". While similar to the ''Nancy Drew, Girl Detective'' series, this series includes situations and problems typical in young adult \"tween\" books. The mystery element is not always the main focus of the characters, and often Nancy states she is avoiding mysteries or \"on a break\" from sleuthing. Nancy often acts timid and scared, in book #16 ''The Haunting on Heliotrope Lane'' she says she is glad she \"hasn't peed herself from being scared\". This Nancy does not navigate in the world of adults as previous versions of the character. The first person narration reveals a juvenile voice with a passive role in the action and a lack of motivation in solving mysteries. In book #12 ''The Sign in the Smoke'' Nancy does not solve the mystery, a secondary character comes up with the solution. In several books Nancy stumbles upon the solution to the \"mystery\" and acts amazed at the reveal. This is in contrast to the set-up of previous Nancy Drew series. Attempts to make Nancy's character more modern and less perfect have resulted in a confusing and often conflicting representation of the iconic Nancy Drew character.\n\n=== International publications ===\nThe main Nancy Drew series, ''The Nancy Drew Files'', and ''Girl Detective'' books have been translated into a number of languages besides English. Estimates vary from between 14 and 25&nbsp;languages,<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 160.</ref> but 25 seems the most accurate number.<ref name=\"Fox\">Shangraw Fox.</ref> Nancy Drew books have been published in many European countries (especially in [[Nordic countries]] and France) as well as in Latin America and Asia. The character of Nancy Drew seems to be more popular in some countries than others. Nancy Drew books have been in print in Norway since 1941 (the first country outside USA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nancydrewworld.com/norwegian.html | title = Around the World with Nancy Drew&nbsp;\u2013 Norway | publisher = Nancydrewworld.com |date=December 21, 2001 |accessdate=September 23, 2012}}</ref>), in Denmark since 1958, in France since 1955<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.carolinequine.com/pages/Presentation_de_la_serie_Alice-504890.html  Nancy Drew in France]</ref> and in Italy since 1970 by [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore]]. Other countries, such as [[Estonia]], have only recently begun printing Nancy Drew books.<ref name=\"Fox\" />\n\nNancy's name is often changed in translated editions: in France, she is known as Alice Roy; in Sweden, as Kitty Drew; in Finland, as Paula Drew;<ref name=\"Fox\" /> and in Norway the book series has the name of ''Fr\u00f8ken Detektiv'' (''Miss Detective''), though the heroine's name is still Nancy Drew inside the books.<ref>Skj\u00f8nsberg (1994), 72.</ref> In Germany, Nancy is a German law student named Susanne Langen. [[George Fayne]]'s name is even more frequently changed, to Georgia, Joyce, Kitty, or Marion. Cover art and series order is often changed as well, and in many countries only a limited number of Drew books are available in translation.\n\n== In other media ==\nSix feature films, three television shows, and four television pilots featuring Nancy Drew have been produced to date. No television show featuring Nancy Drew has lasted longer than two years, and film portrayals of the character have met with mixed reviews.\n\n=== Films ===\n\n==== Bonita Granville ====\nIn 1937, Warner Bros. bought the rights to the ''Nancy Drew'' book series from the Stratemeyer Syndicate, for a reported $6,000. Warner Bros. wanted to make a series of B-films based on the character, to serve as a companion to their popular ''[[Torchy Blane]]'' B-film series, which starred [[Glenda Farrell]], [[Barton MacLane]], and [[Tom Kennedy (actor)|Tom Kennedy]]. Adams sold the rights to [[Jack L. Warner]] without an agent or any consultation; thus, she sold all and any film rights to Warner Bros., a move she would later regret, and would later come into question by her publishers.\n\nFrom 1938 to 1939, four films in the series were released. All of them were directed by [[William Clemens (film director)|William Clemens]], written by ''Torchy Blane'' writer Kenneth Gamet, and had the same primary cast:\n*[[Bonita Granville]] as Nancy Drew\n*[[John Litel]] as Carson Drew\n*[[Frankie Thomas]] as Ted Nickerson (changed from Ned Nickerson)\n*[[Renie Riano]] as Effie Schneider\n*[[Frank Orth]] as Captain Tweedy (Orth appeared in only the first and last film, while being mentioned in the second)\n\nThe four films were released as B-films (a shorter film shows before the main picture, which usually lasted around 60 minutes):\n*''[[Nancy Drew... Detective]]'' (November 1938; loosely based on ''[[The Password to Larkspur Lane]]'')\n*''[[Nancy Drew... Reporter]]'' (February 1939)\n*''[[Nancy Drew\u2026 Trouble Shooter]]'' (June 1939)\n*''[[Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase (1939 film)|Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase]]'' (September 1939; loosely based on ''[[The Hidden Staircase]]'')\n\nThe series was announced by Warner Bros. in April 1938; production of the first film, ''Nancy Drew Gets the Passport'', was set to begin production in June, directed by [[John Farrow]] with a screenplay from Robertson White. However, for unclear reasons, Farrow and White were replaced by Clemens and Gamet, and production was delayed to August. The first two films did well enough to allow Warner Bros. to expand the budgets for the third and fourth films; in early 1939, they also announced the green-lighting of an additional four films, bringing the total up to eight.<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMovie\">{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/phixwithwings/80-years-ago-nancy-drew-made-her-big-screen-debut-3ofba|title=80 Years Ago Nancy Drew Made Her Big Screen Debut|last=phixwithwings|date=November 15, 2018|website=[[BuzzFeed]]|access-date=December 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DetectiveAFI\">{{cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/6253?sid=3331456f-45e2-4be6-b6b0-506496746486&sr=5.6730986&cp=1&pos=3|title=Nancy Drew, Detective|website=AFI|access-date=December 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the second film, Warner Bros. assigned the third film, originally titled ''Nancy Drew Steps Out'', to Eddie Anderson and Charles Perry; like White, they were replaced under unclear circumstances. Gamet was once again re-hired to write for the series, and completed writing the eight films. Shortly after production of the fourth film wrapped in May, Warner Bros. decided to eliminate their [[double feature]] setup, thus cancelling the ''Nancy Drew'' film series. Although they initially announced the ''Nancy Drew'' series would be converted into [[two-reeler]]s, they cancelled those plans days later.<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMovie\"/>\n\nThe fifth film was written, and may have been produced. [[Frankie Thomas]] believes that he and Granville made five films, not four.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 117.</ref> In addition, Harriet Adams wrote to [[Mildred Benson|Mildred Wirt]], the ghostwriter of the books at the time, in August 1939 that \"three have been shown in this area, and I have just heard that a fifth is in production.\"<ref name=\"kismaric-103\">Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 103.</ref>\n\nThe films took many liberties from its source material. Granville's portrayal of Nancy showed her as a ditsy and absent-minded schemer, in contrast to the books of that time, where Nancy was intelligent, sharp-tongued, and quite ahead of her time. Carson Drew of the books was portrayed as an older, feeble, hands-off parent, while John Litel's Carson was young, handsome, much more athletically fit, and tried his best to restrain Nancy from getting into danger. Ned/Ted was even more drastically altered: instead of being Nancy's boyfriend in college who lives in a different town, he was now her clumsy next-door neighbor, who was often in the center of Nancy's scheming unwittingly or under protest. The recurring character of the older Hannah Gruen was replaced with Effie Schneider, Hannah's teenage niece who had appeared in the book the first film was based on. Effie and Hannah's characteristics were merged, although Effie's fidgety, frightful nature retained prominence for comedic effect. In addition to these four, the new character Captain Tweedy was added, to portray the stereotypical bumbling, clueless cop that mirrored Steve McBride in the ''Torchy Blane'' series. The characters of Bess Marvin, George Fayne, and Helen Corning did not appear in the film series, and were never mentioned or referred to.\n\nIn addition to the character changes, the tone and pacing of the films were also matured and altered for comic effect and to accommodate a wider audience. The films changed the less-severe crimes and adventures of the books into gruesome murders, often spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At the time of the films, Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance in the books was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend, usually used by Nancy to his misery. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults while solving the mystery professionally, the films portrayed Nancy as a meddling school girl who chased adventures, much to the misery of the adults and peers around her.\n\nCritical reaction to these films is mixed. Some find that the movies did not \"depict the true Nancy Drew\",<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 114.</ref> in part because Granville's Nancy \"blatantly used her feminine wiles (and enticing bribes)\" to accomplish her goals.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 115.</ref> The films also portray Nancy as childish and easily flustered, a significant change from her portrayal in the books.<ref>Nash (2006), 71\u2013116.</ref> Just as with the critics, both ghostwriter Mildred Wirt and editor Harriet Adams were also divided on the film's reception. Adams did not like the films, and resented the studio for its treatment of the character; she did, however, keep a personal autographed photo from Granville on her office desk for many years according to her employees, and may have used John Litel's portrayal of Carson Drew to revamp the character when she revised the books in the 1960s and 1970s. Contrary to Adams, Benson was said to have liked the films of the time, despite them being different from the character she wrote.<ref name=\"kismaric-103\" />\n\nTo promote the film, [[Warner Bros.]] created a Nancy Drew fan club that included a set of rules, such as: \"Must have steady boy friend, in the sense of a 'pal'\" and must \"Take part in choosing own clothes.\"<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 116.</ref> These rules were based on some research Warner Bros. had done on the habits and attitudes of \"typical\" teenage girls.<ref>Nash (2006), 87\u201390.</ref> Granville was the \"honorary president\" of the fan club, and a kit for the club came with autographed pictures of her.\n\nThe series become somewhat of a cult success after the films started appearing on cable channels such as [[Turner Classic Movies]]. The films were arguably ones in which all five cast members were notable for in their careers. Granville recalled making the films fondly, and stated her favorite film of the series was ''Nancy Drew\u2026 Trouble Shooter''. Twenty years after the films, Thomas would later go on to portray Carson Drew in a failed pilot for CBS. Litel and Granville would later reunite for the 1947 film ''[[The Guilty (1947 film)|The Guilty]]'', produced by Granville's husband [[Jack Wrather]].\n\n====Emma Roberts====\n{{main|Nancy Drew (2007 film)}}\nA new film version for ''Nancy Drew'' had been in the works at Warner Bros. since the mid 1990s. However, nothing came into fruition until the mid 2000s.\n\nOn June 15, 2007, [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] released a new film titled ''[[Nancy Drew (2007 film)|Nancy Drew]]'', with [[Emma Roberts]] starring as Nancy, [[Max Thieriot]] as Ned Nickerson, and [[Tate Donovan]] as Carson Drew; [[Andrew Fleming]] directed and co-wrote the film with Tiffany Paulsen, while [[Jerry Weintraub]] produced. This film saw Nancy move to Los Angeles with her father on an extended business trip, and picking the house of a murdered movie star as their house to solve the cold case.\n\nBefore the release of the 2007 film, Roberts, Fleming, and Weintraub had signed on for two ''Nancy Drew'' sequels. But with the mixed success of the first film, and Roberts' decision to move onto other projects, these films were never made.\n\nAs with the earlier Drew films, reactions were mixed. Some see the film as updated version of the basic character: \"although it has been glammed up for the lucrative tween demographic, the movie retains the best parts of the books, including, of course, their intelligent main character.\"<ref>Cheong (2007).</ref> Others find the movie \"jolting\" because Nancy's \"new classmates prefer shopping to sleuthing, and Nancy's plaid skirt, penny loafers, and magnifying glass make her something of a dork, not the town hero she was in the Midwest.\"<ref>Brown (2007), D1.</ref>\n\n====Sophia Lillis====\n{{main|Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase (2019 film)}}\n\nOn April 20, 2018, Warner Bros. announced they were making a new ''Nancy Drew'' film series, starring [[Sophia Lillis]] as Nancy. The first film will be adapted from ''[[The Hidden Staircase]]'', with [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and Wendy Williams among the producers. The film is not related to the previous film starring Bonita Granville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/939705-sophia-lillis-star-nancy-drew-hidden-staircase|last=N'Duka|first=Amanda|title=\u2018It\u2019 Star Sophia Lillis To Topline Warner Bros\u2019 \u2018Nancy Drew And The Hidden Staircase\u2019|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=April 20, 2018|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/it-sophia-lillis-warner-bros-nancy-drew-and-the-hidden-staircase-1202372950/|last=Evry|first=Max|title=IT\u2019s Sophia Lillis to Star in Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase|work=Comingsoon.net|date=April 20, 2018|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\n==== ''The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries'' ====\n{{main|The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries}}\n\nThe most successful attempt at bringing Nancy Drew to life on television was ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', which ran from 1977 to 1979 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref>Carpan (2008), 110.</ref> Future ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' star [[Pamela Sue Martin]] starred as Nancy, with [[Jean Rasey]] and George O'Hanlon, Jr. as friends George and Ned, and [[William Schallert]] as Carson Drew.\n\nThis series is regarded as the most faithful series to the books; Martin is often regarded by many Nancy Drew fans as the best actress to portray her. The series was also faithful in its tone of smaller mysteries, such as haunted houses or theft.\n\nThe first season originally alternated with the Hardy Boys; the Hardy Boys was met with success, but the Drew episodes were met with mixed results. In the second season, the format shifted to present the Hardy Boys as the more prominent characters, with Nancy Drew mostly a character in crossover episodes (although the character did have some solo episodes). Martin, who was 24 years old at the start of the series, left midway through the season, and was replaced by 19-year-old [[Janet Julian|Janet Louise Johnson]] for the final few episodes.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 121.</ref>\n\nWhen the series came back for a third season, Nancy Drew was dropped from the series, with it now focusing completely on the Hardy Boys. But soon after the change, ABC cancelled the series.\n\n==== ''Nancy Drew'' (1995 TV series) ====\n{{anchor|1995 TV series}}\n\nNelvana began production of another Nancy Drew television show in 1995. [[Tracy Ryan (actress)|Tracy Ryan]] starred as Nancy Drew, with Jhene Erwin as Bess Marvin, [[Joy Tanner]] as George Fayne, and, in a recurring role, [[Scott Speedman]] as Ned Nickerson. Nancy is now a 21-year-old criminology student, moving to New York City and living in an upscale apartment complex called the \"Callisto\". Nancy solved various mysteries with Bess, a gossip columnist at ''The Rag'', and George, a mail carrier and amateur filmmaker. Ned worked on charity missions in Africa, but did make a few appearances. This ''Nancy Drew'' series was again partnered with [[The Hardy Boys (1995 TV series)|a series based on ''The Hardy Boys'']], with Ryan appearing in two episodes of the latter series as Nancy. Both shows were cancelled midway through their first seasons due to low ratings; the poorly syndicated half-hour shows aired in a slot outside of prime time on the newly launched [[The WB]] and [[UPN]] networks.<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 122.</ref> The entire series has since been released on DVD, and has appeared on several online streaming sites, including the Retro Rerun YouTube channel.\n\n===== List of episodes =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Titles and publication dates\n|-\n! #\n!

The movie was intended to be a pilot for a possible weekly series, which saw Nancy and her friends going off to college in a modern setting, and Nancy pursuing a journalism degree. Like the 1930s films, this pilot also took a more mature turn, with the mystery being a drug bust, and Nancy having a falling out with her father. The pilot aired as part of ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' series, with additional scripts being ordered and production contingent on the movie's ratings and reception. The series was passed at ABC, and [[UPN]] also passed following Lawson being cast on another ABC series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/12/13/tem_1213robbie.html|author=Harris, Beth|title=No mystery: Actress detects similarity with Nancy Drew|date=December 13, 2002|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\n====''Nancy Drew'' (2019 TV series)====\n{{main|Nancy Drew (2019 TV series)}}\n\nIn October 2018, [[The CW]] announced that [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Stephanie Savage]] were developing a new ''Nancy Drew'' series.

Thomas had previously starred in the film series in Considine's role. Although a pilot was produced in April 1957, the series could not find a sponsor.

The games are targeted for a younger audience with the rating of \"ages 10 and up\" and are rated \"E\" (\"Everyone\") by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]].  They follow the popular [[adventure game]] style of play.

[[Parker Brothers]] produced a \"Nancy Drew Mystery Game\" in 1957 with the approval of the [[Stratemeyer Syndicate]]. In 1967 [[Alexander Doll Company|Madame Alexander]] produced a Nancy Drew doll. The doll carried binoculars and camera and was available in two outfits: with a plaid coat or a dress and short jacket. [[Harriet Adams]] disapproved of the doll's design, believing Nancy's face to be too childish, but the doll was marketed nonetheless. Various Nancy Drew coloring, activity, and puzzle books have also been published, as has a Nancy Drew puzzle. A Nancy Drew Halloween costume and a Nancy Drew lunchbox were produced in the 1970s as television show tie-ins.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 158\u2013167.</ref>\n\n== Cultural impact ==\nAccording to commentators, the cultural impact of Nancy Drew has been enormous.<ref>Among critics making this claim are Billman, Caprio, Dyer and Romalov, Inness, Kismaric and Heiferman, Macleod, Mason, Nash, Plunkett-Powell, and Rehak.</ref> The immediate success of the series led directly to the creation of numerous other girls' mysteries series, such as [[The Dana Girls]] mystery stories and the [[Kay Tracey]] mystery stories,<ref>Rehak (2006), 162.</ref> and the phenomenal sales of the character Edward Stratemeyer feared was \"too flip\" encouraged publishers to market many other girls' mystery series, such as the [[Judy Bolton Series]], and to request authors of series such as the [[Cherry Ames]] Nurse Stories to incorporate mystery elements into their works.<ref>Billman (1986), 8.</ref>\n\nMany prominent and successful women cite Nancy Drew as an early formative influence whose character encouraged them to take on unconventional roles, including [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justices [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Sonia Sotomayor]];<ref>Weiss (2009).</ref> TV personalities [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Barbara Walters]]; singers [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Beverly Sills]];<ref name=\"Shulman\">Shulman (2007).</ref> mystery authors [[Sara Paretsky]] and [[Nancy Pickard]]; scholar [[Carolyn Heilbrun]]; actresses [[Ellen Barkin]] and [[Emma Roberts]];<ref>http://www.nancydrewsleuth.com/PRESSKIT-Factoids2.pdf</ref> former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]]; former [[First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]];<ref name=\"Burrell\" /> and former president of the [[National Organization for Women]] [[Karen DeCrow]].<ref>Rehak (2006), xii.</ref> Less prominent women also credit the character of Nancy Drew with helping them to become stronger women; when the first Nancy Drew conference was held, at the [[University of Iowa]], in 1993, conference organizers received a flood of calls from women who \"all had stories to tell about how instrumental Nancy had been in their lives, and about how she had inspired, comforted, entertained them through their childhoods, and, for a surprising number of women, well into adulthood.\"<ref>Nancy Tillman Romalov, quoted in Knowlton (1995), 21.</ref>\n\nNancy Drew's popularity continues unabated: in 2002, the first Nancy Drew book published, ''[[The Secret of the Old Clock]]'', alone sold 150,000 copies,<ref name=\"Eveld\">Eveld (2004).</ref> good enough for top-50 ranking in children's books,<ref>Strauss (2004).</ref> and other books in the series sold over 100,000 copies each.<ref>Leibrock (2004).</ref> Sales of the hardcover volumes of the original Nancy Drew series alone has surpassed sales of [[Agatha Christie]] titles,<ref>Paretsky (1991), i.</ref> and newer titles in the [[Girl Detective]] series have reached ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller lists.<ref name=\"Eveld\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked her seventeenth on its list of \"The Top 20 Heroes\" ahead of [[Batman]], explaining that Drew is the \"first female hero embraced by most little girls ... [Nancy lives] in an endless summer of never-ending adventures and unlimited potential.\" The magazine goes on to cite ''[[Scooby-Doo]]''{{'}}s [[Velma Dinkley]] as well as [[Veronica Mars (character)|Veronica Mars]] as Nancy Drew's \"copycat descendants\".<ref name=\"EW\" />\n\nMany [[feminist]] critics have pondered the reason for the character's iconic status. Nancy's car, and her skill in driving and repairing it, are often cited. Melanie Rehak points to Nancy's famous blue roadster (now a blue [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]]) as a symbol of \"ultimate freedom and independence\".<ref name=\"Shulman\" /> Not only does Nancy have the freedom to go where she pleases (a freedom other, similar characters such as [[The Dana Girls]] do not have), but she is also able to change a tire and fix a flawed distributor, prompting Paretsky to argue that in \"a nation where car mechanics still mock or brush off complaints by women Nancy remains a significant role model.\"<ref>Paretsky (1991), ii.</ref>\n\nNancy is also treated with respect: her decisions are rarely questioned and she is trusted by those around her. Male authority figures believe her statements, and neither her father nor Hannah Gruen, the motherly housekeeper, \"place ... restrictions on her comings and goings.\"<ref>Paretsky (1991), iii.</ref> Nancy's father not only imposes no restrictions on his daughter, but trusts her both with her own car and his gun (in the original version of ''[[The Hidden Staircase]]'' [1930]), asks her advice on a frequent basis, and accedes to all her requests. Some critics, such as Betsy Caprio and Ilana Nash, argue that Nancy's relationship with her continually approving father is satisfying to girl readers because it allows them to vicariously experience a fulfilled [[Electra complex]].<ref>Caprio (1992); Nash (2006), passim.</ref>\n\nUnlike other girl detectives, Nancy does not go to school (for reasons that are never explained, but assuming because she has finished), and she thus has complete autonomy. Similar characters, such as [[Kay Tracey]], do go to school, and not only lose a degree of independence but also of authority. The fact of a character's being a school-girl reminds \"the reader, however fleetingly, of the prosaic realities of high-school existence, which rarely includes high adventures or an authoritative voice in the world of adults.\"<ref>Macleod (1995), 33.</ref>\n\nSome see in Nancy's adventures a mythic quality. Nancy often explores secret passages, prompting [[Nancy Pickard]] to argue that Nancy Drew is a figure equivalent to the ancient Sumerian deity [[Inanna]] and that Nancy's \"journeys into the 'underground{{'\"}} are, in psychological terms, explorations of the unconscious.<ref>Pickard (1991), iii.</ref> Nancy is a heroic figure, undertaking her adventures not for the sake of adventure alone, but in order to help others, particularly the disadvantaged. For this reason, Nancy Drew has been called the modern embodiment of the character of \"Good Deeds\" in [[Everyman]].<ref>Lundin (2003), 123.</ref>\n\nIn the end, many critics<ref>See also Mason (1995), 49; Nash (2006), 29\u201330; O'Rourke (2004).</ref> agree that at least part of Nancy Drew's popularity depends on the way in which the books and the character combine sometimes contradictory values, with Kathleen Chamberlain writing in ''The Secrets of Nancy Drew'': \"For over 60 years, the Nancy Drew series has told readers that they can have the benefits of both dependence and independence without the drawbacks, that they can help the disadvantaged and remain successful capitalists, that they can be both elitist and democratic, that they can be both child and adult, and that they can be both 'liberated' women and Daddy's little girls.\"<ref>Chamberlain (1994), 3.</ref> As another critic puts it, \"Nancy Drew 'solved' the contradiction of competing discourses about American womanhood by entertaining them all.\"<ref>Siegel (1997), 171.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Judy Bolton Series]]\n* [[Trixie Belden]]\n{{Portalbar|Children and Young Adult

[[Hardy Boys]] series. The character first appeared in 1930. The books are [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by a number of authors and published under the collective [[pseudonym]] [[Carolyn Keene]].<ref>Peters (2007), 542.</ref> <!-- These two sentences did not relate to each other enough to be connected with a semi-colon, so I split them into two separate sentences. They\u2019ve also been edited to remove redundancies and to maintain present tense when necessary. --> Over the decades, the character evolved in response to changes in US culture and tastes. The books were extensively revised and shortened, beginning in 1959, in part to lower printing costs<ref name=\"rehak-243\">Rehak (2006), 243.</ref> with arguable success.<ref>Nash (2006), 55.</ref><ref name=\"rehak-248\">Rehak (2006), 248.</ref> In the revision process, the heroine's original character was changed to be less unruly and violent.<ref name=\"Lapin\">Lapin (1989).</ref> In the 1980s, an older and more professional Nancy emerged in a new series, ''[[The Nancy Drew Files]]'', that included romantic subplots for the sleuth.<ref name=\"leighbrown-1d\">Leigh Brown (1993), 1D.</ref> The original ''[[Nancy Drew Mystery Stories]]'' series started in 1930 and ended in 2003. Launched in 2004, the ''[[Girl Detective]]'' series features Nancy driving a [[hybrid electric vehicle]] and using a cell phone.<!-- I reworded this sentence to make the dates more clearly correspond to the events that took place. I also split the sentence into two sentences to eliminate the need for excessive commas. --> In 2012, the ''Girl Detective'' series ended, and a new series, ''Nancy Drew Diaries'', was launched in 2013. Illustrations of the character evolved over time to reflect contemporary styles.<ref name=\"Stowe\">Stowe (1999).</ref> The character proves continuously popular worldwide: at least 80&nbsp;million copies of the books have been sold,<ref>Inness (1997), 79.</ref> and the books have been translated into over 45 languages. Nancy Drew is featured in five films, three television shows, and a number of popular computer games; she also appears in a variety of merchandise sold around the world.\n\nA cultural [[icon]], Nancy Drew is cited as a formative influence by a number of women, from [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court Justices]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]<ref>McFeatters (2005), 36.</ref> and [[Sonia Sotomayor]] to former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]]<ref name=\"Burrell\">Burrell (2007).</ref> and former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]].<ref>Argetsinger and Roberts (2007), C03.</ref> [[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist literary critics]] have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic [[hero]], an expression of wish fulfillment,<ref>Sherrie A. Inness writes that in \"many respects, Nancy Drew exists as a wish fulfillment.\" See Inness (1997), 175.</ref> or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about [[femininity]].<ref>Chamberlain (1994).</ref>\n\n== The Nancy Drew character ==\nNancy Drew is a fictional amateur sleuth. In the original versions of the series, she is a 16-year-old high school graduate, and in later versions, is rewritten and aged to be an 18-year-old high school graduate and detective. In the series, she lives in the fictional town of River Heights<ref>Fisher (2004), 71.</ref> with her father, attorney [[Carson Drew]], and their housekeeper, Hannah Gruen.<ref>Macleod (1995), 31.</ref> As a child (age ten in the original versions and age three in the later version), she loses her mother. Her loss is reflected in her early independence\u2014running a household since the age of ten with a clear-cut servant in early series and deferring to the servant as a surrogate parent in later ones. <!-- These two sentences were reworded and separated by a period instead of a semi-colon for the sake of clarity. --> As a teenager, she spends her time solving mysteries, some of which she stumbles upon and some of which begin as cases of her father's. Nancy is often<!-- often or always? --> assisted in solving mysteries by her two closest friends: cousins Bess Marvin and [[George Fayne]]. Bess is delicate and feminine, while George is a tomboy. Nancy is also occasionally joined by her boyfriend [[Ned Nickerson]], a student at Emerson College. <!-- This sentence has too many relative clauses beginning with \u201cwho.\u201d I reworded the sentences to eliminate this problem. -->\n\nNancy is often described as a super girl. In the words of [[Bobbie Ann Mason]], she is \"as immaculate and self-possessed as a [[Miss America]] on tour. She is as cool as [[Mata Hari]] and as sweet as [[Betty Crocker]].\"<ref name=\"mason-50\">Mason (1995), 50.</ref> Nancy is well-off, attractive, and amazingly talented:\n\n{{quote|At sixteen she 'had studied psychology in school, and was familiar with the power of suggestion and association.' Nancy was a fine painter, spoke French, and had frequently run motor boats. She was a skilled driver who at sixteen 'flashed into the garage with a skill born of long practice.' The prodigy was a sure shot, an excellent swimmer, skillful oarsman, expert seamstress, gourmet cook, and a fine bridge player. Nancy brilliantly played tennis and golf, and rode like a cowboy. Nancy danced like [[Ginger Rogers]] and could administer first aid like the [[Mayo clinic|Mayo]] brothers.<ref>Jones (1973), 708.</ref>}}\n\nNancy never lacks money, and in later volumes of the series often travels to faraway locations, such as [[France]] in ''[[The Mystery of the 99 Steps]]'' (1966), [[Nairobi]] in ''[[The Spider Sapphire Mystery]]'' (1968), [[Austria]] in ''[[Captive Witness]]'' (1981), [[Japan]] in ''[[The Runaway Bride (Nancy Drew)|The Runaway Bride]]'' (1994), Costa Rica in ''Scarlet Macaw Scandal'' (2004), and [[Alaska]] in ''Curse of The Arctic Star'' (2013). Nancy is also able to travel freely about the United States, thanks in part to her car, which is a blue [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] in the original series and a blue [[Convertible (car)|convertible]] in the later books.<ref>Inness (1997), 91.</ref> Despite the trouble and presumed expense to which she goes to solve mysteries, Nancy never accepts monetary compensation; however, by implication, her expenses are often paid by a client of her father's, as part of the costs of solving one of his cases.<ref>Keene (1961), 198.</ref>\n\n=== Creation of character ===\n[[File:Stratemeyerposing.jpg|thumb|Edward Stratemeyer conceived the character and wrote plot outlines but hired [[Mildred Benson|Mildred Wirt Benson]] to [[ghostwrite]] the first volumes in the series under the pseudonym [[Carolyn Keene]].]]\nThe character was conceived by [[Edward Stratemeyer]], founder of the [[Stratemeyer Syndicate]]. In 1926 Stratemeyer created the [[The Hardy Boys|Hardy Boys]] series (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which was such a success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine. While Stratemeyer believed that a woman's place was in the home,<ref>Johnson (1982), xxvi.</ref> he was aware that the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.<ref>Johnson (1993), 12.</ref>\n\nStratemeyer initially pitched the new series to Hardy Boys publishers [[Grosset & Dunlap]] as the \"Stella Strong Stories\", adding that \"they might also be called 'Diana Drew Stories', 'Diana Dare Stories', 'Nan Nelson Stories', 'Nan Drew Stories', or 'Helen Hale Stories'.\"<ref>Rehak (2006), 113\u2013114.</ref> Editors at Grosset & Dunlap preferred \"Nan Drew\" of these options, but decided to lengthen \"Nan\" to \"Nancy\".<ref>Rehak (2006), 113.</ref> Stratemeyer accordingly began writing plot outlines and hired [[Mildred Benson|Mildred Wirt]], later Mildred Wirt Benson, to [[ghostwrite]] the first volumes in the series under the [[pseudonym]] [[Carolyn Keene]].<ref>Carpan (2008), 50.</ref> Subsequent titles have been written by a number of different ghostwriters, all under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene.\n\nThe first four titles were published in 1930 and were an immediate success. Exact sales figures are not available for the years prior to 1979, but an indication of the books' popularity can be seen in a letter that Laura Harris, a Grosset and Dunlap editor, wrote to the Syndicate in 1931: \"Can you let us have the manuscript as soon as possible, and no later than July 10? There will only be three or four titles brought out then and the Nancy Drew is one of the most important.\"<ref>Quoted in Rehak (2006), 121.</ref> The 6,000 copies that [[Macy's]] ordered for the 1933 Christmas season sold out within days.<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 27.</ref> In 1934 [[Fortune magazine|''Fortune'' magazine]] featured the Syndicate in a cover story and singled Nancy Drew out for particular attention: \"Nancy is the greatest phenomenon among all the fifty-centers. She is a best seller. How she crashed a Valhalla that had been rigidly restricted to the male of her species is a mystery even to her publishers.\"<ref>Quoted in Plunkett-Powell (1993), 18.</ref>\n\n=== Evolution of character ===\n{{see also|Category:Nancy Drew characters}}\n\nThe character of Nancy Drew has gone through many permutations over the years. The Nancy Drew Mystery series was revised beginning in 1959;<ref>Dyer and Romalov (1995), 194.</ref> with commentators agreeing that Nancy's character changed significantly from the original Nancy of the books written in the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>See, for example, Betsy Caprio, Geoffrey Lapin, Karen Plunkett-Powell, and Melanie Rehak.</ref> Observers also often see a difference between the Nancy Drew of the original series, the Nancy of ''The Nancy Drew Files'', and the Nancy of ''[[Girl Detective]]'' series.<ref>See, for example, [[Maureen Corrigan]], Catherine Foster.</ref> Nevertheless, some find no significant difference among the permutations of Nancy Drew, finding Nancy to be simply a good role model for girls.<ref>See, for example, Gerstel (2007), Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), and Plunkett-Powell (1993).</ref> Despite revisions, \"What hasn't changed, however, are [Nancy's] basic values, her goals, her humility, and her magical gift for having at least nine lives. For more than six decades, her essence has remained intact.\"<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 55.</ref> Nancy is a \"teen detective queen\" who \"offers girl readers something more than action-packed adventure: she gives them something original. Convention has it that girls are passive, respectful, and emotional, but with the energy of a girl shot out of a cannon, Nancy bends conventions and acts out every girl's fantasies of power.\"<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 8.</ref>\n\nOther commentators see Nancy as \"a paradox\u2014which may be why feminists can laud her as a formative 'girl power' icon and conservatives can love her well-scrubbed middle-class values.\"<ref>O'Rourke (2004).</ref>\n\n==== 1930\u20131959: Early stories ====\nThe earliest Nancy Drew books were published as dark blue hardcovers with the titles stamped in orange lettering with dark blue outlines and no other images on the cover.  The covers went through several changes in early years: leaving the orange lettering with no outline and adding an orange silhouette of Nancy peering through a magnifying glass; then changing to a lighter blue board with dark blue lettering and silhouette; then changing the position of the title and silhouette on the front with black lettering and a more \"modern\" silhouette. Nancy Drew is depicted as an independent-minded 16-year-old who has already completed her high school education (16 was the minimum age for graduation at the time); the series also occurs over time, as she is 18 by the early 1940s. Apparently affluent (her father is a successful lawyer), she maintains an active social, volunteer, and sleuthing schedule, as well as participating in athletics and the arts, but is never shown as working for a living or acquiring job skills. Nancy is affected neither by the Great Depression\u2014although many of the characters in her early cases need assistance as they are poverty-stricken\u2014nor by World War II. Nancy lives with her lawyer father, Carson Drew, and their housekeeper, Mrs. Hannah Gruen. Some critics prefer the Nancy of these volumes, largely written by Mildred Benson. Benson is credited with \"[breathing]&nbsp;... a feisty spirit into Nancy's character.\"<ref name=\"Fisher\">Fisher, \"Nancy Drew, Sleuth.\"</ref> The original Nancy Drew is sometimes claimed \"to be a lot like [Benson] herself&nbsp;\u2013 confident, competent, and totally independent, quite unlike the cardboard character that [Edward] Stratemeyer had outlined.\"<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 24.</ref>\n\nThis original Nancy is frequently outspoken and authoritative, so much so that Edward Stratemeyer told Benson that the character was \"much too flip, and would never be well received.\"<ref>Quoted in Plunkett-Powell (1993), 33.</ref><ref>While Benson stated repeatedly in interviews that Stratemeyer used these words to her (Keeline 25), James Keeline states that there is no independent confirmation of this; Stratemeyer's written comments to Benson upon receipt of the manuscript for ''The Secret of the Old Clock'' contain no such criticism (Keeline 26).</ref> The editors at Grosset & Dunlap disagreed,<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 33.</ref> but Benson also faced criticism from her next Stratemeyer Syndicate editor, Harriet Adams, who felt that Benson should make Nancy's character more \"sympathetic, kind-hearted and lovable.\" Adams repeatedly asked Benson to, in Benson's words, \"make the sleuth less bold&nbsp;... 'Nancy said' became 'Nancy said sweetly,' 'she said kindly,' and the like, all designed to produce a less abrasive, more caring type of character.\"<ref>Quoted in Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 28.</ref> Many readers and commentators, however, admire Nancy's original outspoken character.<ref>See, for example, Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), Lapin (1986), and Fisher.</ref>\n\nA prominent critic of the Nancy Drew character, at least the Nancy of these early Nancy Drew stories,<ref>while Mason's book was originally published in 1975, after the Drew books began to be revised and re-written, Mason cites the unrevised volumes almost exclusively.</ref> is mystery writer [[Bobbie Ann Mason]]. Mason contends that Nancy owes her popularity largely to \"the appeal of her high-class advantages.\"<ref>Mason (1995), 49.</ref> Mason also criticizes the series for its [[racism]] and [[classism]],<ref>Mason (1995), 69\u201371.</ref> arguing that Nancy is the upper-class [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] defender of a \"fading aristocracy, threatened by the restless lower classes.\"<ref>Mason (1995), 73.</ref> Mason further contends that the \"most appealing elements of these daredevil girl sleuth adventure books are (secretly) of this kind: tea and fancy cakes, romantic settings, food eaten in quaint places (never a [[Howard Johnson's|Ho-Jo's]]), delicious pauses that refresh, old-fashioned picnics in the woods, precious jewels and heirlooms&nbsp;.... The word dainty is a subversive affirmation of a feminized universe.\"<ref name=\"mason-60\">Mason (1995), 60.</ref>\n\nAt bottom, says Mason, the character of Nancy Drew is that of a girl who is able to be \"perfect\" because she is \"free, white, and sixteen\"<ref name=\"mason-50\" /> and whose \"stories seem to satisfy two standards&nbsp;\u2013 adventure and domesticity. But adventure is the superstructure, domesticity the bedrock.\"<ref name=\"mason-60\" />\n\nOthers argue that \"Nancy, despite her traditionally feminine attributes, such as good looks, a variety of clothes for all social occasions, and an awareness of good housekeeping, is often praised for her seemingly masculine traits&nbsp;... she operates best independently, has the freedom and money to do as she pleases, and outside of a telephone call or two home, seems to live for solving mysteries rather than participating in family life.\"<ref>Parry (1997), 148.</ref>\n\n==== 1959\u20131979: Revisions at Grosset & Dunlap ====\nAt the insistence of publishers Grosset & Dunlap, the Nancy Drew books were revised beginning in 1959, both to make the books more modern and to eliminate racist stereotypes.<ref>Carpan (2008), 15.</ref> Although Harriet Adams felt that these changes were unnecessary, she oversaw a complete overhaul of the series, as well as writing new volumes in keeping with the new guidelines laid down by Grosset & Dunlap.<ref name=\"rehak-243\" /> The series did not so much eliminate racial stereotypes, however, as eliminate non-white characters altogether.<ref name=\"rehak-248\" /> For example, in the original version of ''[[The Hidden Window Mystery]]'' (1956), Nancy visits friends in the south whose [[African-American]] servant, \"lovable old Beulah&nbsp;... serves squabs, sweet potatoes, corn pudding, piping hot biscuits, and strawberry shortcake.\"<ref name=\"mason-70\">Mason (1995), 70.</ref> The mistress of the house waits until Beulah has left the room and then says to Nancy, \"I try to make things easier for Beulah but she insists on cooking and serving everything the old-fashioned way. I must confess, though, that I love it.\"<ref>Keene (1956), 64. Quoted in Mason (1995), 70.</ref> In the revised 1975 version, Beulah is changed to Anna, a \"plump, smiling housekeeper\".<ref>Keene (1975), 35.</ref>\n\nMany other changes were relatively minor. The new books were bound in yellow with color illustrations on the front covers.  Nancy's age was raised from 16 to 18, her mother was said to have died when Nancy was three, rather than ten, and other small changes were made.<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> Housekeeper Hannah Gruen, sent off to the kitchen in early stories, became less a servant and more a mother surrogate.<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 94.</ref>\n\nCritics saw this Nancy of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s as an improvement in some ways, a step back in others: \"In these new editions, an array of elements had been modified&nbsp;... and most of the more overt elements of racism had been excised. In an often overlooked alteration, however, the tomboyishness of the text's title character was also tamed.\"<ref>Abate (2008), 167.</ref>\n\nNancy becomes much more respectful of male authority figures in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, leading some to claim that the revised Nancy simply becomes too agreeable, and less distinctive, writing of her,  \"In the revised books, Nancy is relentlessly upbeat, puts up with her father's increasingly protective tendencies, and, when asked if she goes to church in the 1969 ''[[The Clue of the Tapping Heels]]'', replies, 'As often as I can'&nbsp;... Nancy learns to hold her tongue; she doesn't sass the dumb cops like she used to.\"<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\n==== 1980\u20132003: Continuing the original series ====\nHarriet Adams continued to oversee the series, after switching publishers to Simon & Schuster, until her death in 1982. After her death, Adams' prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Nancy Axelrad and Lilo Wuenn, and her three children, oversaw production of the Nancy Drew books and other Stratemeyer Syndicate series. In 1985, the five sold the Syndicate and all rights to Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster turned to book packager Mega-Books for new writers.<ref name=\"plunkett-29\" /> These books continued to have the characters solve mysteries in the present day, while still containing the same basic formula and style of the books during the Syndicate.\n\n==== 1986\u20131997: ''Files'', ''Super Mystery'', and ''On Campus'' ====\n{{main|The Nancy Drew Files|Super Mystery|Nancy Drew on Campus}}\n[[File:Ndharh.jpg|thumb|''The Nancy Drew Files'' showcased a more mature version of the character, as seen on the cover of ''Hit and Run Holiday'' (1986). Here, Nancy is in swimwear, in proximity to an attractive young man, rather than a clue.|upright]]\n\nIn 1985, as the sale of the Stratemeyer Syndicate to Simon & Schuster was being finalized, Simon & Schuster wanted to launch a spin-off series, that focused on more mature mysteries, and incorporated romance into the stories. To test whether this would work, the final two novels before the sale, ''The Bluebeard Room'' and ''The Phantom of Venice'', were used as backdoor pilots for the new series. The books read drastically different from the preceding novels of the past 55 years. For example, ''The Phantom of Venice'' (1985) opens with Nancy wondering in italics, \"''Am I or am I not in love with Ned Nickerson?''\"<ref>Keene (1985), 1.</ref> Nancy begins dating other young men and acknowledges sexual desires: \"'I saw [you kissing him]&nbsp;... You don't have to apologize to me if some guy turns you on.' 'Gianni ''doesn't'' turn me on!&nbsp;... Won't you please let me explain.'\"<ref>Keene (1985), 111\u2013112. Cited by Shangraw Fox.</ref> The next year, Simon & Schuster launched the first Nancy Drew spin-off, titled ''The Nancy Drew Files''.\n\nThe Nancy Drew character of the ''Files'' series has earned mixed reviews among fans. Some contend that Nancy's character becomes \"more like Mildred Wirt Benson's original heroine than any [version] since 1956.\"<ref>Caprio (1992), 27.</ref> Others criticize the series for its increasing incorporation of romance and \"[dilution] of pre-feminist [[wikt:moxie|moxie]].\"<ref>Torrance (2007), D01.</ref> One reviewer noticed \"Millie [Mildred Wirt Benson] purists tend to look askance upon the ''Files'' series, in which fleeting pecks bestowed on Nancy by her longtime steady, Ned Nickerson, give way to lingering embraces in a Jacuzzi.\"<ref name=\"leighbrown-1d\" /> Cover art for ''Files'' titles, such as ''Hit and Run Holiday'' (1986), reflects these changes; Nancy is often dressed provocatively, in short skirts, shirts that reveal her stomach or cleavage, or a bathing suit. She is often pictured with an attentive, handsome male in the background, and frequently appears aware of and interested in that male. Nancy also becomes more vulnerable, being often [[chloroform]]ed into unconsciousness, or defenseless against [[chokehold]]s.<ref>Foster (1986), 31.</ref> The books place more emphasis on violence and character relationships, with Nancy Drew and Ned Nickerson becoming a more on-off couple, and both having other love interests that can span multiple books.\n\nThe ''Files'' also launched its own spin off. A crossover spin-off series with ''The Hardy Boys'', titled the ''[[Super Mystery]]'' series, began in 1988. These books were in continuity with the similar ''Hardy Boys'' spin-off, ''[[List of Hardy Boys books#The Hardy Boys Casefiles (1987\u20131998)|The Hardy Boys Casefiles]]''.\n\nIn 1995, Nancy Drew finally goes to college in the ''[[Nancy Drew on Campus]]'' series. These books read more similar to soap opera books, such as the ''[[Sweet Valley High]]'' series. The ''On Campus'' books focus more on romance plots, and also centered around other characters; the mysteries were merely used as subplots. By reader request, Nancy broke off her long-term relationship with boyfriend Ned Nickerson in the second volume of the series, ''On Her Own'' (1995).<ref name=\"Fisher\" /><ref>Drew (1997), 185.</ref> Similar to the ''Files'' series, reception for the ''On Campus'' series was also mixed, with some critics viewing the inclusion of adult themes such as date rape \"unsuccessful\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Claudia|title=Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0313339090|pages=450|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&pg=PA450&dq=%22Nancy+Drew+on+Campus%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wvYOUYicHa-70QGL14DoBw&ved=0CGEQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=%22Nancy%20Drew%20on%20Campus%22&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NANCY DREW IS UPDATED - AND DATED|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AK&s_site=ohio&p_multi=AK&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EE780A8128CB7B9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=Akron Beacon Journal|date=September 21, 1995}}</ref> Carolyn Carpan commented that the series was \"more soap opera romance than mystery\" and that Nancy \"comes across as dumb, missing easy clues she wouldn't have missed in previous series\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Carpan|first=Carolyn|title=Sisters, Schoolgirls, and Sleuths|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810863952|pages=135\u2013136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8kdbbiIqVbsC&pg=PA136&dq=%22Nancy+Drew+on+Campus%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=afkOUd77NrS30AGyxYG4CQ&ved=0CEkQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=%22Nancy%20Drew%20on%20Campus%22&f=false}}</ref> The series was also criticized for focusing more on romance than on grades or studying, with one critic stating that the series resembled collegiate academic studying in the 1950s, where \"women were more interested in pursuing ... the \"MRS\" degree.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Naomi|title=Consuming Desires: A Feminist Analysis of Bestselling Teen Romance Novels|year=2008|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|isbn=9780549324775|pages=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DB01qubusloC&pg=PA19&dq=%22Nancy+Drew+on+Campus%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3foOUfWSFaXp0gH1yIHACw&ved=0CGkQ6AEwCTgo#v=onepage&q=%22Nancy%20Drew%20on%20Campus%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Simon & Schuster announced a mass cancellation of Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys spin-offs, except ones for younger children. The ''Files'' series ran until the end of 1997, while both the ''Super Mystery'' and ''on Campus'' series ran until the beginning of 1998.\n\n==== 2003\u20132012: ''Girl Detective'' and graphic novels ====\n{{see also|Girl Detective}}\nIn 2003, publishers Simon & Schuster ended the original Nancy Drew series and began featuring Nancy's character in a new mystery series, ''Girl Detective''. The Nancy Drew of the ''Girl Detective'' series drives a hybrid car, uses a mobile phone, and recounts her mysteries in the first person. Many applaud these changes, arguing that Nancy has not really changed at all other than learning to use a cell phone.<ref>Springen and Meadows(2005).</ref> Others praise the series as more realistic; Nancy, these commentators argue, is now a less-perfect and therefore more likable being, one whom girls can more easily relate to&nbsp;\u2013 a better role model than the old Nancy because she can actually be emulated, rather than a \"prissy automaton of perfection.\"<ref>Benfer (2004), A15.</ref>\n\nSome, mostly fans, vociferously lament the changes, seeing Nancy as a silly, air-headed girl whose trivial adventures (discovering who squished the zucchini in 2004's ''Without a Trace'') \"hold a shallow mirror to a pre-teen's world.\"<ref>Corrigan (2004).</ref> Leona Fisher argues that the new series portrays an increasingly white River Heights, partially because \"the clumsy first-person narrative voice makes it nearly impossible to interlace external authorial attitudes into the discourse\", while it continues and worsens \"the implicitly xenophobic cultural representations of racial, ethnic, and linguistic others\" by introducing gratuitous speculations on characters' national and ethnic origins.<ref>Fisher, Leona (2008), 73.</ref>\n\nThe character is also the heroine of a series of [[graphic novel]]s, begun in 2005 and produced by Papercutz. The graphic novels are written by [[Stefan Petrucha]] and illustrated in [[manga]]-style artwork by Sho Murase. The character's graphic novel incarnation has been described as \"a fun, sassy, modern-day teen who is still hot on the heels of criminals.\"<ref>\"Sleuths Go Graphic\" (2008).</ref>\n\nWhen the 2007 film was released, a non-canon novelization of the movie was written to look like the older books. A new book was written for each of the ''Girl Detective'' and ''Clue Crew'' series, both of which deal with a mystery on a movie set. In 2008, the ''Girl Detective'' series was re-branded into trilogies with a model on the cover. These mysteries became deeper, with the mystery often spread across three books, and multiple culprits. These trilogies also met with negative fan reception due to Nancy's constant mistakes, shortness of the books, and lack of action. With the new trilogy format, sales began slipping. In 2010, Simon & Schuster then cut back from six ''Nancy Drew'' books per year, to four books per year. In December 2011, they finally announced that the series was cancelled along with the Hardy Boys ''Undercover Brothers'' series.\n\n==== 2013\u2013present: ''Diaries'' ====\n{{Expand section|date=November 2017}}\n\nWith the sudden cancellation of the ''Girl Detective'' series, the ''Diaries'' series began in 2013. The series is similar to its predecessor, in that the books are narrated in first person, Nancy is still absent-minded and awkward, and references are made to pop culture and technology.\n\n== Ghostwriters ==\nConsistent with other Stratemeyer Syndicate properties, the Nancy Drew novels were written by various writers, all under the [[pen name]] Carolyn Keene.<ref name=\"SS1\">{{cite web| last=Andrews|first=Dale| title=The Hardy Boys Mystery | url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/08/the-hardy-boys-mystery_27.html |work=Children's books |publisher=SleuthSayers| location=Washington| date=2013-08-27}}</ref> In accordance with the customs of Stratemeyer Syndicate series production, ghostwriters for the Syndicate signed contracts that have sometimes been interpreted as requiring authors to sign away all rights to authorship or future royalties.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 24.</ref> Contracts stated that authors could not use their Stratemeyer Syndicate pseudonyms independently of the Syndicate.<ref>Keeline (2008), 21.</ref> In the early days of the Syndicate, ghostwriters were paid a fee of $125, \"roughly equivalent to two month's wages for a typical newspaper reporter, the primary day job of the syndicate ghosts.\"<ref>Keeline (2008), 22.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]] this fee was lowered to $100 and eventually $75.<ref>Rehak (2006), 149.</ref> All royalties went to the Syndicate, and all correspondence with the publisher was handled through a Syndicate office. The Syndicate was able to enlist the cooperation of libraries in hiding the ghostwriters' names; when [[Walter Karig]], who wrote volumes eight through ten of the original ''[[Nancy Drew Mystery Stories]]'', tried to claim rights with the [[Library of Congress]] in 1933, the Syndicate instructed the Library of Congress not to reveal the names of any Nancy Drew authors, a move with which the Library of Congress complied.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 26\u201327.</ref>\n\nThe Syndicate's process for creating the Nancy Drew books consisted of creating a detailed plot outline, drafting a manuscript, and editing the manuscript. Edward Stratemeyer and his daughters [[Harriet Adams]] and Edna Stratemeyer Squier wrote most of the outlines for the original Nancy Drew series until 1979. Volume 30, ''[[The Clue of the Velvet Mask]]'' (1953), was outlined by [[Andrew Svenson]]. Usually, other writers wrote the manuscripts. Most of the early volumes were written by [[Mildred Benson|Mildred Wirt Benson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mildred Augustine Wirt Benson Papers |url=http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/BensonMildred.htm |work=Iowa Women's Archives |publisher=University of Iowa Libraries |accessdate=27 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510065205/http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/BensonMildred.htm |archivedate=10 May 2013 }}</ref>  Other volumes were written by [[Walter Karig]], George Waller, Jr., Margaret Scherf, Wilhelmina Rankin, Alma Sasse, [[Charles S. Strong]], Iris Vinton,<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 39.</ref> and Patricia Doll. Edward Stratemeyer edited the first three volumes, and Harriet Adams edited most subsequent volumes until her death in 1982. In 1959, the earlier titles were revised, largely by Adams.<ref>Rehak (2006), 245.</ref> From the late 1950s until her death in 1982, Harriet Adams herself wrote the manuscripts for most of the books.<ref>Farah (2005), 431\u2013521; Rehak (2006), 249.</ref>\n\nAfter Adams' death, series production was overseen by Nancy Axelrad (who also wrote several volumes). The rights to the character were sold in 1984, along with the Stratemeyer Syndicate itself, to [[Simon & Schuster]]. Book packager Mega-Books subsequently hired authors to write the main Nancy Drew series and a new series, ''[[The Nancy Drew Files]]''.<ref name=\"plunkett-29\">Plunkett-Powell (1993), 29.</ref>\n\n=== Legal disputes ===\nIn 1980, Harriet Adams switched publishers to Simon & Schuster, dissatisfied with the lack of creative control at Grosset & Dunlap and the lack of publicity for the Hardy Boys' 50th anniversary in 1977. Grosset & Dunlap filed suit against the Syndicate and the new publishers, Simon & Schuster, citing \"breach of contract, copyright infringement, and unfair competition.\"<ref>Johnson (1993), 16.</ref>\n\nAdams filed a countersuit, claiming the case was in poor taste and frivolous, and that, as author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953, and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author. When Mildred Benson was called to testify about her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.<ref>Johnson (1993), 17.</ref>\n\n== Evolution of character's appearance ==\nNancy Drew has been illustrated by many artists over the years, and her look constantly updated. Both the Stratemeyer Syndicate and the books' publishers have exercised control over the way Nancy is depicted.<ref>Rehak (2006), 228.</ref>\n\nSome aspects of Nancy's portrayal have remained relatively constant through the decades. Arguably her most characteristic physical depiction is that she is shown holding a flashlight.<ref name=\"EW\">\"The Top 20 Heroes,\" ''Entertainment Weekly'' 1041 (April 3, 2009): 36.</ref>\n\n=== Russell H. Tandy ===\nCommercial artist [[Russell H. Tandy]] was the first artist to illustrate Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style is that of a flatfoot [[flapper]]: heeled [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Janes]] accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and [[cloche hat]] on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags.<ref>Stowe (1999), 15.</ref> By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]].<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 44.</ref> In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.<ref name=\"Plunkett-Powell 1993, 43\u201344\">Plunkett-Powell (1993), 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nTandy drew the inside sketches for the first 26 volumes of the series as well as painting the covers of the first 26 volumes with the exception of volume 11&nbsp;\u2013 the cover artist for volume 11 is unknown. Tandy read each text before he began sketching, so his early covers were closely connected to specific scenes in the plots. He also hand-painted the cover lettering and designed the original Nancy Drew logo: a silhouette of Nancy bending slightly and looking at the ground through a [[quizzing glass]].<ref name=\"Plunkett-Powell 1993, 43\u201344\"/>\n\nTandy often portrays Nancy Drew with confident, assertive body language. She never appears \"shocked, trepidatious, or scared\".<ref>Stowe (1999), 26.</ref> Nancy is shown either boldly in the center of the action or actively, but secretively, investigating a clue.<ref>Stowe (1999), 28.</ref> She is often observed by a menacing figure and appears to be in imminent danger, but her confident expression suggests to viewers that she is in control of the situation.<ref name=\"stowe-32\">Stowe (1999), 32.</ref>\n\nTandy's home was struck by fire in 1962, and most of his original paintings and sketches were destroyed. As a result, the Tandy dust-jackets are considered very valuable by collectors.<ref name=\"plunkett-46\">Plunkett-Powell (1993), 46.</ref>\n\n=== Bill Gillies and others ===\nBeginning with Tandy in 1948 and continuing into the early 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the prevailing styles. In postwar opulence, a trend emerged for young adults to have their own casual style, instead of dressing in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy becomes less constrained. Sweater or blouse and skirt ensembles, as well as a [[pageboy]] hairstyle, were introduced in 1948, and continued with new artist Bill Gillies, who updated 10 covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952. Gillies used his wife for a model, and Nancy reflects the conservative 1950s, with immaculately waved hair and a limited wardrobe&nbsp;\u2013 she wears similar sweater, blouse, and skirt ensembles, in different combinations, on most of these covers. Gillies also designed the modern-era trademark as a spine symbol which was used for decades: Nancy's head in profile, looking through a quizzing glass.<ref name=\"plunkett-46\" />\n\nIn the later Tandy period (1946&nbsp;\u2013 1949) and continuing throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less frequently in the center of the action. ''The Ghost of Blackwood Hall'' shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up the front steps of the haunted house, and marks a transition to later illustrations. From 1949 forward, she is likely to be observing others, often hiding or concealing herself.<ref>Stowe (1999), 30.</ref> Her mouth is often open in surprise, and she hides her body from view.<ref>Stowe (1999), 30\u201331.</ref> However, although Nancy \"expresses surprise, she is not afraid. She appears to be a bit taken aback by what she sees, but she looks as if she is still in control of the situation.\"<ref name=\"stowe-32\" /> Many of these covers feature Nancy poised in the observation of a clue, spying on criminal activity, or displaying her discoveries to others involved in the mystery. Only occasionally is she shown in action, such as running from the scene of a fire, riding a horse, or actively sleuthing with a flashlight. At times she is only involved in action as her hiding place has been discovered by others. In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.<!-- try to find a source for this in history -->\n\n=== Rudy Nappi and others ===\nJoseph Rudolf \"Rudy\" Nappi, the artist from 1953 to 1979, illustrated a more average teenager. Nappi was asked by [[Grosset & Dunlap]]'s art director to update Nancy's appearance, especially her wardrobe. Nappi gave Nancy [[Peter Pan collar]]s, shirtwaist dresses, a pageboy (later a flip) haircut, and the occasional pair of jeans. Nancy's hair color was changed from blonde to strawberry-blonde, reddish-blonde, or [[red hair|titian]] by the end of the decade. The change was long rumored to have been the result of a printing ink error, but was considered so favorable that it was adopted in the text for books published after 1959, and by illustrator Polly Bolian for volumes she created for a special book club in 1959\u201360.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 48.</ref>\n\nIn 1962, all [[Grosset & Dunlap]] books become \"picture covers\", books with artwork and advertising printed directly on their covers, as opposed to books with a dust jacket over a tweed volume. The change was to reduce production costs. Several of the 1930s and 1940s cover illustrations were updated by Nappi for this change, depicting a Nancy of the Kennedy era, though the stories themselves were not updated. Internal illustrations, which were dropped in 1937, were returned to the books beginning in 1954, as pen and ink line drawings, mostly by uncredited artists, but usually corresponding with Nappi's style of drawing Nancy on the covers.<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> Nappi followed trends initiated by Gillies and often illustrated Nancy wearing the same clothing more than once, including a mustard shirtwaist dress.\n\nUnlike Tandy, Nappi did not read the books before illustrating them; instead, his wife read them and provided him with a brief plot summary before Nappi began painting.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 49.</ref> Nappi's first cover was for ''[[The Clue of the Velvet Mask]]'', where he began a trend of portraying Nancy as \"bobby-soxer&nbsp;... a contemporary sixteen-year-old. This Nancy was perky, clean-cut, and extremely animated. In the majority of his covers Nancy looks startled&nbsp;\u2013 which, no doubt, she was.\"<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 47.</ref> Nancy's style is considerably conservative, and remains so during the psychedelic period. Although she wears bold colors and prints, or the background colors are shades of electric yellow, shocking pink, turquoise, or apple green, her clothing is high-necked and with long hemlines. Earlier Nappi covers show Nancy in poses similar to those in the covers by Tandy and Gillies; for many updated covers he simply updated the color scheme, clothing style, and hairstyles of the characters but retains their original poses in similar settings. Later Nappi covers show only Nancy's head or part of her body, surrounded by spooky or startling elements or clues from the story. These Nappi covers would later be used for the opening credits of the television production, with photos of [[Pamela Sue Martin]] inserted on the book covers.\n\nOften, \"Nancy's face wears the blank expression of one lost in thought,\"<ref name=\"stowe-35\">Stowe (1999), 35.</ref> making her appear passive.<ref name=\"stowe-36\">Stowe (1999), 36.</ref> On the cover of ''[[The Strange Message in the Parchment]]'' (1977), for example, in contrast to earlier covers, Nancy \"is not shown in the midst of danger or even watching a mystery unfold from a distance. Instead, Nancy is shown thinking about the clues\";<ref>Stowe (1999), 33.</ref> in general, Nancy becomes less confident and more puzzled.<ref name=\"stowe-35\" />\n\n=== Nancy in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s ===\n[[File:Ndtcotvv.jpg|thumb|Nancy is shown in danger on the cover of ''The Case of the Vanishing Veil'' (1988) and other covers from the 1980s. Unlike in earlier covers from the series, she is not completely in control of the situation.|upright]]\n\n[[Ruth Sanderson]] and Paul Frame provided cover art and interior illustrations for the first Nancy Drew paperbacks, published under the Wanderer imprint. Other artists, including Aleta Jenks and others whose names are unknown,<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 52.</ref> provided cover art, but no interior illustrations, for later paperbacks. Nancy is portrayed as \"a wealthy, privileged sleuth who looks pretty and alert.... The colors, and Nancy's facial features, are often so vivid that some of the covers look more like glossy photographs than paintings.\"<ref name=\"plunkett-51\">Plunkett-Powell (1993), 51.</ref>\n\nNancy is frequently portrayed pursuing a suspect,<ref name=\"stowe-36\" /> examining a clue, or observing action. She is often also shown in peril:<ref>Stowe (1999), 38.</ref> being chased, falling off a boat, or hanging by a rope from rafters. These covers are \"characterized by frenetic energy on Nancy's part; whether she is falling, limbs flailing, an alarmed look on her face, or whether she is running, hair flying, body bent, face breathless. Nancy does not have any control over the events that are happening in these covers. She is shown to be a victim, being hunted and attacked by unseen foes.\"<ref>Stowe (1999), 40.</ref>\n\nNancy is also sometimes pursued by a visibly threatening foe, as on the cover of ''The Case of the Vanishing Veil'' (1988).\n\nThe covers of ''The Nancy Drew Files'' and ''[[Girl Detective]]'' series represent further departures from the bold, confident character portrayed by Tandy. The Nancy portrayed on the covers of ''The Nancy Drew Files'' is \"a markedly sexy Nancy, with a handsome young man always lurking in the background. Her clothes often reveal an ample bustline and her expression is mischievous.\"<ref name=\"plunkett-51\" /> In the ''Girl Detective'' series, Nancy's face is depicted on each cover in fragments. Her eyes, for example, are confined to a strip across the top of the cover while her mouth is located near the spine in a box independent of her eyes. The artwork for Nancy's eyes and mouth is taken from Rudy Nappi's cover art for the revised version of ''[[The Secret of the Old Clock]]''.<ref name=\"Fisher\" />\n\n== Books ==\n{{main|List of Nancy Drew books}}\n\nThe longest-running series of books to feature Nancy Drew is the original Nancy Drew series, whose 175 volumes were published from 1930 to 2003. Nancy also appeared in 124 titles in ''The Nancy Drew Files'' and then became the heroine of the ''Diaries'' series. Various other series feature the character, such as the ''[[Nancy Drew Notebooks]]'' and ''[[Nancy Drew on Campus]]''. While Nancy Drew is the central character in each series, continuity is preserved only within one series, not between them all; for example, in concurrently published titles in the Nancy Drew series and the ''Nancy Drew on Campus'' series, Nancy is respectively dating her boyfriend Ned Nickerson or broken up with Ned Nickerson.  The two exceptions are the series ''Super Mystery'' (also called ''A Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys Super Mystery'') that ran concurrently with the ''Files'', and shares continuity with those stories and the then-running  ''Hardy Boys Casefiles'', and in 2007 a new ''A Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys Super Mystery'' series shared continuity with the ''Girl Detective'' series.\n\n''Nancy Drew Diaries'' started in 2013. This is a reboot of the ''Nancy Drew: Girl Detective'' series.  The series is described as \"A classic Nancy Drew with her modern twist\". While similar to the ''Nancy Drew, Girl Detective'' series, this series includes situations and problems typical in young adult \"tween\" books. The mystery element is not always the main focus of the characters, and often Nancy states she is avoiding mysteries or \"on a break\" from sleuthing. Nancy often acts timid and scared, in book #16 ''The Haunting on Heliotrope Lane'' she says she is glad she \"hasn't peed herself from being scared\". This Nancy does not navigate in the world of adults as previous versions of the character. The first person narration reveals a juvenile voice with a passive role in the action and a lack of motivation in solving mysteries. In book #12 ''The Sign in the Smoke'' Nancy does not solve the mystery, a secondary character comes up with the solution. In several books Nancy stumbles upon the solution to the \"mystery\" and acts amazed at the reveal. This is in contrast to the set-up of previous Nancy Drew series. Attempts to make Nancy's character more modern and less perfect have resulted in a confusing and often conflicting representation of the iconic Nancy Drew character.\n\n=== International publications ===\nThe main Nancy Drew series, ''The Nancy Drew Files'', and ''Girl Detective'' books have been translated into a number of languages besides English. Estimates vary from between 14 and 25&nbsp;languages,<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 160.</ref> but 25 seems the most accurate number.<ref name=\"Fox\">Shangraw Fox.</ref> Nancy Drew books have been published in many European countries (especially in [[Nordic countries]] and France) as well as in Latin America and Asia. The character of Nancy Drew seems to be more popular in some countries than others. Nancy Drew books have been in print in Norway since 1941 (the first country outside USA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nancydrewworld.com/norwegian.html | title = Around the World with Nancy Drew&nbsp;\u2013 Norway | publisher = Nancydrewworld.com |date=December 21, 2001 |accessdate=September 23, 2012}}</ref>), in Denmark since 1958, in France since 1955<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.carolinequine.com/pages/Presentation_de_la_serie_Alice-504890.html  Nancy Drew in France]</ref> and in Italy since 1970 by [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore]]. Other countries, such as [[Estonia]], have only recently begun printing Nancy Drew books.<ref name=\"Fox\" />\n\nNancy's name is often changed in translated editions: in France, she is known as Alice Roy; in Sweden, as Kitty Drew; in Finland, as Paula Drew;<ref name=\"Fox\" /> and in Norway the book series has the name of ''Fr\u00f8ken Detektiv'' (''Miss Detective''), though the heroine's name is still Nancy Drew inside the books.<ref>Skj\u00f8nsberg (1994), 72.</ref> In Germany, Nancy is a German law student named Susanne Langen. [[George Fayne]]'s name is even more frequently changed, to Georgia, Joyce, Kitty, or Marion. Cover art and series order is often changed as well, and in many countries only a limited number of Drew books are available in translation.\n\n== In other media ==\nSix feature films, three television shows, and four television pilots featuring Nancy Drew have been produced to date. No television show featuring Nancy Drew has lasted longer than two years, and film portrayals of the character have met with mixed reviews.\n\n=== Films ===\n\n==== Bonita Granville ====\nIn 1937, Warner Bros. bought the rights to the ''Nancy Drew'' book series from the Stratemeyer Syndicate, for a reported $6,000. Warner Bros. wanted to make a series of B-films based on the character, to serve as a companion to their popular ''[[Torchy Blane]]'' B-film series, which starred [[Glenda Farrell]], [[Barton MacLane]], and [[Tom Kennedy (actor)|Tom Kennedy]]. Adams sold the rights to [[Jack L. Warner]] without an agent or any consultation; thus, she sold all and any film rights to Warner Bros., a move she would later regret, and would later come into question by her publishers.\n\nFrom 1938 to 1939, four films in the series were released. All of them were directed by [[William Clemens (film director)|William Clemens]], written by ''Torchy Blane'' writer Kenneth Gamet, and had the same primary cast:\n*[[Bonita Granville]] as Nancy Drew\n*[[John Litel]] as Carson Drew\n*[[Frankie Thomas]] as Ted Nickerson (changed from Ned Nickerson)\n*[[Renie Riano]] as Effie Schneider\n*[[Frank Orth]] as Captain Tweedy (Orth appeared in only the first and last film, while being mentioned in the second)\n\nThe four films were released as B-films (a shorter film shows before the main picture, which usually lasted around 60 minutes):\n*''[[Nancy Drew... Detective]]'' (November 1938; loosely based on ''[[The Password to Larkspur Lane]]'')\n*''[[Nancy Drew... Reporter]]'' (February 1939)\n*''[[Nancy Drew\u2026 Trouble Shooter]]'' (June 1939)\n*''[[Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase (1939 film)|Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase]]'' (September 1939; loosely based on ''[[The Hidden Staircase]]'')\n\nThe series was announced by Warner Bros. in April 1938; production of the first film, ''Nancy Drew Gets the Passport'', was set to begin production in June, directed by [[John Farrow]] with a screenplay from Robertson White. However, for unclear reasons, Farrow and White were replaced by Clemens and Gamet, and production was delayed to August. The first two films did well enough to allow Warner Bros. to expand the budgets for the third and fourth films; in early 1939, they also announced the green-lighting of an additional four films, bringing the total up to eight.<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMovie\">{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/phixwithwings/80-years-ago-nancy-drew-made-her-big-screen-debut-3ofba|title=80 Years Ago Nancy Drew Made Her Big Screen Debut|last=phixwithwings|date=November 15, 2018|website=[[BuzzFeed]]|access-date=December 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DetectiveAFI\">{{cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/6253?sid=3331456f-45e2-4be6-b6b0-506496746486&sr=5.6730986&cp=1&pos=3|title=Nancy Drew, Detective|website=AFI|access-date=December 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the second film, Warner Bros. assigned the third film, originally titled ''Nancy Drew Steps Out'', to Eddie Anderson and Charles Perry; like White, they were replaced under unclear circumstances. Gamet was once again re-hired to write for the series, and completed writing the eight films. Shortly after production of the fourth film wrapped in May, Warner Bros. decided to eliminate their [[double feature]] setup, thus cancelling the ''Nancy Drew'' film series. Although they initially announced the ''Nancy Drew'' series would be converted into [[two-reeler]]s, they cancelled those plans days later.<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMovie\"/>\n\nThe fifth film was written, and may have been produced. [[Frankie Thomas]] believes that he and Granville made five films, not four.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 117.</ref> In addition, Harriet Adams wrote to [[Mildred Benson|Mildred Wirt]], the ghostwriter of the books at the time, in August 1939 that \"three have been shown in this area, and I have just heard that a fifth is in production.\"<ref name=\"kismaric-103\">Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 103.</ref>\n\nThe films took many liberties from its source material. Granville's portrayal of Nancy showed her as a ditsy and absent-minded schemer, in contrast to the books of that time, where Nancy was intelligent, sharp-tongued, and quite ahead of her time. Carson Drew of the books was portrayed as an older, feeble, hands-off parent, while John Litel's Carson was young, handsome, much more athletically fit, and tried his best to restrain Nancy from getting into danger. Ned/Ted was even more drastically altered: instead of being Nancy's boyfriend in college who lives in a different town, he was now her clumsy next-door neighbor, who was often in the center of Nancy's scheming unwittingly or under protest. The recurring character of the older Hannah Gruen was replaced with Effie Schneider, Hannah's teenage niece who had appeared in the book the first film was based on. Effie and Hannah's characteristics were merged, although Effie's fidgety, frightful nature retained prominence for comedic effect. In addition to these four, the new character Captain Tweedy was added, to portray the stereotypical bumbling, clueless cop that mirrored Steve McBride in the ''Torchy Blane'' series. The characters of Bess Marvin, George Fayne, and Helen Corning did not appear in the film series, and were never mentioned or referred to.\n\nIn addition to the character changes, the tone and pacing of the films were also matured and altered for comic effect and to accommodate a wider audience. The films changed the less-severe crimes and adventures of the books into gruesome murders, often spearheaded by dangerous criminals. At the time of the films, Nancy and Ned/Ted's romance in the books was set aside for the main mystery; on the other hand, romance was a prominent theme of the films, with Nancy being portrayed as the domineering girlfriend, and Ted as the repressive boyfriend, usually used by Nancy to his misery. While book Nancy was usually treated with authority and equal respect to other adults while solving the mystery professionally, the films portrayed Nancy as a meddling school girl who chased adventures, much to the misery of the adults and peers around her.\n\nCritical reaction to these films is mixed. Some find that the movies did not \"depict the true Nancy Drew\",<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 114.</ref> in part because Granville's Nancy \"blatantly used her feminine wiles (and enticing bribes)\" to accomplish her goals.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 115.</ref> The films also portray Nancy as childish and easily flustered, a significant change from her portrayal in the books.<ref>Nash (2006), 71\u2013116.</ref> Just as with the critics, both ghostwriter Mildred Wirt and editor Harriet Adams were also divided on the film's reception. Adams did not like the films, and resented the studio for its treatment of the character; she did, however, keep a personal autographed photo from Granville on her office desk for many years according to her employees, and may have used John Litel's portrayal of Carson Drew to revamp the character when she revised the books in the 1960s and 1970s. Contrary to Adams, Benson was said to have liked the films of the time, despite them being different from the character she wrote.<ref name=\"kismaric-103\" />\n\nTo promote the film, [[Warner Bros.]] created a Nancy Drew fan club that included a set of rules, such as: \"Must have steady boy friend, in the sense of a 'pal'\" and must \"Take part in choosing own clothes.\"<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 116.</ref> These rules were based on some research Warner Bros. had done on the habits and attitudes of \"typical\" teenage girls.<ref>Nash (2006), 87\u201390.</ref> Granville was the \"honorary president\" of the fan club, and a kit for the club came with autographed pictures of her.\n\nThe series become somewhat of a cult success after the films started appearing on cable channels such as [[Turner Classic Movies]]. The films were arguably ones in which all five cast members were notable for in their careers. Granville recalled making the films fondly, and stated her favorite film of the series was ''Nancy Drew\u2026 Trouble Shooter''. Twenty years after the films, Thomas would later go on to portray Carson Drew in a failed pilot for CBS. Litel and Granville would later reunite for the 1947 film ''[[The Guilty (1947 film)|The Guilty]]'', produced by Granville's husband [[Jack Wrather]].\n\n====Emma Roberts====\n{{main|Nancy Drew (2007 film)}}\nA new film version for ''Nancy Drew'' had been in the works at Warner Bros. since the mid 1990s. However, nothing came into fruition until the mid 2000s.\n\nOn June 15, 2007, [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] released a new film titled ''[[Nancy Drew (2007 film)|Nancy Drew]]'', with [[Emma Roberts]] starring as Nancy, [[Max Thieriot]] as Ned Nickerson, and [[Tate Donovan]] as Carson Drew; [[Andrew Fleming]] directed and co-wrote the film with Tiffany Paulsen, while [[Jerry Weintraub]] produced. This film saw Nancy move to Los Angeles with her father on an extended business trip, and picking the house of a murdered movie star as their house to solve the cold case.\n\nBefore the release of the 2007 film, Roberts, Fleming, and Weintraub had signed on for two ''Nancy Drew'' sequels. But with the mixed success of the first film, and Roberts' decision to move onto other projects, these films were never made.\n\nAs with the earlier Drew films, reactions were mixed. Some see the film as updated version of the basic character: \"although it has been glammed up for the lucrative tween demographic, the movie retains the best parts of the books, including, of course, their intelligent main character.\"<ref>Cheong (2007).</ref> Others find the movie \"jolting\" because Nancy's \"new classmates prefer shopping to sleuthing, and Nancy's plaid skirt, penny loafers, and magnifying glass make her something of a dork, not the town hero she was in the Midwest.\"<ref>Brown (2007), D1.</ref>\n\n====Sophia Lillis====\n{{main|Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase (2019 film)}}\n\nOn April 20, 2018, Warner Bros. announced they were making a new ''Nancy Drew'' film series, starring [[Sophia Lillis]] as Nancy. The first film will be adapted from ''[[The Hidden Staircase]]'', with [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and Wendy Williams among the producers. The film is not related to the previous film starring Bonita Granville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/939705-sophia-lillis-star-nancy-drew-hidden-staircase|last=N'Duka|first=Amanda|title=\u2018It\u2019 Star Sophia Lillis To Topline Warner Bros\u2019 \u2018Nancy Drew And The Hidden Staircase\u2019|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=April 20, 2018|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/it-sophia-lillis-warner-bros-nancy-drew-and-the-hidden-staircase-1202372950/|last=Evry|first=Max|title=IT\u2019s Sophia Lillis to Star in Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase|work=Comingsoon.net|date=April 20, 2018|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\n==== ''The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries'' ====\n{{main|The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries}}\n\nThe most successful attempt at bringing Nancy Drew to life on television was ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', which ran from 1977 to 1979 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref>Carpan (2008), 110.</ref> Future ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' star [[Pamela Sue Martin]] starred as Nancy, with [[Jean Rasey]] and George O'Hanlon, Jr. as friends George and Ned, and [[William Schallert]] as Carson Drew.\n\nThis series is regarded as the most faithful series to the books; Martin is often regarded by many Nancy Drew fans as the best actress to portray her. The series was also faithful in its tone of smaller mysteries, such as haunted houses or theft.\n\nThe first season originally alternated with the Hardy Boys; the Hardy Boys was met with success, but the Drew episodes were met with mixed results. In the second season, the format shifted to present the Hardy Boys as the more prominent characters, with Nancy Drew mostly a character in crossover episodes (although the character did have some solo episodes). Martin, who was 24 years old at the start of the series, left midway through the season, and was replaced by 19-year-old [[Janet Julian|Janet Louise Johnson]] for the final few episodes.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 121.</ref>\n\nWhen the series came back for a third season, Nancy Drew was dropped from the series, with it now focusing completely on the Hardy Boys. But soon after the change, ABC cancelled the series.\n\n==== ''Nancy Drew'' (1995 TV series) ====\n{{anchor|1995 TV series}}\n\nNelvana began production of another Nancy Drew television show in 1995. [[Tracy Ryan (actress)|Tracy Ryan]] starred as Nancy Drew, with Jhene Erwin as Bess Marvin, [[Joy Tanner]] as George Fayne, and, in a recurring role, [[Scott Speedman]] as Ned Nickerson. Nancy is now a 21-year-old criminology student, moving to New York City and living in an upscale apartment complex called the \"Callisto\". Nancy solved various mysteries with Bess, a gossip columnist at ''The Rag'', and George, a mail carrier and amateur filmmaker. Ned worked on charity missions in Africa, but did make a few appearances. This ''Nancy Drew'' series was again partnered with [[The Hardy Boys (1995 TV series)|a series based on ''The Hardy Boys'']], with Ryan appearing in two episodes of the latter series as Nancy. Both shows were cancelled midway through their first seasons due to low ratings; the poorly syndicated half-hour shows aired in a slot outside of prime time on the newly launched [[The WB]] and [[UPN]] networks.<ref>Kismaric and Heiferman (2007), 122.</ref> The entire series has since been released on DVD, and has appeared on several online streaming sites, including the Retro Rerun YouTube channel.\n\n===== List of episodes =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Titles and publication dates\n|-\n! #\n!

The movie was intended to be a pilot for a possible weekly series, which saw Nancy and her friends going off to college in a modern setting, and Nancy pursuing a journalism degree. Like the 1930s films, this pilot also took a more mature turn, with the mystery being a drug bust, and Nancy having a falling out with her father. The pilot aired as part of ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' series, with additional scripts being ordered and production contingent on the movie's ratings and reception. The series was passed at ABC, and [[UPN]] also passed following Lawson being cast on another ABC series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/12/13/tem_1213robbie.html|author=Harris, Beth|title=No mystery: Actress detects similarity with Nancy Drew|date=December 13, 2002|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>\n\n====''Nancy Drew'' (2019 TV series)====\n{{main|Nancy Drew (2019 TV series)}}\n\nIn October 2018, [[The CW]] announced that [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Stephanie Savage]] were developing a new ''Nancy Drew'' series.

Del Col has been a lifelong fan of the characters and was successful in working with Simon & Schuster to secure the comic book rights and then pitch to publishers.\n \nInspired by Archie Comics\u2019 ''Afterlife with Archie'', Del Col is quoted as saying, \u201cSo, then I started to think, 'Huh, I wonder what other characters are out there that are well-known that could be rebooted like that,'\" Del Col said. \"That's when I started to look around and I looked in some properties, and then I thought, 'Wait a minute. Nancy Drew. Hardy Boys. Oh, that would be really cool to do a hard-boiled noir take on them.' \u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2017/03/nancy_drew_the_hardy_boys_and.html|title=Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys and writer Anthony Del Col's big play in 'The Big Lie'|publisher=}}</ref>\n \nThe series, a hardboiled noir take on the characters, finds characters Frank and Joe Hardy accused of murdering their father, Fenton Hardy, and turning to a femme fatale-esque Nancy Drew to clear their names. The series features artwork by Italian artist Werther Dell\u2019Ederra with covers by UK artist Fay Dalton. Del Col credits editors Matt Idelson and Matt Humphreys with helping him shape the direction of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/03/09/writers-commentary-anthony-del-col-nancy-drew-hardy-boys-big-lie-1/|title=Writer's Commentary - Anthony Del Col On Nancy Drew And The Hardy Boys: The Big Lie #1 - Bleeding Cool News And Rumors|date=9 March 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n \nThe series debuted to positive reviews, with praise going towards its noir-themed tone. Comics blog Readingwithaflightring.com declared it, \u201cthe best 'modern' approach to updating a franchise like this that I\u2019ve seen.

[[Parker Brothers]] produced a \"Nancy Drew Mystery Game\" in 1957 with the approval of the [[Stratemeyer Syndicate]]. In 1967 [[Alexander Doll Company|Madame Alexander]] produced a Nancy Drew doll. The doll carried binoculars and camera and was available in two outfits: with a plaid coat or a dress and short jacket. [[Harriet Adams]] disapproved of the doll's design, believing Nancy's face to be too childish, but the doll was marketed nonetheless. Various Nancy Drew coloring, activity, and puzzle books have also been published, as has a Nancy Drew puzzle. A Nancy Drew Halloween costume and a Nancy Drew lunchbox were produced in the 1970s as television show tie-ins.<ref>Plunkett-Powell (1993), 158\u2013167.</ref>\n\n== Cultural impact ==\nAccording to commentators, the cultural impact of Nancy Drew has been enormous.<ref>Among critics making this claim are Billman, Caprio, Dyer and Romalov, Inness, Kismaric and Heiferman, Macleod, Mason, Nash, Plunkett-Powell, and Rehak.</ref> The immediate success of the series led directly to the creation of numerous other girls' mysteries series, such as [[The Dana Girls]] mystery stories and the [[Kay Tracey]] mystery stories,<ref>Rehak (2006), 162.</ref> and the phenomenal sales of the character Edward Stratemeyer feared was \"too flip\" encouraged publishers to market many other girls' mystery series, such as the [[Judy Bolton Series]], and to request authors of series such as the [[Cherry Ames]] Nurse Stories to incorporate mystery elements into their works.<ref>Billman (1986), 8.</ref>\n\nMany prominent and successful women cite Nancy Drew as an early formative influence whose character encouraged them to take on unconventional roles, including [[U.S. Supreme Court]] Justices [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Sonia Sotomayor]];<ref>Weiss (2009).</ref> TV personalities [[Oprah Winfrey]] and [[Barbara Walters]]; singers [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Beverly Sills]];<ref name=\"Shulman\">Shulman (2007).</ref> mystery authors [[Sara Paretsky]] and [[Nancy Pickard]]; scholar [[Carolyn Heilbrun]]; actresses [[Ellen Barkin]] and [[Emma Roberts]];<ref>http://www.nancydrewsleuth.com/PRESSKIT-Factoids2.pdf</ref> former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]]; former [[First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]];<ref name=\"Burrell\" /> and former president of the [[National Organization for Women]] [[Karen DeCrow]].<ref>Rehak (2006), xii.</ref> Less prominent women also credit the character of Nancy Drew with helping them to become stronger women; when the first Nancy Drew conference was held, at the [[University of Iowa]], in 1993, conference organizers received a flood of calls from women who \"all had stories to tell about how instrumental Nancy had been in their lives, and about how she had inspired, comforted, entertained them through their childhoods, and, for a surprising number of women, well into adulthood.\"<ref>Nancy Tillman Romalov, quoted in Knowlton (1995), 21.</ref>\n\nNancy Drew's popularity continues unabated: in 2002, the first Nancy Drew book published, ''[[The Secret of the Old Clock]]'', alone sold 150,000 copies,<ref name=\"Eveld\">Eveld (2004).</ref> good enough for top-50 ranking in children's books,<ref>Strauss (2004).</ref> and other books in the series sold over 100,000 copies each.<ref>Leibrock (2004).</ref> Sales of the hardcover volumes of the original Nancy Drew series alone has surpassed sales of [[Agatha Christie]] titles,<ref>Paretsky (1991), i.</ref> and newer titles in the [[Girl Detective]] series have reached ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller lists.<ref name=\"Eveld\" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked her seventeenth on its list of \"The Top 20 Heroes\" ahead of [[Batman]], explaining that Drew is the \"first female hero embraced by most little girls ... [Nancy lives] in an endless summer of never-ending adventures and unlimited potential.\" The magazine goes on to cite ''[[Scooby-Doo]]''{{'}}s [[Velma Dinkley]] as well as [[Veronica Mars (character)|Veronica Mars]] as Nancy Drew's \"copycat descendants\".<ref name=\"EW\" />\n\nMany [[feminist]] critics have pondered the reason for the character's iconic status. Nancy's car, and her skill in driving and repairing it, are often cited. Melanie Rehak points to Nancy's famous blue roadster (now a blue [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]]) as a symbol of \"ultimate freedom and independence\".<ref name=\"Shulman\" /> Not only does Nancy have the freedom to go where she pleases (a freedom other, similar characters such as [[The Dana Girls]] do not have), but she is also able to change a tire and fix a flawed distributor, prompting Paretsky to argue that in \"a nation where car mechanics still mock or brush off complaints by women Nancy remains a significant role model.\"<ref>Paretsky (1991), ii.</ref>\n\nNancy is also treated with respect: her decisions are rarely questioned and she is trusted by those around her. Male authority figures believe her statements, and neither her father nor Hannah Gruen, the motherly housekeeper, \"place ... restrictions on her comings and goings.\"<ref>Paretsky (1991), iii.</ref> Nancy's father not only imposes no restrictions on his daughter, but trusts her both with her own car and his gun (in the original version of ''[[The Hidden Staircase]]'' [1930]), asks her advice on a frequent basis, and accedes to all her requests. Some critics, such as Betsy Caprio and Ilana Nash, argue that Nancy's relationship with her continually approving father is satisfying to girl readers because it allows them to vicariously experience a fulfilled [[Electra complex]].<ref>Caprio (1992); Nash (2006), passim.</ref>\n\nUnlike other girl detectives, Nancy does not go to school (for reasons that are never explained, but assuming because she has finished), and she thus has complete autonomy. Similar characters, such as [[Kay Tracey]], do go to school, and not only lose a degree of independence but also of authority. The fact of a character's being a school-girl reminds \"the reader, however fleetingly, of the prosaic realities of high-school existence, which rarely includes high adventures or an authoritative voice in the world of adults.\"<ref>Macleod (1995), 33.</ref>\n\nSome see in Nancy's adventures a mythic quality. Nancy often explores secret passages, prompting [[Nancy Pickard]] to argue that Nancy Drew is a figure equivalent to the ancient Sumerian deity [[Inanna]] and that Nancy's \"journeys into the 'underground{{'\"}} are, in psychological terms, explorations of the unconscious.<ref>Pickard (1991), iii.</ref> Nancy is a heroic figure, undertaking her adventures not for the sake of adventure alone, but in order to help others, particularly the disadvantaged. For this reason, Nancy Drew has been called the modern embodiment of the character of \"Good Deeds\" in [[Everyman]].<ref>Lundin (2003), 123.</ref>\n\nIn the end, many critics<ref>See also Mason (1995), 49; Nash (2006), 29\u201330; O'Rourke (2004).</ref> agree that at least part of Nancy Drew's popularity depends on the way in which the books and the character combine sometimes contradictory values, with Kathleen Chamberlain writing in ''The Secrets of Nancy Drew'': \"For over 60 years, the Nancy Drew series has told readers that they can have the benefits of both dependence and independence without the drawbacks, that they can help the disadvantaged and remain successful capitalists, that they can be both elitist and democratic, that they can be both child and adult, and that they can be both 'liberated' women and Daddy's little girls.\"<ref>Chamberlain (1994), 3.</ref> As another critic puts it, \"Nancy Drew 'solved' the contradiction of competing discourses about American womanhood by entertaining them all.\"<ref>Siegel (1997), 171.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Judy Bolton Series]]\n* [[Trixie Belden]]\n{{Portalbar|Children and Young Adult

Often, its operation can be thought of as revealing the internal structure of the data in a way that best explains the variance in the data. If a [[multivariate dataset]] is visualised as a set of coordinates in a high-[[Dimension (metadata)|dimensional]] data space (1 axis per variable), PCA can supply the user with a lower-dimensional picture, a projection of this object when viewed from its most informative viewpoint.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is done by using only the first few principal components so that the dimensionality of the transformed data is reduced.\n\nPCA is closely related to [[factor analysis]].  Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix.\n\nPCA is also related to [[Canonical correlation|canonical correlation analysis (CCA)]]. CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new [[orthogonal coordinate system]] that optimally describes variance in a single dataset.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Barnett, T.

If some axis of the ellipsoid is small, then the variance along that axis is also small, and by omitting that axis and its corresponding principal component from our representation of the dataset, we lose only an equally small amount of information.\n\nTo find the axes of the ellipsoid, we must first subtract the mean of each variable from the dataset to center the data around the origin. Then, we compute the [[covariance matrix]] of the data and calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix. Then we must normalize each of the orthogonal eigenvectors to become unit vectors. Once this is done, each of the mutually orthogonal, unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data. This choice of basis will transform our covariance matrix into a diagonalised form with the diagonal elements representing the variance of each axis. The proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues.\n\nThis procedure is sensitive to the scaling of the data, and there is no consensus as to how to best scale the data to obtain optimal results.{{Citation needed|reason=This contradicts the earlier instruction about normalization. It seems like a bomb drop in a section about central concepts that should be intuitive.|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Details ==\nPCA is defined as an [[orthogonal transformation|orthogonal]] [[linear transformation]] that transforms the data to a new [[coordinate system]] such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.<ref name=\"Principal Component Analysis\" />\n\nConsider a data [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], '''X''', with column-wise zero [[empirical mean]] (the sample mean of each column has been shifted to zero), where each of the ''n'' rows represents a different repetition of the experiment, and each of the ''p'' columns gives a particular kind of feature (say, the results from a particular sensor).\n\nMathematically, the transformation is defined by a set of ''p''-dimensional vectors of weights or coefficients <math>\\mathbf{w}_{(k)} = (w_1, \\dots, w_p)_{(k)} </math> that map each row vector <math>\\mathbf{x}_{(i)}</math> of '''X''' to a new vector of principal component ''scores'' <math>\\mathbf{t}_{(i)} = (t_1, \\dots, t_l)_{(i)}</math>, given by\n\n:<math>{t_{k}}_{(i)} = \\mathbf{x}_{(i)} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}_{(k)} \\qquad \\mathrm{for} \\qquad i = 1,\\dots,n \\qquad k = 1,\\dots,l </math>\nin such a way that the individual variables <math>t_1, \\dots, t_l</math> of '''t''' considered over the data set successively inherit the maximum possible variance from '''X''', with each coefficient vector '''w''' constrained to be a [[unit vector]] (where <math>l</math> is usually selected to be less than <math>p</math> to reduce dimensionality).\n\n=== First component ===\nIn order to maximize variance, the first weight vector '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> thus has to satisfy\n:<math>\\mathbf{w}_{(1)}\n = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\,\\left\\{ \\sum_i \\left(t_1\\right)^2_{(i)} \\right\\}\n = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\,\\left\\{ \\sum_i \\left(\\mathbf{x}_{(i)} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} \\right)^2 \\right\\}</math>\n\nEquivalently, writing this in matrix form gives\n:<math>\\mathbf{w}_{(1)}\n = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\, \\{ \\Vert \\mathbf{Xw} \\Vert^2 \\}\n = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\, \\left\\{ \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{X^T} \\mathbf{X w} \\right\\}</math>\n\nSince '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> has been defined to be a unit vector, it equivalently also satisfies\n:<math>\\mathbf{w}_{(1)} = {\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\, \\left\\{ \\frac{\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{X^T} \\mathbf{X w}}{\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{w}} \\right\\}</math>\n\nThe quantity to be maximised can be recognised as a [[Rayleigh quotient]]. A standard result for a [[positive semidefinite matrix]] such as  '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' is that the quotient's maximum possible value is the largest [[eigenvalue]] of the matrix, which occurs when '''''w''''' is the corresponding [[eigenvector]].\n\nWith '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> found, the first principal component of a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> can then be given as a score ''t''<sub>1(''i'')</sub> = '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> in the transformed co-ordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the original variables, {'''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub>} '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub>.\n\n=== Further components ===\nThe ''k''th component can be found by subtracting the first ''k''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 principal components from '''X''':\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} = \\mathbf{X} - \\sum_{s = 1}^{k - 1} \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}_{(s)} \\mathbf{w}_{(s)}^{\\rm T} </math>\n\nand then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix\n:<math>\\mathbf{w}_{(k)} = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\left\\{ \\Vert \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} \\mathbf{w} \\Vert^2 \\right\\} = {\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\, \\left\\{ \\tfrac{\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k}^T \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} \\mathbf{w}}{\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{w}} \\right\\}</math>\n\nIt turns out that this gives the remaining eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', with the maximum values for the quantity in brackets given by their corresponding eigenvalues. Thus the weight vectors are eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nThe ''k''th principal component of a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> can therefore be given as a score ''t''<sub>''k''(''i'')</sub> = '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> in the transformed co-ordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the space of the original variables, {'''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>} '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>, where '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> is the ''k''th eigenvector of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nThe full principal components decomposition of '''X''' can therefore be given as\n:<math>\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}</math>\nwhere '''W''' is a ''p''-by-''p'' matrix of weights whose columns are the eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.  The transpose of '''W''' is sometimes called the [[whitening transformation|whitening or sphering transformation]]. Columns of '''W''' multiplied by the square root of corresponding eigenvalues, that is, eigenvectors scaled up by the variances, are called ''loadings'' in PCA or in Factor analysis.\n\n=== Covariances ===\n'''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' itself can be recognised as proportional to the empirical sample [[covariance matrix]] of the dataset '''X<sup>T</sup>'''.\n\nThe sample covariance ''Q'' between two of the different principal components over the dataset is given by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nQ(\\mathrm{PC}_{(j)}, \\mathrm{PC}_{(k)}) & \\propto (\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}_{(j)})^T (\\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{w}_{(k)}) \\\\\n& = \\mathbf{w}_{(j)}^T \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}_{(k)} \\\\\n& = \\mathbf{w}_{(j)}^T \\lambda_{(k)} \\mathbf{w}_{(k)} \\\\\n& = \\lambda_{(k)} \\mathbf{w}_{(j)}^T \\mathbf{w}_{(k)}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the eigenvalue property of '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> has been used to move from line 2 to line 3.  However eigenvectors '''w'''<sub>(''j'')</sub> and '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> corresponding to eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal (if the eigenvalues are different), or can be orthogonalised (if the vectors happen to share an equal repeated value).  The product in the final line is therefore zero; there is no sample covariance between different principal components over the dataset.\n\nAnother way to characterise the principal components transformation is therefore as the transformation to coordinates which diagonalise the empirical sample covariance matrix.\n\nIn matrix form, the empirical covariance matrix for the original variables can be written\n:<math>\\mathbf{Q} \\propto \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\mathbf{W}^T</math>\n\nThe empirical covariance matrix between the principal components becomes\n:<math>\\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{W} \\propto \\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W} \\, \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\, \\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W}\n=  \\mathbf{\\Lambda} </math>\n\nwhere '''\u039b''' is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''. \u03bb<sub>(k)</sub> is equal to the sum of the squares over the dataset associated with each component ''k'', that is, ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> = \u03a3<sub>''i''</sub> ''t''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>2</sup><sub>(''i'')</sub> = \u03a3<sub>''i''</sub> ('''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>)<sup>2</sup>.\n\n=== Dimensionality reduction ===\nThe transformation '''T''' = '''X''' '''W''' maps a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> from an original space of ''p'' variables to a new space of ''p'' variables which are uncorrelated over the dataset.  However, not all the principal components need to be kept.  Keeping only the first ''L'' principal components, produced by using only the first ''L'' eigenvectors, gives the truncated transformation\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{T}_L = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_L</math>\n\nwhere the matrix '''T'''<sub>L</sub> now has ''n'' rows but only ''L'' columns. In other words, PCA learns a linear transformation <math> t = W^T x, x \\in R^p, t \\in R^L,</math> where the columns of {{math|''p'' \u00d7 ''L''}} matrix ''W'' form an orthogonal basis for the ''L'' features (the components of representation ''t'') that are decorrelated.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Bengio, Y.|year=2013|title=Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1798\u20131828 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2013.50|pmid=23787338|display-authors=etal|arxiv=1206.5538}}</ref> By construction, of all the transformed data matrices with only ''L'' columns, this score matrix maximises the variance in the original data that has been preserved, while minimising the total squared reconstruction error <math>\\|\\mathbf{T}\\mathbf{W}^T - \\mathbf{T}_L\\mathbf{W}^T_L\\|_2^2</math> or <math>\\|\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{X}_L\\|_2^2</math>.\n\n[[File:PCA of Haplogroup J using 37 STRs.png|thumb|right|A principal components analysis scatterplot of [[Y-STR]] [[haplotype]]s calculated from repeat-count values for 37 Y-chromosomal STR markers from 354 individuals.<br />  PCA has successfully found linear combinations of the different markers, that separate out different clusters corresponding to different lines of individuals' Y-chromosomal genetic descent.]]\nSuch [[dimensionality reduction]] can be a very useful step for visualising and processing high-dimensional datasets, while still retaining as much of the variance in the dataset as possible.  For example, selecting ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 and keeping only the first two principal components finds the two-dimensional plane through the high-dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out, so if the data contains [[Cluster analysis|clusters]] these too may be most spread out, and therefore most visible to be plotted out in a two-dimensional diagram; whereas if two directions through the data (or two of the original variables) are chosen at random, the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other, and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other, making them indistinguishable.\n\nSimilarly, in [[regression analysis]], the larger the number of [[explanatory variable]]s allowed, the greater is the chance of [[overfitting]] the model, producing conclusions that fail to generalise to other datasets.  One approach, especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables, is to reduce them to a few principal components and then run the regression against them, a method called [[principal component regression]].\n\nDimensionality reduction may also be appropriate when the variables in a dataset are noisy.  If each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed Gaussian noise, then the columns of '''T''' will also contain similarly identically distributed Gaussian noise (such a distribution is invariant under the effects of the matrix '''W''', which can be thought of as a high-dimensional rotation of the co-ordinate axes).  However, with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance, the proportionate effect of the noise is less\u2014the first few components achieve a higher [[signal-to-noise ratio]].  PCA thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components, which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction; while the later principal components may be dominated by noise, and so disposed of without great loss.\n\n=== Singular value decomposition ===\nThe principal components transformation can also be associated with another matrix factorization, the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) of '''X''',\n:<math>\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T</math>\nHere '''\u03a3''' is an ''n''-by-''p'' [[Diagonal matrix|rectangular diagonal matrix]] of positive numbers ''\u03c3''<sub>(''k'')</sub>, called the singular values of '''X'''; '''U''' is an ''n''-by-''n'' matrix, the columns of which are orthogonal unit vectors of length ''n'' called the left singular vectors of '''X'''; and '''W''' is a ''p''-by-''p'' whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors of length ''p'' and called the right singular vectors of '''X'''.\n\nIn terms of this factorization, the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' can be written\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T \\\\\n                       & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{W}^T \\\\\n                       & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}}^2 \\mathbf{W}^T\n\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ''' <math> \\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}} </math>''' is the square diagonal matrix with the singular values of ''' X ''' and the excess zeros chopped off that satisfies ''' <math> \\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}^2}=\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma} </math>'''. Comparison with the eigenvector factorization of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' establishes that the right singular vectors '''W''' of '''X''' are equivalent to the eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', while the singular values ''\u03c3''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of ''' <math> \\mathbf{{X}}</math>''' are equal to the square-root of the eigenvalues ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nUsing the singular value decomposition the score matrix '''T''' can be written\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{T} & = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W} \\\\\n           & = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W} \\\\\n           & = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\n\\end{align}</math>\nso each column of '''T''' is given by one of the left singular vectors of '''X''' multiplied by the corresponding singular value. This form is also the [[polar decomposition]] of '''T'''.\n\nEfficient algorithms exist to calculate the SVD of '''X''' without having to form the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', so computing the SVD is now the standard way to calculate a principal components analysis from a data matrix{{citation needed|reason=A reference to SVD algorithms that outperform eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is needed, particularly in cases where n is greater than p|date=August 2014}}, unless only a handful of components are required.\n\nAs with the eigen-decomposition, a truncated {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''L''}} score matrix '''T'''<sub>L</sub> can be obtained by considering only the first L largest singular values and their singular vectors:\n:<math>\\mathbf{T}_L = \\mathbf{U}_L\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_L = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_L </math>\nThe truncation of a matrix '''M''' or '''T''' using a truncated singular value decomposition in this way produces a truncated matrix that is the nearest possible matrix of [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] ''L'' to the original matrix, in the sense of the difference between the two having the smallest possible [[Frobenius norm]], a result known as the Eckart\u2013Young theorem [1936].\n\n== Further considerations ==\n\nGiven a set of points in [[Euclidean space]], the first principal component corresponds to a line that passes through the multidimensional mean and minimizes the sum of squares of the distances of the points from the line. The second principal component corresponds to the same concept after all correlation with the first principal component has been subtracted from the points. The singular values (in '''\u03a3''') are the square roots of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''. Each eigenvalue is proportional to the portion of the \"variance\" (more correctly of the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean) that is associated with each eigenvector. The sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean. PCA essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the principal components. This moves as much of the variance as possible (using an orthogonal transformation) into the first few dimensions. The values in the remaining dimensions, therefore, tend to be small and may be dropped with minimal loss of information (see [[Principle Component Analysis#PCA and information theory|below]]). PCA is often used in this manner for [[dimensionality reduction]]. PCA has the distinction of being the optimal orthogonal transformation for keeping the subspace that has largest \"variance\" (as defined above). This advantage, however, comes at the price of greater computational requirements if compared, for example, and when applicable, to the [[discrete cosine transform]], and in particular to the DCT-II which is simply known as the \"DCT\". [[Nonlinear dimensionality reduction]] techniques tend to be more computationally demanding than PCA.\n\nPCA is sensitive to the scaling of the variables. If we have just two variables and they have the same [[sample variance]] and are positively correlated, then the PCA will entail a rotation by 45\u00b0 and the \"weights\" (they are the cosines of rotation) for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal. But if we multiply all values of the first variable by 100, then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable, with a small contribution from the other variable, whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable. This means that whenever the different variables have different units (like temperature and mass), PCA is a somewhat arbitrary method of analysis. (Different results would be obtained if one used Fahrenheit rather than Celsius for example.) Pearson's original paper was entitled \"On Lines and Planes of Closest Fit to Systems of Points in Space\" \u2013 \"in space\" implies physical Euclidean space where such concerns do not arise. One way of making the PCA less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance, by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as a basis for PCA. However, this compresses (or expands) the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance.\n\nMean subtraction (a.k.a. \"mean centering\") is necessary for performing classical PCA to ensure that the first principal component describes the direction of maximum variance. If mean subtraction is not performed, the first principal component might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data. A mean of zero is needed for finding a basis that minimizes the [[Minimum mean square error|mean square error]] of the approximation of the data.<ref>A. A. Miranda, Y. A. Le Borgne, and G. Bontempi. [http://www.ulb.ac.be/di/map/yleborgn/pub/NPL_PCA_07.pdf New Routes from Minimal Approximation Error to Principal Components], Volume 27, Number 3 / June, 2008, Neural Processing Letters, Springer</ref>\n\nMean-centering is unnecessary if performing a principal components analysis on a correlation matrix, as the data are already centered after calculating correlations. Correlations are derived from the cross-product of two standard scores (Z-scores) or statistical moments (hence the name: ''Pearson Product-Moment Correlation''). Also see the article by Kromrey & Foster-Johnson (1998) on ''\"Mean-centering in Moderated Regression: Much Ado About Nothing\".''\n\nPCA is a popular primary technique in [[pattern recognition]].

Because these last PCs have variances as small as possible they are useful in their own right. They can help to detect unsuspected near-constant linear relationships between the elements of {{mvar|x}}, and they may also be useful in [[regression analysis|regression]], in selecting a subset of variables from {{mvar|x}}, and in outlier detection.\n\n:<big>'''''Property 3'':'''</big> (Spectral Decomposition of {{math|'''\u03a3'''}})\n::<math>\\mathbf{{\\Sigma}} = \\lambda_{1}\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{1}' + \\cdots + \\lambda_{p}\\alpha_{p}\\alpha_{p}'</math>\n\nBefore we look at its usage, we first look at [[diagonal]] elements,\n:<math>\\text{Var}(x_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^P \\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{kj}^2</math>\nThen, perhaps the main statistical implication of the result is that not only can we decompose the combined variances of all the elements of {{mvar|x}} into decreasing contributions due to each PC, but we can also decompose the whole [[covariance matrix]] into contributions <math>\\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{k}\\alpha_{k}'</math> from each PC.

This can be cured by scaling each feature by its standard deviation, so that one ends up with dimensionless features with unital variance <ref name=Leznik>Leznik, M; Tofallis, C. 2005 [https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/715/S56.pdf Estimating Invariant Principal Components Using Diagonal Regression.]</ref>\n\nThe applicability of PCA as described above is limited by certain (tacit) assumptions <ref>Jonathon Shlens, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1100 A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis.]</ref> made in its derivation. In particular, PCA can capture linear correlations between the features but fails when this assumption is violated (see Figure 6a in the reference). In some cases, coordinate transformations can restore the linearity assumption and PCA can then be applied (see [[Kernel principal component analysis|kernel PCA]]).\n\nAnother limitation is the mean-removal process before constructing the covariance matrix for PCA. In fields such as astronomy, all the signals are non-negative, and the mean-removal process will force the mean of some astrophysical exposures to be zero, which consequently creates unphysical negative fluxes,<ref name=\"soummer12\"/> and forward modeling has to be performed to recover the true magnitude of the signals.<ref name=\"pueyo16\">{{Cite journal|arxiv= 1604.06097 |last1= Pueyo|first1= Laurent |title= Detection and Characterization of Exoplanets using Projections on Karhunen Loeve Eigenimages: Forward Modeling |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |volume= 824|issue= 2|pages= 117|year= 2016|doi= 10.3847/0004-637X/824/2/117|bibcode = 2016ApJ...824..117P}}</ref> As an alternative method, [[non-negative matrix factorization]] focusing only on the non-negative elements in the matrices, which is well-suited for astrophysical observations.<ref name=\"blantonRoweis07\"/><ref name=\"zhu16\"/><ref name=\"ren18\"/> See more at [[Principal component analysis#Non-negative matrix factorization|Relation between PCA and Non-negative Matrix Factorization]].\n\n=== PCA and information theory ===\nDimensionality reduction loses information, in general.

Ed. Michael I. Jordan, Michael J. Kearns, and Sara A. Solla The MIT Press, 1998.</ref> is shown in the following pseudo-code, for a data matrix {{math|'''X'''}} with zero mean, without ever computing its covariance matrix.\n\n {{math|'''r'''}} = a random vector of length {{mvar|p}}\n {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{|\\mathbf{r}|}</math>}}\n do {{mvar|c}} times:\n       {{math|1='''s''' = 0}} (a vector of length {{mvar|p}})\n       {{nowrap|for each row <math>\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbf{X}</math>}}\n             {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{s} + (\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{x}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>eigenvalue = \\mathbf{r}^T\\mathbf{s}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>error = |eigenvalue\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}|</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{\\mathbf{s}}{|\\mathbf{s}|}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|exit if <math>error < tolerance</math>}}\n return {{nowrap|<math>eigenvalue, \\mathbf{r}</math>}}\n\nThis [[power iteration]] algorithm simply calculates the vector {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X r)'''}}, normalizes, and places the result back in {{math|'''r'''}}. The eigenvalue is approximated by {{math|'''r<sup>T</sup> (X<sup>T</sup>X) r'''}}, which is the [[Rayleigh quotient]] on the unit vector {{math|'''r'''}} for the covariance matrix {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>X '''}}. If the largest singular value is well separated from the next largest one, the vector {{math|'''r'''}} gets close to the first principal component of {{math|'''X'''}} within the number of iterations {{mvar|c}}, which is small relative to {{mvar|p}}, at the total cost {{math|''2cnp''}}. The [[power iteration]] convergence can be accelerated without noticeably sacrificing the small cost per iteration using more advanced [[matrix-free methods]], such as the [[Lanczos algorithm]] or the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient ([[LOBPCG]]) method.\n\nSubsequent principal components can be computed one-by-one via deflation or simultaneously as a block. In the former approach, imprecisions in already computed approximate principal components additively affect the accuracy of the subsequently computed principal components, thus increasing the error with every new computation. The latter approach in the block power method replaces single-vectors {{math|'''r'''}} and {{math|'''s'''}} with block-vectors, matrices {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''S'''}}. Every column of {{math|'''R'''}} approximates one of the leading principal components, while all columns are iterated simultaneously. The main calculation is evaluation of the product {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X R)'''}}. Implemented, for example., in [[LOBPCG]], efficient blocking eliminates the accumulation of the errors, allows using high-level [[BLAS]] matrix-matrix product functions, and typically leads to faster convergence, compared to the single-vector one-by-one technique.\n\n=== The NIPALS method ===\n''Non-linear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS)'' is a variant the classical [[power iteration]] with matrix deflation by subtraction implemented for computing the first few components in a principal component or [[partial least squares]] analysis. For very-high-dimensional datasets, such as those generated in the *omics sciences (for example, [[genomics]], [[metabolomics]]) it is usually only necessary to compute the first few PCs. The [[non-linear iterative partial least squares]] (NIPALS) algorithm updates iterative approximations to the leading scores and loadings '''t<sub>1</sub>''' and '''r<sub>1</sub>'''<sup>T</sup> by the [[power iteration]] multiplying on every iteration by '''X''' on the left and on the right, that is, calculation of the covariance matrix is avoided, just as in the matrix-free implementation of the power iterations to {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>X'''}}, based on the function evaluating the product {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X r)'''}} = {{math|'''((X r)<sup>T</sup>X)<sup>T</sup>'''}}.\n\nThe matrix deflation by subtraction is performed by subtracting the outer product, '''t<sub>1</sub>r<sub>1</sub>'''<sup>T</sup> from '''X''' leaving the deflated residual matrix used to calculate the subsequent leading PCs.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Geladi\n  | first = Paul\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 = Kowalski\n  | first2 = Bruce\n  | author2-link =\n  | title = Partial Least Squares Regression:A Tutorial\n  | journal = Analytica Chimica Acta\n  | volume = 185\n  | issue =\n  | pages = 1\u201317\n  | year = 1986\n  | url =\n  | doi = 10.1016/0003-2670(86)80028-9\n  | id = }}</ref> \nFor large data matrices, or matrices that have a high degree of column collinearity, NIPALS suffers from loss of orthogonality of PCs due to machine precision [[round-off errors]] accumulated in each iteration and matrix deflation by subtraction.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kramer |first=R. |year=1998 |title=Chemometric Techniques for Quantitative Analysis |publisher=CRC Press |location=New York |isbn= 9780203909805|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBpOzwAOfHYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> A [[Gram\u2013Schmidt]] re-orthogonalization algorithm is applied to both the scores and the loadings at each iteration step to eliminate this loss of orthogonality.<ref>{{cite journal |first=M. |last=Andrecut |title=Parallel GPU Implementation of Iterative PCA Algorithms |journal=Journal of Computational Biology |volume=16 |issue=11 |year=2009 |pages=1593\u20131599 |doi=10.1089/cmb.2008.0221 |pmid=19772385 |arxiv=0811.1081 }}</ref> NIPALS reliance on single-vector multiplications cannot take advantage of high-level [[BLAS]] and results in slow convergence for clustered leading singular values\u2014both these deficiencies are resolved in more sophisticated matrix-free block solvers, such as the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient ([[LOBPCG]]) method.\n\n=== Online/sequential estimation ===\nIn an \"online\" or \"streaming\" situation with data arriving piece by piece rather than being stored in a single batch, it is useful to make an estimate of the PCA projection that can be updated sequentially.

For example, many quantitative variables have been measured on plants. For these plants, some qualitative variables are available as, for example, the species to which the plant belongs. These data were subjected to PCA for quantitative variables. When analyzing the results, it is natural to connect the principal components to the qualitative variable ''species''.\nFor this, the following results are produced.\n* Identification, on the factorial planes, of the different species, for example, using different colors.\n* Representation, on the factorial planes, of the centers of gravity of plants belonging to the same species.\n* For each center of gravity and each axis,  p-value to judge the significance of the difference between the center of gravity and origin.\n\nThese results are what is called ''introducing a qualitative variable as supplementary element''. This procedure is detailed in and Husson, L\u00ea & Pag\u00e8s 2009 and Pag\u00e8s 2013.\nFew software offer this option in an \"automatic\" way. This is the case of [http://www.coheris.com/produits/analytics/logiciel-data-mining/ SPAD] that historically, following the work of [[Ludovic Lebart]], was the first to propose this option, and the R package [http://factominer.free.fr/ FactoMineR].\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Quantitative finance ===\n{{See also|Portfolio optimization}}\nIn [[quantitative finance]], principal component analysis can be directly applied to the [[risk management]] of [[interest rate derivative]] portfolios.<ref name=PHIRS>[http://www.tradinginterestrates.com The Pricing and Hedging of Interest Rate Derivatives: A Practical Guide to Swaps], J H M Darbyshire, 2016, {{isbn|978-0995455511}}</ref> Trading multiple [[swap (finance)|swap instruments]] which are usually a function of 30-500 other market quotable swap instruments is sought to be reduced to usually 3 or 4 principal components, representing the path of interest rates on a macro basis.

(2000).</ref> This technique is known as [[Spike-triggered covariance|spike-triggered covariance analysis]]. In a typical application an experimenter presents a [[white noise]] process as a stimulus (usually either as a sensory input to a test subject, or as a [[Electric current|current]] injected directly into the neuron) and records a train of action potentials, or spikes, produced by the neuron as a result. Presumably, certain features of the stimulus make the neuron more likely to spike. In order to extract these features, the experimenter calculates the [[covariance matrix]] of the ''spike-triggered ensemble'', the set of all stimuli (defined and discretized over a finite time window, typically on the order of 100 ms) that immediately preceded a spike. The [[Eigenvectors and eigenvalues|eigenvectors]] of the difference between the spike-triggered covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the ''prior stimulus ensemble'' (the set of all stimuli, defined over the same length time window) then indicate the directions in the [[Vector space|space]] of stimuli along which the variance of the spike-triggered ensemble differed the most from that of the prior stimulus ensemble. Specifically, the eigenvectors with the largest positive eigenvalues correspond to the directions along which the variance of the spike-triggered ensemble showed the largest positive change compared to the variance of the prior. Since these were the directions in which varying the stimulus led to a spike, they are often good approximations of the sought after relevant stimulus features.\n\nIn neuroscience, PCA is also used to discern the identity of a neuron from the shape of its action potential. [[Spike sorting]] is an important procedure because [[Electrophysiology#Extracellular recording|extracellular]] recording techniques often pick up signals from more than one neuron. In spike sorting, one first uses PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the space of action potential waveforms, and then performs [[Cluster analysis|clustering analysis]] to associate specific action potentials with individual neurons.\n\nPCA as a dimension reduction technique is particularly suited to detect coordinated activities of large neuronal ensembles. It has been used in determining collective variables, that is, [[order parameters]], during [[phase transitions]] in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jirsa|first1=Victor|last2=Friedrich|first2=R|last3=Haken|first3=Herman|last4=Kelso|first4=Scott|title=A theoretical model of phase transitions in the human brain|journal=Biological Cybernetics|date=1994|volume=71|issue=1|pages=27\u201335|doi=10.1007/bf00198909|pmid=8054384}}</ref>\n\n== Relation with other methods ==\n\n=== Correspondence analysis ===\n\n[[Correspondence analysis]] (CA)\nwas developed by [[Jean-Paul Benz\u00e9cri]]<ref>{{Cite book\n | author = Benz\u00e9cri, J.-P.\n | publisher=Dunod |location= Paris, France\n | year = 1973\n | title = L'Analyse des Donn\u00e9es.

The new variables have the property that the variables are all orthogonal. The PCA transformation can be helpful as a pre-processing step before clustering. PCA is a variance-focused approach seeking to reproduce the total variable variance, in which components reflect both common and unique variance of the variable. PCA is generally preferred for purposes of data reduction (that is, translating variable space into optimal factor space) but not when the goal is to detect the latent construct or factors.\n\n[[Factor analysis]] is similar to principal component analysis, in that factor analysis also involves linear combinations of variables. Different from PCA, factor analysis is a correlation-focused approach seeking to reproduce the inter-correlations among variables, in which the factors \"represent the common variance of variables, excluding unique variance\".<ref>Timothy A. Brown. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDb3BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Confirmatory Factor Analysis for Applied Research Methodology in the social sciences]. Guilford Press, 2006</ref> In terms of the correlation matrix, this corresponds with focusing on explaining the off-diagonal terms (that is, shared co-variance), while PCA focuses on explaining the terms that sit on the diagonal. However, as a side result, when trying to reproduce the on-diagonal terms, PCA also tends to fit relatively well the off-diagonal correlations.<ref>I.T. Jolliffe. Principal Component Analysis, Second Edition. Chapter 7. 2002</ref> Results given by PCA and factor analysis are very similar in most situations, but this is not always the case, and there are some problems where the results are significantly different.

Repeating this process yields an [[orthogonal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in which different individual dimensions of the data are uncorrelated.

Often, its operation can be thought of as revealing the internal structure of the data in a way that best explains the variance in the data. If a [[multivariate dataset]] is visualised as a set of coordinates in a high-[[Dimension (metadata)|dimensional]] data space (1 axis per variable), PCA can supply the user with a lower-dimensional picture, a projection of this object when viewed from its most informative viewpoint.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is done by using only the first few principal components so that the dimensionality of the transformed data is reduced.\n\nPCA is closely related to [[factor analysis]].  Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix.\n\nPCA is also related to [[Canonical correlation|canonical correlation analysis (CCA)]]. CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new [[orthogonal coordinate system]] that optimally describes variance in a single dataset.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Barnett, T.

If some axis of the ellipsoid is small, then the variance along that axis is also small, and by omitting that axis and its corresponding principal component from our representation of the dataset, we lose only an equally small amount of information.\n\nTo find the axes of the ellipsoid, we must first subtract the mean of each variable from the dataset to center the data around the origin. Then, we compute the [[covariance matrix]] of the data and calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix. Then we must normalize each of the orthogonal eigenvectors to become unit vectors. Once this is done, each of the mutually orthogonal, unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data. This choice of basis will transform our covariance matrix into a diagonalised form with the diagonal elements representing the variance of each axis. The proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues.\n\nThis procedure is sensitive to the scaling of the data, and there is no consensus as to how to best scale the data to obtain optimal results.{{Citation needed|reason=This contradicts the earlier instruction about normalization.

A standard result for a [[positive semidefinite matrix]] such as  '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' is that the quotient's maximum possible value is the largest [[eigenvalue]] of the matrix, which occurs when '''''w''''' is the corresponding [[eigenvector]].\n\nWith '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> found, the first principal component of a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> can then be given as a score ''t''<sub>1(''i'')</sub> = '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub> in the transformed co-ordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the original variables, {'''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub>} '''w'''<sub>(1)</sub>.\n\n=== Further components ===\nThe ''k''th component can be found by subtracting the first ''k''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 principal components from '''X''':\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} = \\mathbf{X} - \\sum_{s = 1}^{k - 1} \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w}_{(s)} \\mathbf{w}_{(s)}^{\\rm T} </math>\n\nand then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix\n:<math>\\mathbf{w}_{(k)} = \\underset{\\Vert \\mathbf{w} \\Vert = 1}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\left\\{ \\Vert \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} \\mathbf{w} \\Vert^2 \\right\\} = {\\operatorname{\\arg\\,max}}\\, \\left\\{ \\tfrac{\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k}^T \\mathbf{\\hat{X}}_{k} \\mathbf{w}}{\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{w}} \\right\\}</math>\n\nIt turns out that this gives the remaining eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', with the maximum values for the quantity in brackets given by their corresponding eigenvalues. Thus the weight vectors are eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nThe ''k''th principal component of a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> can therefore be given as a score ''t''<sub>''k''(''i'')</sub> = '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> in the transformed co-ordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the space of the original variables, {'''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>} '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>, where '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> is the ''k''th eigenvector of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nThe full principal components decomposition of '''X''' can therefore be given as\n:<math>\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}</math>\nwhere '''W''' is a ''p''-by-''p'' matrix of weights whose columns are the eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.  The transpose of '''W''' is sometimes called the [[whitening transformation|whitening or sphering transformation]].

However eigenvectors '''w'''<sub>(''j'')</sub> and '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub> corresponding to eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal (if the eigenvalues are different), or can be orthogonalised (if the vectors happen to share an equal repeated value).  The product in the final line is therefore zero; there is no sample covariance between different principal components over the dataset.\n\nAnother way to characterise the principal components transformation is therefore as the transformation to coordinates which diagonalise the empirical sample covariance matrix.\n\nIn matrix form, the empirical covariance matrix for the original variables can be written\n:<math>\\mathbf{Q} \\propto \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\mathbf{W}^T</math>\n\nThe empirical covariance matrix between the principal components becomes\n:<math>\\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{W} \\propto \\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W} \\, \\mathbf{\\Lambda} \\, \\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W}\n=  \\mathbf{\\Lambda} </math>\n\nwhere '''\u039b''' is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''. \u03bb<sub>(k)</sub> is equal to the sum of the squares over the dataset associated with each component ''k'', that is, ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> = \u03a3<sub>''i''</sub> ''t''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>2</sup><sub>(''i'')</sub> = \u03a3<sub>''i''</sub> ('''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> \u22c5 '''w'''<sub>(''k'')</sub>)<sup>2</sup>.\n\n=== Dimensionality reduction ===\nThe transformation '''T''' = '''X''' '''W''' maps a data vector '''x'''<sub>(''i'')</sub> from an original space of ''p'' variables to a new space of ''p'' variables which are uncorrelated over the dataset.  However, not all the principal components need to be kept.

For example, selecting ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 and keeping only the first two principal components finds the two-dimensional plane through the high-dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out, so if the data contains [[Cluster analysis|clusters]] these too may be most spread out, and therefore most visible to be plotted out in a two-dimensional diagram; whereas if two directions through the data (or two of the original variables) are chosen at random, the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other, and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other, making them indistinguishable.\n\nSimilarly, in [[regression analysis]], the larger the number of [[explanatory variable]]s allowed, the greater is the chance of [[overfitting]] the model, producing conclusions that fail to generalise to other datasets.  One approach, especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables, is to reduce them to a few principal components and then run the regression against them, a method called [[principal component regression]].\n\nDimensionality reduction may also be appropriate when the variables in a dataset are noisy.  If each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed Gaussian noise, then the columns of '''T''' will also contain similarly identically distributed Gaussian noise (such a distribution is invariant under the effects of the matrix '''W''', which can be thought of as a high-dimensional rotation of the co-ordinate axes).  However, with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance, the proportionate effect of the noise is less\u2014the first few components achieve a higher [[signal-to-noise ratio]].  PCA thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components, which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction; while the later principal components may be dominated by noise, and so disposed of without great loss.\n\n=== Singular value decomposition ===\nThe principal components transformation can also be associated with another matrix factorization, the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) of '''X''',\n:<math>\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T</math>\nHere '''\u03a3''' is an ''n''-by-''p'' [[Diagonal matrix|rectangular diagonal matrix]] of positive numbers ''\u03c3''<sub>(''k'')</sub>, called the singular values of '''X'''; '''U''' is an ''n''-by-''n'' matrix, the columns of which are orthogonal unit vectors of length ''n'' called the left singular vectors of '''X'''; and '''W''' is a ''p''-by-''p'' whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors of length ''p'' and called the right singular vectors of '''X'''.\n\nIn terms of this factorization, the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' can be written\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{U}^T \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T \\\\\n                       & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{W}^T \\\\\n                       & = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}}^2 \\mathbf{W}^T\n\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ''' <math> \\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}} </math>''' is the square diagonal matrix with the singular values of ''' X ''' and the excess zeros chopped off that satisfies ''' <math> \\mathbf{\\hat{\\Sigma}^2}=\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^T \\mathbf{\\Sigma} </math>'''. Comparison with the eigenvector factorization of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''' establishes that the right singular vectors '''W''' of '''X''' are equivalent to the eigenvectors of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', while the singular values ''\u03c3''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of ''' <math> \\mathbf{{X}}</math>''' are equal to the square-root of the eigenvalues ''\u03bb''<sub>(''k'')</sub> of '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''.\n\nUsing the singular value decomposition the score matrix '''T''' can be written\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{T} & = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W} \\\\\n           & = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{W}^T \\mathbf{W} \\\\\n           & = \\mathbf{U}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\n\\end{align}</math>\nso each column of '''T''' is given by one of the left singular vectors of '''X''' multiplied by the corresponding singular value. This form is also the [[polar decomposition]] of '''T'''.\n\nEfficient algorithms exist to calculate the SVD of '''X''' without having to form the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X''', so computing the SVD is now the standard way to calculate a principal components analysis from a data matrix{{citation needed|reason=A reference to SVD algorithms that outperform eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is needed, particularly in cases where n is greater than p|date=August 2014}}, unless only a handful of components are required.\n\nAs with the eigen-decomposition, a truncated {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''L''}} score matrix '''T'''<sub>L</sub> can be obtained by considering only the first L largest singular values and their singular vectors:\n:<math>\\mathbf{T}_L = \\mathbf{U}_L\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_L = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_L </math>\nThe truncation of a matrix '''M''' or '''T''' using a truncated singular value decomposition in this way produces a truncated matrix that is the nearest possible matrix of [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] ''L'' to the original matrix, in the sense of the difference between the two having the smallest possible [[Frobenius norm]], a result known as the Eckart\u2013Young theorem [1936].\n\n== Further considerations ==\n\nGiven a set of points in [[Euclidean space]], the first principal component corresponds to a line that passes through the multidimensional mean and minimizes the sum of squares of the distances of the points from the line. The second principal component corresponds to the same concept after all correlation with the first principal component has been subtracted from the points. The singular values (in '''\u03a3''') are the square roots of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix '''X'''<sup>T</sup>'''X'''. Each eigenvalue is proportional to the portion of the \"variance\" (more correctly of the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean) that is associated with each eigenvector. The sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean. PCA essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the principal components. This moves as much of the variance as possible (using an orthogonal transformation) into the first few dimensions. The values in the remaining dimensions, therefore, tend to be small and may be dropped with minimal loss of information (see [[Principle Component Analysis#PCA and information theory|below]]). PCA is often used in this manner for [[dimensionality reduction]]. PCA has the distinction of being the optimal orthogonal transformation for keeping the subspace that has largest \"variance\" (as defined above). This advantage, however, comes at the price of greater computational requirements if compared, for example, and when applicable, to the [[discrete cosine transform]], and in particular to the DCT-II which is simply known as the \"DCT\". [[Nonlinear dimensionality reduction]] techniques tend to be more computationally demanding than PCA.\n\nPCA is sensitive to the scaling of the variables. If we have just two variables and they have the same [[sample variance]] and are positively correlated, then the PCA will entail a rotation by 45\u00b0 and the \"weights\" (they are the cosines of rotation) for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal. But if we multiply all values of the first variable by 100, then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable, with a small contribution from the other variable, whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable. This means that whenever the different variables have different units (like temperature and mass), PCA is a somewhat arbitrary method of analysis. (Different results would be obtained if one used Fahrenheit rather than Celsius for example.) Pearson's original paper was entitled \"On Lines and Planes of Closest Fit to Systems of Points in Space\" \u2013 \"in space\" implies physical Euclidean space where such concerns do not arise. One way of making the PCA less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance, by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as a basis for PCA. However, this compresses (or expands) the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance.\n\nMean subtraction (a.k.a. \"mean centering\") is necessary for performing classical PCA to ensure that the first principal component describes the direction of maximum variance. If mean subtraction is not performed, the first principal component might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data.

Then the trace of <math>\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_y</math>, denoted <math>\\text{tr} (\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_y)</math>, is maximized by taking <math>\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{A}_q</math>, where <math>\\mathbf{A}_q</math> consists of the first ''q'' columns of <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> <math>(\\mathbf{B'}</math> is the transposition of <math>\\mathbf{B})</math>.\n\n:<big>'''''Property 2'':'''</big> Consider again the [[orthonormal transformation]]\n::<math>y = \\mathbf{B'}x</math>\n:with <math>x, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{A}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_y</math> defined as before.

Because these last PCs have variances as small as possible they are useful in their own right. They can help to detect unsuspected near-constant linear relationships between the elements of {{mvar|x}}, and they may also be useful in [[regression analysis|regression]], in selecting a subset of variables from {{mvar|x}}, and in outlier detection.\n\n:<big>'''''Property 3'':'''</big> (Spectral Decomposition of {{math|'''\u03a3'''}})\n::<math>\\mathbf{{\\Sigma}} = \\lambda_{1}\\alpha_{1}\\alpha_{1}' + \\cdots + \\lambda_{p}\\alpha_{p}\\alpha_{p}'</math>\n\nBefore we look at its usage, we first look at [[diagonal]] elements,\n:<math>\\text{Var}(x_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^P \\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{kj}^2</math>\nThen, perhaps the main statistical implication of the result is that not only can we decompose the combined variances of all the elements of {{mvar|x}} into decreasing contributions due to each PC, but we can also decompose the whole [[covariance matrix]] into contributions <math>\\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{k}\\alpha_{k}'</math> from each PC. Although not strictly decreasing, the elements of <math>\\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{k}\\alpha_{k}'</math> will tend to become smaller as <math>k</math> increases, as <math>\\lambda_{k}\\alpha_{k}\\alpha_{k}'</math> is nonincreasing for increasing <math>k</math>, whereas the elements of <math>\\alpha_{k}</math> tend to stay about the same size because of the normalization constraints: <math>\\alpha_{k}'\\alpha_{k}=1, k=1,\\cdots, p</math>.\n\n=== Limitations ===\n\nAs noted above, the results of PCA depend on the scaling of the variables. This can be cured by scaling each feature by its standard deviation, so that one ends up with dimensionless features with unital variance <ref name=Leznik>Leznik, M; Tofallis, C. 2005 [https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/715/S56.pdf Estimating Invariant Principal Components Using Diagonal Regression.]</ref>\n\nThe applicability of PCA as described above is limited by certain (tacit) assumptions <ref>Jonathon Shlens, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1100 A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis.]</ref> made in its derivation. In particular, PCA can capture linear correlations between the features but fails when this assumption is violated (see Figure 6a in the reference). In some cases, coordinate transformations can restore the linearity assumption and PCA can then be applied (see [[Kernel principal component analysis|kernel PCA]]).\n\nAnother limitation is the mean-removal process before constructing the covariance matrix for PCA. In fields such as astronomy, all the signals are non-negative, and the mean-removal process will force the mean of some astrophysical exposures to be zero, which consequently creates unphysical negative fluxes,<ref name=\"soummer12\"/> and forward modeling has to be performed to recover the true magnitude of the signals.<ref name=\"pueyo16\">{{Cite journal|arxiv= 1604.06097 |last1= Pueyo|first1= Laurent |title= Detection and Characterization of Exoplanets using Projections on Karhunen Loeve Eigenimages: Forward Modeling |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |volume= 824|issue= 2|pages= 117|year= 2016|doi= 10.3847/0004-637X/824/2/117|bibcode = 2016ApJ...824..117P}}</ref> As an alternative method, [[non-negative matrix factorization]] focusing only on the non-negative elements in the matrices, which is well-suited for astrophysical observations.<ref name=\"blantonRoweis07\"/><ref name=\"zhu16\"/><ref name=\"ren18\"/> See more at [[Principal component analysis#Non-negative matrix factorization|Relation between PCA and Non-negative Matrix Factorization]].\n\n=== PCA and information theory ===\nDimensionality reduction loses information, in general.

The covariance-free approach avoids the {{math|''np''<sup>2</sup>}} operations of explicitly calculating and storing the covariance matrix {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>X'''}}, instead utilizing one of [[matrix-free methods]], for example, based on the function evaluating the product {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X r)'''}} at the cost of {{math|''2np''}} operations.\n\n=== Iterative computation ===\n\nOne way to compute the first principal component efficiently<ref name=\"roweis\">Roweis, Sam. \"EM Algorithms for PCA and SPCA.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. Ed. Michael I. Jordan, Michael J. Kearns, and Sara A. Solla The MIT Press, 1998.</ref> is shown in the following pseudo-code, for a data matrix {{math|'''X'''}} with zero mean, without ever computing its covariance matrix.\n\n {{math|'''r'''}} = a random vector of length {{mvar|p}}\n {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}}{|\\mathbf{r}|}</math>}}\n do {{mvar|c}} times:\n       {{math|1='''s''' = 0}} (a vector of length {{mvar|p}})\n       {{nowrap|for each row <math>\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbf{X}</math>}}\n             {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{s} + (\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{x}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>eigenvalue = \\mathbf{r}^T\\mathbf{s}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>error = |eigenvalue\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{s}|</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|<math>\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{\\mathbf{s}}{|\\mathbf{s}|}</math>}}\n       {{nowrap|exit if <math>error < tolerance</math>}}\n return {{nowrap|<math>eigenvalue, \\mathbf{r}</math>}}\n\nThis [[power iteration]] algorithm simply calculates the vector {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X r)'''}}, normalizes, and places the result back in {{math|'''r'''}}. The eigenvalue is approximated by {{math|'''r<sup>T</sup> (X<sup>T</sup>X) r'''}}, which is the [[Rayleigh quotient]] on the unit vector {{math|'''r'''}} for the covariance matrix {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>X '''}}. If the largest singular value is well separated from the next largest one, the vector {{math|'''r'''}} gets close to the first principal component of {{math|'''X'''}} within the number of iterations {{mvar|c}}, which is small relative to {{mvar|p}}, at the total cost {{math|''2cnp''}}. The [[power iteration]] convergence can be accelerated without noticeably sacrificing the small cost per iteration using more advanced [[matrix-free methods]], such as the [[Lanczos algorithm]] or the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient ([[LOBPCG]]) method.\n\nSubsequent principal components can be computed one-by-one via deflation or simultaneously as a block. In the former approach, imprecisions in already computed approximate principal components additively affect the accuracy of the subsequently computed principal components, thus increasing the error with every new computation. The latter approach in the block power method replaces single-vectors {{math|'''r'''}} and {{math|'''s'''}} with block-vectors, matrices {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''S'''}}. Every column of {{math|'''R'''}} approximates one of the leading principal components, while all columns are iterated simultaneously. The main calculation is evaluation of the product {{math|'''X<sup>T</sup>(X R)'''}}.

For example, many quantitative variables have been measured on plants. For these plants, some qualitative variables are available as, for example, the species to which the plant belongs. These data were subjected to PCA for quantitative variables. When analyzing the results, it is natural to connect the principal components to the qualitative variable ''species''.\nFor this, the following results are produced.\n* Identification, on the factorial planes, of the different species, for example, using different colors.\n* Representation, on the factorial planes, of the centers of gravity of plants belonging to the same species.\n* For each center of gravity and each axis,  p-value to judge the significance of the difference between the center of gravity and origin.\n\nThese results are what is called ''introducing a qualitative variable as supplementary element''. This procedure is detailed in and Husson, L\u00ea & Pag\u00e8s 2009 and Pag\u00e8s 2013.\nFew software offer this option in an \"automatic\" way. This is the case of [http://www.coheris.com/produits/analytics/logiciel-data-mining/ SPAD] that historically, following the work of [[Ludovic Lebart]], was the first to propose this option, and the R package [http://factominer.free.fr/ FactoMineR].\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Quantitative finance ===\n{{See also|Portfolio optimization}}\nIn [[quantitative finance]], principal component analysis can be directly applied to the [[risk management]] of [[interest rate derivative]] portfolios.<ref name=PHIRS>[http://www.tradinginterestrates.com The Pricing and Hedging of Interest Rate Derivatives: A Practical Guide to Swaps], J H M Darbyshire, 2016, {{isbn|978-0995455511}}</ref> Trading multiple [[swap (finance)|swap instruments]] which are usually a function of 30-500 other market quotable swap instruments is sought to be reduced to usually 3 or 4 principal components, representing the path of interest rates on a macro basis.

(2000).</ref> This technique is known as [[Spike-triggered covariance|spike-triggered covariance analysis]]. In a typical application an experimenter presents a [[white noise]] process as a stimulus (usually either as a sensory input to a test subject, or as a [[Electric current|current]] injected directly into the neuron) and records a train of action potentials, or spikes, produced by the neuron as a result. Presumably, certain features of the stimulus make the neuron more likely to spike. In order to extract these features, the experimenter calculates the [[covariance matrix]] of the ''spike-triggered ensemble'', the set of all stimuli (defined and discretized over a finite time window, typically on the order of 100 ms) that immediately preceded a spike. The [[Eigenvectors and eigenvalues|eigenvectors]] of the difference between the spike-triggered covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the ''prior stimulus ensemble'' (the set of all stimuli, defined over the same length time window) then indicate the directions in the [[Vector space|space]] of stimuli along which the variance of the spike-triggered ensemble differed the most from that of the prior stimulus ensemble. Specifically, the eigenvectors with the largest positive eigenvalues correspond to the directions along which the variance of the spike-triggered ensemble showed the largest positive change compared to the variance of the prior. Since these were the directions in which varying the stimulus led to a spike, they are often good approximations of the sought after relevant stimulus features.\n\nIn neuroscience, PCA is also used to discern the identity of a neuron from the shape of its action potential. [[Spike sorting]] is an important procedure because [[Electrophysiology#Extracellular recording|extracellular]] recording techniques often pick up signals from more than one neuron. In spike sorting, one first uses PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the space of action potential waveforms, and then performs [[Cluster analysis|clustering analysis]] to associate specific action potentials with individual neurons.\n\nPCA as a dimension reduction technique is particularly suited to detect coordinated activities of large neuronal ensembles. It has been used in determining collective variables, that is, [[order parameters]], during [[phase transitions]] in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jirsa|first1=Victor|last2=Friedrich|first2=R|last3=Haken|first3=Herman|last4=Kelso|first4=Scott|title=A theoretical model of phase transitions in the human brain|journal=Biological Cybernetics|date=1994|volume=71|issue=1|pages=27\u201335|doi=10.1007/bf00198909|pmid=8054384}}</ref>\n\n== Relation with other methods ==\n\n=== Correspondence analysis ===\n\n[[Correspondence analysis]] (CA)\nwas developed by [[Jean-Paul Benz\u00e9cri]]<ref>{{Cite book\n | author = Benz\u00e9cri, J.-P.\n | publisher=Dunod |location= Paris, France\n | year = 1973\n | title = L'Analyse des Donn\u00e9es.

The new variables have the property that the variables are all orthogonal. The PCA transformation can be helpful as a pre-processing step before clustering. PCA is a variance-focused approach seeking to reproduce the total variable variance, in which components reflect both common and unique variance of the variable. PCA is generally preferred for purposes of data reduction (that is, translating variable space into optimal factor space) but not when the goal is to detect the latent construct or factors.\n\n[[Factor analysis]] is similar to principal component analysis, in that factor analysis also involves linear combinations of variables. Different from PCA, factor analysis is a correlation-focused approach seeking to reproduce the inter-correlations among variables, in which the factors \"represent the common variance of variables, excluding unique variance\".<ref>Timothy A. Brown. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDb3BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Confirmatory Factor Analysis for Applied Research Methodology in the social sciences]. Guilford Press, 2006</ref> In terms of the correlation matrix, this corresponds with focusing on explaining the off-diagonal terms (that is, shared co-variance), while PCA focuses on explaining the terms that sit on the diagonal. However, as a side result, when trying to reproduce the on-diagonal terms, PCA also tends to fit relatively well the off-diagonal correlations.<ref>I.T. Jolliffe. Principal Component Analysis, Second Edition. Chapter 7. 2002</ref> Results given by PCA and factor analysis are very similar in most situations, but this is not always the case, and there are some problems where the results are significantly different. Factor analysis is generally used when the research purpose is detecting data structure (that is, latent constructs or factors) or causal modeling. If the factor model is incorrectly formulated or the assumptions are not met, then factor analysis will give erroneous results.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Meglen|first1=R.R. |title=Examining Large Databases: A Chemometric Approach Using Principal Component Analysis|journal=Journal of Chemometrics |volume=5 |issue=3|pages=163\u2013179 |date=1991 |doi=10.1002/cem.1180050305 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''K''-means clustering ===\nIt was asserted in <ref>{{cite journal|author=H.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Dissuaded by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of cavalry and two of infantry, Rupert failed to take advantage of his initial superiority in numbers to overwhelm the London brigade. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to [[Naunton]]. He had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of reinforcements from Bristol which numbered 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted troops. Their countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Dissuaded by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of cavalry and two of infantry, Rupert failed to take advantage of his initial superiority in numbers to overwhelm the London brigade. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to [[Naunton]]. He had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of reinforcements from Bristol which numbered 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted troops. Their countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.
