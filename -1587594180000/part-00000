It was wider and longer than previous DeSoto models and it came equipped with a [[V8 engine|V8]] engine producing 200&nbsp;hp when equipped with the 4 barrel carburetor (190&nbsp;kW) and PowerFlite [[automatic transmission]]. The transmission was operated by a Flite-Control lever located on the dashboard. The car weighed 4,070&nbsp;lb (1850&nbsp;kg) and cost [[United States dollar|US$]]3,544. AM radio was a $110 option.<ref name=\"flory2008\"/>\n\nThe 1956 model car was best known for its long, tapering tail fins, often accentuated by a two-tone exterior finish.

In 1955, DeSotos sold well with over 114,765 examples produced, making 1955 the best year for the company since 1946.
