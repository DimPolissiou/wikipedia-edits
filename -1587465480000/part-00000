He made over 100 appearances for Stuttgart before joining RB Leipzig in 2016 for a then-club record fee of \u20ac10 million. Across his spell with the two clubs, Werner claimed the domestic records for being the youngest player to reach 50, 100, 150 and 200 appearances in the [[Bundesliga]], although the former two milestones were broken by [[Kai Havertz]], and is the youngest player to have scored two goals in a single top-flight match in Germany.\n\nWerner was a prolific goalscorer at youth international level where he scored 34 goals in 48 appearances across the various age group levels. He made his senior debut for [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in 2017 and in the same year helped his nation claim the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]] where his return of three goals earned him the tournament's Golden Boot award.\n\n==Club career==\n===VfB Stuttgart===\nAn academy graduate of [[VfB Stuttgart]], Werner represented the club at various youth levels. During the 2012\u201313 season, he was promoted to the U-19 side despite only being sixteen-years old at the time.

These events were the longest-running military action in the history of [[Colonialism in Africa|African colonialism]].{{efn|I am indebted to Dr C. C. Saunders for this term {{sfn|Peires|1979|p=51}} }}{{sfn|Peires|1976|p=1}}\n\nThe reality of the conflicts between the Europeans and Xhosa involves a balance of tension. At times, tensions existed between the various Europeans in the Cape region, tensions between Empire administration and colonial governments, and tensions within the Xhosa Kingdom, e.g. chiefs rivalling each other, which usually led to Europeans taking advantage of the situation to meddle in Xhosa politics. A perfect example of this is the case of chief Ngqika and his uncle, chief Ndlambe.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Cape Colony00.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of the Cape Colony in 1809, showing its eastward expansion]]\n\nThe first European settlers in the Cape were the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], who established a small supply station in 1652 at present-day [[Cape Town]] for their trading ships to stop for supplies en route to and from the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]]. European settlement in and around Cape Town later spread into the valleys. By the second half of the 18th century, Europeans, predominantly [[trekboers]], moved eastward up the coast and encountered the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] in the region of the [[Great Fish River]]. The Xhosa were already established in the area and herded cattle. Competition for land ensued, particularly after the arrival of [[1820 Settlers|several groups of British settlers]] in 1820.\n\nThe Europeans invaded using force when land, they had originally seized, restricted them from expanding their stock farming activities. The [[Dutch East India Company]], which was responsible for what is referred to as \"founding\" several urban areas, like towns and cities in already populated areas of the west of South Africa, continually changed the boundaries in the [[Cape Colony]], establishing the [[Great Fish River]] as the eastern frontier in 1778.<ref name=\"Invasion\">[http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/conquest-eastern-cape-1779-1878 2011. Conquest of the Eastern Cape 1779-1878. SA History. Accessed 13 March.]</ref>\n\n== Early conflicts ==\n=== First war (1779\u20131781) ===\n\nThe First Xhosa War broke out in 1779 between [[Boer]] frontiersmen and the Xhosa. In December 1779, an armed clash occurred, resulting from allegations of cattle theft by Xhosa people. This led to [[Adreaan Van Jaarsveld]] capturing a large number of cattle from the Xhosa and claiming to have driven them out of [[Albany, South Africa|Zuurveld]] by July 1781.<ref name=sa>[http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/conquest-eastern-cape-1779-1878 Conquest of the Eastern Cape]</ref>\n\n=== Second war (1789\u201393) ===\n\nThe second war involved a larger territory. It started when the [[Gqunukhwebe]] clans of the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] started to penetrate back into the [[Albany, South Africa|Zuurveld]], a district between the Great Fish and the [[Sundays River]]s. Some frontiersmen, under Barend Lindeque, allied themselves with Ndlambe (regent of the Western Xhosas) to repel the Gqunukhwebe. Panic ensued and farms were abandoned.<ref name=sa/>\n\n=== Third war (1799-1803) ===\n\nThe third war started in January 1799 with a Xhosa rebellion that General T.P. Vandeleur crushed. Discontented [[Khoikhoi]] then revolted, joined with the Xhosa in the Zuurveld, and started attacking, retaking land through farms occupied by whites, reaching Oudtshoorn by July 1799. Commandos from Graaf-Reinet and Swellendam then started fighting in a string of clashes. Fearing general Khoi rising, the government made peace with the Xhosa and allowed them to stay in Zuurveld. In 1801, another Graaff-Reinet rebellion started forcing more Khoi desertions and farm abandonments. The commandos could achieve no result, so in February 1803 a peace was arranged, leaving the Xhosas still in Zuurveld.<ref name=sa/>\n\n== Start of British involvement ==\n\n=== Fourth War (1811\u201312){{anchor|Graham's Expedition}} ===\n\nThe Fourth War was the first experienced under British rule. The Zuurveld acted as a buffer zone between the Cape Colony and Xhosa territory, empty of the Boers and British to the west and the Xhosa to the east. In 1811, the Xhosa occupied the area, and flashpoint conflicts with the settlers followed. A mixed force under Colonel [[John Graham (British Army officer)|John Graham]]  that included British soldiers drove the Xhosa back beyond the Fish River in an effort that the first Governor of the [[Cape Colony]], Lt-General [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|John Cradock]], characterized as involving no more bloodshed \"than was necessary to impress on the minds of these savages a proper degree of terror and respect\".{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=55}} About four thousand British immigrants subsequently (after the fifth war) settled on the Fish River. \"Graham's Town\" arose on the site of Colonel Graham's headquarters; in time this became [[Grahamstown]].\n\n=== Fifth War (1818\u201319) ===\n\nThe fifth frontier war, also known as the \"War of Nxele\", initially developed from an 1817 judgment by the Cape Colony government about stolen cattle and their restitution by the Xhosa.<ref>[http://www.frontierwars.co.za/ninth.htm \"The Nine Frontier Wars\"], Frontier Legends Historical Tours.</ref> An issue of overcrowding brought on a civil war between the [[Gaika people|Ngqika]] (royal clan of the Rharhabe Xhosa) and the [[Gcaleka]] Xhosa (those that remained in their homeland). A Cape Colony-Ngqika defence treaty legally required military assistance to the Ngqika request (1818).\n\nThe Xhosa prophet-chief [[Maqana Nxele]] (or Makana) emerged at this time and promised \u201cto turn bullets into water.\u201d Under the command of [[ImiDushane|Mdushane]], [[AmaNdlambe]]'s son, Maqana led a 10,000 Xhosa force attack (22 April 1819) on [[Battle of Grahamstown|Grahamstown]], which was held by 350 troops. A [[Khoikhoi]] group led by Jan Boesak enabled the garrison to repulse Maqana, who suffered the loss of 1,000 Xhosa. Maqana was eventually captured and imprisoned on [[Robben Island]].\n\nThe British pushed the Xhosa further east beyond the Fish River to the [[Keiskamma River]]. The resulting empty territory was designated as a buffer zone for loyal Africans' settlements, but was declared to be off limits for either side's military occupation. It came to be known as the \"Ceded Territories\". The Albany district was established in 1820, on the Cape's side of the Fish River, and was populated with some [[1820 Settlers|5,000 Britons]]. The Grahamstown battle site continues to be called \"Egazini\" (\"Place of Blood\"), and a monument was erected there for the fallen Xhosa in 2001.{{efn|As of 2016 the Egazini monument has been vandalised and is in a bad state <ref>{{youtube|id=ger_2GturZI|title=Are heritage sites under threat in Makana?}}</ref>}}\n\n===Battle of Amalinde===\n{{Main|Battle of Amalinde|Ngqika people}}\n\nDuring the Fifth Frontier War in 1818, after a two-decade long conflict, Chief [[Ngqika]] ka Mlawu and his uncle Ndlambe\u2019s people clashed again in a battle called the [[Battle of Amalinde]] over several issues, including land ownership. The chief appointed his eldest son Maqoma (despite him lacking experience in battle) and the renowned Jingqi to lead the fight that lasted from midday to the evening. Ngqika was defeated, losing about 500 men during what is considered the bloodiest and most famous clash between [[Xhosa people]] in history.\n\n== Sixth war (1834\u201336) ==\n[[File:Eastern Frontier, Cape of Good Hope, ca 1835.png|thumb|300px|Eastern frontier of the colony, c. 1835\n{{legend|PaleGreen|Settled colonial area, showing districts established in 1820 (in various shades)}}\n{{legend|white|Neutral zone since 1820, as agreed by [[Lord Charles Somerset|Lord Somerset]] and the [[Ngqika|Gaika]] (Xhosa)}}\n{{legend|yellow|Tribal areas under British administration}}\n{{legend|red|Military forts and district boundaries}}]]\n\nThe earlier Xhosa Wars did not quell British-Xhosa tension in the Cape's eastern border at the Keiskamma River. Insecurity persisted because the Xhosa remained expelled from territory (especially the so-called \"Ceded Territories\") that was then settled by Europeans and other African peoples. They were also subjected to territorial expansions from other Africans that were themselves under pressure from the expanding [[Zulu Kingdom]]. Nevertheless, the frontier region was seeing increasing amounts of admixture between Europeans, Khoikhoi, and Xhosa living and trading throughout the frontier region. The vacillation by the Cape Government's policy towards the return of the Xhosa to areas they previously inhabited did not dissipate Xhosa frustration toward the inability to provide for themselves, and they thus resorted to frontier cattle-raiding.\n\n=== Outbreak ===\n\nCape responses to the Xhosa cattle raids varied, but in some cases were drastic and violent.On 11 December 1834, a Cape government commando party killed a chief of high rank, incensing the Xhosa: an army of 10,000 men, led by [[Maqoma]], a brother of the chief who had been killed, swept across the frontier into the Cape Colony, pillaged and burned the homesteads, and killed all who resisted. Among the worst sufferers was a colony of freed Khoikhoi who, in 1829, had been settled in the [[Kat River Valley]] by the British authorities. Refugees from the farms and villages took to the safety of Grahamstown, where women and children found refuge in the church.\n\n=== British campaign ===\n\nThe response was swift and multifaceted. [[Boer commando]]s mobilised under [[Piet Retief]] and inflicted a defeat on the Xhosa in the [[Winterberg, Eastern Cape|Winterberg Mountains]] in the north. Burgher and Khoi commandos also mobilised, and British Imperial troops arrived via [[Algoa Bay]].\n\nThe British governor, [[Benjamin d'Urban|Sir Benjamin d'Urban]], mustered the combined forces under [[Harry Smith (army)|Colonel Sir Harry Smith]],<ref>Smith, Sir Harry. \u2018\u2019The Autobiography of Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Smith Baronet of Aliwal on the Sutlej.\u2019\u2019 Publisher: John Murray,  Albemarle Street 1903 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57094/57094-h/57094-h.htm] </ref> who reached Grahamstown on 6 January 1835, six days after news of the uprising had reached Cape Town. It was from Grahamstown that the retaliatory campaign was launched and directed.\n\nThe campaign inflicted a string of defeats on the Xhosa, such as at Trompetter's Drift on the Fish River, and most of the Xhosa chiefs surrendered. However, the two primary Xhosa leaders, Maqoma and Tyali, retreated to the fastnesses of the [[Amatola Mountains]].\n\n=== The treaty ===\n\nBritish governor [[Benjamin d'Urban|Sir Benjamin d'Urban]] believed that [[Hintsa ka Khawuta]], Paramount-Chief of the [[Gcaleka]] Xhosa, commanded authority over all of the Xhosa tribes and therefore held him responsible for the initial attack on the Cape Colony, and for the looted cattle. D'Urban came to the frontier in December 1834, and led a large force across the [[Great Kei River|Kei river]] to confront Hintsa at his residence and dictate terms to him.\n\nThe terms stated that all the country from the Cape's prior frontier, the Keiskamma River, as far as the Great Kei River, was annexed as the British [[British Kaffraria|\"Queen Adelaide Province\"]], and its inhabitants declared British subjects. A site for the seat of the province's government was selected and named [[King William\u2019s Town]]. The new province was declared to be for the settlement of loyal tribes, rebel tribes who replaced their leadership, and the [[Fengu people|Fengu]] (known to the Europeans as the \"Fingo people\"), who had recently arrived fleeing from the Zulu armies and had been living under Xhosa subjection. Magistrates were appointed to administer the territory in the hope that they would gradually, with the help of missionaries, undermine tribal authority. Hostilities finally died down on 17 September 1836, after having continued for nine months.\n\n=== The killing of Paramount-Chief Hintsa ===\n[[File:Chief Hintsa of the Gcaleka Xhosa.jpg|thumb|The murder of Chief Hintsa is an enduring atrocity in the memory of the Xhosa nation.]]\n\nOriginally assured of his personal safety during the treaty negotiations, Hintsa rapidly found himself held hostage and pressured with massive demands for cattle \"restitution\". Other sources say he offered himself as a hostage until the indemnity was paid and even suggested that he accompany Colonel Smith in collecting Xhosa cattle.{{sfn|Ransford|1974|p=20}} He attempted to escape at the Nqabarha River but was pursued, pulled off his horse, and immobilized with shots through the back and the leg. Immediately, a soldier named George Southey (brother of colonial administrator [[Richard Southey (colonial administrator)|Sir Richard Southey]]) came up behind Hintsa and shot him in the back of the head; furthermore, Hintsa's ears were cut off after his death. Other sources say his horse bolted and Harry Smith tried to shoot the fleeing man but both his pistols misfired. Giving chase, he caught hold of Hintsa and dragged him heavily to the ground. Hintsa was still full of fight. \"He was jabbing at me furiously with his assegai,\" Colonel Smith recalled in his autobiography, and the chief succeeded in breaking away to find cover in a nearby stream bed. There, while pleading for mercy, the top of his skull was blown off by one of Smith's officers and his body was afterwards mutilated by British and colonial troops.{{sfn|Ransford|1974|p=20}} These actions shocked the government in London, which condemned and repudiated Governor D\u2019Urban. Hintsa's murder angered the Xhosa for decades thereafter.\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nBy the end of the war, 7,000 people of all races were left homeless.\n\nThe settlement of the Fengu in the annexed territory had far-reaching consequences. This wandering nation claimed to be escaping oppression at the hands of the Gcaleka and, in return for the land they were given by the Cape, they became the [[Cape Colony]]'s formidable allies. They swiftly acquired firearms and formed mounted commandos for the defense of their new land. In the following wars, they fought alongside the Cape Colony as invaluable allies, not as subordinates, and won considerable renown and respect for their martial ability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newhistory.co.za/part-1-chapter-3-an-unstable-frontier-the-role-of-soldiers-and-military-hintsa-s-war/ |title=An Unstable Frontier The Role Of Soldiers And Military Hintsa\u2019s War |publisher=New History |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe conflict was the catalyst for [[Piet Retief]]'s manifesto and the [[Great Trek]]. In total, 40 farmers (Boers) were killed and 416 farmhouses were burnt down. In addition, 5,700 horses, 115,000 head of cattle, and 162,000 sheep were plundered by Xhosa tribespeople. In retaliation, sixty thousand Xhosa cattle were taken or retaken by [[1820 Settlers|colonists]].\n\nThe British minister of colonies, [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Lord Glenelg]], repudiated d'Urban's actions and accused the Boer retaliation against cattle raiders as being what instigated the conflict. As a result, the Boer community lost faith in the British justice system and often took the law into their own hands when cattle rustlers were caught.\n\nThe territorial expansion and creation of \"Queen Adelaide Province\" was also condemned by London as being uneconomical and unjust. The province was disannexed in December 1836, the Cape's border was re-established at the Keiskamma river, and new treaties were made with the chiefs responsible for order beyond the Fish River.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/conquest-eastern-cape-1779-1878 |title=Conquest of the Eastern Cape 1779-1878 &#124; South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\n== Interlude: Stockenstr\u00f6m's treaty system ==\n[[File:Andries Stockenstrom - Cape Colony Archives.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Andries Stockenstr\u00f6m]], 1st Baronet, and veteran of several Xhosa wars]]\n\nIn the aftermath of the previous frontier war, the new lieutenant-governor of the Eastern Province, [[Andries Stockenstr\u00f6m]], instituted a completely new border policy. Stockenstr\u00f6m, who professed considerable respect for the Xhosa, developed a system of formal treaties to guard the border and return any stolen cattle from either side (cattle raiding was a regular grievance). Diplomatic agents were exchanged between the [[Cape Colony]] and the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa Chiefs]] as reliable \"ambassadors\", and colonial expansion into Xhosa land was forbidden. Land annexed from the Xhosa in the previous war was also returned and the displaced Xhosa moved back into this land, assuaging overpopulation in the Xhosa territories.\n\nIn the framework of this new system, the frontier settled and saw nearly a decade of peace. The Xhosa chiefs generally honoured Stockenstr\u00f6m's treaty and returned any cattle that their people had raided. On the Cape side, Stockenstr\u00f6m, who saw the major problem as being the land management of the colonists, used his influence to rein in the frontier settlers and prevent any expansion onto Xhosa land. A level of trust also began to develop, and the Xhosa chiefs came to hold Stockenstr\u00f6m in exceptionally high regard as a man who, although he had defeated the Xhosa armies on multiple occasions, nonetheless treated them as diplomatic equals.\n\nThe treaty system began to unravel as the settlers gained a determined leader and spokesman in the form of [[Robert Godlonton]], who led a large colonist movement to dismantle Stockenstr\u00f6m's system and allow seizure of Xhosa lands. As one settler ominously declared of the Xhosa territory: ''\"The appearance of the country is very fine, it will make excellent sheep farms.\"'' Godlonton also used his considerable influence in the religious institutions of the Cape to drive his opinions, declaring that: ''\"the British race was selected by God himself to colonize Kaffraria\"''.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=63-}}\n\nIn the face of massive pressure and ruinous lawsuits, Stockenstr\u00f6m was eventually dismissed and the new British governor, Maitland, abrogated the treaties.<ref name=\"newhistory1\">{{cite web|url=http://newhistory.co.za/part-1-chapter-3-a-quest-for-a-treaty-stockenstrom-godlonton-and-bowker/ |title=A Quest For A Treaty Stockenstrom, Godlonton And Bowker |publisher=New History |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Seventh War}} Seventh war (1846\u201347) ==\n[[File:Mfengu soldier of Cape Colony - Fingo People.jpg|thumb|The '''Fengu''' (''\"Fingoes\"''), known across southern Africa as skilled gunmen, were invaluable allies of the Cape Colony in its frontier wars.]]\n\nThe Seventh Xhosa War is often referred to as the \"War of the Axe\" or the \"Amatola War\". On the [[Cape Colony|colonial side]], two main groups were involved: columns of imperial British troops sent from London, and local mixed-race ''\"Burgher forces\"'', which were mainly Khoi, Fengu, [[British people|British]] settlers and [[Boer commando]]s, led by their commander-in-chief, [[Andries Stockenstr\u00f6m]]. Relations between the British Imperial troops and the local commandos broke down completely during the war.\n\nOn the Xhosa side, the [[Ngqika]] (known to the Europeans as the \"Gaika\") were the chief tribe engaged in the war, assisted by portions of the [[Ndlambe ka Rarabe|Ndlambe]]{{sfn|Cana|1911|p=239}} and the [[Thembu]]. The Xhosa forces were over 10 times greater in number, and had by this time replaced their traditional weapons with firearms. It was their new use of guns that made the Xhosa considerably more effective in fighting the British. Both sides engaged in the widespread use of [[scorched earth tactics]].{{sfn|SAH staff|2012}}\n\nChief [[Mgolombane Sandile]] led the Ngqika people in the Seventh Frontier War (1846\u201347), Eighth Frontier War (1850\u201353) and the Ninth Frontier War (1877\u201378), in which he was killed. These clashes marked the beginning of the use of firearms by Xhosa armies, scoring many victories for Chief Sandile, gaining him a reputation as a Xhosa hero and mighty warrior.<ref name=\"Sandile\u2019s grave\">[2008.

Accessed 13 March.]</ref> \n\n=== Background ===\nTension had been simmering between farmers and marauders, on both sides of the frontier, since the dismantlement of Stockenstrom's treaty system. Governor Maitland imposed a new system of treaties on the chiefs without consulting them, while a severe drought forced desperate Xhosa to engage in cattle raids across the frontier in order to survive. In addition, politician [[Robert Godlonton]] continued to use his newspaper the ''Graham's Town Journal'' to agitate for [[1820 Settlers|Eastern Cape settlers]] to annex and settle the land that had been returned to the Xhosa after the previous war.\n\nThe event that actually ignited the war was a trivial dispute over a raid. A Khoi escort was transporting a manacled Xhosa thief to Grahamstown to be tried for stealing an axe, when Xhosa raiders attacked and killed the Khoi escort. The Xhosa refused to surrender the murderer and war broke out in March 1846.\n<ref name=\"newhistory1\"/>\n\n=== Initial British setbacks ===\n[[File:War of the Axe - Sketch of shootout between British Imperial Troops and Xhosa Soldiers - Amatola Mnts June 1851.png|thumb|left|Sketch of the shoot-out as British Imperial Troops attempt to storm Sandile's position in the Amatola Mountains.]]\n[[File:1850 frontier shoot-out - between Xhosa and long British wagon train.jpg|thumb|Shoot-out between Xhosa and long, slow-moving British army column.]]\n\nThe regular British forces suffered initial setbacks. A British column sent to confront the Ngqika chief, [[Mgolombane Sandile]], was temporarily delayed at the Amatola Mountains, and the attacking Xhosa were able to capture the centre of the three mile long wagon train which was not being defended, carrying away the British officer's supply of wine and other supplies.\n\nLarge numbers of Xhosa then poured across the border as the outnumbered imperial troops fell back, abandoning their outposts. The only successful resistance was from the local Fengu, who heroically defended their villages from the far larger Xhosa forces.\n\nOn 28 May, a force of 8,000 Xhosa attacked the last remaining British garrison, at Fort Peddie, but fell back after a long shootout with British and Fengu troops. The Xhosa army then marched on Grahamstown itself, but was held up when a sizable army of Ndlambe Xhosa were defeated on 7 June 1846 by [[Henry Somerset (British Army officer)|General Somerset]] on the [[Gwangu]], a few miles from Fort Peddie. However the slow-moving British columns, like the Xhosa, were considerably hampered by drought and were becoming desperate.\n\nAfter much debate, they were forced to call in Stockenstr\u00f6m and the local Burgher forces.{{sfn|SAH staff|1836}}{{sfn|SAH staff|loc=1800s time-line}}\n\n=== The local Burghers' campaign ===\n[[File:Boers 1881.gif|thumb|Mobile mounted commandos were highly effective in the mountainous frontier terrain.]]\n\nThe local Commandos were much more effective in the rough and mountainous terrain, of which they had considerable local knowledge.\n\nAfter inflicting a string of defeats on the Ngqika, Stockenstr\u00f6m took a small and select group of his mounted commandos across the Colony's border and rapidly pushed into the independent Xhosa lands beyond the frontier. They rode deep into the [[Transkei]] Xhosa heartland, directly towards the kraal of [[Sarili kaHintsa|Sarhili]] (\"Kreli\"), the paramount chief of all the Xhosa.\nDue in part to the speed of their approach, they were barely engaged by Xhosa forces and rode directly into Sarhili's capital.{{sfn|Stockenstrom|Shippard|1964|p=}}\n\nParamount Chief Sarhili and his generals agreed to meet Stockenstr\u00f6m (with his commandants [[Christian Groepe|Groepe]], [[John Molteno|Molteno]] and [[Charles Brownlee|Brownlee]]), unarmed, on a nearby mountain ridge. The meeting was initially tense \u2013 the fathers of both Sarhili and Stockenstr\u00f6m had been killed whilst unarmed. Both men were also veterans of several frontier wars against each other and, while they treated each other with extreme respect, Stockenstr\u00f6m nonetheless made the extreme demand that Sarhili assume responsibility for any future Ngqika attacks.\n\nAfter protracted negotiations, Sarhili agreed to return any raided cattle & other property and to relinquish claims to the Ngqika land west of the Kei. He also promised to use his limited authority over the frontier Ngqika to restrain cross-border attacks.\nA treaty was signed and the commandos departed on good terms.{{sfn|Theal|1911|p=}}\n\nAlso leading his commando on this campaign was a young man named [[John Charles Molteno|John Molteno]], who in later life became the Cape's first Prime Minister. Significantly, his experience of what he believed to be the ineptitude and injustice of the British Empire's frontier policy later informed his government's decisions to oppose the British in the final frontier war.\n\n=== Later stage of the conflict ===\n[[File:Frederick Timpson I'Ons08.JPG|thumb|A column of Xhosa gunmen, crossing a ravine in the frontier mountains]]\n\nHowever, British Imperial General [[Peregrine Maitland]] rejected the treaty and sent an insulting letter back to the Xhosa paramount-chief, demanding greater acts of submission and servility. Furious, Stockenstr\u00f6m and his local commandos resigned and departed from the war, leaving the British and the Xhosa \u2013 both starving and afflicted by fever \u2013 to a long, drawn-out war of attrition.\n\nThe effects of the drought were worsened through the use, by both sides, of [[scorched earth tactics]]. Gradually, as the armies weakened, the conflict subsided into waves of petty and bloody recriminations. At one point, violence flared up again after Ngqika tribesmen supposedly stole four goats from the neighbouring Kat River Settlement. When the rains came, floods turned the surrounding lands into a quagmire. The violence slowly wound down as both sides weakened, immobile and fever-ridden.\n\nThe war continued until Sandile was captured during negotiations and sent to Grahamstown. Although Sandile was soon released, the other chiefs gradually stopped fighting, and by the end of 1847 the Xhosa had been completely subdued after 21 months of fighting.{{sfn|Cana|1911|p=239}}<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv |url=http://www.southafricaholiday.org.uk/history/hist_xhosawars1840-78.htm |title=South Africa Holiday: Xhosa frontier wars 1840-78 |accessdate= 1 March 2012}} {{better source|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n\n\u200aIn the last month of the war (December 1847) Sir Harry Smith reached Cape Town as governor of the colony, and on the 23rd, at a meeting of the Xhosa chiefs, announced the annexation of the country between the Keiskamma and the Kei rivers to the British crown, thus reabsorbing the territory abandoned by order of Lord Glenelg. It was not, however, incorporated with the Cape Colony, but made a crown dependency under the name of [[British Kaffraria]] Colony,{{sfn|Cana|1911|p=239}} with King William's Town as capital.\n\n== {{anchor|Eighth War}} Eighth war (1850\u201353) ==\n{{main|Eighth Xhosa War}}\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:CAPE MOUNTED RIFLES IN 8TH FRONTIER WAR.jpg|thumb|The [[Cape Mounted Riflemen]] charging the enemy at Waterkloof during the 8th Frontier War]]\n\nLarge numbers of Xhosa were displaced across the Keiskamma by Governor Harry Smith, and these refugees supplemented the original inhabitants there, causing overpopulation and hardship. Those Xhosa who remained in the colony were moved to towns and encouraged to adopt European lifestyles.\n\nHarry Smith also attacked and annexed the independent [[Orange Free State]], hanging the Boer resistance leaders, and in the process alienating the Burghers of the Cape Colony. To cover the mounting expenses he then imposed exorbitant taxes on the local people of the frontier and cut the Cape's standing forces to less than five thousand men.\n\nIn June 1850 there followed an unusually cold winter, together with an extreme drought. It was at this time that Smith ordered the displacement of large numbers of Xhosa squatters from the Kat River region.\n\nThe war became known as \"Mlanjeni's War\", after the prophet Mlanjeni who arose among the homeless Xhosa, and who predicted that the Xhosa would be unaffected by the colonists' bullets. Large numbers of Xhosa began leaving the colony's towns and mobilizing in the tribal areas.\n\n=== The Outbreak of War (December 1850) ===\n[[File:Chief Maqoma - Xhosa Wars.jpg|thumb|Chief Maqoma. Xhosa military leader in several of the frontier wars]]\n\nBelieving that the chiefs were responsible for the unrest caused by Mlanjeni's preaching, Governor Sir Harry Smith travelled to meet with the prominent chiefs. When Sandile refused to attend a meeting outside [[Fort Cox, Eastern Cape|Fort Cox]], Governor Smith deposed him and declared him a fugitive. On 24 December, a British detachment of 650 men under Colonel Mackinnon was ambushed by Xhosa warriors in the Boomah Pass. The party was forced to retreat to [[Fort White, Eastern Cape|Fort White]], under heavy fire from the Xhosa, having sustained forty-two casualties. The very next day, during Christmas festivities in towns throughout the border region, apparently friendly Xhosa entered the towns to partake in the festivities. At a given signal though, they fell upon the settlers who had invited them into their homes and killed them. With this attack, the bulk of the Ngqika joined the war.\n\n=== Initial Xhosa victories ===\n\nWhile the Governor was still at Fort Cox, the Xhosa forces advanced on the colony, isolating him there. The Xhosa burned British military villages along the frontier and captured the post at Line Drift. Meanwhile, the Khoi of the [[Blinkwater River Valley]] and Kat River Settlement revolted, under the leadership of a half-Khoi, half-Xhosa chief Hermanus Matroos, and managed to capture [[Fort Armstrong (South Africa)|Fort Armstrong]]. Large numbers of the \"Kaffir Police\" \u2014 a paramilitary police force the British had established to combat cattle theft \u2014 deserted their posts and joined Xhosa war parties. For a while, it appeared that all of the Xhosa and Khoi people of the eastern Cape were taking up arms against the British.\n\nHarry Smith finally fought his way out of Fort Cox with the help of the local [[Cape Mounted Riflemen]], but found that he had alienated most of his local allies. His policies had made enemies of the Burghers and Boer Commandos, the Fengu, and the Khoi, who formed much of the Cape's local defences. Even some of the Cape Mounted Riflemen refused to fight.{{sfn|Abbink|Peires|1989|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}}\n\n=== British counter-attack (January 1851) ===\nAfter these initial successes, however, the Xhosa experienced a series of setbacks. Xhosa forces were repulsed in separate attacks on Fort White and [[Fort Hare]]. Similarly, on 7 January, Hermanus and his supporters launched an offensive on the town of [[Fort Beaufort]], which was defended by a small detachment of troops and local volunteers. The attack failed however, and Hermanus was killed. The Cape Government also eventually agreed to levy a force of local gunmen (predominantly Khoi) to hold the frontier, allowing Smith to free some imperial troops for offensive action.{{sfn|Abbink|Bruijn|Walraven|2008|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}}\n\nBy the end of the month of January, the British were beginning to receive reinforcements from [[Cape Town]] and a force under Colonel Mackinnon was able to drive north from [[King William's Town]] to resupply the beleaguered garrisons at [[Fort White, Eastern Cape|Fort White]], [[Fort Cox, Eastern Cape|Fort Cox]] and [[Fort Hare]]. With fresh men and supplies, the British expelled the remainder of Hermanus' rebel forces (now under the command of Willem Uithaalder) from Fort Armstrong and drove them west toward the [[Amathole Mountains|Amatola Mountains]]. Over the coming months, increasing numbers of Imperial troops arrived, reinforcing the heavily outnumbered British and allowing Smith to lead sweeps across the frontier country.\n\nIn 1852, [[HMS Birkenhead (1845)|HMS Birkenhead]] was wrecked at [[Gansbaai]] while bringing reinforcements to the war at the request of [[Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet|Sir Harry Smith]]. As the ship sank, the men (mostly new recruits) stood silently in rank, while the women and children were loaded into the lifeboats. They remained in rank as the ship slipped under and over 300 died.\n\n=== Final stages of the conflict ===\n[[File:Ambush of British Column - Xhosa wars.jpg|thumb|A British column (74th Highlanders) under ambush in the Waterkloof forests]]\n\nInsurgents led by Maqoma established themselves in the forested Waterkloof. From this base they managed to plunder surrounding farms and torch the homesteads. Maqoma's stronghold was situated on Mount Misery, a natural fortress on a narrow neck wedged between the Waterkloof and Harry's Kloof. The Waterkloof conflicts lasted two years. Maqoma also led an attack on Fort Fordyce and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of Sir Harry Smith.\n\nIn February 1852, the British Government decided that Sir Harry Smith's inept rule had been responsible for much of the violence, and ordered him replaced by [[George Cathcart]], who took charge in March. For the last six months, Cathcart ordered scourings of the countryside for rebels. In February 1853, Sandile and the other chiefs surrendered.\n\nThe 8th frontier war was the most bitter and brutal in the series of Xhosa wars. It lasted over two years and ended in the complete subjugation of the Ciskei Xhosa.\n\n== Cattle-killing movement (1856\u201358) ==\n{{main|History of Cape Colony from 1806 to 1870#Xhosa cattle-killing movement and famine (1854-1858)}}\n[[File:Nongqawuse and Nonkosi.jpg|thumb|Nongqawuse (right) with fellow prophetess, Nonkosi]]\n\nThe great Cattle-killing was a [[Millenarianism|millennialist movement]] which began among the Xhosa in 1856, and led them to destroy their own means of subsistence in the belief that it would bring about salvation by supernatural spirits.\n\nIn April 1856 the 16-year-old Xhosa [[prophet]]ess [[Nongqawuse]] began to declare that she had received a message from the Xhosa people's ancestors, promising deliverance from their hardships. She preached that the ancestors would return from the afterlife in huge numbers, drive all Europeans into the sea, and give the Xhosa bounteous gifts of horses, sheep, goats, dogs, fowls, and all manner of clothing and food in great amounts. They would also restore the elderly to youth and would usher in a utopian era of prosperity. However, she declared that the dead ancestors would only enact this on condition that the Xhosa first destroyed all their means of subsistence. They needed to kill all of their cattle and burn all of their crops.\n\nAt first no one believed Nongquwuse's prophecy and the Xhosa nation ignored her prophecy. But when Chief [[Sarhili]] began to kill his cattle, more and more people began to believe that Nongquwuse was an ''igqirha'' (diviner) who could communicate with the ancestors. They too killed their cattle and destroyed their crops. The cult grew and built up momentum, sweeping across the eastern Cape. The government authorities of the [[Cape Colony]] feared chaos, famine and economic collapse, so they desperately appealed in vain to the Xhosa to ignore the prophecies. They even arrested Nongqawuse herself for disturbance caused.\n\nThe return of the [[Ancestor worship|ancestors]] was predicted to occur on 18 February 1857. The Xhosa, especially chief Sarhili of the Gcalekas, heeded the demand to destroy food sources and clothes and enforced it on others throughout the country. When the day came, the Xhosa nation waited en masse for the momentous events to occur, only to be bitterly disappointed. With no means of subsistence, famine set in.\n\nThe cattle killings continued into 1858, leading to the starvation of thousands. Disease was also spread from the cattle killings. This gave the settlers power over the remainder of the Xhosa nation who were often forced to turn to the colonists for food, blankets and other relief.<ref>{{cite web |first=Alistair |last=Boddy-Evans |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/glossaryc/g/def_CattleKill.htm |title=Cattle-Killings (1856\u201357)|publisher=About.com Guide|accessdate=29 July 2010}} {{better source|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Ninth war (1877\u201379) ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Cape Colony map 1876 - Eve of Confederation Wars.jpg|thumb|Map of southern Africa on the eve of the final frontier war (1876)]]\n\nThe ninth and final frontier war  \u2014 also known as the \"Fengu-Gcaleka War\" or \"Ngcayechibi's War\", the latter being the name of the headman at whose feast the initial bar fight occurred \u2014 involved several competing powers: the [[Cape Colony]] Government and its Fengu allies, the British Empire, and the Xhosa armies (Gcaleka and Ngqika). The Cape Colony addressed local needs through their own devices, creating a period of peace and prosperity, and achieved partial independence from Britain with \"[[Responsible Government]]\"; it had relatively little interest in territorial expansion. The frontier was policed lightly using small, highly mobile, mounted mixed-race commandos that were recruited locally from Boer, Fengu, Khoi and settler frontier peoples. The [[Cape Qualified Franchise|multi-racial franchise]], and legal recognition for indigenous systems of land tenure, had also gone some way to easing frontier tensions. Any further intrusion of the British government in Cape affairs to disrupt this state was thought unnecessary and ill-advised.\n\nThe British Government sought to increase control in [[History of the Cape Colony from 1870 to 1899|southern Africa]] by uniting all the states of the region into a [[Confederation]] under the overall rule of the British Empire, the same policy that was successfully applied to Canada. This Confederation scheme required that the remaining independent Black States be annexed; a frontier war was seen as an ideal opportunity for such a conquest. Both the Cape Colony and Xhosa shared the view that actions to achieve such a scheme at that time would create instability.\n\nThe integration of the [[Black African]] population of the frontier into the life patterns and practices of the Cape Colony had developed unevenly. The Fengu had rapidly adapted to and accepted the changes coming to southern Africa by taking to urban trade. The Gcaleka Xhosa resided predominately in the independent [[Gcaleka]] land to the east and had suffered greatly from the effects of war, alcoholism and [[Nongqawuse]]'s cattle killing. They bitterly resented the material success of the Fengu, although some Gcaleka lived within the Cape's borders.\n\nA series of devastating droughts across the Transkei threatened the relative peace which had prevailed for the previous few decades. In the memorable summary of the historian De Kiewiet: ''\"In South Africa, the heat of drought easily becomes the fever of war.\"''<ref>Kiewiet, Cornelis W. de (1941), ''A History of South Africa, Social and Economic''., Oxford, England: Clarendon Press. p.105</ref> The drought had started in 1875 in Gcalekaland and had spread to other parts of the Transkei and Basutoland, as well as to the Cape Colony controlled Ciskei. By 1877, it had become the most severe drought ever recorded.{{sfn|Hone|1993|p=68}} In 1877, the ethnic tensions began to emerge, particularly between the [[Mfengu]], the [[Thembu]] and the Gcaleka Xhosa.{{sfn|Oliver|Fage|Sanderson|1985|p=387}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.ru.ac.za/1761/1/Spicer-MA-TR78-38.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312212856/http://eprints.ru.ac.za/1761/1/Spicer-MA-TR78-38.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2014 }}</ref>{{sfn|Bundy|1979|p=83}} A wedding celebration in September 1877 was the scene of a bar fight when the tensions emerged after Gcaleka harassed the Fengu in attendance. Later in the same day, Gcaleka attacked a Cape Colony police outpost, which was manned predominantly by a Fengu ethnic police force.\n\n=== Outbreak ===\n[[File:Chief Sarili - Kreli - with councillors.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Chief Sarhili (centre seated) was under pressure from belligerent factions of his own government.]]\n\nIn September 1877 the Cape Colony government rejected the second attempt to implement the [[History of the Cape Colony from 1870 to 1899|Confederation scheme]], this time put forth by Governor [[Henry Bartle Frere]]. The attack by the Gcaleka on the predominantly Fengu ethnic police force at a Cape Colony police outpost was thought by the Cape Colony government as tribal violence best left for local police management. Frere used the incident as a pretext for British conquest of the independent neighbouring state of Gcalekaland. Sarhili, the paramount-chief of Gcalekaland, was summoned by Frere, but declined the invitation in fear of arrest and coercion. Frere wrote to him to declare him deposed and at war.{{sfn|Malherbe|1971|p=}} Frere contacted radical settler groups who desired British intervention and cheap Xhosa labour to work their farms, and did not quell rumours of an impending Xhosa invasion.\n\n=== The Cape Colony's War ===\n[[File:A local commando of fingoes and colonists on the cape frontier - 1878.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cape Colony militia \u2013 Fengu and Boer \u2013 on the frontier, 1878]]\n[[File:1 John Molteno - 1st Prime Minister of the Cape - 1860s - Copy2.jpg|thumb|upright|Cape Prime Minister [[John Molteno]], a supporter of local solutions to the conflict.]]\n\nChief Sarhili faced intense pressure from belligerent factions within his own government and mobilised his armies for their movement to the frontier. The Cape Government reiterated its insistence that the matter was best left to local resolution and did not constitute an international war for imperial military intervention. High-pressure negotiations by Cape Prime Minister John Charles Molteno extracted a promise from Britain that imperial troops would stay put and on no account cross the frontier. Gcaleka forces of 8000 attacked a Cape police outpost near the frontier at [[Butterworth, Eastern Cape|Ibeka]]; a fierce shoot-out followed but the Gcaleka forces were dispersed. Soon, several other outposts and stations along the frontier were coming under attack. The Cape Government now had to use all available diplomatic leverage it had to keep the British imperial forces contained.\n\nThe Cape's local paramilitaries (mounted commandos of mainly [[Boer Commando|Boer]], [[Thembu]] and Fengu origin) were deployed by Molteno under the leadership of Commander Veldman Bikitsha and [[Chief Magistrate]] [[Charles Duncan Griffith|Charles Griffith]]. The commandos swiftly engaged and defeated an army of Gcaleka gunmen. They then crossed the frontier and pushed into Gcalekaland. Dividing into three lightly equipped, fast-moving columns, the commandos devastated the Gcaleka armies, which dispersed and fled eastwards. The Cape units tracked the fleeing remnants right through Gcalekaland, stopping only when they reached neutral Bomvanaland on the far side. The war was over in three weeks. Sarhili had also recently applied for peace. With few incentives to conquer or occupy the land, and with the violence subsiding, the Cape Government recalled their commandos, who returned home and disbanded.{{sfn|Molteno|1910|p=}}\n\n=== Bartle Frere's War Council ===\n[[File:BartleFrere.jpg|thumb|upright|British Governor Bartle Frere sought to annex Gcalekaland to the British Empire.]]\n\nDuring the Cape's lightning quick campaign, Governor Frere had established a \"war-council\" at nearby [[King William's Town]] to direct the war against Gcalekaland. Frere and his Lieutenant General Sir Arthur Cunynghame were to represent the British Empire on this council, while two of Molteno's ministers, [[John X. Merriman]] and [[Charles Brownlee]], were appointed to represent local Cape interests.\n\nThe council was torn apart by argument from the beginning, as Frere refused Gcaleka appeals and worked towards full British occupation of Gcalekaland for white settlement and his future confederation. Frere also increasingly insisted on having complete imperial control of the war.\n\nThe Cape government on the other hand was reluctant to see its local Commandos brought under British imperial command, in what it considered to be essentially a local conflict, not an imperial war of conquest. The Cape had only recently attained local democracy and was extremely suspicious of Imperial infringements upon it. It also considered the slow-moving British troop columns to be absurdly unsuitable for frontier warfare \u2013 immobile, ineffective and vastly more expensive than local Cape forces. This last point of contention was chiefly exacerbated by Frere's insistence that the Cape's government pay for his imported British imperial troops, as well as its own local forces. The Cape Government wanted to fund and use only its own local forces. It did not desire British troops to operate in the Cape Colony in the first place, and especially objected to being forced to fund them.\n\nMerriman, who Molteno had appointed to oversee the Cape's war effort, initially worked hard to cooperate with Frere, but increasingly came to share Molteno's views on the ineptitude and injustice of British imperial policy in southern Africa.<ref>Cape Times: ''Correspondence, Memoranda and Minutes connected with the Dismissal of the Late Ministry''. Cape Town: Houses of Parliament Library. 1878.</ref>{{sfn|Lewsen|1982|p=}}\n\n=== The Imperial War ===\n[[File:Frontier war engagement near Ibika - 1877 Cape Colony.jpg|thumb|Engagement near Ibika \u2013 1877]]\n\nThe second stage of the war began when Frere ordered the disarmament of all Black peoples of the Cape. There was confusion and uproar from the Cape's many black soldiers and a furious protest from the Cape Government. Militia deserted and protests erupted, in the face of which Cunynghame panicked and overreacted by unilaterally deploying the imperial troops to thinly encircle the whole of [[British Kaffraria]]. Faced with growing discontent, the Cape demanded that the British Government fire Cunynghame, abandon its racial disarmament policy, and allow the Cape to deploy its (predominantly black) paramilitaries to establish order. However Frere refused and brought in Imperial troops to enforce the disarmament, and then to invade Gcalekaland once again. This time to annex it and occupy it for the purpose of white settlement.\n\nThe British initially attempted to repeat the successful strategy of the Cape's previous campaign. After similarly dividing into three columns, the slow-moving foreign troops soon became disorientated and exhausted. They were unable to engage or even to find the dispersed Gcaleka, who were swiftly moving and regrouping. As the British scoured Gcalekaland, the regrouped Gcaleka army easily slipped past them and crossed the border into the Cape Colony. Here they were joined by Sandile who led his Ngqika nation into rebellion.\n\n[[File:Mgolombane Sandile - Xhosa Chief.jpg|thumb|left|The great Chief of the Ngqika, Mgolombane Sandile, veteran of several frontier wars]]\n\nThe combined Xhosa armies laid waste to the frontier region. Fengu towns and other frontier settlements were sacked, supply lines were cut and outposts were evacuated as the British fell back.\n\nUp until now, Molteno had been heavily engaged in a high-level diplomatic battle with Britain to preserve the Cape Colony's constitutional independence. However, with the Cape's frontier collapsing in chaos, he now made for the frontier in person, where he confronted the British Governor with a heavy condemnation for bad intentions and incompetence. He demanded the free command of the Cape's indigenous forces to operate and contain the violence, making it clear that he was content to sacrifice his job rather than tolerate further British interference.\n\nFrere's next move was to appeal to the authority of the [[British Colonial Office]] to formally dissolve the elected Cape government, which was now stubbornly standing in the way of the British Empire, and assume direct imperial control over the entire country.{{sfn|von Welfling Eybers|1918|p=448\u2013450}}\n\nIncreasing numbers of Xhosa armies now poured across the frontier. Towns and farms throughout the region were now burning, and the remaining frontier forts filled with refugees fleeing the invasion. British troops remained thin on the ground as much of them still remained idle in Gcalekaland, where they had been sent for the purpose of occupation.\n\nHowever Frere was lucky in that he still had access to the frontier militia and Fengu regiments of the Cape Government he had just overthrown. These forces, again under their legendary commander Veldman Bikitsha, managed to engage and finally defeat the Gcaleka on 13 January (near Nyumaxa).\n\nThe imperial troops assisted, but were tired, short of rations and unable to follow up on the victory. A subsequent attack was barely repelled on 7 February (Battle of [[Kentani]] or \"Centane\") with considerable more help from the Fengu and the local [[Frontier Light Horse]] militia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Neil Parsons |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/25/rose-of-rhodesia/parsons-2.html |title=Investigating the Origins of The Rose of Rhodesia, Part II: Harold Shaw Film Productions Ltd |publisher=Latrobe.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe exhausted Gcaleka finally pulled out from the conflict, but Sandile's rebel Ngqika armies fought on. The rebels eluded the Imperial troops once again and moved into the Amatola mountain range, beginning a final stage of guerrilla warfare. Cunynghame was meanwhile removed from his authority by London, and his replacement, Lieutenant General [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Thesiger]] took over command.{{sfn|Benyon|1980|p=}}{{sfn|Lewsen|1940|p=}}\n\n=== The Guerrilla War ===\n\n[[File:Amathole mountains, indigenous forest.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Amatola Mountains]], setting for the final stage of the war.]]\nThe [[Amatola Mountains|Amatola Range]] had served as a mountain stronghold for Xhosa insurgents many times before, with its vast, dark, creeper-entwined forests.\n\nIn March 1878, British troops entered the mountain ranges to pursue Sandile's rebels but were hopelessly outmaneuvered. They were eluded, led astray and ambushed time and time again, as the rebels easily slipped past their slow-moving troop columns. Flag signalling, path systems and other techniques were tried, but to no effect. The British were very inexperienced with the environment and plagued by mismanagement, stretched supply lines, sickness and other hardships. Meanwhile, the local [[Boer Commando|Cape commandos]] (Boer and Fengu) held back, reluctant to get involved.\n\nFinally the British adopted the strategy which the locals had been recommending from the beginning. This involved dividing the vast territory into 11 military provinces and stationing a mounted garrison in each. If a rebel regiment was encountered it was chased, until it entered the next military province, where the next garrison (fresh and close to supplies) would take over the pursuit. The valley exits from the range were then fortified. Under this uninterrupted pressure the rebel forces quickly splintered and began to surrender, Sandile himself fled down into the valley of the Fish River where he was intercepted by a Fengu commando. In the final shoot out he was accidentally killed by a stray bullet. The surviving rebels were granted an amnesty.{{sfn|Ayliff|Whiteside|1912|p=}}\n\n=== Conclusion ===\n\nThe war had lasted a year and was a final blow for the last independent Xhosa state, Gcalekaland, which was now administered as a British territory.{{sfn|Gon|1982}}\n\nInitially, however, the conflict had shown no signs of being anything more than a petty intertribal quarrel. Neither the [[Cape Colony|Cape Government]] nor the Xhosa had desired a war. Had Bartle Frere not moved to the frontier and drawn the conflict into Britain's greater Confederation scheme, it would almost definitely have remained as only a brief patch of localised ethnic strife.{{sfn|Gon|1982}}\n\nOnce the broader conflict had been ignited, however, the result was the annexation of all remaining Xhosa territory under British control. The war also led Britain to overthrow the Cape Colony's elected government.{{sfn|Mostert|1992|p=}}\n\nBartle Frere next applied the same tactics to invade the independent [[Zulu Kingdom]] in 1879. In the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] the disastrous use of Britain's slow-moving troop columns was once again demonstrated at [[battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]]. Although Frere was recalled for misconduct in 1880, and the Confederation scheme was dropped, the new series of \"Confederation Wars\" was to last over the next 20 years. These wars would see the ending of all Black independence in [[southern Africa]] and eventually build up to the great [[Anglo-Boer War]] decades later.<ref>''Illustrated History of South Africa''.

These events were the longest-running military action in the history of [[Colonialism in Africa|African colonialism]].{{efn|I am indebted to Dr C. C. Saunders for this term {{sfn|Peires|1979|p=51}} }}{{sfn|Peires|1976|p=1}}\n\nThe reality of the conflicts between the Europeans and Xhosa involves a balance of tension. At times, tensions existed between the various Europeans in the Cape region, tensions between Empire administration and colonial governments, and tensions within the Xhosa Kingdom, e.g. chiefs rivalling each other, which usually led to Europeans taking advantage of the situation to meddle in Xhosa politics. A perfect example of this is the case of chief Ngqika and his uncle, chief Ndlambe.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Cape Colony00.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of the Cape Colony in 1809, showing its eastward expansion]]\n\nThe first European settlers in the Cape were the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], who established a small supply station in 1652 at present-day [[Cape Town]] for their trading ships to stop for supplies en route to and from the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]]. European settlement in and around Cape Town later spread into the valleys. By the second half of the 18th century, Europeans, predominantly [[trekboers]], moved eastward up the coast and encountered the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] in the region of the [[Great Fish River]]. The Xhosa were already established in the area and herded cattle. Competition for land ensued, particularly after the arrival of [[1820 Settlers|several groups of British settlers]] in 1820.\n\nThe Europeans invaded using force when land, they had originally seized, restricted them from expanding their stock farming activities. The [[Dutch East India Company]], which was responsible for what is referred to as \"founding\" several urban areas, like towns and cities in already populated areas of the west of South Africa, continually changed the boundaries in the [[Cape Colony]], establishing the [[Great Fish River]] as the eastern frontier in 1778.<ref name=\"Invasion\">[http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/conquest-eastern-cape-1779-1878 2011. Conquest of the Eastern Cape 1779-1878. SA History. Accessed 13 March.]</ref>\n\n== Early conflicts ==\n=== First war (1779\u20131781) ===\n\nThe First Xhosa War broke out in 1779 between [[Boer]] frontiersmen and the Xhosa. In December 1779, an armed clash occurred, resulting from allegations of cattle theft by Xhosa people. This led to [[Adreaan Van Jaarsveld]] capturing a large number of cattle from the Xhosa and claiming to have driven them out of [[Albany, South Africa|Zuurveld]] by July 1781.<ref name=sa>[http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/conquest-eastern-cape-1779-1878 Conquest of the Eastern Cape]</ref>\n\n=== Second war (1789\u201393) ===\n\nThe second war involved a larger territory. It started when the [[Gqunukhwebe]] clans of the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] started to penetrate back into the [[Albany, South Africa|Zuurveld]], a district between the Great Fish and the [[Sundays River]]s. Some frontiersmen, under Barend Lindeque, allied themselves with Ndlambe (regent of the Western Xhosas) to repel the Gqunukhwebe. Panic ensued and farms were abandoned.<ref name=sa/>\n\n=== Third war (1799-1803) ===\n\nThe third war started in January 1799 with a Xhosa rebellion that General T.P. Vandeleur crushed. Discontented [[Khoikhoi]] then revolted, joined with the Xhosa in the Zuurveld, and started attacking, retaking land through farms occupied by whites, reaching Oudtshoorn by July 1799. Commandos from Graaf-Reinet and Swellendam then started fighting in a string of clashes. Fearing general Khoi rising, the government made peace with the Xhosa and allowed them to stay in Zuurveld. In 1801, another Graaff-Reinet rebellion started forcing more Khoi desertions and farm abandonments. The commandos could achieve no result, so in February 1803 a peace was arranged, leaving the Xhosas still in Zuurveld.<ref name=sa/>\n\n== Start of British involvement ==\n\n=== Fourth War (1811\u201312){{anchor|Graham's Expedition}} ===\n\nThe Fourth War was the first experienced under British rule. The Zuurveld acted as a buffer zone between the Cape Colony and Xhosa territory, empty of the Boers and British to the west and the Xhosa to the east. In 1811, the Xhosa occupied the area, and flashpoint conflicts with the settlers followed. A mixed force under Colonel [[John Graham (British Army officer)|John Graham]]  that included British soldiers drove the Xhosa back beyond the Fish River in an effort that the first Governor of the [[Cape Colony]], Lt-General [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|John Cradock]], characterized as involving no more bloodshed \"than was necessary to impress on the minds of these savages a proper degree of terror and respect\".{{sfn|Thompson|2001|p=55}} About four thousand British immigrants subsequently (after the fifth war) settled on the Fish River. \"Graham's Town\" arose on the site of Colonel Graham's headquarters; in time this became [[Grahamstown]].\n\n=== Fifth War (1818\u201319) ===\n\nThe fifth frontier war, also known as the \"War of Nxele\", initially developed from an 1817 judgment by the Cape Colony government about stolen cattle and their restitution by the Xhosa.<ref>[http://www.frontierwars.co.za/ninth.htm \"The Nine Frontier Wars\"], Frontier Legends Historical Tours.</ref> An issue of overcrowding brought on a civil war between the [[Gaika people|Ngqika]] (royal clan of the Rharhabe Xhosa) and the [[Gcaleka]] Xhosa (those that remained in their homeland). A Cape Colony-Ngqika defence treaty legally required military assistance to the Ngqika request (1818).\n\nThe Xhosa prophet-chief [[Maqana Nxele]] (or Makana) emerged at this time and promised \u201cto turn bullets into water.\u201d Under the command of [[ImiDushane|Mdushane]], [[AmaNdlambe]]'s son, Maqana led a 10,000 Xhosa force attack (22 April 1819) on [[Battle of Grahamstown|Grahamstown]], which was held by 350 troops. A [[Khoikhoi]] group led by Jan Boesak enabled the garrison to repulse Maqana, who suffered the loss of 1,000 Xhosa. Maqana was eventually captured and imprisoned on [[Robben Island]].\n\nThe British pushed the Xhosa further east beyond the Fish River to the [[Keiskamma River]]. The resulting empty territory was designated as a buffer zone for loyal Africans' settlements, but was declared to be off limits for either side's military occupation. It came to be known as the \"Ceded Territories\". The Albany district was established in 1820, on the Cape's side of the Fish River, and was populated with some [[1820 Settlers|5,000 Britons]]. The Grahamstown battle site continues to be called \"Egazini\" (\"Place of Blood\"), and a monument was erected there for the fallen Xhosa in 2001.{{efn|As of 2016 the Egazini monument has been vandalised and is in a bad state <ref>{{youtube|id=ger_2GturZI|title=Are heritage sites under threat in Makana?}}</ref>}}\n\n===Battle of Amalinde===\n{{Main|Battle of Amalinde|Ngqika people}}\n\nDuring the Fifth Frontier War in 1818, after a two-decade long conflict, Chief [[Ngqika]] ka Mlawu and his uncle Ndlambe\u2019s people clashed again in a battle called the [[Battle of Amalinde]] over several issues, including land ownership. The chief appointed his eldest son Maqoma (despite him lacking experience in battle) and the renowned Jingqi to lead the fight that lasted from midday to the evening. Ngqika was defeated, losing about 500 men during what is considered the bloodiest and most famous clash between [[Xhosa people]] in history.\n\n== Sixth war (1834\u201336) ==\n[[File:Eastern Frontier, Cape of Good Hope, ca 1835.png|thumb|300px|Eastern frontier of the colony, c. 1835\n{{legend|PaleGreen|Settled colonial area, showing districts established in 1820 (in various shades)}}\n{{legend|white|Neutral zone since 1820, as agreed by [[Lord Charles Somerset|Lord Somerset]] and the [[Ngqika|Gaika]] (Xhosa)}}\n{{legend|yellow|Tribal areas under British administration}}\n{{legend|red|Military forts and district boundaries}}]]\n\nThe earlier Xhosa Wars did not quell British-Xhosa tension in the Cape's eastern border at the Keiskamma River. Insecurity persisted because the Xhosa remained expelled from territory (especially the so-called \"Ceded Territories\") that was then settled by Europeans and other African peoples. They were also subjected to territorial expansions from other Africans that were themselves under pressure from the expanding [[Zulu Kingdom]]. Nevertheless, the frontier region was seeing increasing amounts of admixture between Europeans, Khoikhoi, and Xhosa living and trading throughout the frontier region. The vacillation by the Cape Government's policy towards the return of the Xhosa to areas they previously inhabited did not dissipate Xhosa frustration toward the inability to provide for themselves, and they thus resorted to frontier cattle-raiding.\n\n=== Outbreak ===\n\nCape responses to the Xhosa cattle raids varied, but in some cases were drastic and violent.On 11 December 1834, a Cape government commando party killed a chief of high rank, incensing the Xhosa: an army of 10,000 men, led by [[Maqoma]], a brother of the chief who had been killed, swept across the frontier into the Cape Colony, pillaged and burned the homesteads, and killed all who resisted. Among the worst sufferers was a colony of freed Khoikhoi who, in 1829, had been settled in the [[Kat River Valley]] by the British authorities. Refugees from the farms and villages took to the safety of Grahamstown, where women and children found refuge in the church.\n\n=== British campaign ===\n\nThe response was swift and multifaceted. [[Boer commando]]s mobilised under [[Piet Retief]] and inflicted a defeat on the Xhosa in the [[Winterberg, Eastern Cape|Winterberg Mountains]] in the north. Burgher and Khoi commandos also mobilised, and British Imperial troops arrived via [[Algoa Bay]].\n\nThe British governor, [[Benjamin d'Urban|Sir Benjamin d'Urban]], mustered the combined forces under [[Harry Smith (army)|Colonel Sir Harry Smith]],<ref>Smith, Sir Harry. \u2018\u2019The Autobiography of Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Smith Baronet of Aliwal on the Sutlej.\u2019\u2019 Publisher: John Murray,  Albemarle Street 1903 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57094/57094-h/57094-h.htm] </ref> who reached Grahamstown on 6 January 1835, six days after news of the uprising had reached Cape Town. It was from Grahamstown that the retaliatory campaign was launched and directed.\n\nThe campaign inflicted a string of defeats on the Xhosa, such as at Trompetter's Drift on the Fish River, and most of the Xhosa chiefs surrendered. However, the two primary Xhosa leaders, Maqoma and Tyali, retreated to the fastnesses of the [[Amatola Mountains]].\n\n=== The treaty ===\n\nBritish governor [[Benjamin d'Urban|Sir Benjamin d'Urban]] believed that [[Hintsa ka Khawuta]], Paramount-Chief of the [[Gcaleka]] Xhosa, commanded authority over all of the Xhosa tribes and therefore held him responsible for the initial attack on the Cape Colony, and for the looted cattle. D'Urban came to the frontier in December 1834, and led a large force across the [[Great Kei River|Kei river]] to confront Hintsa at his residence and dictate terms to him.\n\nThe terms stated that all the country from the Cape's prior frontier, the Keiskamma River, as far as the Great Kei River, was annexed as the British [[British Kaffraria|\"Queen Adelaide Province\"]], and its inhabitants declared British subjects. A site for the seat of the province's government was selected and named [[King William\u2019s Town]]. The new province was declared to be for the settlement of loyal tribes, rebel tribes who replaced their leadership, and the [[Fengu people|Fengu]] (known to the Europeans as the \"Fingo people\"), who had recently arrived fleeing from the Zulu armies and had been living under Xhosa subjection. Magistrates were appointed to administer the territory in the hope that they would gradually, with the help of missionaries, undermine tribal authority. Hostilities finally died down on 17 September 1836, after having continued for nine months.\n\n=== The killing of Paramount-Chief Hintsa ===\n[[File:Chief Hintsa of the Gcaleka Xhosa.jpg|thumb|The murder of Chief Hintsa is an enduring atrocity in the memory of the Xhosa nation.]]\n\nOriginally assured of his personal safety during the treaty negotiations, Hintsa rapidly found himself held hostage and pressured with massive demands for cattle \"restitution\". Other sources say he offered himself as a hostage until the indemnity was paid and even suggested that he accompany Colonel Smith in collecting Xhosa cattle.{{sfn|Ransford|1974|p=20}} He attempted to escape at the Nqabarha River but was pursued, pulled off his horse, and immobilized with shots through the back and the leg. Immediately, a soldier named George Southey (brother of colonial administrator [[Richard Southey (colonial administrator)|Sir Richard Southey]]) came up behind Hintsa and shot him in the back of the head; furthermore, Hintsa's ears were cut off after his death. Other sources say his horse bolted and Harry Smith tried to shoot the fleeing man but both his pistols misfired. Giving chase, he caught hold of Hintsa and dragged him heavily to the ground. Hintsa was still full of fight. \"He was jabbing at me furiously with his assegai,\" Colonel Smith recalled in his autobiography, and the chief succeeded in breaking away to find cover in a nearby stream bed. There, while pleading for mercy, the top of his skull was blown off by one of Smith's officers and his body was afterwards mutilated by British and colonial troops.{{sfn|Ransford|1974|p=20}} These actions shocked the government in London, which condemned and repudiated Governor D\u2019Urban. Hintsa's murder angered the Xhosa for decades thereafter.\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nBy the end of the war, 7,000 people of all races were left homeless.\n\nThe settlement of the Fengu in the annexed territory had far-reaching consequences. This wandering nation claimed to be escaping oppression at the hands of the Gcaleka and, in return for the land they were given by the Cape, they became the [[Cape Colony]]'s formidable allies. They swiftly acquired firearms and formed mounted commandos for the defense of their new land. In the following wars, they fought alongside the Cape Colony as invaluable allies, not as subordinates, and won considerable renown and respect for their martial ability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newhistory.co.za/part-1-chapter-3-an-unstable-frontier-the-role-of-soldiers-and-military-hintsa-s-war/ |title=An Unstable Frontier The Role Of Soldiers And Military Hintsa\u2019s War |publisher=New History |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe conflict was the catalyst for [[Piet Retief]]'s manifesto and the [[Great Trek]]. In total, 40 farmers (Boers) were killed and 416 farmhouses were burnt down. In addition, 5,700 horses, 115,000 head of cattle, and 162,000 sheep were plundered by Xhosa tribespeople. In retaliation, sixty thousand Xhosa cattle were taken or retaken by [[1820 Settlers|colonists]].\n\nThe British minister of colonies, [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Lord Glenelg]], repudiated d'Urban's actions and accused the Boer retaliation against cattle raiders as being what instigated the conflict. As a result, the Boer community lost faith in the British justice system and often took the law into their own hands when cattle rustlers were caught.\n\nThe territorial expansion and creation of \"Queen Adelaide Province\" was also condemned by London as being uneconomical and unjust. The province was disannexed in December 1836, the Cape's border was re-established at the Keiskamma river, and new treaties were made with the chiefs responsible for order beyond the Fish River.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/conquest-eastern-cape-1779-1878 |title=Conquest of the Eastern Cape 1779-1878 &#124; South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\n== Interlude: Stockenstr\u00f6m's treaty system ==\n[[File:Andries Stockenstrom - Cape Colony Archives.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Andries Stockenstr\u00f6m]], 1st Baronet, and veteran of several Xhosa wars]]\n\nIn the aftermath of the previous frontier war, the new lieutenant-governor of the Eastern Province, [[Andries Stockenstr\u00f6m]], instituted a completely new border policy. Stockenstr\u00f6m, who professed considerable respect for the Xhosa, developed a system of formal treaties to guard the border and return any stolen cattle from either side (cattle raiding was a regular grievance). Diplomatic agents were exchanged between the [[Cape Colony]] and the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa Chiefs]] as reliable \"ambassadors\", and colonial expansion into Xhosa land was forbidden. Land annexed from the Xhosa in the previous war was also returned and the displaced Xhosa moved back into this land, assuaging overpopulation in the Xhosa territories.\n\nIn the framework of this new system, the frontier settled and saw nearly a decade of peace. The Xhosa chiefs generally honoured Stockenstr\u00f6m's treaty and returned any cattle that their people had raided. On the Cape side, Stockenstr\u00f6m, who saw the major problem as being the land management of the colonists, used his influence to rein in the frontier settlers and prevent any expansion onto Xhosa land. A level of trust also began to develop, and the Xhosa chiefs came to hold Stockenstr\u00f6m in exceptionally high regard as a man who, although he had defeated the Xhosa armies on multiple occasions, nonetheless treated them as diplomatic equals.\n\nThe treaty system began to unravel as the settlers gained a determined leader and spokesman in the form of [[Robert Godlonton]], who led a large colonist movement to dismantle Stockenstr\u00f6m's system and allow seizure of Xhosa lands. As one settler ominously declared of the Xhosa territory: ''\"The appearance of the country is very fine, it will make excellent sheep farms.\"'' Godlonton also used his considerable influence in the religious institutions of the Cape to drive his opinions, declaring that: ''\"the British race was selected by God himself to colonize Kaffraria\"''.{{sfn|Ross|1999|p=63-}}\n\nIn the face of massive pressure and ruinous lawsuits, Stockenstr\u00f6m was eventually dismissed and the new British governor, Maitland, abrogated the treaties.<ref name=\"newhistory1\">{{cite web|url=http://newhistory.co.za/part-1-chapter-3-a-quest-for-a-treaty-stockenstrom-godlonton-and-bowker/ |title=A Quest For A Treaty Stockenstrom, Godlonton And Bowker |publisher=New History |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Seventh War}} Seventh war (1846\u201347) ==\n[[File:Mfengu soldier of Cape Colony - Fingo People.jpg|thumb|The '''Fengu''' (''\"Fingoes\"''), known across southern Africa as skilled gunmen, were invaluable allies of the Cape Colony in its frontier wars.]]\n\nThe Seventh Xhosa War is often referred to as the \"War of the Axe\" or the \"Amatola War\". On the [[Cape Colony|colonial side]], two main groups were involved: columns of imperial British troops sent from London, and local mixed-race ''\"Burgher forces\"'', which were mainly Khoi, Fengu, [[British people|British]] settlers and [[Boer commando]]s, led by their commander-in-chief, [[Andries Stockenstr\u00f6m]]. Relations between the British Imperial troops and the local commandos broke down completely during the war.\n\nOn the Xhosa side, the [[Ngqika]] (known to the Europeans as the \"Gaika\") were the chief tribe engaged in the war, assisted by portions of the [[Ndlambe ka Rarabe|Ndlambe]]{{sfn|Cana|1911|p=239}} and the [[Thembu]]. The Xhosa forces were over 10 times greater in number, and had by this time replaced their traditional weapons with firearms. It was their new use of guns that made the Xhosa considerably more effective in fighting the British. Both sides engaged in the widespread use of [[scorched earth tactics]].{{sfn|SAH staff|2012}}\n\nChief [[Mgolombane Sandile]] led the Ngqika people in the Seventh Frontier War (1846\u201347), Eighth Frontier War (1850\u201353) and the Ninth Frontier War (1877\u201378), in which he was killed. These clashes marked the beginning of the use of firearms by Xhosa armies, scoring many victories for Chief Sandile, gaining him a reputation as a Xhosa hero and mighty warrior.<ref name=\"Sandile\u2019s grave\">[2008. Nienaber WC, Steyn M and Hutten L.The grave of King Mgolombane Sandile Ngqika: Revisiting the legend. South African Archaeological Bulletin. Accessed 13 March.]</ref> \n\n=== Background ===\nTension had been simmering between farmers and marauders, on both sides of the frontier, since the dismantlement of Stockenstrom's treaty system. Governor Maitland imposed a new system of treaties on the chiefs without consulting them, while a severe drought forced desperate Xhosa to engage in cattle raids across the frontier in order to survive. In addition, politician [[Robert Godlonton]] continued to use his newspaper the ''Graham's Town Journal'' to agitate for [[1820 Settlers|Eastern Cape settlers]] to annex and settle the land that had been returned to the Xhosa after the previous war.\n\nThe event that actually ignited the war was a trivial dispute over a raid. A Khoi escort was transporting a manacled Xhosa thief to Grahamstown to be tried for stealing an axe, when Xhosa raiders attacked and killed the Khoi escort. The Xhosa refused to surrender the murderer and war broke out in March 1846.\n<ref name=\"newhistory1\"/>\n\n=== Initial British setbacks ===\n[[File:War of the Axe - Sketch of shootout between British Imperial Troops and Xhosa Soldiers - Amatola Mnts June 1851.png|thumb|left|Sketch of the shoot-out as British Imperial Troops attempt to storm Sandile's position in the Amatola Mountains.]]\n[[File:1850 frontier shoot-out - between Xhosa and long British wagon train.jpg|thumb|Shoot-out between Xhosa and long, slow-moving British army column.]]\n\nThe regular British forces suffered initial setbacks. A British column sent to confront the Ngqika chief, [[Mgolombane Sandile]], was temporarily delayed at the Amatola Mountains, and the attacking Xhosa were able to capture the centre of the three mile long wagon train which was not being defended, carrying away the British officer's supply of wine and other supplies.\n\nLarge numbers of Xhosa then poured across the border as the outnumbered imperial troops fell back, abandoning their outposts. The only successful resistance was from the local Fengu, who heroically defended their villages from the far larger Xhosa forces.\n\nOn 28 May, a force of 8,000 Xhosa attacked the last remaining British garrison, at Fort Peddie, but fell back after a long shootout with British and Fengu troops. The Xhosa army then marched on Grahamstown itself, but was held up when a sizable army of Ndlambe Xhosa were defeated on 7 June 1846 by [[Henry Somerset (British Army officer)|General Somerset]] on the [[Gwangu]], a few miles from Fort Peddie. However the slow-moving British columns, like the Xhosa, were considerably hampered by drought and were becoming desperate.\n\nAfter much debate, they were forced to call in Stockenstr\u00f6m and the local Burgher forces.{{sfn|SAH staff|1836}}{{sfn|SAH staff|loc=1800s time-line}}\n\n=== The local Burghers' campaign ===\n[[File:Boers 1881.gif|thumb|Mobile mounted commandos were highly effective in the mountainous frontier terrain.]]\n\nThe local Commandos were much more effective in the rough and mountainous terrain, of which they had considerable local knowledge.\n\nAfter inflicting a string of defeats on the Ngqika, Stockenstr\u00f6m took a small and select group of his mounted commandos across the Colony's border and rapidly pushed into the independent Xhosa lands beyond the frontier. They rode deep into the [[Transkei]] Xhosa heartland, directly towards the kraal of [[Sarili kaHintsa|Sarhili]] (\"Kreli\"), the paramount chief of all the Xhosa.\nDue in part to the speed of their approach, they were barely engaged by Xhosa forces and rode directly into Sarhili's capital.{{sfn|Stockenstrom|Shippard|1964|p=}}\n\nParamount Chief Sarhili and his generals agreed to meet Stockenstr\u00f6m (with his commandants [[Christian Groepe|Groepe]], [[John Molteno|Molteno]] and [[Charles Brownlee|Brownlee]]), unarmed, on a nearby mountain ridge. The meeting was initially tense \u2013 the fathers of both Sarhili and Stockenstr\u00f6m had been killed whilst unarmed. Both men were also veterans of several frontier wars against each other and, while they treated each other with extreme respect, Stockenstr\u00f6m nonetheless made the extreme demand that Sarhili assume responsibility for any future Ngqika attacks.\n\nAfter protracted negotiations, Sarhili agreed to return any raided cattle & other property and to relinquish claims to the Ngqika land west of the Kei. He also promised to use his limited authority over the frontier Ngqika to restrain cross-border attacks.\nA treaty was signed and the commandos departed on good terms.{{sfn|Theal|1911|p=}}\n\nAlso leading his commando on this campaign was a young man named [[John Charles Molteno|John Molteno]], who in later life became the Cape's first Prime Minister. Significantly, his experience of what he believed to be the ineptitude and injustice of the British Empire's frontier policy later informed his government's decisions to oppose the British in the final frontier war.\n\n=== Later stage of the conflict ===\n[[File:Frederick Timpson I'Ons08.JPG|thumb|A column of Xhosa gunmen, crossing a ravine in the frontier mountains]]\n\nHowever, British Imperial General [[Peregrine Maitland]] rejected the treaty and sent an insulting letter back to the Xhosa paramount-chief, demanding greater acts of submission and servility. Furious, Stockenstr\u00f6m and his local commandos resigned and departed from the war, leaving the British and the Xhosa \u2013 both starving and afflicted by fever \u2013 to a long, drawn-out war of attrition.\n\nThe effects of the drought were worsened through the use, by both sides, of [[scorched earth tactics]]. Gradually, as the armies weakened, the conflict subsided into waves of petty and bloody recriminations. At one point, violence flared up again after Ngqika tribesmen supposedly stole four goats from the neighbouring Kat River Settlement. When the rains came, floods turned the surrounding lands into a quagmire. The violence slowly wound down as both sides weakened, immobile and fever-ridden.\n\nThe war continued until Sandile was captured during negotiations and sent to Grahamstown. Although Sandile was soon released, the other chiefs gradually stopped fighting, and by the end of 1847 the Xhosa had been completely subdued after 21 months of fighting.{{sfn|Cana|1911|p=239}}<ref>{{cite web|ref=harv |url=http://www.southafricaholiday.org.uk/history/hist_xhosawars1840-78.htm |title=South Africa Holiday: Xhosa frontier wars 1840-78 |accessdate= 1 March 2012}} {{better source|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n\n\u200aIn the last month of the war (December 1847) Sir Harry Smith reached Cape Town as governor of the colony, and on the 23rd, at a meeting of the Xhosa chiefs, announced the annexation of the country between the Keiskamma and the Kei rivers to the British crown, thus reabsorbing the territory abandoned by order of Lord Glenelg. It was not, however, incorporated with the Cape Colony, but made a crown dependency under the name of [[British Kaffraria]] Colony,{{sfn|Cana|1911|p=239}} with King William's Town as capital.\n\n== {{anchor|Eighth War}} Eighth war (1850\u201353) ==\n{{main|Eighth Xhosa War}}\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:CAPE MOUNTED RIFLES IN 8TH FRONTIER WAR.jpg|thumb|The [[Cape Mounted Riflemen]] charging the enemy at Waterkloof during the 8th Frontier War]]\n\nLarge numbers of Xhosa were displaced across the Keiskamma by Governor Harry Smith, and these refugees supplemented the original inhabitants there, causing overpopulation and hardship. Those Xhosa who remained in the colony were moved to towns and encouraged to adopt European lifestyles.\n\nHarry Smith also attacked and annexed the independent [[Orange Free State]], hanging the Boer resistance leaders, and in the process alienating the Burghers of the Cape Colony. To cover the mounting expenses he then imposed exorbitant taxes on the local people of the frontier and cut the Cape's standing forces to less than five thousand men.\n\nIn June 1850 there followed an unusually cold winter, together with an extreme drought. It was at this time that Smith ordered the displacement of large numbers of Xhosa squatters from the Kat River region.\n\nThe war became known as \"Mlanjeni's War\", after the prophet Mlanjeni who arose among the homeless Xhosa, and who predicted that the Xhosa would be unaffected by the colonists' bullets. Large numbers of Xhosa began leaving the colony's towns and mobilizing in the tribal areas.\n\n=== The Outbreak of War (December 1850) ===\n[[File:Chief Maqoma - Xhosa Wars.jpg|thumb|Chief Maqoma. Xhosa military leader in several of the frontier wars]]\n\nBelieving that the chiefs were responsible for the unrest caused by Mlanjeni's preaching, Governor Sir Harry Smith travelled to meet with the prominent chiefs. When Sandile refused to attend a meeting outside [[Fort Cox, Eastern Cape|Fort Cox]], Governor Smith deposed him and declared him a fugitive. On 24 December, a British detachment of 650 men under Colonel Mackinnon was ambushed by Xhosa warriors in the Boomah Pass. The party was forced to retreat to [[Fort White, Eastern Cape|Fort White]], under heavy fire from the Xhosa, having sustained forty-two casualties. The very next day, during Christmas festivities in towns throughout the border region, apparently friendly Xhosa entered the towns to partake in the festivities. At a given signal though, they fell upon the settlers who had invited them into their homes and killed them. With this attack, the bulk of the Ngqika joined the war.\n\n=== Initial Xhosa victories ===\n\nWhile the Governor was still at Fort Cox, the Xhosa forces advanced on the colony, isolating him there. The Xhosa burned British military villages along the frontier and captured the post at Line Drift. Meanwhile, the Khoi of the [[Blinkwater River Valley]] and Kat River Settlement revolted, under the leadership of a half-Khoi, half-Xhosa chief Hermanus Matroos, and managed to capture [[Fort Armstrong (South Africa)|Fort Armstrong]]. Large numbers of the \"Kaffir Police\" \u2014 a paramilitary police force the British had established to combat cattle theft \u2014 deserted their posts and joined Xhosa war parties. For a while, it appeared that all of the Xhosa and Khoi people of the eastern Cape were taking up arms against the British.\n\nHarry Smith finally fought his way out of Fort Cox with the help of the local [[Cape Mounted Riflemen]], but found that he had alienated most of his local allies. His policies had made enemies of the Burghers and Boer Commandos, the Fengu, and the Khoi, who formed much of the Cape's local defences. Even some of the Cape Mounted Riflemen refused to fight.{{sfn|Abbink|Peires|1989|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}}\n\n=== British counter-attack (January 1851) ===\nAfter these initial successes, however, the Xhosa experienced a series of setbacks. Xhosa forces were repulsed in separate attacks on Fort White and [[Fort Hare]]. Similarly, on 7 January, Hermanus and his supporters launched an offensive on the town of [[Fort Beaufort]], which was defended by a small detachment of troops and local volunteers. The attack failed however, and Hermanus was killed. The Cape Government also eventually agreed to levy a force of local gunmen (predominantly Khoi) to hold the frontier, allowing Smith to free some imperial troops for offensive action.{{sfn|Abbink|Bruijn|Walraven|2008|p={{Page needed|date=March 2012}}}}\n\nBy the end of the month of January, the British were beginning to receive reinforcements from [[Cape Town]] and a force under Colonel Mackinnon was able to drive north from [[King William's Town]] to resupply the beleaguered garrisons at [[Fort White, Eastern Cape|Fort White]], [[Fort Cox, Eastern Cape|Fort Cox]] and [[Fort Hare]]. With fresh men and supplies, the British expelled the remainder of Hermanus' rebel forces (now under the command of Willem Uithaalder) from Fort Armstrong and drove them west toward the [[Amathole Mountains|Amatola Mountains]]. Over the coming months, increasing numbers of Imperial troops arrived, reinforcing the heavily outnumbered British and allowing Smith to lead sweeps across the frontier country.\n\nIn 1852, [[HMS Birkenhead (1845)|HMS Birkenhead]] was wrecked at [[Gansbaai]] while bringing reinforcements to the war at the request of [[Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet|Sir Harry Smith]]. As the ship sank, the men (mostly new recruits) stood silently in rank, while the women and children were loaded into the lifeboats. They remained in rank as the ship slipped under and over 300 died.\n\n=== Final stages of the conflict ===\n[[File:Ambush of British Column - Xhosa wars.jpg|thumb|A British column (74th Highlanders) under ambush in the Waterkloof forests]]\n\nInsurgents led by Maqoma established themselves in the forested Waterkloof. From this base they managed to plunder surrounding farms and torch the homesteads. Maqoma's stronghold was situated on Mount Misery, a natural fortress on a narrow neck wedged between the Waterkloof and Harry's Kloof. The Waterkloof conflicts lasted two years. Maqoma also led an attack on Fort Fordyce and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of Sir Harry Smith.\n\nIn February 1852, the British Government decided that Sir Harry Smith's inept rule had been responsible for much of the violence, and ordered him replaced by [[George Cathcart]], who took charge in March. For the last six months, Cathcart ordered scourings of the countryside for rebels. In February 1853, Sandile and the other chiefs surrendered.\n\nThe 8th frontier war was the most bitter and brutal in the series of Xhosa wars. It lasted over two years and ended in the complete subjugation of the Ciskei Xhosa.\n\n== Cattle-killing movement (1856\u201358) ==\n{{main|History of Cape Colony from 1806 to 1870#Xhosa cattle-killing movement and famine (1854-1858)}}\n[[File:Nongqawuse and Nonkosi.jpg|thumb|Nongqawuse (right) with fellow prophetess, Nonkosi]]\n\nThe great Cattle-killing was a [[Millenarianism|millennialist movement]] which began among the Xhosa in 1856, and led them to destroy their own means of subsistence in the belief that it would bring about salvation by supernatural spirits.\n\nIn April 1856 the 16-year-old Xhosa [[prophet]]ess [[Nongqawuse]] began to declare that she had received a message from the Xhosa people's ancestors, promising deliverance from their hardships. She preached that the ancestors would return from the afterlife in huge numbers, drive all Europeans into the sea, and give the Xhosa bounteous gifts of horses, sheep, goats, dogs, fowls, and all manner of clothing and food in great amounts. They would also restore the elderly to youth and would usher in a utopian era of prosperity. However, she declared that the dead ancestors would only enact this on condition that the Xhosa first destroyed all their means of subsistence. They needed to kill all of their cattle and burn all of their crops.\n\nAt first no one believed Nongquwuse's prophecy and the Xhosa nation ignored her prophecy. But when Chief [[Sarhili]] began to kill his cattle, more and more people began to believe that Nongquwuse was an ''igqirha'' (diviner) who could communicate with the ancestors. They too killed their cattle and destroyed their crops. The cult grew and built up momentum, sweeping across the eastern Cape. The government authorities of the [[Cape Colony]] feared chaos, famine and economic collapse, so they desperately appealed in vain to the Xhosa to ignore the prophecies. They even arrested Nongqawuse herself for disturbance caused.\n\nThe return of the [[Ancestor worship|ancestors]] was predicted to occur on 18 February 1857. The Xhosa, especially chief Sarhili of the Gcalekas, heeded the demand to destroy food sources and clothes and enforced it on others throughout the country. When the day came, the Xhosa nation waited en masse for the momentous events to occur, only to be bitterly disappointed. With no means of subsistence, famine set in.\n\nThe cattle killings continued into 1858, leading to the starvation of thousands. Disease was also spread from the cattle killings. This gave the settlers power over the remainder of the Xhosa nation who were often forced to turn to the colonists for food, blankets and other relief.<ref>{{cite web |first=Alistair |last=Boddy-Evans |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/glossaryc/g/def_CattleKill.htm |title=Cattle-Killings (1856\u201357)|publisher=About.com Guide|accessdate=29 July 2010}} {{better source|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Ninth war (1877\u201379) ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Cape Colony map 1876 - Eve of Confederation Wars.jpg|thumb|Map of southern Africa on the eve of the final frontier war (1876)]]\n\nThe ninth and final frontier war  \u2014 also known as the \"Fengu-Gcaleka War\" or \"Ngcayechibi's War\", the latter being the name of the headman at whose feast the initial bar fight occurred \u2014 involved several competing powers: the [[Cape Colony]] Government and its Fengu allies, the British Empire, and the Xhosa armies (Gcaleka and Ngqika). The Cape Colony addressed local needs through their own devices, creating a period of peace and prosperity, and achieved partial independence from Britain with \"[[Responsible Government]]\"; it had relatively little interest in territorial expansion. The frontier was policed lightly using small, highly mobile, mounted mixed-race commandos that were recruited locally from Boer, Fengu, Khoi and settler frontier peoples. The [[Cape Qualified Franchise|multi-racial franchise]], and legal recognition for indigenous systems of land tenure, had also gone some way to easing frontier tensions. Any further intrusion of the British government in Cape affairs to disrupt this state was thought unnecessary and ill-advised.\n\nThe British Government sought to increase control in [[History of the Cape Colony from 1870 to 1899|southern Africa]] by uniting all the states of the region into a [[Confederation]] under the overall rule of the British Empire, the same policy that was successfully applied to Canada. This Confederation scheme required that the remaining independent Black States be annexed; a frontier war was seen as an ideal opportunity for such a conquest. Both the Cape Colony and Xhosa shared the view that actions to achieve such a scheme at that time would create instability.\n\nThe integration of the [[Black African]] population of the frontier into the life patterns and practices of the Cape Colony had developed unevenly. The Fengu had rapidly adapted to and accepted the changes coming to southern Africa by taking to urban trade. The Gcaleka Xhosa resided predominately in the independent [[Gcaleka]] land to the east and had suffered greatly from the effects of war, alcoholism and [[Nongqawuse]]'s cattle killing. They bitterly resented the material success of the Fengu, although some Gcaleka lived within the Cape's borders.\n\nA series of devastating droughts across the Transkei threatened the relative peace which had prevailed for the previous few decades. In the memorable summary of the historian De Kiewiet: ''\"In South Africa, the heat of drought easily becomes the fever of war.\"''<ref>Kiewiet, Cornelis W. de (1941), ''A History of South Africa, Social and Economic''., Oxford, England: Clarendon Press. p.105</ref> The drought had started in 1875 in Gcalekaland and had spread to other parts of the Transkei and Basutoland, as well as to the Cape Colony controlled Ciskei. By 1877, it had become the most severe drought ever recorded.{{sfn|Hone|1993|p=68}} In 1877, the ethnic tensions began to emerge, particularly between the [[Mfengu]], the [[Thembu]] and the Gcaleka Xhosa.{{sfn|Oliver|Fage|Sanderson|1985|p=387}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.ru.ac.za/1761/1/Spicer-MA-TR78-38.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312212856/http://eprints.ru.ac.za/1761/1/Spicer-MA-TR78-38.pdf |archivedate=12 March 2014 }}</ref>{{sfn|Bundy|1979|p=83}} A wedding celebration in September 1877 was the scene of a bar fight when the tensions emerged after Gcaleka harassed the Fengu in attendance. Later in the same day, Gcaleka attacked a Cape Colony police outpost, which was manned predominantly by a Fengu ethnic police force.\n\n=== Outbreak ===\n[[File:Chief Sarili - Kreli - with councillors.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Chief Sarhili (centre seated) was under pressure from belligerent factions of his own government.]]\n\nIn September 1877 the Cape Colony government rejected the second attempt to implement the [[History of the Cape Colony from 1870 to 1899|Confederation scheme]], this time put forth by Governor [[Henry Bartle Frere]]. The attack by the Gcaleka on the predominantly Fengu ethnic police force at a Cape Colony police outpost was thought by the Cape Colony government as tribal violence best left for local police management. Frere used the incident as a pretext for British conquest of the independent neighbouring state of Gcalekaland. Sarhili, the paramount-chief of Gcalekaland, was summoned by Frere, but declined the invitation in fear of arrest and coercion. Frere wrote to him to declare him deposed and at war.{{sfn|Malherbe|1971|p=}} Frere contacted radical settler groups who desired British intervention and cheap Xhosa labour to work their farms, and did not quell rumours of an impending Xhosa invasion.\n\n=== The Cape Colony's War ===\n[[File:A local commando of fingoes and colonists on the cape frontier - 1878.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cape Colony militia \u2013 Fengu and Boer \u2013 on the frontier, 1878]]\n[[File:1 John Molteno - 1st Prime Minister of the Cape - 1860s - Copy2.jpg|thumb|upright|Cape Prime Minister [[John Molteno]], a supporter of local solutions to the conflict.]]\n\nChief Sarhili faced intense pressure from belligerent factions within his own government and mobilised his armies for their movement to the frontier. The Cape Government reiterated its insistence that the matter was best left to local resolution and did not constitute an international war for imperial military intervention. High-pressure negotiations by Cape Prime Minister John Charles Molteno extracted a promise from Britain that imperial troops would stay put and on no account cross the frontier. Gcaleka forces of 8000 attacked a Cape police outpost near the frontier at [[Butterworth, Eastern Cape|Ibeka]]; a fierce shoot-out followed but the Gcaleka forces were dispersed. Soon, several other outposts and stations along the frontier were coming under attack. The Cape Government now had to use all available diplomatic leverage it had to keep the British imperial forces contained.\n\nThe Cape's local paramilitaries (mounted commandos of mainly [[Boer Commando|Boer]], [[Thembu]] and Fengu origin) were deployed by Molteno under the leadership of Commander Veldman Bikitsha and [[Chief Magistrate]] [[Charles Duncan Griffith|Charles Griffith]]. The commandos swiftly engaged and defeated an army of Gcaleka gunmen. They then crossed the frontier and pushed into Gcalekaland. Dividing into three lightly equipped, fast-moving columns, the commandos devastated the Gcaleka armies, which dispersed and fled eastwards. The Cape units tracked the fleeing remnants right through Gcalekaland, stopping only when they reached neutral Bomvanaland on the far side. The war was over in three weeks. Sarhili had also recently applied for peace. With few incentives to conquer or occupy the land, and with the violence subsiding, the Cape Government recalled their commandos, who returned home and disbanded.{{sfn|Molteno|1910|p=}}\n\n=== Bartle Frere's War Council ===\n[[File:BartleFrere.jpg|thumb|upright|British Governor Bartle Frere sought to annex Gcalekaland to the British Empire.]]\n\nDuring the Cape's lightning quick campaign, Governor Frere had established a \"war-council\" at nearby [[King William's Town]] to direct the war against Gcalekaland. Frere and his Lieutenant General Sir Arthur Cunynghame were to represent the British Empire on this council, while two of Molteno's ministers, [[John X. Merriman]] and [[Charles Brownlee]], were appointed to represent local Cape interests.\n\nThe council was torn apart by argument from the beginning, as Frere refused Gcaleka appeals and worked towards full British occupation of Gcalekaland for white settlement and his future confederation. Frere also increasingly insisted on having complete imperial control of the war.\n\nThe Cape government on the other hand was reluctant to see its local Commandos brought under British imperial command, in what it considered to be essentially a local conflict, not an imperial war of conquest. The Cape had only recently attained local democracy and was extremely suspicious of Imperial infringements upon it. It also considered the slow-moving British troop columns to be absurdly unsuitable for frontier warfare \u2013 immobile, ineffective and vastly more expensive than local Cape forces. This last point of contention was chiefly exacerbated by Frere's insistence that the Cape's government pay for his imported British imperial troops, as well as its own local forces. The Cape Government wanted to fund and use only its own local forces. It did not desire British troops to operate in the Cape Colony in the first place, and especially objected to being forced to fund them.\n\nMerriman, who Molteno had appointed to oversee the Cape's war effort, initially worked hard to cooperate with Frere, but increasingly came to share Molteno's views on the ineptitude and injustice of British imperial policy in southern Africa.<ref>Cape Times: ''Correspondence, Memoranda and Minutes connected with the Dismissal of the Late Ministry''. Cape Town: Houses of Parliament Library. 1878.</ref>{{sfn|Lewsen|1982|p=}}\n\n=== The Imperial War ===\n[[File:Frontier war engagement near Ibika - 1877 Cape Colony.jpg|thumb|Engagement near Ibika \u2013 1877]]\n\nThe second stage of the war began when Frere ordered the disarmament of all Black peoples of the Cape. There was confusion and uproar from the Cape's many black soldiers and a furious protest from the Cape Government. Militia deserted and protests erupted, in the face of which Cunynghame panicked and overreacted by unilaterally deploying the imperial troops to thinly encircle the whole of [[British Kaffraria]]. Faced with growing discontent, the Cape demanded that the British Government fire Cunynghame, abandon its racial disarmament policy, and allow the Cape to deploy its (predominantly black) paramilitaries to establish order. However Frere refused and brought in Imperial troops to enforce the disarmament, and then to invade Gcalekaland once again. This time to annex it and occupy it for the purpose of white settlement.\n\nThe British initially attempted to repeat the successful strategy of the Cape's previous campaign. After similarly dividing into three columns, the slow-moving foreign troops soon became disorientated and exhausted. They were unable to engage or even to find the dispersed Gcaleka, who were swiftly moving and regrouping. As the British scoured Gcalekaland, the regrouped Gcaleka army easily slipped past them and crossed the border into the Cape Colony. Here they were joined by Sandile who led his Ngqika nation into rebellion.\n\n[[File:Mgolombane Sandile - Xhosa Chief.jpg|thumb|left|The great Chief of the Ngqika, Mgolombane Sandile, veteran of several frontier wars]]\n\nThe combined Xhosa armies laid waste to the frontier region. Fengu towns and other frontier settlements were sacked, supply lines were cut and outposts were evacuated as the British fell back.\n\nUp until now, Molteno had been heavily engaged in a high-level diplomatic battle with Britain to preserve the Cape Colony's constitutional independence. However, with the Cape's frontier collapsing in chaos, he now made for the frontier in person, where he confronted the British Governor with a heavy condemnation for bad intentions and incompetence. He demanded the free command of the Cape's indigenous forces to operate and contain the violence, making it clear that he was content to sacrifice his job rather than tolerate further British interference.\n\nFrere's next move was to appeal to the authority of the [[British Colonial Office]] to formally dissolve the elected Cape government, which was now stubbornly standing in the way of the British Empire, and assume direct imperial control over the entire country.{{sfn|von Welfling Eybers|1918|p=448\u2013450}}\n\nIncreasing numbers of Xhosa armies now poured across the frontier. Towns and farms throughout the region were now burning, and the remaining frontier forts filled with refugees fleeing the invasion. British troops remained thin on the ground as much of them still remained idle in Gcalekaland, where they had been sent for the purpose of occupation.\n\nHowever Frere was lucky in that he still had access to the frontier militia and Fengu regiments of the Cape Government he had just overthrown. These forces, again under their legendary commander Veldman Bikitsha, managed to engage and finally defeat the Gcaleka on 13 January (near Nyumaxa).\n\nThe imperial troops assisted, but were tired, short of rations and unable to follow up on the victory. A subsequent attack was barely repelled on 7 February (Battle of [[Kentani]] or \"Centane\") with considerable more help from the Fengu and the local [[Frontier Light Horse]] militia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Neil Parsons |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/25/rose-of-rhodesia/parsons-2.html |title=Investigating the Origins of The Rose of Rhodesia, Part II: Harold Shaw Film Productions Ltd |publisher=Latrobe.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe exhausted Gcaleka finally pulled out from the conflict, but Sandile's rebel Ngqika armies fought on. The rebels eluded the Imperial troops once again and moved into the Amatola mountain range, beginning a final stage of guerrilla warfare. Cunynghame was meanwhile removed from his authority by London, and his replacement, Lieutenant General [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Thesiger]] took over command.{{sfn|Benyon|1980|p=}}{{sfn|Lewsen|1940|p=}}\n\n=== The Guerrilla War ===\n\n[[File:Amathole mountains, indigenous forest.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Amatola Mountains]], setting for the final stage of the war.]]\nThe [[Amatola Mountains|Amatola Range]] had served as a mountain stronghold for Xhosa insurgents many times before, with its vast, dark, creeper-entwined forests.\n\nIn March 1878, British troops entered the mountain ranges to pursue Sandile's rebels but were hopelessly outmaneuvered. They were eluded, led astray and ambushed time and time again, as the rebels easily slipped past their slow-moving troop columns. Flag signalling, path systems and other techniques were tried, but to no effect. The British were very inexperienced with the environment and plagued by mismanagement, stretched supply lines, sickness and other hardships. Meanwhile, the local [[Boer Commando|Cape commandos]] (Boer and Fengu) held back, reluctant to get involved.\n\nFinally the British adopted the strategy which the locals had been recommending from the beginning. This involved dividing the vast territory into 11 military provinces and stationing a mounted garrison in each. If a rebel regiment was encountered it was chased, until it entered the next military province, where the next garrison (fresh and close to supplies) would take over the pursuit. The valley exits from the range were then fortified. Under this uninterrupted pressure the rebel forces quickly splintered and began to surrender, Sandile himself fled down into the valley of the Fish River where he was intercepted by a Fengu commando. In the final shoot out he was accidentally killed by a stray bullet. The surviving rebels were granted an amnesty.{{sfn|Ayliff|Whiteside|1912|p=}}\n\n=== Conclusion ===\n\nThe war had lasted a year and was a final blow for the last independent Xhosa state, Gcalekaland, which was now administered as a British territory.{{sfn|Gon|1982}}\n\nInitially, however, the conflict had shown no signs of being anything more than a petty intertribal quarrel. Neither the [[Cape Colony|Cape Government]] nor the Xhosa had desired a war. Had Bartle Frere not moved to the frontier and drawn the conflict into Britain's greater Confederation scheme, it would almost definitely have remained as only a brief patch of localised ethnic strife.{{sfn|Gon|1982}}\n\nOnce the broader conflict had been ignited, however, the result was the annexation of all remaining Xhosa territory under British control. The war also led Britain to overthrow the Cape Colony's elected government.{{sfn|Mostert|1992|p=}}\n\nBartle Frere next applied the same tactics to invade the independent [[Zulu Kingdom]] in 1879. In the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] the disastrous use of Britain's slow-moving troop columns was once again demonstrated at [[battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]]. Although Frere was recalled for misconduct in 1880, and the Confederation scheme was dropped, the new series of \"Confederation Wars\" was to last over the next 20 years. These wars would see the ending of all Black independence in [[southern Africa]] and eventually build up to the great [[Anglo-Boer War]] decades later.<ref>''Illustrated History of South Africa''.

He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time. His father came to Vienna from Sibiu. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order of Leopold]].\n\n== Politician ==\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi\u0219oara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics.  von M\u00f6ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919 M\u00f6ller was elected the second mayor of Timi\u0219oara. From 1919 to 1926 he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in Bucharest, representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M\u00f6ller joined the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920.\n\nFrom 1920 he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923 he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of Adolf Hitler. After his return, he became chief editor of the \"Banat German newspaper\". He was one of the members of the \"German People's Council\".\n\nvon M\u00f6ller is considered one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931 he founded the first Banat local group of the \"National Socialist Self-Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M\u00f6ller became the first Gauleiter of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper \u201cDer St\u00fcrmer\u201d in Timi\u0219oara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \"cultural office manager\" in Sibiuthe \"job for ideological education and cultural policy\". After his application for admission to the Wehrmacht had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to Karl Schworm on September 7, 1939: \"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire. \u201d In 1941 he was appointed the\u201c cultural council \u201dof the German ethnic group in Romania.\n\n== Author ==\nAccording to his biography on the \"Kulturportal West-Ost\", in addition to his political \"von M\u00f6ller\" developed a lively writing activity, which was based on the great novels of Adam M\u00fcller-Guttenbrunn (1852-1923) and the intellectual and political development of Southeastern Germany, but especially the Banat Swabia, from the settlement until their ethnic awakening at the turn of the 20th century. As editor-in-chief of the 'Banater Deutsche Zeitung', he served the 'Banater Schw\u00e4bische Volksgemeinschaft'.\u201d\n\nVon M\u00f6ller's novels try to give a concrete picture of the respective events from the perspective of their time. He is one of the most popular authors of historical novels of his time, but with a nationalist and anti-Semitic touch. From M\u00f6ller began in the early 1920s with the publication ultranationalist writings. As \"advocate of folk anti-Semitism\" he wrote in his Gazette \"The Striker\". In his two-volume work \"How the Swabian communities came into being\" (Timi\u0219oara 1923\u201324), M\u00f6ller 1924 \"openly expressed his chauvinistic ideas and ideas by incorporating the 'Germanic racial element' (Vol. 2, p. 22) of the German superman into The foreground of his historical statements moved. \n\nIn the novel \u201cDie Werschetzer Tat\u201d (1936) he glorified the defence of Werschetz on the westernmost slope of the Banat Mountains at the time of the last great invasion of the Banat in 1788 by the Turks. Based on historical events, the author illustrates the rural life of German settlers of the first generation in the midst of a colourful mix of people and people. He takes on Nazi ideologies back such. B. The glorification of struggle, peasantry and leader personality, the superiority of the \" Aryan race\", inferiority, moral and physical degradation of the \"foreign people\": The Germans \"must be protected from the teeth of the strange army wolf, who runs up and down the Danube with hanging blood tongues.\"\n\nIn the novel \"Borders Wander: A Banat Roman\" (1937) von M\u00f6ller describes his life and customs of the Banat Swabians from the turn of the century about the First World War and the resulting tripartite division of the Banat in 1920 using the example of the predominantly German-inhabited place Jimbolia. The place fell to Yugoslavia after 1918 and to Romania in 1924 in exchange for Ja\u0161a Tomi\u0107. As in \"The Werschetzer act\" must also in this novel the \"Aryan\" hero \"against their racial opponent\" claim.\n\nIn the novel \"Die Salpeterer: A Freedom Struggle by German Peasants\" (1938) M\u00f6ller describes the struggle for freedom of the Hotzenwald Salpeterer in the Black Forest against the Prince-Bishop of St. Blasien and their eventual banishment to the Banat. He describes their homesickness and defiance against the injustice suffered from their point of view and only allows them to become \"real Banat farmers\" after generations. \n\nvon M\u00f6ller was very active as a writer in his last years. Above all, he published in the [[Eher-Verlag]] of the [[NSDAP]].\n\nOn October 11, 1941, the author's 65th birthday, [[Reich Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] expressed his thanks to the nation.\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons.

He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time.

{"title_page": "Pharmakos", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=October 2014}}\n{{Ancient Greek religion|expanded=practices}}\nA '''pharmak\u00f3s''' ({{lang-el|\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}}, plural '''''pharmakoi''''') in [[Ancient Greek religion]] was the ritualistic sacrifice or exile of a human [[scapegoat]] or victim.\n\n==Ritual==\nA slave, a cripple or a criminal was chosen and expelled from the community at times of disaster (famine, invasion or plague) or at times of calendrical crisis. It was believed that this would bring about purification. On the first day of the [[Thargelia]], a festival of [[Apollo]] at Athens, two men, the ''Pharmakoi'', were led out as if to be sacrificed as an expiation.\n\nSome scholia state that ''pharmakoi'' were actually sacrificed (thrown from a cliff or burned), but many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the ''pharmakos'' (the iambic satirist [[Hipponax]]) shows the ''pharmakoi'' being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes not, depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance, a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn ''Aesop in Delphi'' (1961), Anton Wiechers discussed the parallels between the legendary biography of [[Aesop]] (in which he is unjustly tried and executed by the Delphians) and the ''pharmakos'' ritual. For example, Aesop is grotesquely deformed, as was the ''pharmakos'' in some traditions; and Aesop was thrown from a cliff, as was the pharmakos in some traditions.\n\nGregory Nagy, in ''Best of the Achaeans'' (1979), compared Aesop's ''pharmakos'' death to the \"worst\" of the Achaeans in the ''[[Iliad]]'', Thersites. More recently, both Daniel Ogden, ''The Crooked Kings of Ancient Greece'' (1997) and [[Todd Compton]], ''Victim of the Muses: Poet as Scapegoat, Warrior and Hero'' (2006) examine poet ''pharmakoi''. Compton surveys important poets who were exiled, executed or suffered unjust trials, either in history, legend or Greek or [[Indo-European myth]].\n\n==Modern interpretations<!--'Plato's Pharmacy' redirects here-->==\n[[Walter Burkert]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Girard]] have written influential modern interpretations of the ''pharmakos'' rite. Burkert shows that humans were sacrificed or expelled after being fed well, and, according to some sources, their ashes were scattered to the ocean. This was a purification ritual, a form of societal [[catharsis]].<ref>Walter Burkert. ''Greek Religion'', p. 82.</ref> Girard likewise discusses the connection between catharsis, sacrifice, and purification.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard. ''I See Satan Fall Like Lightning'', pp. 37\u201338, 51, 78, 131</ref> Some scholars have connected the practice of [[ostracism]], in which a prominent politician was exiled from Athens after a vote using pottery pieces, with the ''pharmakos'' custom. However, the ostracism exile was only for a fixed time, as opposed to the finality of the ''pharmakos'' execution or expulsion.\n\nPharmakos is also used as a vital term in Derridean [[deconstruction]]. In his essay \"'''Plato's Pharmacy'''\"<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->,<ref>''Dissemination'', translated by Barbara Johnson, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1981</ref> [[Derrida]] deconstructs several texts by [[Plato]], such as ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', and reveals the inter-connection between the word chain ''pharmakeia\u2013pharmakon\u2013pharmakeus'' and the notably absent word ''pharmakos''. In doing so, he attacks the boundary between inside and outside, declaring that the outside (pharmakos, never uttered by Plato) is always-already present right behind the inside (''pharmakeia\u2013pharmakon\u2013pharmakeus'').

It was believed that this would bring about purification. On the first day of the [[Thargelia]], a festival of [[Apollo]] at Athens, two men, the ''Pharmakoi'', were led out as if to be sacrificed as an expiation.\n\nSome scholia state that ''pharmakoi'' were actually sacrificed (thrown from a cliff or burned), but many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the ''pharmakos'' (the iambic satirist [[Hipponax]]) shows the ''pharmakoi'' being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes not, depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance, a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn ''Aesop in Delphi'' (1961), Anton Wiechers discussed the parallels between the legendary biography of [[Aesop]] (in which he is unjustly tried and executed by the Delphians) and the ''pharmakos'' ritual. For example, Aesop is grotesquely deformed, as was the ''pharmakos'' in some traditions; and Aesop was thrown from a cliff, as was the pharmakos in some traditions.\n\nGregory Nagy, in ''Best of the Achaeans'' (1979), compared Aesop's ''pharmakos'' death to the \"worst\" of the Achaeans in the ''[[Iliad]]'', Thersites. More recently, both Daniel Ogden, ''The Crooked Kings of Ancient Greece'' (1997) and [[Todd Compton]], ''Victim of the Muses: Poet as Scapegoat, Warrior and Hero'' (2006) examine poet ''pharmakoi''. Compton surveys important poets who were exiled, executed or suffered unjust trials, either in history, legend or Greek or [[Indo-European myth]].\n\n==Modern interpretations<!--'Plato's Pharmacy' redirects here-->==\n[[Walter Burkert]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Girard]] have written influential modern interpretations of the ''pharmakos'' rite. Burkert shows that humans were sacrificed or expelled after being fed well, and, according to some sources, their ashes were scattered to the ocean. This was a purification ritual, a form of societal [[catharsis]].<ref>Walter Burkert. ''Greek Religion'', p. 82.</ref> Girard likewise discusses the connection between catharsis, sacrifice, and purification.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Girard. ''I See Satan Fall Like Lightning'', pp. 37\u201338, 51, 78, 131</ref> Some scholars have connected the practice of [[ostracism]], in which a prominent politician was exiled from Athens after a vote using pottery pieces, with the ''pharmakos'' custom. However, the ostracism exile was only for a fixed time, as opposed to the finality of the ''pharmakos'' execution or expulsion.\n\nPharmakos is also used as a vital term in Derridean [[deconstruction]]. In his essay \"'''Plato's Pharmacy'''\"<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->,<ref>''Dissemination'', translated by Barbara Johnson, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1981</ref> [[Derrida]] deconstructs several texts by [[Plato]], such as ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', and reveals the inter-connection between the word chain ''pharmakeia\u2013pharmakon\u2013pharmakeus'' and the notably absent word ''pharmakos''. In doing so, he attacks the boundary between inside and outside, declaring that the outside (pharmakos, never uttered by Plato) is always-already present right behind the inside (''pharmakeia\u2013pharmakon\u2013pharmakeus''). As a concept, Pharmakos can be said to be related to other Derridian terms such as \"[[Trace (deconstruction)|Trace]]\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pharmacy#Etymology|Etymology of ''pharmacy'']]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.rug.nl/Bibliotheek/catalogiBestanden/elekPubRUG/keur/11Bremmer Bremmer, Jan N.], [http://keur.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/wetenschappers/11/6576/ \"Scapegoat Rituals in Ancient Greece\"], ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', Vol. 87.

Plot summaries are recommended to be 400-700 words. -->\nTwenty-eight-year-old billionaire [[Speculation|currency speculator]]/[[asset manager]] Eric Packer rides slowly across [[Manhattan]] amid traffic jams, in his state-of-the-art luxury [[stretch limousine]] office, to his preferred barber. Various visitors discuss the meaning of life and inconsequential trivia. The traffic jams are caused by a visit of the [[President of the United States]] and the funeral of Eric's favorite musician, a [[rap artist]] whose music he plays in one of his two private elevators. Despite devastating currency speculation losses over the course of the day, Packer fantasizes about buying the [[Rothko Chapel]].\n\nHe meets his wife, Elise, in her taxi, for coffee, in a bookstore, as well as outside a theater. She declines sex with him. Packer has sex with two other women. When a day of poor trading destroys a large part of his wealth, his wife takes this as a reason to dissolve their union.\n\nAnti-capitalist activists demonstrate on the street. They wave rats and declare, \"[[The Communist Manifesto|A spectre is haunting the world]]: the spectre of [[capitalism]]\". They spray-paint Packer's limo and later subjects him to a [[pieing]]. Packer learns that an [[assassin]] is out to kill him, but seems curiously uninterested in who the person might be.\n\nIn his car, his doctor performs his daily medical checkup. Eric worries about the doctor's finding that he has an asymmetrical [[prostate]]. As the currency speculation wipes out most of his fortune, Eric's world begins to disintegrate. Eventually he kills his bodyguard. At the destination, the barber, who knew his father, cuts Eric's hair on one side. The barber and limo driver discuss their respective careers driving cabs. The barber gives Eric his gun because he had thrown away the bodyguard's.\n\nEric follows a path of further self-destruction, visiting his potential murderer, former employee Richard Sheets, a.k.a. Benno Levin. Eric seems ready to commit suicide,  but instead deliberately shoots himself in the hand. Sheets/Levin, who feels adrift in the capitalist system, explains that Eric's mistake in speculating was looking for perfect symmetry and patterns in the currency market: he should have looked for the lopsided\u2014his body with its asymmetrical prostate was telling him this.As Sheets points the gun to Eric's head, Eric seems to have overcome his fear of death and is waiting for it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as Eric Packer\n* [[Sarah Gadon]] as Elise Packer (n\u00e9e Shifrin), Eric's wife\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Benno Levin\n* [[Kevin Durand]] as Torval, Eric's Chief of Security\n* [[Abdul Ayoola]] as Ibrahim Hamadou, Eric's driver\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Didi Fancher, Eric's art consultant, with whom Eric has an affair\n* [[Emily Hampshire]] as Jane Melman, Eric's Chief of Finance\n* [[Bob Bainborough]] as Dr. Ingram, Eric's physician\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Vija Kinsky, Eric's Chief of Theory\n* [[Zeljko Kecojevic]] as Danko, Eric's veteran bodyguard\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Shiner, Eric's Head of Technology and Cyber Security and startup partner \n* [[Philip Nozuka]] as Michael Chin, Eric's young Systems Analyst\n* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as Andr\u00e9 Petrescu aka The Pastry Assassin\n* [[Patricia McKenzie]] as Kendra Hays, Eric's new bodyguard, with whom Eric has an affair\n* [[K'naan]] as Brutha Fez, a rap artist who's one of Eric's favorite musicians\n}}\n\n==Production==\nNews about a film adaptation of ''Cosmopolis'' first emerged on 10 February 2009 when Geoffrey Macnab, writing for Screendaily.com, reported that \"In his most ambitious project to date, international producer [[Paulo Branco]] is plotting a $10m\u201312m film based on the novel ''Cosmopolis'' by legendary US writer Don DeLillo.

The ''Cosmopolis'' soundtrack also features \"Mecca\" by Somali-Canadian singer/rapper [[K'naan]] with lyrics by K'naan and Don DeLillo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metric Score David Cronenberg's Don DeLillo Adaptation Cosmopolis|url=https://www.pitchfork.com/news/44282-metric-score-david-cronenbergs-don-delillo-adaptation-cosmopolis/|work=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc|accessdate=9 September 2012|author=Carrie Battan|date=13 October 2011}}</ref> ''Film Music Magazine'''s Daniel Schweiger praised the soundtrack as \"an environment of hallucinatory beauty.

Plot summaries are recommended to be 400-700 words. -->\nTwenty-eight-year-old billionaire [[Speculation|currency speculator]]/[[asset manager]] Eric Packer rides slowly across [[Manhattan]] amid traffic jams, in his state-of-the-art luxury [[stretch limousine]] office, to his preferred barber. Various visitors discuss the meaning of life and inconsequential trivia. The traffic jams are caused by a visit of the [[President of the United States]] and the funeral of Eric's favorite musician, a [[rap artist]] whose music he plays in one of his two private elevators. Despite devastating currency speculation losses over the course of the day, Packer fantasizes about buying the [[Rothko Chapel]].\n\nHe meets his wife, Elise, in her taxi, for coffee, in a bookstore, as well as outside a theater. She declines sex with him. Packer has sex with two other women. When a day of poor trading destroys a large part of his wealth, his wife takes this as a reason to dissolve their union.\n\nAnti-capitalist activists demonstrate on the street. They wave rats and declare, \"[[The Communist Manifesto|A spectre is haunting the world]]: the spectre of [[capitalism]]\". They spray-paint Packer's limo and later subjects him to a [[pieing]]. Packer learns that an [[assassin]] is out to kill him, but seems curiously uninterested in who the person might be.\n\nIn his car, his doctor performs his daily medical checkup. Eric worries about the doctor's finding that he has an asymmetrical [[prostate]]. As the currency speculation wipes out most of his fortune, Eric's world begins to disintegrate. Eventually he kills his bodyguard. At the destination, the barber, who knew his father, cuts Eric's hair on one side. The barber and limo driver discuss their respective careers driving cabs. The barber gives Eric his gun because he had thrown away the bodyguard's.\n\nEric follows a path of further self-destruction, visiting his potential murderer, former employee Richard Sheets, a.k.a. Benno Levin. Eric seems ready to commit suicide,  but instead deliberately shoots himself in the hand. Sheets/Levin, who feels adrift in the capitalist system, explains that Eric's mistake in speculating was looking for perfect symmetry and patterns in the currency market: he should have looked for the lopsided\u2014his body with its asymmetrical prostate was telling him this.As Sheets points the gun to Eric's head, Eric seems to have overcome his fear of death and is waiting for it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as Eric Packer\n* [[Sarah Gadon]] as Elise Packer (n\u00e9e Shifrin), Eric's wife\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Benno Levin\n* [[Kevin Durand]] as Torval, Eric's Chief of Security\n* [[Abdul Ayoola]] as Ibrahim Hamadou, Eric's driver\n* [[Juliette Binoche]] as Didi Fancher, Eric's art consultant, with whom Eric has an affair\n* [[Emily Hampshire]] as Jane Melman, Eric's Chief of Finance\n* [[Bob Bainborough]] as Dr. Ingram, Eric's physician\n* [[Samantha Morton]] as Vija Kinsky, Eric's Chief of Theory\n* [[Zeljko Kecojevic]] as Danko, Eric's veteran bodyguard\n* [[Jay Baruchel]] as Shiner, Eric's Head of Technology and Cyber Security and startup partner \n* [[Philip Nozuka]] as Michael Chin, Eric's young Systems Analyst\n* [[Mathieu Amalric]] as Andr\u00e9 Petrescu aka The Pastry Assassin\n* [[Patricia McKenzie]] as Kendra Hays, Eric's new bodyguard, with whom Eric has an affair\n* [[K'naan]] as Brutha Fez, a rap artist who's one of Eric's favorite musicians\n}}\n\n==Production==\nNews about a film adaptation of ''Cosmopolis'' first emerged on 10 February 2009 when Geoffrey Macnab, writing for Screendaily.com, reported that \"In his most ambitious project to date, international producer [[Paulo Branco]] is plotting a $10m\u201312m film based on the novel ''Cosmopolis'' by legendary US writer Don DeLillo.

[[Geurie, New South Wales|Geurie]] is located between [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] and [[Dubbo]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia.\n\n== Events ==\nThe Sydney-bound Bourke Mail train, with 110 passengers, was steaming towards Geurie station. The locomotive was [[New South Wales C38 class locomotive|C38]] Pacific steam engine, 3817. Standing in the loop, beside a grain silo,  was a goods train, hauled by a {{convert|265|t|ST|0|adj=on}} Beyer-Garratt [[New South Wales AD60 class locomotive|AD60 class]] locomotive 6003. It was refuged so as to cross the Mail train.<ref name=ipl>{{cite book| title=Australian Railway Disasters| last=Pearce| first=Kenn| publisher=IPL Books| location=Davidson| isbn=0-908876-09-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Crosby|first1=Heather|title=Geurie crash still vivid in minds of survivors after 50 years|url=http://www.dailyliberal.com.au/story/1726254/geurie-crash-still-vivid-in-minds-of-survivors-after-50-years/|website=[[Daily Liberal]]|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|date=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe length from the front of the Garratt locomotive to the driver's position contributed to a misjudgment of standing clear of the mainline. 3817 collided with the Garratt locomotive at an estimated speed of {{convert|32|km/h}}.<ref name=ipl/>\n\nThe fouling point, as was common practice at the time, was marked by a white lamp on a white post located quite close to the actual fouling point.  The points at the entrance to the loop were operated by a [[ground frame]] and interlocked with signals using [[Annett's key|annett keys]].

[[Geurie, New South Wales|Geurie]] is located between [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] and [[Dubbo]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia.\n\n== Events leading up to the crash ==\nThe Sydney-bound Bourke Mail train, with 110 passengers, was steaming towards Geurie station. The locomotive was [[New South Wales C38 class locomotive|C38]] Pacific steam engine, 3817. Standing in the loop, beside a grain silo,  was a goods train, hauled by a 265-tonne Beyer-Garratt [[New South Wales AD60 class locomotive|AD60 class]] locomotive 6003. It was refuged so as to cross the Mail train.<ref name=ipl>{{cite book| title=Australian Railway Disasters| last=Pearce| first=Kenn| publisher=IPL Books| location=Davidson| isbn=0-908876-09-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Crosby|first1=Heather|title=Geurie crash still vivid in minds of survivors after 50 years|url=http://www.dailyliberal.com.au/story/1726254/geurie-crash-still-vivid-in-minds-of-survivors-after-50-years/|website=[[Daily Liberal]]|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|date=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Goods train foul of main line ==\nThe length from the front of the Garratt locomotive to the driver's position contributed to a misjudgment of standing clear of the mainline. 3817 collided with the Garratt locomotive at an estimated speed of 32 km/h.<ref name=ipl/>\n\nThe fouling point, as was common practice at the time, was marked by a white lamp on a white post located quite close to the actual fouling point.  The points at the entrance to the loop were operated by a [[ground frame]] and interlocked with signals using [[Annett's key|annett keys]].  There were no [[track circuit]]s over the points which might have detected the foul locomotive and thus held the home signal at \"red\" and thus stopped the mail train short of the obstruction.\n\n== Collision ==\nThe impact of the two locomotives colliding forced the Garratt into the side of the silo and reared up its boiler section on to its leading water unit. 3817 was derailed and pushed over on to its side.
