In his first season, Kerzhakov was the second choice striker behind [[Hennadiy Popovych]]. However, later in 2001, he helped Zenit finish third in the [[Russian Premier League]] and runners-up in 2003. In 2002, Kerzhakov quickly developed a striking partnership with [[Andrei Arshavin]] which earned them both call-ups to the [[Russia national football team|Russian national team]]. That year Kerzhakov went to represent Russia at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nIn 2003, Czech manager [[Vlastimil Petr\u017eela]] promoted Kerzhakov as first choice striker and he became the top scorer of the Russian Premier League in 2004. While under Petr\u017eela, Kerzhakov was given a starting position in all four group games of the [[UEFA Cup 2004-05|2004\u201305 UEFA Cup]] and went on to score a hat trick in a 5\u20131 victory over [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]. The following season, he was in the starting line up once again in Zenit's second straight [[UEFA Cup 2005-06|UEFA Cup]] campaign. Zenit qualified for the round of 32 by overcoming [[Vit\u00f3ria SC|Vit\u00f3ria]], [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]], [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]], and [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]].

He scored the winning goal against Tottenham in a 4\u20133 victory in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals on 5 April 2007. Kerzhakov later contributed to Sevilla's victorious run in the 2006\u201307 UEFA Cup season.\n\nAfter Juande Ramos resigned at Sevilla to manage [[Tottenham Hotspur]] in October 2007, Kerzhakov's playing time decreased under caretaker manager [[Manuel Jim\u00e9nez Jim\u00e9nez|Manuel Jim\u00e9nez]].

Just prior to the start of the [[UEFA Euro 2004 qualification|UEFA Euro 2004 qualifiers]], Kerzhakov scored his first goal for Russia in a friendly 1\u20131 draw against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] on 21 August 2002. Despite making eight appearances in the qualification tournament, for the [[UEFA Euro 2004|final tournament]] he was selected by [[Georgi Yartsev]] as one of four strikers in the squad behind with [[Dmitri Bulykin]], [[Dmitri Kirichenko]], and [[Dmitri Sychev]]. He was on the bench for Russia's games against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Greece national football team|Greece]], but played a full game against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].\n\n===2004\u20132010===\nAfter Euro 2004, Yartsev continued to pick Kerzhakov as a substitute for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2006 World Cup qualifiers]]. Russia started strongly but after a 7\u20131 loss to Portugal and a 1\u20131 draw with Estonia, Yartsev resigned. Yartsev's successor [[Yuri Semin]], promoted Kerzhakov to the starting position after Bulykin and Kirichenko were dropped from the squad. Along with the recall of his then clubmate [[Andrei Arshavin]], he made a strong contribution with  by scoring three goals including a double against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]]. However, his impact did little as they failed to qualify for the playoffs behind Portugal and [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]].\n\nUnder [[Guus Hiddink]], Kerzhakov continued his role as the first choice striker but was dropped after limited appearances for [[Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit]] in late 2006. Upon moving to Spain, Hiddink overlooked Kerzhakov for a friendly against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in February 2007, but recalled him a month later to face [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] following impressive performances for [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]. Kerzhakov went on to score both goals in the 2\u20130 victory over Estonia. In June 2007, Kerzhakov scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 victory over [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]]. He made a further contribution to Russia's [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualification|Euro 2008 qualification]] campaign by scoring a goal in a 3\u20130 victory over [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] on September 2007. Despite being the top scorer for Russia with five goals, Kerzhakov was not included in Hiddink's squad for [[UEFA Euro 2008|the tournament finals]]. His poor form at Sevilla and less than impressive season at Dynamo Moscow led to a period of exclusion from the national team that lasted nearly 18 months.\n\nKerzhakov was finally recalled in May 2009 for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 4|2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifier]] against [[Finland national football team|Finland]] in Helsinki.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.uk.reuters.com/european/news/LQ943422.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121211220253/http://football.uk.reuters.com/european/news/LQ943422.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 December 2012 |title=Hiddink recalls Kerzhakov for Finland qualifier |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2009 |publisher=Reuters UK }}</ref> He started the game and celebrated his return by scoring two goals as Russia defeated Finland 3\u20130. Kerzhakov was reinstated as the first choice striker and made a further four appearances in the qualifiers, helping his team finish behind Germany with 24 points. During the playoff against Slovenia, Kerzhakov was on the bench for first leg but was introduced at half-time for [[Roman Pavlyuchenko]] in the return fixture. In the 66th minute he received a straight red card after what was interpreted by referee [[Terje Hauge]] to be a deliberate kick at [[Slovenia]]n [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Samir Handanovi\u0107]].

The manufacturing process for this food item is very similar to a generic production of chocolate spread.

These cocoa beans are harvested from cocoa trees and are left to dry for about ten days before being shipped for processing.<ref name=\"wanttoknowit.com\">{{cite web|url=http://wanttoknowit.com/how-is-nutella-made/|title=How is Nutella Made|website=Wanttoknowit.com|date=28 December 2011}}</ref> Typically, cocoa beans contain approximately 50 percent of cocoa butter; therefore, they must be roasted to reduce the cocoa bean into a liquid form.<ref name=\"wanttoknowit.com\"/> This step is not sufficient for turning cocoa bean into a chocolate paste because it solidifies at room temperature and would not be spreadable. After the initial roast, the liquid paste is sent to presses, which are used to squeeze the butter out of the cocoa bean. The final products are round discs of chocolate made of pure compressed cocoa. The cocoa butter is transferred elsewhere so it can be used in other products.\n\nThe second process involves the hazelnuts. Once the hazelnuts have arrived at the processing plant, a quality control is issued to inspect the nuts so they are suitable for processing. A [[guillotine]] is used to chop the nuts to inspect the interior.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwbgruOt6g|title=Chocolate Spread : How Its Made|first=|last=Triwood1973|date=25 May 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> After this process, the hazelnuts are cleaned and roasted. A second quality control is issued by a computer-controlled blast of air, which removes the bad nuts from the batch.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> This ensures that each jar of Nutella is uniform in its look and taste. Approximately 50 hazelnuts can be found in each jar of Nutella, as claimed by the company.<ref name=\"nutella.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nutella.com.au|title=Nutella Australia|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe cocoa powder is then mixed with the hazelnuts along with sugar, vanillin and skim milk in a large tank, until it becomes a paste-like spread.<ref name=\"wanttoknowit.com\"/> Modified palm oil is then added to help retain the solid phase of the Nutella at room temperature, which substitutes for the butter found in the cocoa bean. Whey powder is then added to the mix to act as a binder for the paste. Whey powder is an additive commonly used in spreads to prevent the coagulation of the product, because it stabilizes the fat emulsions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milkingredients.ca/index-eng.php?id=194|title=Whey Powder|website=Milkingredients.ca}}</ref> Similarly, lecithin, a form of a fatty substance found in animal and plant tissues, is added to help emulsify the paste, as it promotes homogenized mixing of the different ingredients, allowing the paste to become spreadable. It also aids the lipophilic properties of the cocoa powder, which, again, keeps the product from separating.<ref name=\"nutella.com.au\"/> Vanillin is added to enhance the sweetness of the chocolate. The finished product is then packaged.\n\n==Nutrition==\nNutella contains 10.4 percent of [[saturated fat]] and 58% of processed sugar by weight. A two-tablespoon (37-gram) serving of Nutella contains 200 [[calorie]]s, including 99 calories from 11 grams of fat (3.5&nbsp;g of which are saturated) and 80 calories from 21 grams of sugar. The spread also contains 15&nbsp;mg of [[sodium]] and 2&nbsp;g of [[protein]] per serving (for reference a Canadian serving size is 1 tablespoon or 19 grams).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/nutella-settles-lawsuit-from-angry-mom-drops-health-claims-1.802299#.T5sMHSwf-ZY|title=Nutella settles lawsuit from angry mom, drops health claims|publisher=[[CTV News]]|date=27 April 2012|accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-C00001-01c21Pe.html | title=Nutrition Facts and Analysis for Chocolate-flavored hazelnut spread | publisher=NutritionaData | accessdate=2008-11-09}}</ref>\n\n==Storage==\nThe label states that Nutella does not need to be refrigerated. This is because the large quantity of sugar in the product acts as a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. More specifically, the sugar acts as a preservative by binding the water in the product, which prevents the microorganisms from growing.<ref name=\"ubcwiki\">{{cite web|url=http://wiki.ubc.ca/Course:FNH200/Lesson_02|title=Chemical and Physical Properties of Food|website=wiki.UBC.ca|access-date=1 February 2018}}</ref> Refrigeration causes Nutella to harden, because it contains fats from the hazelnuts.

These cocoa beans are harvested from cocoa trees and are left to dry for about ten days before being shipped for processing.<ref name=\"wanttoknowit.com\">{{cite web|url=http://wanttoknowit.com/how-is-nutella-made/|title=How is Nutella Made|website=Wanttoknowit.com|date=28 December 2011}}</ref> Typically, cocoa beans contain approximately 50 percent of cocoa butter; therefore, they must be roasted to reduce the cocoa bean into a liquid form.<ref name=\"wanttoknowit.com\"/> This step is not sufficient for turning cocoa bean into a chocolate paste because it solidifies at room temperature and would not be spreadable. After the initial roast, the liquid paste is sent to presses, which are used to squeeze the butter out of the cocoa bean. The final products are round discs of chocolate made of pure compressed cocoa. The cocoa butter is transferred elsewhere so it can be used in other products.\n\nThe second process involves the hazelnuts. Once the hazelnuts have arrived at the processing plant, a quality control is issued to inspect the nuts so they are suitable for processing. A [[guillotine]] is used to chop the nuts to inspect the interior.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dwbgruOt6g|title=Chocolate Spread : How Its Made|first=|last=Triwood1973|date=25 May 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> After this process, the hazelnuts are cleaned and roasted. A second quality control is issued by a computer-controlled blast of air, which removes the bad nuts from the batch.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> This ensures that each jar of Nutella is uniform in its look and taste. Approximately 50 hazelnuts can be found in each jar of Nutella, as claimed by the company.<ref name=\"nutella.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nutella.com.au|title=Nutella Australia|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe cocoa powder is then mixed with the hazelnuts along with sugar, vanillin and skim milk in a large tank, until it becomes a paste-like spread.<ref name=\"wanttoknowit.com\"/> Modified palm oil is then added to help retain the solid phase of the Nutella at room temperature, which substitutes for the butter found in the cocoa bean. Whey powder is then added to the mix to act as a binder for the paste. Whey powder is an additive commonly used in spreads to prevent the coagulation of the product, because it stabilizes the fat emulsions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milkingredients.ca/index-eng.php?id=194|title=Whey Powder|website=Milkingredients.ca}}</ref> Similarly, lecithin, a form of a fatty substance found in animal and plant tissues, is added to help emulsify the paste, as it promotes homogenized mixing of the different ingredients, allowing the paste to become spreadable. It also aids the lipophilic properties of the cocoa powder, which, again, keeps the product from separating.<ref name=\"nutella.com.au\"/> Vanillin is added to enhance the sweetness of the chocolate. The finished product is then packaged.\n\n==Nutrition==\nNutella contains 10.4 percent of [[saturated fat]] and 58% of processed sugar by weight. A two-tablespoon (37-gram) serving of Nutella contains 200 [[calorie]]s, including 99 calories from 11 grams of fat (3.5&nbsp;g of which are saturated) and 80 calories from 21 grams of sugar.

Bond then exposes Moon's plan: to use the Icarus as a [[sun gun]] to cut a path through the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade [[South Korea]] and [[Korean reunification|reunite the countries]] through force. Bond disables the Icarus controls, kills Moon and stops the invasion.\n\n===''Casino Royale'' (2006)===\n{{Main|Casino Royale (2006 film)}}\n\nThis serves as a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, with Bond gaining his [[00 Agent|00 status]] in the [[pre-credit]]s sequence. Bond is instructed to investigate the funding of terrorism. He tracks down and kills a bomb-maker and takes his mobile phone. Searching through the phone, Bond discovers a text message which he traces to Alex Dimitrios, and then on to financer [[Le Chiffre]]. Le Chiffre's investments involve [[short (finance)|short-selling]] stock in successful companies and then engineering terrorist attacks to sink their share prices. Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype ''Skyfleet'' airliner, which forces Le Chiffre to set up a high-stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale to recoup his fortune. Bond is instructed to beat Le Chiffre and is aided by a member of [[HM Treasury]], Vesper Lynd.\n\nBond beats Le Chiffre at the poker table, but Lynd is kidnapped by Le Chiffre after the game, as is Bond, who is captured whilst pursuing them; Lynd is ransomed for the money and Bond is tortured. Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre and a number of his clients. Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to have done, and Bond establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M. Bond subsequently finds and captures White.\n\n===''Quantum of Solace'' (2008)===\n[[File:Daniel Craig - Film Premiere \"Spectre\" 007 - on the Red Carpet in Berlin (22387409720) (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Daniel Craig]] at the Berlin premiere of ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' in October 2015|alt=|left]]\n{{Main|Quantum of Solace}}\nAlong with M, Bond interrogates Mr. White regarding his organisation, [[List of James Bond villains#villainous organisations|Quantum]]. M's bodyguard, Mitchell, a [[double agent]], attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond traces the organisation to Haiti and a connection to environmentalist Dominic Greene.\n\nBond uncovers a plot between Greene and an exiled Bolivian General, Medrano, to put Medrano in power in Bolivia while Quantum are given a monopoly to run the water supply to the country. Bond ascertains Quantum are damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to force the price up. Bond attacks the hotel where Greene and Medrano are finalising their plans and leaves Greene stranded in the desert with only a tin of engine oil to drink. Bond then finds Vesper Lynd's former lover and member of Quantum, Yusef Kabira.\n\n===''Skyfall'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Skyfall}}\n\nAfter an operation in Istanbul ends in disaster, Bond is missing and presumed to be dead. In the aftermath, questions are raised over M's ability to run the Secret Service, and she becomes the subject of a government review over her handling of the situation. The Service itself is attacked, prompting Bond's return to London. His presence assists MI6's investigation in uncovering a lead, and Bond is sent to Shanghai and Macau in pursuit of a [[mercenary]] named Patrice. There, he establishes a connection to Raoul Silva, a former MI6 agent who was captured and tortured by Chinese agents. Blaming M for his imprisonment, he sets in motion a plan to ruin her reputation before murdering her. Bond saves M and attempts to lure Silva into a trap, and while he is successful in repelling Silva's assault, M is mortally wounded. Bond returns to active duty under the command of the new M, Gareth Mallory.\n\n===''Spectre'' (2015)===\n{{Main|Spectre (2015 film)}}\n\nFollowing her death in ''Skyfall'', M sends Bond a posthumous message that leads him to thwart a terrorist attack in Mexico City. Gareth Mallory takes Bond off active duty for his illegal operation, but Bond continues his investigation off the books. The trail leads him first to Rome, where he learns of a sinister terrorist organisation known as \"[[SPECTRE|Spectre]]\"; and later to Austria where he finds former adversary Mr. White, whom Spectre ordered to murder, dying of thallium poisoning. White asks Bond to protect his daughter Madeleine Swann from Spectre and its leader, Franz Oberhauser, before committing suicide. Meanwhile, Mallory comes under pressure to have British intelligence join a global intelligence-sharing network code-named \"Nine Eyes\". With Swann's help, Bond tracks Spectre to Morocco and learns that Spectre is behind the terror attacks, creating a need for Nine Eyes. Spectre controls Nine Eyes, giving them access to the intelligence-sharing network. Oberhauser captures and tortures Bond, revealing that his father was Bond's guardian after the deaths of Bond's parents. Now known as [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], he claims responsibility for everything Bond has suffered in his career. Bond and Swann escape and return to London where Bond joins forces with Mallory and Q to shut down Nine Eyes and apprehend Blofeld.<ref name=\"cast & crew\">{{cite news|url=http://www.007.com/bond-returns-in-spectre/|title=Bond returns in ''Spectre''|work=007.com|publisher=[[Eon Productions]]|date=4 December 2014|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=William|title='SPECTRE': Poster and synopsis revealed for new Bond film|url=http://www.cultbox.co.uk/news/galleries/spectre-poster-and-synopsis-revealed-for-new-bond-film|website=Cultbox|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=4 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"on a mission\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/31654971|title=Sam Mendes: ''Spectre'' about Bond's childhood|work=BBC Entertainment|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=27 February 2015|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''No Time to Die'' (2020)===\n{{Main|No Time to Die}}\n\nJames Bond has left active service when his friend Felix Leiter enlists his help in the search for a missing scientist.

He recruits baccarat player Evelyn Tremble to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Having embezzled SMERSH's money, Le Chiffre is desperate for money to cover up his theft. Tremble stops Le Chiffre's cheating and beats him in a game of baccarat. Tremble is captured, tortured and killed. Bond establishes that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah; he and Moneypenny travel there to investigate. Dr. Noah turns out to be Sir James's nephew Jimmy Bond, who plans to use biological warfare to make all women beautiful and kill all tall men, leaving him as the \"big man\" who gets all the girls. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues, but the building explodes, killing all inside.\n\n===''Never Say Never Again'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Never Say Never Again}}\n\nBond investigates the hijacking of two [[cruise missiles]] with live nuclear warheads which had been taken by SPECTRE. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot's sister, and her lover, Maximillian Largo, SPECTRE's Number One, who directly responds to Blofeld. Following them to France, Bond informs Domino of her brother's death and subsequently finds his MI6 colleague killed by Fatima Blush, another SPECTRE agent: Bond kills her. Bond and Felix Leiter then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the Flying Saucer, in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in North Africa, but Bond subsequently escapes with Domino. The two agents ambush Largo while he is placing one of the bombs.\n\n==Awards==\nThe Bond films have been nominated for a number of awards throughout their fifty-year history, with most films winning an award; these include successes at the [[British Academy Film Awards]], [[Golden Globe Award]]s and [[Academy Award]]s.

He escapes, destroying the refinery in the process, and pursues Sanchez, killing him.\n\n===''GoldenEye'' (1995)===\n{{Main|GoldenEye}}\n\nIn 1986 Bond and [[Alec Trevelyan]]\u2014agent 006\u2014infiltrate an illicit [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] chemical weapons facility and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes from the facility as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond witnesses the theft by criminal organisation Janus of a prototype [[Eurocopter Tiger]] helicopter that can withstand an [[electromagnetic pulse]]. Janus uses the helicopter to steal the control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons, using the GoldenEye to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse; there are two survivors of the attack, the programmers, Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko.\n\nBond investigates the attack and travels to Russia where he locates Simonova and learns that Trevelyan, who had faked his own death, was the head of Janus. Simonova tracks computer traffic to Cuba and she and Bond travel there and locate Trevelyan, who reveals his plan to steal money from the [[Bank of England]] before erasing all of its financial records with the GoldenEye, concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy. Bond and Simonova destroy the satellite facility, killing Trevelyan and Grishenko in the process.\n\n===''Tomorrow Never Dies'' (1997)===\n{{Main|Tomorrow Never Dies}}\n\nBond investigates the sinking of a British warship in Chinese waters, the theft of one of the ship's [[cruise missile]]s\u2014and the shooting down of a Chinese fighter plane. He uncovers a link to media mogul [[Elliot Carver]] which suggests that Carver had purchased a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] encoder on the black market.\n\nBond encounters Chinese agent [[Wai Lin]], who is also investigating the matter and the two agree to work together. They discover that Carver had used the GPS encoder to push the British ship off course and into Chinese waters to incite a war for ratings. With the British fleet on their way to China, Bond and Wai Lin find Carver's stealth ship, board it and prevent the firing of a British cruise missile at Beijing. They blow a hole in the ship, exposing it to radar, leading to its sinking averting war between Britain and China.\n\n===''The World Is Not Enough'' (1999)===\n{{Main|The World Is Not Enough}}\n\nBond recovers money for Sir Robert King, a British oil tycoon and friend of M, but the money is booby-trapped and kills King shortly afterwards. Bond traces the money to Renard, a KGB agent-turned-terrorist, who had previously kidnapped King's daughter Elektra. MI6 believes that Renard is targeting Elektra King a second time and Bond is assigned to protect her; the pair are subsequently attacked.\n\nBond visits Valentin Zukovsky and is informed that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is in league with Renard: Bond kills Davidov and follows the trail to a Russian [[ICBM]] base in Kazakhstan. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond meets American [[Nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]] Christmas Jones. The two witness Renard stealing the [[GPS]] locator card and a half quantity of weapons-grade [[plutonium]] from a bomb and set off an explosion, from which Bond and Jones escape. Elektra kidnaps M after she thinks Bond had been killed and Bond establishes that Elektra intends to create a nuclear explosion in a submarine in [[Istanbul]] to increase the value of her own oil pipeline. Bond frees M, kills Elektra and then disarms the bomb on the submarine where he kills Renard.\n\n===''Die Another Day'' (2002)===\n[[File:PierceBrosnanCannesPhoto2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Smiling man with short, tousled hair, wearing white shirt open at collar, and black jacket.|[[Pierce Brosnan]] at the 2002 [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] for the press conference of ''[[Die Another Day]]''.]]\n{{Main|Die Another Day}}\n\nBond investigates [[North Korea]]n Colonel Tan-Sun Moon, who is illegally trading African [[Blood diamond|conflict diamonds]] for weapons. Moon is apparently killed and Bond is captured and tortured for 14 months, after which he is exchanged for Zao, Moon's assistant. Despite being suspended on his return, he decides to complete his mission and tracks down Zao to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Zao escapes, but the trail leads to British billionaire Gustav Graves.\n\nGraves unveils a mirror satellite, \"Icarus\", which is able to focus [[solar energy]] on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for crop development. Bond discovers that Moon has also undergone the gene therapy and has assumed the identity of Graves. Bond then exposes Moon's plan: to use the Icarus as a [[sun gun]] to cut a path through the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade [[South Korea]] and [[Korean reunification|reunite the countries]] through force. Bond disables the Icarus controls, kills Moon and stops the invasion.\n\n===''Casino Royale'' (2006)===\n{{Main|Casino Royale (2006 film)}}\n\nThis serves as a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the series, with Bond gaining his [[00 Agent|00 status]] in the [[pre-credit]]s sequence. Bond is instructed to investigate the funding of terrorism. He tracks down and kills a bomb-maker and takes his mobile phone. Searching through the phone, Bond discovers a text message which he traces to Alex Dimitrios, and then on to financer [[Le Chiffre]]. Le Chiffre's investments involve [[short (finance)|short-selling]] stock in successful companies and then engineering terrorist attacks to sink their share prices. Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype ''Skyfleet'' airliner, which forces Le Chiffre to set up a high-stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale to recoup his fortune. Bond is instructed to beat Le Chiffre and is aided by a member of [[HM Treasury]], Vesper Lynd.\n\nBond beats Le Chiffre at the poker table, but Lynd is kidnapped by Le Chiffre after the game, as is Bond, who is captured whilst pursuing them; Lynd is ransomed for the money and Bond is tortured. Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre and a number of his clients. Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to have done, and Bond establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M. Bond subsequently finds and captures White.\n\n===''Quantum of Solace'' (2008)===\n[[File:Daniel Craig - Film Premiere \"Spectre\" 007 - on the Red Carpet in Berlin (22387409720) (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Daniel Craig]] at the Berlin premiere of ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' in October 2015|alt=|left]]\n{{Main|Quantum of Solace}}\nAlong with M, Bond interrogates Mr. White regarding his organisation, [[List of James Bond villains#villainous organisations|Quantum]]. M's bodyguard, Mitchell, a [[double agent]], attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond traces the organisation to Haiti and a connection to environmentalist Dominic Greene.\n\nBond uncovers a plot between Greene and an exiled Bolivian General, Medrano, to put Medrano in power in Bolivia while Quantum are given a monopoly to run the water supply to the country. Bond ascertains Quantum are damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to force the price up. Bond attacks the hotel where Greene and Medrano are finalising their plans and leaves Greene stranded in the desert with only a tin of engine oil to drink. Bond then finds Vesper Lynd's former lover and member of Quantum, Yusef Kabira.\n\n===''Skyfall'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Skyfall}}\n\nAfter an operation in Istanbul ends in disaster, Bond is missing and presumed to be dead. In the aftermath, questions are raised over M's ability to run the Secret Service, and she becomes the subject of a government review over her handling of the situation. The Service itself is attacked, prompting Bond's return to London. His presence assists MI6's investigation in uncovering a lead, and Bond is sent to Shanghai and Macau in pursuit of a [[mercenary]] named Patrice. There, he establishes a connection to Raoul Silva, a former MI6 agent who was captured and tortured by Chinese agents. Blaming M for his imprisonment, he sets in motion a plan to ruin her reputation before murdering her. Bond saves M and attempts to lure Silva into a trap, and while he is successful in repelling Silva's assault, M is mortally wounded. Bond returns to active duty under the command of the new M, Gareth Mallory.\n\n===''Spectre'' (2015)===\n{{Main|Spectre (2015 film)}}\n\nFollowing her death in ''Skyfall'', M sends Bond a posthumous message that leads him to thwart a terrorist attack in Mexico City. Gareth Mallory takes Bond off active duty for his illegal operation, but Bond continues his investigation off the books. The trail leads him first to Rome, where he learns of a sinister terrorist organisation known as \"[[SPECTRE|Spectre]]\"; and later to Austria where he finds former adversary Mr. White, whom Spectre ordered to murder, dying of thallium poisoning. White asks Bond to protect his daughter Madeleine Swann from Spectre and its leader, Franz Oberhauser, before committing suicide. Meanwhile, Mallory comes under pressure to have British intelligence join a global intelligence-sharing network code-named \"Nine Eyes\". With Swann's help, Bond tracks Spectre to Morocco and learns that Spectre is behind the terror attacks, creating a need for Nine Eyes. Spectre controls Nine Eyes, giving them access to the intelligence-sharing network. Oberhauser captures and tortures Bond, revealing that his father was Bond's guardian after the deaths of Bond's parents. Now known as [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], he claims responsibility for everything Bond has suffered in his career. Bond and Swann escape and return to London where Bond joins forces with Mallory and Q to shut down Nine Eyes and apprehend Blofeld.<ref name=\"cast & crew\">{{cite news|url=http://www.007.com/bond-returns-in-spectre/|title=Bond returns in ''Spectre''|work=007.com|publisher=[[Eon Productions]]|date=4 December 2014|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=William|title='SPECTRE': Poster and synopsis revealed for new Bond film|url=http://www.cultbox.co.uk/news/galleries/spectre-poster-and-synopsis-revealed-for-new-bond-film|website=Cultbox|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=4 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"on a mission\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/31654971|title=Sam Mendes: ''Spectre'' about Bond's childhood|work=BBC Entertainment|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=27 February 2015|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===''No Time to Die'' (2020)===\n{{Main|No Time to Die}}\n\nJames Bond has left active service when his friend Felix Leiter enlists his help in the search for a missing scientist.

He recruits baccarat player Evelyn Tremble to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Having embezzled SMERSH's money, Le Chiffre is desperate for money to cover up his theft. Tremble stops Le Chiffre's cheating and beats him in a game of baccarat. Tremble is captured, tortured and killed. Bond establishes that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah; he and Moneypenny travel there to investigate. Dr. Noah turns out to be Sir James's nephew Jimmy Bond, who plans to use biological warfare to make all women beautiful and kill all tall men, leaving him as the \"big man\" who gets all the girls. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues, but the building explodes, killing all inside.\n\n===''Never Say Never Again'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Never Say Never Again}}\n\nBond investigates the hijacking of two [[cruise missiles]] with live nuclear warheads which had been taken by SPECTRE. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot's sister, and her lover, Maximillian Largo, SPECTRE's Number One, who directly responds to Blofeld. Following them to France, Bond informs Domino of her brother's death and subsequently finds his MI6 colleague killed by Fatima Blush, another SPECTRE agent: Bond kills her. Bond and Felix Leiter then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the Flying Saucer, in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in North Africa, but Bond subsequently escapes with Domino. The two agents ambush Largo while he is placing one of the bombs.\n\n==Awards==\nThe Bond films have been nominated for a number of awards throughout their fifty-year history, with most films winning an award; these include successes at the [[British Academy Film Awards]], [[Golden Globe Award]]s and [[Academy Award]]s.

It was formerly thought to be a member of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Lamnidae]] and a close relative of the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''). However, it is now classified into the extinct family [[Otodontidae]], which [[Speciation|diverged]] from the great white shark during the [[Early Cretaceous]]. Its genus placement is still debated, authors placing it in either ''[[Carcharocles]]'', ''Megaselachus'', ''[[Otodus]]'', or ''Procarcharodon''. This is because [[transitional fossil]]s have been found showing that Megalodon is the final [[chronospecies]] of a lineage of giant sharks originally of the genus ''Otodus'' which evolved during the [[Paleocene]].\n\nWhile regarded as one of the largest and most powerful predators to have ever lived, megalodon is known from fragmentary remains, and its appearance and maximum size are uncertain. Scientists differ on whether it would have more closely resembled a stockier version of the great white shark, the [[basking shark]] (''Cetorhinus maximus'') or the [[sand tiger shark]] (''Carcharias taurus''). Most estimates of megalodon's size extrapolate from teeth; with maximum length estimates up to {{convert|18|m|ft|sp=us}} and average length estimates of {{convert|10.5|m|ft|sp=us}}. Estimates suggest their large jaws could exert a bite force of up to {{convert|110,000|to|180,000|newtons|lbf}}.<ref name=\"GWB\" /> Their teeth were thick and robust, built for grabbing prey and breaking bone.\n\nMegalodon probably had a major impact on the structure of [[marine life|marine communities]]. The fossil record indicates that it had a [[cosmopolitan distribution]]. It probably targeted large prey, such as [[cetacea|whales]], [[pinniped|seals]] and [[sea turtle]]s. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters and fed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white, which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.\n\nThe animal faced competition from whale-eating cetaceans, such as ''[[Livyatan]]'' and other [[macroraptorial sperm whale]]s and possibly smaller ancestral killer whales. As the shark preferred warmer waters, it is thought that oceanic cooling associated with the onset of the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice ages]], coupled with the lowering of sea levels and resulting loss of suitable nursery areas, may have also contributed to its decline. A reduction in the diversity of [[baleen whale]]s and a shift in their distribution toward polar regions may have reduced megalodon's primary food source. A 2019 study reviewed newer evidence suggesting that competition from the modern great white shark may have also contributed to the extinction of megalodon, coupled with range fragmentation resulting in a gradual, asynchronous extinction as a result of cooling oceans around 3.6\u20134 million years ago, far earlier than previously assumed.<ref name=\"Boessenecker2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Boessenecker|first1=R.

It was formerly thought to be a member of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Lamnidae]] and a close relative of the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''). However, presently there is near unanimous [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] that it belongs to the extinct family [[Otodontidae]], which [[Speciation|diverged]] from the ancestry of the great white shark during the [[Early Cretaceous]]. Its genus placement is still debated, authors placing it in either ''[[Carcharocles]]'', ''Megaselachus'', ''[[Otodus]]'', or ''Procarcharodon''. This is because [[transitional fossil]]s have been found showing that Megalodon is the final [[chronospecies]] of a lineage of giant sharks originally of the genus ''Otodus'' which evolved during the [[Paleocene]].\n\nWhile regarded as one of the largest and most powerful predators to have ever lived, megalodon is known from fragmentary remains, and its appearance and maximum size are uncertain. Scientists differ on whether it would have more closely resembled a stockier version of the great white shark, the [[basking shark]] (''Cetorhinus maximus'') or the [[sand tiger shark]] (''Carcharias taurus''). Most estimates of megalodon's size extrapolate from teeth; with maximum length estimates up to {{convert|18|m|ft|sp=us}} and average length estimates of {{convert|10.5|m|ft|sp=us}}. Estimates suggest their large jaws could exert a bite force of up to {{convert|110,000|to|180,000|newtons|lbf}}.<ref name=\"GWB\" /> Their teeth were thick and robust, built for grabbing prey and breaking bone.\n\nMegalodon probably had a major impact on the structure of [[marine life|marine communities]]. The fossil record indicates that it had a [[cosmopolitan distribution]]. It probably targeted large prey, such as [[cetacea|whales]], [[pinniped|seals]] and [[sea turtle]]s. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters and fed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white, which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.\n\nThe animal faced competition from whale-eating cetaceans, such as ''[[Livyatan]]'' and other [[macroraptorial sperm whale]]s and possibly smaller ancestral killer whales. As the shark preferred warmer waters, it is thought that oceanic cooling associated with the onset of the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice ages]], coupled with the lowering of sea levels and resulting loss of suitable nursery areas, may have also contributed to its decline. A reduction in the diversity of [[baleen whale]]s and a shift in their distribution toward polar regions may have reduced megalodon's primary food source. A 2019 study reviewed newer evidence suggesting that competition from the modern great white shark may have also contributed to the extinction of megalodon, coupled with range fragmentation resulting in a gradual, asynchronous extinction as a result of cooling oceans around 3.6\u20134 million years ago, far earlier than previously assumed.<ref name=\"Boessenecker2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Boessenecker|first1=R.

He has an older sister, [[Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway|Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise]]. In accordance with Norway's [[agnatic primogeniture]] succession, Haakon became crown prince when his father ascended the throne on 17 January 1991 upon the death of his grandfather [[Olav V of Norway|Olav V]].\n\nThe [[Skaugum|Skaugum Estate]], situated in the area of [[Semsvannet]], is the official residence of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess.<ref>[http://www.royalcourt.no/artikkel.html?tid=28708&sek=28594 The Royal House of Norway - Skaugum Estate]</ref>\n\n== Family and early life ==\nHaakon was born in 20 July 1973 at [[Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet|The National Hospital]] in [[St. Hanshaugen]], [[Oslo]], the only son and younger child of [[Harald V of Norway|Crown Prince Harald]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Crown Princess Sonja]]. His father was the son of the reigning Norwegian monarch, [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V]]. At birth he was named Haakon Magnus, and it was stressed in the announcement that he would go by the name Haakon.{{refn|His godparents are King [[Olav V of Norway]], [[Princess Astrid of Norway]], [[Prince Carl, Duke of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland|Prince Carl Bernadotte]], King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden]], Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}}} He was named in honor of his paternal great-grandfather, [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]], and his maternal uncle Haakon Haraldsen. When Haakon was only 17, his grandfather Olav died on 17 January 1991, leading to the ascension of his father as King Harald V and himself as crown prince.\n\nHaakon has one sibling, [[Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway]] (born 1971). In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was altered, granting [[primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|absolute primogeniture]] to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. This was not, however, done retroactively (as, for example, Sweden had done in 1980), meaning that Haakon continues to take precedence over his older sister. He is also in the [[line of succession to the British throne]], albeit highly removed, as a great-great-grandson of [[Edward VII]].\n\n=== Education and military ===\nHaakon has served in the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]], where he undertook his first-level officer's education at the [[Norwegian Naval Academy]]. This was then followed with a year aboard missile [[torpedo boat]]s and other vessels. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[political science]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1999.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Crown-Prince-Breaks-Tradition-at-Berkeley-2969170.php|title=Crown Prince Breaks Tradition at Berkeley / Norway's royal son has enrolled at Cal|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref> Haakon later attended lectures at the [[University of Oslo]] and took the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' civil servant introductory course in 2001. He completed his education in 2003 at the [[London School of Economics]], where he was awarded an MSc in development studies, specializing in international trade and Africa.\n\nAs of 15 November 2013, in the Royal Norwegian Navy his [[officer rank]] is [[Military ranks and insignia of Norway|Admiral]], and in the [[Norwegian Army]] and the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] his rank is [[General]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/nb/aktuelt/hans-kongelige-hoyhet-kronprinsen-utnevn/id745632/ |title=Hans Kongelige H\u00f8yhet Kronprinsen utnevnes til admiral og general |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 November 2013 |website=[[Government.no]] |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Norway)|Ministry of Defence]] |accessdate=14 December 2013 |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613184317/https://www.regjeringen.no/nb/aktuelt/hans-kongelige-hoyhet-kronprinsen-utnevn/id745632/ |archivedate=13 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Marriage and children ==\n{{See also|Wedding of Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway, and Mette-Marit Tjessem H\u00f8iby}}\n\nHaakon married a [[commoner]] and single mother [[Mette-Marit Tjessem H\u00f8iby]] on 25 August 2001, at [[Oslo Cathedral]].

Haakon is also the stepfather to Mette-Marit's son Marius Borg H\u00f8iby.\n\n== Activities ==\n[[File:16-11-2015 Presidente em exerc\u00edcio, Michel Temer, recebe no Itamaraty o pr\u00edncipe herdeiro da Noruega, Haakon Magnus (23069823405).jpg|thumb|Haakon with then-Brazilian Vice President [[Michel Temer]] at the [[Itamaraty Palace]] in [[Bras\u00edlia]], Brazil, 16 November 2015.]]\n\nFrom 25 November 2003 to 12 April 2004, Haakon was [[regent]] during the King's treatment for cancer and the subsequent convalescence period. Likewise, Haakon was Regent from 29 March 2005 until the King had fully recovered from the heart surgery he underwent on 1 April. This period ended on 7 June.\n\nIn addition to his official duties, Haakon has a strong interest in cultural matters. He also has given patronage to a number of organisations. In 2006, Haakon established [[Global Dignity]] with [[Pekka Himanen]] and [[John Hope Bryant]]. Global Dignity is an independent, non-political organization that promotes the universal right of every human being to lead a dignified life. Members of the organization include entrepreneurs [[Sir Richard Branson]] and [[Sandro Salsano]].\n\n=== Personal interests ===\nHaakon was involved in several sports and seemed to take a particular liking to [[windsurfing]] and surfing. However, he has not engaged in serious competitions. Haakon is known as a big music fan. When he was younger, he attended music festivals all over Europe, including the [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark and the [[Quart Festival]] in [[Kristiansand]], Norway.\n\nHe has also been part of Olympics ceremonies. In 1994, the Crown Prince and his father played roles during the opening ceremony in [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer]]. While the King declared open the Games, the Crown Prince [[List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron|lit the cauldron]], paying tribute to his father and grandfather having served as Olympians. He attended the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver.\n\nHe accompanied the band [[Katzenjammer (band)|Katzenjammer]] in their recording of the song \"Vi tenner v\u00e5re lykter\" (for the 2011 [[Christmas]]-themed album of the same name).

Haakon Magnus; born 20 July 1973) is the only son of [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Queen Sonja]], and [[heir apparent]] to the [[throne of Norway]].\n\nIn 2001, Haakon married [[Mette-Marit Tjessem H\u00f8iby]] with whom he has two children. He has an older sister, [[Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway|Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise]]. In accordance with Norway's [[agnatic primogeniture]] succession, Haakon became crown prince when his father ascended the throne on 17 January 1991 upon the death of his grandfather [[Olav V of Norway|Olav V]].\n\nThe [[Skaugum|Skaugum Estate]], situated in the area of [[Semsvannet]], is the official residence of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess.<ref>[http://www.royalcourt.no/artikkel.html?tid=28708&sek=28594 The Royal House of Norway - Skaugum Estate]</ref>\n\n== Family and early life ==\nHaakon was born in 20 July 1973 at [[Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet|The National Hospital]] in [[St. Hanshaugen]], [[Oslo]], the only son and younger child of [[Harald V of Norway|Crown Prince Harald]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Crown Princess Sonja]]. His father was the son of the reigning Norwegian monarch, [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V]]. At birth he was named Haakon Magnus, and it was stressed in the announcement that he would go by the name Haakon.{{refn|His godparents are King [[Olav V of Norway]], [[Princess Astrid of Norway]], [[Prince Carl, Duke of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland|Prince Carl Bernadotte]], King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden]], Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}}} He was named in honor of his paternal great-grandfather, [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]], and his maternal uncle Haakon Haraldsen. When Haakon was only 17, his grandfather Olav died on 17 January 1991, leading to the ascension of his father as King Harald V and himself as crown prince.\n\nHaakon has one sibling, [[Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise of Norway]] (born 1971). In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was altered, granting [[primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|absolute primogeniture]] to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. This was not, however, done retroactively (as, for example, Sweden had done in 1980), meaning that Haakon continues to take precedence over his older sister. He is also in the [[line of succession to the British throne]], albeit highly removed, as a great-great-grandson of [[Edward VII]].\n\n=== Education and military ===\nHaakon has served in the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]], where he undertook his first-level officer's education at the [[Norwegian Naval Academy]]. This was then followed with a year aboard missile [[torpedo boat]]s and other vessels. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[political science]] from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1999.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Crown-Prince-Breaks-Tradition-at-Berkeley-2969170.php|title=Crown Prince Breaks Tradition at Berkeley / Norway's royal son has enrolled at Cal|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-05-31}}</ref> Haakon later attended lectures at the [[University of Oslo]] and took the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' civil servant introductory course in 2001. He completed his education in 2003 at the [[London School of Economics]], where he was awarded an MSc in development studies, specializing in international trade and Africa.\n\nAs of 15 November 2013, in the Royal Norwegian Navy his [[officer rank]] is [[Military ranks and insignia of Norway|Admiral]], and in the [[Norwegian Army]] and the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] his rank is [[General]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/nb/aktuelt/hans-kongelige-hoyhet-kronprinsen-utnevn/id745632/ |title=Hans Kongelige H\u00f8yhet Kronprinsen utnevnes til admiral og general |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 November 2013 |website=[[Government.no]] |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Norway)|Ministry of Defence]] |accessdate=14 December 2013 |language=Norwegian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613184317/https://www.regjeringen.no/nb/aktuelt/hans-kongelige-hoyhet-kronprinsen-utnevn/id745632/ |archivedate=13 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\n== Marriage and children ==\n{{See also|Wedding of Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway, and Mette-Marit Tjessem H\u00f8iby}}\n\nHaakon married a [[commoner]] and single mother [[Mette-Marit Tjessem H\u00f8iby]] on 25 August 2001, at [[Oslo Cathedral]].

Haakon is also the stepfather to Mette-Marit's son Marius Borg H\u00f8iby.\n\n== Activities ==\n[[File:16-11-2015 Presidente em exerc\u00edcio, Michel Temer, recebe no Itamaraty o pr\u00edncipe herdeiro da Noruega, Haakon Magnus (23069823405).jpg|thumb|Haakon with then-Brazilian Vice President [[Michel Temer]] at the [[Itamaraty Palace]] in [[Bras\u00edlia]], Brazil, 16 November 2015.]]\n\nFrom 25 November 2003 to 12 April 2004, Haakon was [[regent]] during the King's treatment for cancer and the subsequent convalescence period. Likewise, Haakon was Regent from 29 March 2005 until the King had fully recovered from the heart surgery he underwent on 1 April. This period ended on 7 June.\n\nIn addition to his official duties, Haakon has a strong interest in cultural matters. He also has given patronage to a number of organisations. In 2006, Haakon established [[Global Dignity]] with [[Pekka Himanen]] and [[John Hope Bryant]]. Global Dignity is an independent, non-political organization that promotes the universal right of every human being to lead a dignified life. Members of the organization include entrepreneurs [[Sir Richard Branson]] and [[Sandro Salsano]].\n\n=== Personal interests ===\nHaakon was involved in several sports and seemed to take a particular liking to [[windsurfing]] and surfing. However, he has not engaged in serious competitions. Haakon is known as a big music fan. When he was younger, he attended music festivals all over Europe, including the [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark and the [[Quart Festival]] in [[Kristiansand]], Norway.\n\nHe has also been part of Olympics ceremonies. In 1994, the Crown Prince and his father played roles during the opening ceremony in [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer]]. While the King declared open the Games, the Crown Prince [[List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron|lit the cauldron]], paying tribute to his father and grandfather having served as Olympians. He attended the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver.\n\nHe accompanied the band [[Katzenjammer (band)|Katzenjammer]] in their recording of the song \"Vi tenner v\u00e5re lykter\" (for the 2011 [[Christmas]]-themed album of the same name).

After Scrooge locks the boys in a room for making fun of him, the triplets come across Webby Vanderquack, who befriends them and shows off a collection of relics and artifacts that Scrooge and Donald collected during their previous adventures, only to accidentally release various ancient evils housed in them. After the kids help him contain them, Scrooge finds his thirst for adventure rekindled and decides to take them all, along with his driver/pilot Launchpad McQuack, to find the Lost Jewel of [[Atlantis]]. However, the group are unaware that Scrooge's rival, [[Flintheart Glomgold]] ([[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]), seeks the jewel as well and has hired Donald as his sailor; leading to a race against time to claim the relic. During their quest, Dewey argues with Scrooge about locking him and his brothers up and not wanting them around, though they later reconcile. In the end, Scrooge gets the Jewel, and Donald and the boys move into McDuck Manor after an accident costs them their houseboat.

However, it fails and Lunaris reveals his plan to make the Earth revolve around the Moon using a planetary engine. Elsewhere, Della flies the kids to safety, disguising it as a recruitment drive, but they're attacked and crash on an island, where they find Donald. Della tries to sway the others from leaving, until Louie helps her see that it's okay to have bad experiences because there will be good ones. Gladstone and Fethry soon find them and take them back to Duckburg on Mitzi. Meanwhile, Scrooge reluctantly teams up with Glomgold and defeats Lunaris with a dumb, but successful plan. Lunaris flees in his ship and attempts to blow up the Earth, leading to a space battle against the Ducks. In the end, Penumbra arrives and damages Lunaris' ship, leaving him stranded in space. Afterwards, the Moonlanders stop the invasion and the family celebrates, unaware of F.O.W.L watching them.\n |LineColor       = F89E32\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 3 (2020) ===\n{{Episode table|background=#960018|overall=|season=|title=|director=|writer=|aux2=|aux2T=Storyboard by|airdate=|prodcode=|prodcodeR=<ref name=WDTV>{{cite web|url=https://www.wdtvpress.com/disneyxd/shows/ducktales/episodes/|title=Disney XD - DuckTales: Episode Info|website=Walt Disney Television Press|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref>|viewers=|country=U.S.|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 48\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\n |RTitle          = \n |DirectedBy      = Matthew Humphreys\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Francisco Angones, Madison Bateman, Colleen Evanson, Christian Magalhaes & Bob Snow|t=Angones & Bateman}}\n |Aux2            = Stephanie Gonzaga, Krystal Ureta & Brandon Warren\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|4}}\n |ProdCode        =  304\n |Viewers         = 0.19<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-saturday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-4-20.html|title=Top 150 Saturday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.4.2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|author=Mitch Metcalf|date=April 7, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = As part of their Junior Woodchuck graduation, Huey and Violet must compete in a challenge to earn the title of Senior Woodchuck.

After Violet saves his life, he admits she's a better Woodchuck and forfeits the competition.

While he insists they are missing out, the others remind him that it is more meaningful to have your own adventure than to follow someone else's. The bird ultimately leads them to Finch's treasure: her lost adventure journal which contains a list of legendary treasures she was unable to find.

When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: \"The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response.\"</ref><ref name=topten>Mulcahy (2014).</ref> Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.<ref>[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H. Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W. H. Freeman & Co., 1989, {{ISBN|0-7167-1987-8}}, Chapter 4. A non-technical overview; reprint of the 1976 Scientific American article.</ref> \n\nConway was probably the most important member of [[Martin Gardner#Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine|Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine]]. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], August 28, 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W.

He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], August 28, 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway is widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe is also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]]. Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that in which every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers, each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practices his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.
