Kane Cornes is also a ex firefighter who was sacked for being too gutless to perform his duties \n\n==Early life==\n\nA product of [[Sacred Heart College Senior, Adelaide|Sacred Heart College]] and [[Glenelg Football Club|Glenelg]] in the [[SANFL]], he made his AFL debut in 2001 after being selected with pick 20 in the [[2000 AFL Draft]]. Prior to his professional football career he attended Sacred Heart College, which is one of the most prolific schools in Australia in terms of producing Australian Rules footballers. His [[All Australian]] brother, [[Chad Cornes]], also attended Sacred Heart College and played for Glenelg in the SANFL. They are the sons of South Australian football identity [[Graham Cornes]], and stepsons of 2007 Federal Labor candidate [[Nicole Cornes]]. They have three younger half-sisters paternally.\n\n==AFL career==\nIn 2001 and 2002, Cornes played in Port Adelaide's two pre-season competition winning teams.\n\nThen in 2004, the team made the step up, and Cornes was in the team that won the 2004 AFL premiership, Port Adelaide's first in the AFL. 2004, Cornes' fourth season in the competition, saw him cement his position in the midfield, averaging 20 disposals a game.\n\nCornes continued his good form into 2005 becoming [[All Australian]], and in 2006 played his 100th game for the club in round 7, and topped the AFL Dreamteam competition, despite his team Port Adelaide having a bad year. \n\nIn 2007, Cornes won [[All Australian]] selection for the second time in a team otherwise dominated by Geelong players. He was also the leading possession winner in the AFL, received the most Brownlow votes for the year for Port Adelaide, and won their best and fairest, the [[John Cahill Medal]], ahead of brother [[Chad Cornes|Chad]].\n\nIn 2010, Cornes took out his third John Cahill Medal and confirmed his reputation as the club's most consistent player through a new attacking role that went beyond his previous role of merely tagging the opposition's best players. His 36-possession, 2-goal game against the Western Bulldogs in Round 16 of that year was a highlight, in addition to a 38-possession effort against West Coast late in the year. Instrumental in the Power's late season fortunes, he was well-deserving of his third best and fairest merit and highlighted his durability as a mainstay of the Port Adelaide engine room.\n\nIn 2011, Cornes had a difficult season by his standards as he adjusted to a new role which took him further away from his traditional tagging duties. Before 2011, Cornes had not missed a single game since 2003. But round 4, 2011 saw his streak of 174 consecutive games come to an end when he was omitted from the side.<ref>[http://www.finalsiren.com/PlayerStats.asp?PlayerID=1184]</ref> Playing more on the wing and across halfback, he was sent back to Glenelg in the SANFL with a view to adapting better to the coaching panel's new expectations. He still managed to play 17 games out of a possible 23, despite spending time back at the SANFL Tigers, and was serviceable in his ball-winning ability.\n\nCornes made an impressive return to form in 2012, playing every game, and playing an exceptional season as a setup midfielder. He won his fourth John Cahill Medal on the back of his season and polled again in the Brownlow Medal votes. He once again topped the disposals count for the season. Cornes received high praise for returning to his acclaimed tagging football with top performances on midfield heavyweights [[Brent Harvey]] (North Melbourne) and [[Gary Ablett, Jr.|Gary Ablett]] (Gold Coast).\n\nCornes reached his 250th game in Round 5 of 2013, where Port Adelaide came from 41-points down to win 12.12 (84) to 10.19 (79) at AAMI Stadium against the West Coast Eagles, taking the Power to a 5\u20130 start to the season. Shortly after, Cornes passed Warren Tredrea's record of 258 games to become the man who has played the most games for Port Adelaide in the AFL, in a match where Port thrashed Greater Western Sydney at Skoda Stadium, 19.11 (125) to 6.14 (50). Cornes has played a vital role under Ken Hinkley in reinventing Port Adelaide and getting the team back into finals in 2013, and helping the Power to their best ever start to an AFL season in 2014, starting 10\u20131, before eventually losing the 2014 preliminary final to Hawthorn, the eventual premiers, by three points.\n\nCornes' 2015 season was short. He played the first two games of the season before being rested in round three. He then played a further three games to take his career tally to 298 before announcing that the round 8 game against [[Richmond Tigers|Richmond]] would be his 300th and last to join the [[South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service]].<ref name=retire>{{cite news|url=http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/news/2015-05-14/kane-cornes-retires|title=Kane Cornes to retire after becoming Power's first 300-gamer|first=Matthew|last=Agius|date=14 May 2015|website=portadelaide.com.au|publisher=[[Bigpond]]|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref> He finished his Port Adelaide career having played a total of 300 games, winning 4 best and fairest, two All Australian guernseys and a premiership.\n\n== Media career ==\nCornes took up a full time media career in 2016 after leaving the South Australia Metropolitan Fire Service, where he had been trying to do both, with appearances on [[The Sunday Footy Show (AFL)|The Sunday Footy Show]] and [[1116 SEN]], as well as writing for [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sen.com.au/news/kane-cornes/|title=Kane Cornes news from SEN 1116|website=www.sen.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/expert-opinion/kane-cornes|title=AFL Opinion {{!}} The Advertiser|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref> He is known for his critical and divisive views including an on-going feud with [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide Crows]] player [[Taylor Walker (footballer)|Taylor Walker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-2019-adelaides-taylor-walker-clips-kane-cornes-over-fireman-career-in-latest-instalment-of-feud/news-story/595a3bf79845f839a1ae7eec7cd9580e|title=AFL 2019: Taylor Walker v Kane Cornes feud, fireman career joke, history of feud between Adelaide captain, Power champion|date=2019-06-21|website=Fox Sports|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 31 December 2004, Kane married long-time girlfriend, who he met at Sacred Heart College, Lucy.

Prior to his professional football career he attended Sacred Heart College, which is one of the most prolific schools in Australia in terms of producing Australian Rules footballers. His [[All Australian]] brother, [[Chad Cornes]], also attended Sacred Heart College and played for Glenelg in the SANFL. They are the sons of South Australian football identity [[Graham Cornes]], and stepsons of 2007 Federal Labor candidate [[Nicole Cornes]]. They have three younger half-sisters paternally.\n\n==AFL career==\nIn 2001 and 2002, Cornes played in Port Adelaide's two pre-season competition winning teams.\n\nThen in 2004, the team made the step up, and Cornes was in the team that won the 2004 AFL premiership, Port Adelaide's first in the AFL. 2004, Cornes' fourth season in the competition, saw him cement his position in the midfield, averaging 20 disposals a game.\n\nCornes continued his good form into 2005 becoming [[All Australian]], and in 2006 played his 100th game for the club in round 7, and topped the AFL Dreamteam competition, despite his team Port Adelaide having a bad year. \n\nIn 2007, Cornes won [[All Australian]] selection for the second time in a team otherwise dominated by Geelong players. He was also the leading possession winner in the AFL, received the most Brownlow votes for the year for Port Adelaide, and won their best and fairest, the [[John Cahill Medal]], ahead of brother [[Chad Cornes|Chad]].\n\nIn 2010, Cornes took out his third John Cahill Medal and confirmed his reputation as the club's most consistent player through a new attacking role that went beyond his previous role of merely tagging the opposition's best players. His 36-possession, 2-goal game against the Western Bulldogs in Round 16 of that year was a highlight, in addition to a 38-possession effort against West Coast late in the year. Instrumental in the Power's late season fortunes, he was well-deserving of his third best and fairest merit and highlighted his durability as a mainstay of the Port Adelaide engine room.\n\nIn 2011, Cornes had a difficult season by his standards as he adjusted to a new role which took him further away from his traditional tagging duties. Before 2011, Cornes had not missed a single game since 2003. But round 4, 2011 saw his streak of 174 consecutive games come to an end when he was omitted from the side.<ref>[http://www.finalsiren.com/PlayerStats.asp?PlayerID=1184]</ref> Playing more on the wing and across halfback, he was sent back to Glenelg in the SANFL with a view to adapting better to the coaching panel's new expectations. He still managed to play 17 games out of a possible 23, despite spending time back at the SANFL Tigers, and was serviceable in his ball-winning ability.\n\nCornes made an impressive return to form in 2012, playing every game, and playing an exceptional season as a setup midfielder. He won his fourth John Cahill Medal on the back of his season and polled again in the Brownlow Medal votes. He once again topped the disposals count for the season. Cornes received high praise for returning to his acclaimed tagging football with top performances on midfield heavyweights [[Brent Harvey]] (North Melbourne) and [[Gary Ablett, Jr.|Gary Ablett]] (Gold Coast).\n\nCornes reached his 250th game in Round 5 of 2013, where Port Adelaide came from 41-points down to win 12.12 (84) to 10.19 (79) at AAMI Stadium against the West Coast Eagles, taking the Power to a 5\u20130 start to the season. Shortly after, Cornes passed Warren Tredrea's record of 258 games to become the man who has played the most games for Port Adelaide in the AFL, in a match where Port thrashed Greater Western Sydney at Skoda Stadium, 19.11 (125) to 6.14 (50). Cornes has played a vital role under Ken Hinkley in reinventing Port Adelaide and getting the team back into finals in 2013, and helping the Power to their best ever start to an AFL season in 2014, starting 10\u20131, before eventually losing the 2014 preliminary final to Hawthorn, the eventual premiers, by three points.\n\nCornes' 2015 season was short. He played the first two games of the season before being rested in round three. He then played a further three games to take his career tally to 298 before announcing that the round 8 game against [[Richmond Tigers|Richmond]] would be his 300th and last to join the [[South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service]].<ref name=retire>{{cite news|url=http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/news/2015-05-14/kane-cornes-retires|title=Kane Cornes to retire after becoming Power's first 300-gamer|first=Matthew|last=Agius|date=14 May 2015|website=portadelaide.com.au|publisher=[[Bigpond]]|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref> He finished his Port Adelaide career having played a total of 300 games, winning 4 best and fairest, two All Australian guernseys and a premiership.\n\n== Media career ==\nCornes took up a full time media career in 2016 after leaving the South Australia Metropolitan Fire Service, where he had been trying to do both, with appearances on [[The Sunday Footy Show (AFL)|The Sunday Footy Show]] and [[1116 SEN]], as well as writing for [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sen.com.au/news/kane-cornes/|title=Kane Cornes news from SEN 1116|website=www.sen.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/expert-opinion/kane-cornes|title=AFL Opinion {{!}} The Advertiser|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref> He is known for his critical and divisive views including an on-going feud with [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide Crows]] player [[Taylor Walker (footballer)|Taylor Walker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-2019-adelaides-taylor-walker-clips-kane-cornes-over-fireman-career-in-latest-instalment-of-feud/news-story/595a3bf79845f839a1ae7eec7cd9580e|title=AFL 2019: Taylor Walker v Kane Cornes feud, fireman career joke, history of feud between Adelaide captain, Power champion|date=2019-06-21|website=Fox Sports|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 31 December 2004, Kane married long-time girlfriend, who he met at Sacred Heart College, Lucy.

{"title_page": "Territory (animal)", "text_new": "{{short description|An area a wild animal consistently defends}}\n{{Other uses|Territory (disambiguation)}}\n{{lead too short|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:JenB Marking Territory.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A male [[South China tiger]] scent-marking his territory]]\n\nIn [[ethology]], '''territory''' is the sociographical area that an [[animal]] of a particular [[species]] consistently defends against [[conspecificity|conspecifics]] (or, occasionally, animals of other species). Animals that defend territories in this way are referred to as '''territorial'''.\n\nTerritoriality is only shown by a minority of species. More commonly, an individual or a group of animals has an area that it habitually uses but does not necessarily defend; this is called the [[Home Range|home range]]. The home ranges of different groups of animals often overlap, or in the overlap areas, the groups tend to avoid each other rather than seeking to expel each other. Within the home range there may be a ''core area'' that no other individual group uses, but, again, this is as a result of avoidance.\n\n==Function==\nThe ultimate function of animals inhabiting and defending a territory is to increase the individual [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] or [[inclusive fitness]] of the animals expressing the behaviour. Fitness in this biological sense relates to the ability of an animal to survive and raise young. The proximate functions of territory defense vary. For some animals, the reason for such protective behaviour is to acquire and protect food sources, nesting sites, mating areas, or to attract a mate.\n\n==Types and size==\nAmong birds, territories have been classified as six types.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdterritories.html|author=Anon.|title=Ornithology: territoriality and coloniality|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n*Type A: An 'all-purpose territory' in which all activities occur, e.g. courtship, mating, nesting and foraging\n*Type B: A mating and nesting territory, not including most of the area used for foraging.\n*Type C: A nesting territory which includes the nest plus a small area around it. Common in colonial waterbirds.\n*Type D: A pairing and mating territory. The type of territory defended by males in lekking species.\n*Type E: Roosting territory. \n*Type F: Winter territory which typically includes foraging areas and roost sites. May be equivalent (in terms of location) to the Type A territory, or for a migratory species, may be on the wintering grounds.\n\nReports of territory size can be confused by a lack of distinction between home range and the defended territory. The size and shape of a territory can vary according to its purpose, season, the amount and quality of resources it contains, or the geography. The size is usually a compromise of resource needs, defense costs, predation pressure and reproductive needs.\n\nSome species of [[squirrels]] may claim as much as {{convert|10|ha}} of territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animals.pawnation.com/squirrel-behavior-territory-4745.html|title=Squirrel behaviour and territory|author=Turpin, K.|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>\nFor [[European badger]]s, a home range may be as small as {{convert|30|ha}} in a good rural habitat, but as large as {{convert|300|ha}} in a poor habitat. On average, a territory may be approximately {{convert|50|ha}}, with main setts normally at least {{convert|500|m}} apart. In urban areas, territories can be as small as {{convert|5|ha}}, if they can obtain enough food from bird tables, food waste or artificial feeding in suburban gardens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.badgerland.co.uk/animals/family/territories.html|title=Territories|author=Anon.|publisher=www.badgerland.co.uk|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref> [[Spotted hyena]]s (''Crocuta crocuta'') have highly variable territory sizes, ranging from less than {{convert|4000|ha}} in the Ngorongoro Crater to over {{convert|100000|ha}} in the Kalahari.<ref>Kruuk, H., (1972).

University of California Press, {{ISBN|0226455084}}</ref>\n\nIn birds, [[golden eagles]] (''Aquila chrysaetos'') have territories of {{convert|9000|ha}}, [[least flycatcher]]s' (''Empidonax minimus'') territories are about {{convert|600|m2}} and [[gulls]] have territories of only a few square centimetres in the immediate vicinity of the nest.<ref name=\"Ehrlich\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Territoriality.html|title=Territoriality|author=Ehrlich, P.R., Dobkin, D.S. and Wheye, D.|year=1998|accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTerritories can be linear. [[Sanderling]]s (''Calidris alba'') forage on beaches and sandflats. When on beaches, they feed either in flocks or individual territories of 10 to 120 metres of shoreline.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Connors | first2 = P.G. | last3 = Pitelka | first3 = F.A. | year = 1979 | title = Territory size in wintering Sanderlings: the effects of prey abundance and intruder density | url =https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v096n03/p0551-p0561.pdf | journal = Auk | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 551\u2013561 }}</ref>\n\nThe time to develop territories varies between animals.

Many animals create \"sign-posts\" to advertise their territory. Sometimes these sign-posts are on the boundary thereby demarcating the territory, or, may be scattered throughout the territory. These communicate to other animals that the territory is occupied and may also communicate additional information such as the sex, reproductive status or [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] status of the territory-holder. Sign-posts may communicate information by [[olfactory]], auditory, or visual means, or a combination of these. If an intruder progresses further into the territory beyond the sign-posts and encounters the territory-holder, both animals may begin [[ritualized aggression]] toward each other. This is a series of stylised postures, vocalisations, displays, etc. which function to solve the territory dispute without actual fighting as this could injure either or both animals. Ritualized aggression often ends by one of the animals fleeing (generally the intruder). If this does not happen, the territory may be defended by actual fighting, although this is generally a last resort.\n\n===Advertising the territory===\n{{anchor|Spraying}}\n\n====Scent marking====\n{{further|White-tailed deer}}\n{{commons category|Scent marking}}\n\nScent marking, also known as territorial marking or [[Spraying (animal behavior)|spraying]] when this involves [[urination]], is a behaviour used by animals to identify their territory.<ref>Gosling, L.

In a behaviour called \"spur marking\", they grasp the substrate, usually a small sapling, and drag the spur over it, cutting into the wood and spreading the gland's secretions.

This is [[ritualized aggression]]. Such defense frequently involves a graded series of behaviours or displays that include threatening gestures (such as vocalizations, spreading of wings or gill covers, lifting and presentation of claws, head bobbing, tail and body beating) and finally, direct attack.\n\n===Defense===\nTerritories may be held by an individual, a [[mated pair|mated]] or unmated pair, or a group. Territoriality is not always a fixed behavioural characteristic of a species. For example, red foxes (''Vulpes vulpes'') either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with [[no fixed abode]].<ref name=\"mac117\">{{Harvnb|Macdonald|1987|p=117}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}<!--Which book or paper is intended here? Ref does not point anywhere--></ref> Territories may vary with time (season), for example, [[European robin]]s defend territories as pairs during the breeding season but as individuals during the winter. Resource availability may cause changes in territoriality, for example, some [[nectarivore]]s defend territories only during the mornings when plants are richest in nectar. In species that do not form pair bonds, male and female territories are often independent, i.e. males defend territories only against other males and females only against other females. In this case, if the species is [[polygyny|polygynous]], one male territory probably contains several female territories, while in some [[polyandry|polyandrous]] species such as the [[northern jacana]], this situation is reversed.\n\n==Strategies==\nAnimals may use several strategies to defend their territories.\n\nThe first [[Game theory#Biology|game theory model]] of fighting is known as the ''[[Chicken (game)|hawk-dove game]]''. This model pits a hawk strategy (always try to injure your opponent and only withdraw from the contest if an injury is received) against a dove strategy (always use a non-injurious display if the rival is another dove and always withdraw if the rival is a hawk).\n\nAnother strategy used in territory defence is the [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]]. In this model of aggression, two contestants compete for a resource by persisting while constantly accumulating costs over the time that the contest lasts. Strategically, the game is an auction in which the prize goes to the player with the highest bid, and each player pays the loser's low bid.\n\nSome animals use a strategy termed the ''[[dear enemy effect]]'' in which two neighbouring territorial animals become less aggressive toward one another once territorial borders are well-established and they are familiar to each other, but aggression toward unfamiliar animals remains unaffected.<ref>Fisher, J., {1954}. Evolution and bird sociality. In: ''Evolution As a Process'' (Huxley, J., Hardy, A. and Ford, E., eds). London, Allen and Unwin. pp. 71-83</ref> The converse of this is the ''[[nasty neighbour effect]]'' in which a territory-holder shows heightened aggression toward neighbouring territory-holders but unaffected aggression to unfamiliar animals or distant territory-holders. These contrasting strategies depend on which intruder (familiar or unfamiliar) poses the greatest threat to the resident territory-holder.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = M\u00fcller | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Manser | first2 = M.B. | year = 2007 | title = 'Nasty neighbours' rather than 'dear enemies' in a social carnivore | url = | journal = Proc.

In selecting a territory, the size and quality play crucial roles in determining an animal's habitat. Territory size generally tends to be no larger than the organism requires to survive, because defending a larger territory incurs greater energy, time and risk of injury costs. For some animals, the territory size is not the most important aspect of territoriality, but rather the quality of the defended territory.\n\nBehavioural ecologists have argued that food distribution determines whether a species is territorial or not, however, this may be too narrow a perspective. Several other type of resource may be defended including partners, potential mates, offspring, nests or lairs, display areas or [[lek (animal behavior)|leks]]. Territoriality emerges where there is a focused resource that provides enough for the individual or group, within a boundary that is small enough to be defended without the expenditure of excessive effort. Territoriality is often most strong towards [[conspecifics]], as shown in the case of [[Ophioblennius atlanticus|redlip blenny]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nursall|first=J.R.|title=Territoriality in Redlip blennies (Ophioblennius atlanticus-Pisces: Blenniidae)|journal=Journal of Zoology|year=1977|volume=182|issue=2|series=2|pages=205\u2013223|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04156.x}}</ref> This is because the conspecifics share exactly the same set of resources.\n\nSeveral types of resource in a territory may be defended.\n[[File:Vanellus vanellus mobbing Circus aeruginosus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A western marsh harrier is mobbed by a northern lapwing. The marsh harrier, a male, had been quartering the ground in which lapwing and redshank were nesting.]]\n\n'''Food:''' Large solitary (or paired) carnivores, such as [[bear]]s and the bigger [[Bird of prey|raptors]] require an extensive protected area to guarantee their food supply. This territoriality only breaks down when there is a glut of food, for example when [[grizzly bear]]s are attracted to migrating [[salmon]].\n\nFood related territoriality is least likely with insectivorous birds, where the food supply is plentiful but unpredictably distributed. [[Swift]]s rarely defend an area larger than the nest. Conversely, other insectivorous birds that occupy more constrained territories, such as the ground-nesting [[blacksmith lapwing]] may be very territorial, especially in the breeding season during which they not only threaten or attack many kinds of intruders, but have stereotyped display behaviour to deter conspecifics sharing neighbouring nesting spots.\n\nThe [[owl limpet]] (''Lottia gigantea'') is a large (up to 8&nbsp;cm in length) limpet. It lives in association with an approximately 1,000&nbsp;cm^2 area of algal film in which its grazing marks can be seen, whereas the remainder of the rock surface is usually free of any visible film. These areas of algal film represent the territories of the Lottia; within them the animals do all their grazing. They keep their territories free of other organisms by shoving off any intruders: other Lottia, grazing limpets of the genus Acmaea, predatory snails, and sessile organisms such as anemones and barnacles.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1933604 | last1 = Stimson | first1 = J. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1969 | title = Territoriality of the owl limpet ''Lottia gigantea'' | jstor = 1933604| journal = [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 113\u2013118 }}</ref>\n\n'''Nests and offspring:''' Many birds, particularly seabirds, nest in dense communities but are nonetheless territorial in defending their nesting site to within the distance they can reach while brooding. This is necessary to prevent attacks on their own chicks or nesting material from neighbours. Commonly the resulting superimposition of the short-range repulsion onto the long-range attraction characteristically leads to the well-known roughly hexagonal spacing of nests. One gets a similar hexagonal spacing resulting from the territorial behaviour of gardening limpets such as species of [[Scutellastra]].<ref>Branch, G.M., Griffiths, C., Beckley, L.E., Branch, M.L.; Two Oceans.

Groups typically contain several [[philopatric]] adult sons (and daughters) that are believed not to breed in their natal group and all group members participate in territorial defence. Males defend their territory using a nasty neignbour strategy. Group-living male breeders are nearly five times more aggressive towards their neighbours than towards strangers, leading to the prediction that neighbours are the most important competitors for paternity. Using a molecular parentage analysis it has been shown that 28% of offspring are sired by neighbouring males and only 7% by strangers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schradin | first1 = C. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = C. | last3 = Lindholm | first3 = A.K. | year = 2010 | title = The nasty neighbour in the striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) steals paternity and elicits aggression | url = | journal = Frontiers in Zoology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 19 | doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-7-19 | pmid = 20573184 | pmc = 2908079 }}</ref> In certain species of butterflies, such as the [[Australian painted lady]] butterfly and the [[Speckled wood (butterfly)|speckled wood butterfly]], the male defends territories that receptive females are likely to fly through such as sunny hilltops and sunspots on a forest's floor.<ref name=\"Alcock and Gwynne, 1988\">{{cite journal|last=Alcock|first=John|author2=Gwynne Daryl |title=The mating system of Vanessa kershawi: Males defend landmark territories as mate encounter sites|journal=Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera|year=1988|volume=26|issue=1\u20134|pages=116\u2013124}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies 1978\">{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=N.B.|title=Territorial defense in the speckled wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria): The resident always wins|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=1978|volume=26|pages=138\u2013147|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(78)90013-1|citeseerx=10.1.1.513.4639}}</ref>\n\nTerritory defence in male variegated pupfish (''[[Cyprinodon]] variegatus'') is dependent on the presence of females.

Thus, this dear enemy territoriality relationship is not a fixed pattern but a flexible one likely to evolve with social and ecological circumstances.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Briefer | first1 = E. | last2 = Rybak | first2 = F. | last3 = Aubin | first3 = T. | year = 2008 | title = When to be a dear enemy: flexible acoustic relationships of neighbouring skylarks, Alauda arvensis | url = https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=acwp_ena| journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 76 | issue = 4| pages = 1319\u20131325 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.06.017}}</ref>\n\nSome species of bees also exhibit territoriality to defend mating sites. For example, in ''[[Euglossa imperialis]],'' a non-social bee species, males have been observed to occasionally form aggregations of fragrance-rich territories, considered to be leks. These leks serve only a facultative purpose for this species, in which the more fragrance-rich sites there are, the greater the number of habitable territories. Since these territories are aggregated, females have a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate within the aggregation, giving females the power of mate choice.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kimsey | first1 = Lynn Siri | year = 1980 | title = The behaviour of male orchid bees (Apidae, Hymenoptera, Insecta) and the question of leks | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 996\u20131004 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(80)80088-1}}</ref> Similar behaviour is also observed in the ''[[Eulaema meriana]]'' orchid bee. Males in this species of bee show alternative behaviours of territoriality and transiency. Transient male bees did not defend territories, but instead flew from one territory to the other. They also did not engage in physical contact with the territorial males. On the other hand, territorial males patrolled an area around a tree and used the same territory for up to 49 days. It also appeared that they gave up territories to new males without violence. Males defend territories solely for mating, and no other resources such as fragrances, nests, nest construction materials, nectar, or pollen are found at these territories.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Male Territoriality and Alternative Male Behaviors in the Euglossine Bee, Eulaema meriana (Hymenoptera: Apidae)|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|date = 1991-10-01|pages = 421\u2013437|volume = 64|issue = 4|first = David L.|last = Stern|jstor=25085309}}</ref>\n\n===Single resource territories===\nAlthough most territories contain multiple (potential) resources, some territories are defended for only one purpose. [[Common blackbird|European blackbirds]] may defend feeding territories that are distant from their nest sites, and in some species that form leks, for example in the [[Kob|Uganda kob]] (a [[grazing antelope]]) and the marine iguana, males defend the lek site which is used only for mating.\n\n==Polyterritoriality==\nMany species demonstrate polyterritoriality, referring to the act of claiming or defending more than one territory. In the [[European pied flycatcher]] (''Ficedula hypoleuca''), researchers assert that males exhibit polyterritoriality to deceive females of the species into entering into polygynous relationships. This hypothesis, named the [[Deception in animals|deception]] hypothesis, claims that males have territories at distances sufficiently great that females are unable to discern already-mated males. The observation that males travelled long distances, ranging from 200m to 3.5&nbsp;km, to find a second mate supports this argument.<ref name=\"jstor\">{{cite journal| last= Alatalo | first= Rauno V. |author2=Carlson, Allan |author3=Lundberg, Arne |author4=Ulfstrand, Staffan | year= 1981| title= The Conflict Between Male Polygamy and Female Monogamy: The Case of the Pied Flycatcher ''Ficedula hypoleuca'' | journal= The American Naturalist | volume= 117 |language = | issue = 5 | pages= 738\u2013753 | url = | doi =10.1086/283756 }}</ref> The debate about polyterritoriality in this species may initiate research about the evolution and reasons for polyterritoriality in other unrelated species.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aggression]]\n* [[Alpha (biology)]]\n* [[Biological interaction]]\n* [[Dear enemy recognition]]\n* [[Property]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Walther, F.

Animals that defend territories in this way are referred to as '''territorial'''.\n\nTerritoriality is only shown by a minority of species. More commonly, an individual or a group of animals has an area that it habitually uses but does not necessarily defend; this is called the [[Home Range|home range]]. The home ranges of different groups of animals often overlap, or in the overlap areas, the groups tend to avoid each other rather than seeking to expel each other. Within the home range there may be a ''core area'' that no other individual group uses, but, again, this is as a result of avoidance.\n\n==Function==\nThe ultimate function of animals inhabiting and defending a territory is to increase the individual [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] or [[inclusive fitness]] of the animals expressing the behaviour. Fitness in this biological sense relates to the ability of an animal to survive and raise young. The proximate functions of territory defense vary. For some animals, the reason for such protective behaviour is to acquire and protect food sources, nesting sites, mating areas, or to attract a mate.\n\n==Types and size==\nAmong birds, territories have been classified as six types.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdterritories.html|author=Anon.|title=Ornithology: territoriality and coloniality|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n*Type A: An 'all-purpose territory' in which all activities occur, e.g. courtship, mating, nesting and foraging\n*Type B: A mating and nesting territory, not including most of the area used for foraging.\n*Type C: A nesting territory which includes the nest plus a small area around it. Common in colonial waterbirds.\n*Type D: A pairing and mating territory. The type of territory defended by males in lekking species.\n*Type E: Roosting territory. \n*Type F: Winter territory which typically includes foraging areas and roost sites. May be equivalent (in terms of location) to the Type A territory, or for a migratory species, may be on the wintering grounds.\n\nReports of territory size can be confused by a lack of distinction between home range and the defended territory. The size and shape of a territory can vary according to its purpose, season, the amount and quality of resources it contains, or the geography. The size is usually a compromise of resource needs, defense costs, predation pressure and reproductive needs.\n\nSome species of [[squirrels]] may claim as much as {{convert|10|ha}} of territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animals.pawnation.com/squirrel-behavior-territory-4745.html|title=Squirrel behaviour and territory|author=Turpin, K.|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>\nFor [[European badger]]s, a home range may be as small as {{convert|30|ha}} in a good rural habitat, but as large as {{convert|300|ha}} in a poor habitat. On average, a territory may be approximately {{convert|50|ha}}, with main setts normally at least {{convert|500|m}} apart. In urban areas, territories can be as small as {{convert|5|ha}}, if they can obtain enough food from bird tables, food waste or artificial feeding in suburban gardens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.badgerland.co.uk/animals/family/territories.html|title=Territories|author=Anon.|publisher=www.badgerland.co.uk|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref> [[Spotted hyena]]s (''Crocuta crocuta'') have highly variable territory sizes, ranging from less than {{convert|4000|ha}} in the Ngorongoro Crater to over {{convert|100000|ha}} in the Kalahari.<ref>Kruuk, H., (1972).

Many animals create \"sign-posts\" to advertise their territory. Sometimes these sign-posts are on the boundary thereby demarcating the territory, or, may be scattered throughout the territory. These communicate to other animals that the territory is occupied and may also communicate additional information such as the sex, reproductive status or [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] status of the territory-holder. Sign-posts may communicate information by [[olfactory]], auditory, or visual means, or a combination of these. If an intruder progresses further into the territory beyond the sign-posts and encounters the territory-holder, both animals may begin [[ritualized aggression]] toward each other. This is a series of stylised postures, vocalisations, displays, etc. which function to solve the territory dispute without actual fighting as this could injure either or both animals. Ritualized aggression often ends by one of the animals fleeing (generally the intruder). If this does not happen, the territory may be defended by actual fighting, although this is generally a last resort.\n\n===Advertising the territory===\n{{anchor|Spraying}}\n\n====Scent marking====\n{{further|White-tailed deer}}\n{{commons category|Scent marking}}\n\nScent marking, also known as territorial marking or [[Spraying (animal behavior)|spraying]] when this involves [[urination]], is a behaviour used by animals to identify their territory.<ref>Gosling, L.

Short-term communication includes the colouration or behaviour of the animal, which can only be communicated when the resident is present.

The male ring-tailed lemur has a specialised adaptation to assist in leaving visual/olfactory territorial marks. On their inner forearm (antebrachial) is a scent gland which is covered by a [[Spur (zoology)|spur]]. In a behaviour called \"spur marking\", they grasp the substrate, usually a small sapling, and drag the spur over it, cutting into the wood and spreading the gland's secretions. When on the ground, ring-tailed lemurs preferentially mark small saplings and when high in the trees, they usually mark small vertical branches.<ref name=\"Cawthon Lang\" />\n\n[[European wildcat]]s (''Felis silvestris'') deposit their faecal marks on plants with high visual conspicuousness that enhances the visual effectiveness of the signal.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pi\u00f1eiro | first1 = A. | last2 = Barja | first2 = I. | year = 2002 | title = The plant physical features selected by wildcats as signal posts: an economic approach to fecal marking | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 99 | issue = 10| pages = 801\u2013809 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-012-0962-9 | pmid=22926138}}</ref>\n\n====Auditory====\nMany animals use vocalisations to advertise their territory.

This is [[ritualized aggression]]. Such defense frequently involves a graded series of behaviours or displays that include threatening gestures (such as vocalizations, spreading of wings or gill covers, lifting and presentation of claws, head bobbing, tail and body beating) and finally, direct attack.\n\n===Defense===\nTerritories may be held by an individual, a [[mated pair|mated]] or unmated pair, or a group. Territoriality is not always a fixed behavioural characteristic of a species. For example, red foxes (''Vulpes vulpes'') either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with [[no fixed abode]].<ref name=\"mac117\">{{Harvnb|Macdonald|1987|p=117}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}<!--Which book or paper is intended here? Ref does not point anywhere--></ref> Territories may vary with time (season), for example, [[European robin]]s defend territories as pairs during the breeding season but as individuals during the winter. Resource availability may cause changes in territoriality, for example, some [[nectarivore]]s defend territories only during the mornings when plants are richest in nectar. In species that do not form pair bonds, male and female territories are often independent, i.e. males defend territories only against other males and females only against other females. In this case, if the species is [[polygyny|polygynous]], one male territory probably contains several female territories, while in some [[polyandry|polyandrous]] species such as the [[northern jacana]], this situation is reversed.\n\n==Strategies==\nAnimals may use several strategies to defend their territories.\n\nThe first [[Game theory#Biology|game theory model]] of fighting is known as the ''[[Chicken (game)|hawk-dove game]]''. This model pits a hawk strategy (always try to injure your opponent and only withdraw from the contest if an injury is received) against a dove strategy (always use a non-injurious display if the rival is another dove and always withdraw if the rival is a hawk).\n\nAnother strategy used in territory defence is the [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]]. In this model of aggression, two contestants compete for a resource by persisting while constantly accumulating costs over the time that the contest lasts. Strategically, the game is an auction in which the prize goes to the player with the highest bid, and each player pays the loser's low bid.\n\nSome animals use a strategy termed the ''[[dear enemy effect]]'' in which two neighbouring territorial animals become less aggressive toward one another once territorial borders are well-established and they are familiar to each other, but aggression toward unfamiliar animals remains unaffected.<ref>Fisher, J., {1954}. Evolution and bird sociality. In: ''Evolution As a Process'' (Huxley, J., Hardy, A. and Ford, E., eds). London, Allen and Unwin. pp. 71-83</ref> The converse of this is the ''[[nasty neighbour effect]]'' in which a territory-holder shows heightened aggression toward neighbouring territory-holders but unaffected aggression to unfamiliar animals or distant territory-holders. These contrasting strategies depend on which intruder (familiar or unfamiliar) poses the greatest threat to the resident territory-holder.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = M\u00fcller | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Manser | first2 = M.B. | year = 2007 | title = 'Nasty neighbours' rather than 'dear enemies' in a social carnivore | url = | journal = Proc.

In selecting a territory, the size and quality play crucial roles in determining an animal's habitat. Territory size generally tends to be no larger than the organism requires to survive, because defending a larger territory incurs greater energy, time and risk of injury costs. For some animals, the territory size is not the most important aspect of territoriality, but rather the quality of the defended territory.\n\nBehavioural ecologists have argued that food distribution determines whether a species is territorial or not, however, this may be too narrow a perspective. Several other type of resource may be defended including partners, potential mates, offspring, nests or lairs, display areas or [[lek (animal behavior)|leks]]. Territoriality emerges where there is a focused resource that provides enough for the individual or group, within a boundary that is small enough to be defended without the expenditure of excessive effort. Territoriality is often most strong towards [[conspecifics]], as shown in the case of [[Ophioblennius atlanticus|redlip blenny]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nursall|first=J.R.|title=Territoriality in Redlip blennies (Ophioblennius atlanticus-Pisces: Blenniidae)|journal=Journal of Zoology|year=1977|volume=182|issue=2|series=2|pages=205\u2013223|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04156.x}}</ref> This is because the conspecifics share exactly the same set of resources.\n\nSeveral types of resource in a territory may be defended.\n[[File:Vanellus vanellus mobbing Circus aeruginosus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A western marsh harrier is mobbed by a northern lapwing. The marsh harrier, a male, had been quartering the ground in which lapwing and redshank were nesting.]]\n\n'''Food:''' Large solitary (or paired) carnivores, such as [[bear]]s and the bigger [[Bird of prey|raptors]] require an extensive protected area to guarantee their food supply. This territoriality only breaks down when there is a glut of food, for example when [[grizzly bear]]s are attracted to migrating [[salmon]].\n\nFood related territoriality is least likely with insectivorous birds, where the food supply is plentiful but unpredictably distributed. [[Swift]]s rarely defend an area larger than the nest. Conversely, other insectivorous birds that occupy more constrained territories, such as the ground-nesting [[blacksmith lapwing]] may be very territorial, especially in the breeding season during which they not only threaten or attack many kinds of intruders, but have stereotyped display behaviour to deter conspecifics sharing neighbouring nesting spots.\n\nThe [[owl limpet]] (''Lottia gigantea'') is a large (up to 8&nbsp;cm in length) limpet. It lives in association with an approximately 1,000&nbsp;cm^2 area of algal film in which its grazing marks can be seen, whereas the remainder of the rock surface is usually free of any visible film. These areas of algal film represent the territories of the Lottia; within them the animals do all their grazing. They keep their territories free of other organisms by shoving off any intruders: other Lottia, grazing limpets of the genus Acmaea, predatory snails, and sessile organisms such as anemones and barnacles.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1933604 | last1 = Stimson | first1 = J. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1969 | title = Territoriality of the owl limpet ''Lottia gigantea'' | jstor = 1933604| journal = [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 113\u2013118 }}</ref>\n\n'''Nests and offspring:''' Many birds, particularly seabirds, nest in dense communities but are nonetheless territorial in defending their nesting site to within the distance they can reach while brooding. This is necessary to prevent attacks on their own chicks or nesting material from neighbours. Commonly the resulting superimposition of the short-range repulsion onto the long-range attraction characteristically leads to the well-known roughly hexagonal spacing of nests. One gets a similar hexagonal spacing resulting from the territorial behaviour of gardening limpets such as species of [[Scutellastra]].<ref>Branch, G.M., Griffiths, C., Beckley, L.E., Branch, M.L.; Two Oceans. Pub. Struik, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-77007-772-0}}</ref> They vigorously defend their gardens of particular species of algae, that extend for perhaps 1\u20132&nbsp;cm around the periphery of their shells.\n\nSome species of penguin defend their nests from intruders trying to steal the pebbles from which the nest is constructed.<ref name=\"Ehrlich\" />\n\n'''Mating opportunities:''' The striped mouse (''[[Rhabdomys]] pumilio'') is group living with one single breeding male and up to 4 communally breeding females per group. Groups typically contain several [[philopatric]] adult sons (and daughters) that are believed not to breed in their natal group and all group members participate in territorial defence. Males defend their territory using a nasty neignbour strategy. Group-living male breeders are nearly five times more aggressive towards their neighbours than towards strangers, leading to the prediction that neighbours are the most important competitors for paternity. Using a molecular parentage analysis it has been shown that 28% of offspring are sired by neighbouring males and only 7% by strangers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schradin | first1 = C. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = C. | last3 = Lindholm | first3 = A.K. | year = 2010 | title = The nasty neighbour in the striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) steals paternity and elicits aggression | url = | journal = Frontiers in Zoology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 19 | doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-7-19 | pmid = 20573184 | pmc = 2908079 }}</ref> In certain species of butterflies, such as the [[Australian painted lady]] butterfly and the [[Speckled wood (butterfly)|speckled wood butterfly]], the male defends territories that receptive females are likely to fly through such as sunny hilltops and sunspots on a forest's floor.<ref name=\"Alcock and Gwynne, 1988\">{{cite journal|last=Alcock|first=John|author2=Gwynne Daryl |title=The mating system of Vanessa kershawi: Males defend landmark territories as mate encounter sites|journal=Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera|year=1988|volume=26|issue=1\u20134|pages=116\u2013124}}</ref><ref name=\"Davies 1978\">{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=N.B.|title=Territorial defense in the speckled wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria): The resident always wins|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=1978|volume=26|pages=138\u2013147|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(78)90013-1|citeseerx=10.1.1.513.4639}}</ref>\n\nTerritory defence in male variegated pupfish (''[[Cyprinodon]] variegatus'') is dependent on the presence of females.

Thus, this dear enemy territoriality relationship is not a fixed pattern but a flexible one likely to evolve with social and ecological circumstances.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Briefer | first1 = E. | last2 = Rybak | first2 = F. | last3 = Aubin | first3 = T. | year = 2008 | title = When to be a dear enemy: flexible acoustic relationships of neighbouring skylarks, Alauda arvensis | url = https://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=acwp_ena| journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 76 | issue = 4| pages = 1319\u20131325 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2008.06.017}}</ref>\n\nSome species of bees also exhibit territoriality to defend mating sites. For example, in ''[[Euglossa imperialis]],'' a non-social bee species, males have been observed to occasionally form aggregations of fragrance-rich territories, considered to be leks. These leks serve only a facultative purpose for this species, in which the more fragrance-rich sites there are, the greater the number of habitable territories. Since these territories are aggregated, females have a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate within the aggregation, giving females the power of mate choice.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kimsey | first1 = Lynn Siri | year = 1980 | title = The behaviour of male orchid bees (Apidae, Hymenoptera, Insecta) and the question of leks | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 996\u20131004 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(80)80088-1}}</ref> Similar behaviour is also observed in the ''[[Eulaema meriana]]'' orchid bee. Males in this species of bee show alternative behaviours of territoriality and transiency. Transient male bees did not defend territories, but instead flew from one territory to the other. They also did not engage in physical contact with the territorial males. On the other hand, territorial males patrolled an area around a tree and used the same territory for up to 49 days. It also appeared that they gave up territories to new males without violence. Males defend territories solely for mating, and no other resources such as fragrances, nests, nest construction materials, nectar, or pollen are found at these territories.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Male Territoriality and Alternative Male Behaviors in the Euglossine Bee, Eulaema meriana (Hymenoptera: Apidae)|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|date = 1991-10-01|pages = 421\u2013437|volume = 64|issue = 4|first = David L.|last = Stern|jstor=25085309}}</ref>\n\n===Single resource territories===\nAlthough most territories contain multiple (potential) resources, some territories are defended for only one purpose. [[Common blackbird|European blackbirds]] may defend feeding territories that are distant from their nest sites, and in some species that form leks, for example in the [[Kob|Uganda kob]] (a [[grazing antelope]]) and the marine iguana, males defend the lek site which is used only for mating.\n\n==Polyterritoriality==\nMany species demonstrate polyterritoriality, referring to the act of claiming or defending more than one territory. In the [[European pied flycatcher]] (''Ficedula hypoleuca''), researchers assert that males exhibit polyterritoriality to deceive females of the species into entering into polygynous relationships. This hypothesis, named the [[Deception in animals|deception]] hypothesis, claims that males have territories at distances sufficiently great that females are unable to discern already-mated males. The observation that males travelled long distances, ranging from 200m to 3.5&nbsp;km, to find a second mate supports this argument.<ref name=\"jstor\">{{cite journal| last= Alatalo | first= Rauno V. |author2=Carlson, Allan |author3=Lundberg, Arne |author4=Ulfstrand, Staffan | year= 1981| title= The Conflict Between Male Polygamy and Female Monogamy: The Case of the Pied Flycatcher ''Ficedula hypoleuca'' | journal= The American Naturalist | volume= 117 |language = | issue = 5 | pages= 738\u2013753 | url = | doi =10.1086/283756 }}</ref> The debate about polyterritoriality in this species may initiate research about the evolution and reasons for polyterritoriality in other unrelated species.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aggression]]\n* [[Alpha (biology)]]\n* [[Biological interaction]]\n* [[Dear enemy recognition]]\n* [[Property]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Walther, F.
