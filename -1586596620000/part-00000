Gifted with excellent vision, passing range, [[Cross (football)|crossing]] accuracy, set-piece delivery, creativity, technical skills, movement, and an ability to read the game, as well as good balance and co-ordination, he is highly regarded by pundits for his ability to orchestrate attacking moves for his team with his distribution, create or exploit spaces with his runs, and provide assists to his teammates, which makes him an excellent [[playmaker]] and creator. He is also known for his eye for goal from midfield, and for his ability to strike the ball with power and accuracy with either foot, despite being naturally right-footed, in particular from distance; moreover, he has also established himself as a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] specialist. A talented and hard-working player, his creative playing style, nationality, and role on the pitch has led pundits to compare him to compatriots Michael and Brian Laudrup, who were two of his major influences in his youth, as well as Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart; Eriksen has also cited [[Francesco Totti]] as an inspiration.{{#tag:ref|See<ref name=makings/><ref name=uefafaith/><ref name=talented/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/tottenham-2018-pochettino/ |title=Il Tottenham \u00e8 una squadra senza compromessi |publisher=www.ultimouomo.com |language=Italian |last1=Barcellona |first1=Fabio |date=12 February 2018 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/eriksen-inter-tottenham-conte/ |title=Eriksen cambierebbe l\u2019Inter |publisher=www.ultimouomo.com |language=Italian |last1=Barcellona |first1=Fabio |date=21 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/eriksen-lultima-frontiera-del-trequartista-moderno/ |title=L\u2019ultima frontiera del trequartista moderno |publisher=www.ultimouomo.com |last1=Barcellona |first1=Fabio |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/tottenham-hotspur/story/2650154/christian-eriksen-the-premier-league-free-kick-specialist |title=Christian Eriksen the Premier League's best free kick taker says Fabianski |publisher=ESPN FC |date=5 October 2015 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/committed-underwhelming-christian-eriksens-display-focus |title=Committed but underwhelming \u2013 Christian Eriksen\u2019s display in focus |publisher=FourFourTwo |date=14 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/soccer/eriksen-completes-transfer-to-inter-from-tottenham/2020/01/28/84d4c1fe-41d6-11ea-99c7-1dfd4241a2fe_story.html |title=Eriksen completes transfer to Inter from Tottenham |work=The Washington Post |date=28 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"Goal1-King\">{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/story/christian-eriksen-king-of-denmark/index.html|title=Christian Eriksen: King of Denmark|publisher=Goal.com|last1=Schmeckel|first1=Maximilian|last2=Konig|first2=Niklas|date=15 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/148801/eriksen-right-man-inter |title=Eriksen the right man for Inter |publisher=Football Italia |last1=Krogh |first1=Karsten |date=16 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fcinter1908.it/ultimora/eriksen-giroud-riflessioni/ |title=Inter, l\u2019arrivo di Eriksen chiude le porte a Giroud?

Gifted with excellent vision, passing range, [[Cross (football)|crossing]] accuracy, set-piece delivery, creativity, technical skills, movement, and an ability to read the game, as well as good balance and co-ordination, he is highly regarded by pundits for his ability to orchestrate attacking moves for his team with his distribution, create or exploit spaces with his runs, and provide assists to his teammates, which makes him an excellent [[playmaker]] and creator. He is also known for his eye for goal from midfield, and for his ability to strike the ball with power and accuracy with either foot, despite being naturally right-footed, in particular from distance; moreover, he has also established himself as a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] specialist. A talented and hard-working player, his creative playing style, nationality, and role on the pitch has led pundits to compare him to compatriots Michael and Brian Laudrup, who were two of his major influences in his youth, as well as Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart; Eriksen has also cited [[Francesco Totti]] as an inspiration.{{#tag:ref|See<ref name=makings/><ref name=uefafaith/><ref name=talented/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/tottenham-2018-pochettino/ |title=Il Tottenham \u00e8 una squadra senza compromessi |publisher=www.ultimouomo.com |language=Italian |last1=Barcellona |first1=Fabio |date=12 February 2018 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/eriksen-inter-tottenham-conte/ |title=Eriksen cambierebbe l\u2019Inter |publisher=www.ultimouomo.com |language=Italian |last1=Barcellona |first1=Fabio |date=21 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/eriksen-lultima-frontiera-del-trequartista-moderno/ |title=L\u2019ultima frontiera del trequartista moderno |publisher=www.ultimouomo.com |last1=Barcellona |first1=Fabio |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/tottenham-hotspur/story/2650154/christian-eriksen-the-premier-league-free-kick-specialist |title=Christian Eriksen the Premier League's best free kick taker says Fabianski |publisher=ESPN FC |date=5 October 2015 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/committed-underwhelming-christian-eriksens-display-focus |title=Committed but underwhelming \u2013 Christian Eriksen\u2019s display in focus |publisher=FourFourTwo |date=14 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/soccer/eriksen-completes-transfer-to-inter-from-tottenham/2020/01/28/84d4c1fe-41d6-11ea-99c7-1dfd4241a2fe_story.html |title=Eriksen completes transfer to Inter from Tottenham |work=The Washington Post |date=28 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"Goal1-King\">{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/story/christian-eriksen-king-of-denmark/index.html|title=Christian Eriksen: King of Denmark|publisher=Goal.com|last1=Schmeckel|first1=Maximilian|last2=Konig|first2=Niklas|date=15 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/148801/eriksen-right-man-inter |title=Eriksen the right man for Inter |publisher=Football Italia |last1=Krogh |first1=Karsten |date=16 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fcinter1908.it/ultimora/eriksen-giroud-riflessioni/ |title=Inter, l\u2019arrivo di Eriksen chiude le porte a Giroud?

Disregarding the judge's instructions, the jury came to the verdict that Muybridge was \"not guilty\" on the grounds of [[justifiable homicide]]. The twelve men felt they should not punish the man who had done something that they themselves would do in similar circumstances.\n\n==Murder and circumstances==\nOn 20 May 1871, 41-year-old Muybridge married 21-year-old divorcee Flora Shallcross Stone (n\u00e9e Downs).<ref name=muychron>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muychron01.htm#part4|title=COMPLEAT EADWEARD MUYBRIDGE - CHRONOLOGY 1830-1875|website=www.stephenherbert.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nMuybridge was often away from home to photograph faraway places.

Muybridge also found a baby picture of Florado with \"Harry\" on the back in his wife's handwriting, suggesting who she believed was the father of the child.<ref name=union20/>\n \nOn 17 October, Muybridge went to [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]] and tracked down Larkyns, who had found a new job at the Yellow Jacket mine. Muybridge called Larkyns to the door and  was heard saying \u201cMy name is Muybridge. This is the reply to the letter you sent my wife\u201d, before killing Larkyns with a [[point-blank]] pistol-shot close to the heart. Other guests disarmed  Muybridge.

Wallace presided. Judge Thomas P. Stoney and district attorney D. Spencer represented the prosecution. The defense was led by W.W. Pendergast (a friend of [[Leland Stanford]]), with Cameron H. King and E.S. Gottschalk as assistant counsels. The defendant had pleaded \"not guilty\". The defense admitted to the murder but pleaded for an acquittal on ground of insanity.<ref name=Alta4/>\n\nA jury of twelve men had been assembled with little difficulty, in a very short time.<ref name=Alta4/> At the time [[Women in United States juries|women were excluded from juries]] in the United States.\n\n===The prosecution===\nHearings of witnesses confirmed almost everything that had been related in the local press.<ref name=Alta4/> Eyewitness James M. McArthur, who had brought Muybridge to the authorities, told how Muybridge had calmly and spontaneously discussed how he had planned everything, had no regrets and believed men of family would understand his choice. Muybridge had arranged his affairs in case he himself would get killed or lynched, but made sure that Larkyns had little chance to defend himself.<ref name=\"union5\">{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=SDU18750205.2.26.2&srpos=70&e=-------en--20--61-byDA-txt-txIN-muybridge-------|title=Sacramento Daily Union 5 February 1875 \u2014 California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=DAC18750205.2.19&srpos=17&e=------187-en--20--1-byDA-txt-txIN-muybridge----1875---1|title=Daily Alta California 5 February 1875 \u2014 California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe defense argued against the insanity plea. It was impossible that Muybridge had gone insane after receiving proof for his dishonor, if he afterwards had quietly conversed with witness Harry Edwards and informed about business options.<ref name=union8/> In his closing adress, Stoney stated that there was not the least conclusive evidence of insanity. The expert witness for the defense had argued that Muybridge had not been insane and the conclusion was incontrovertible. Muybridge was either guilty of murder in the first degree or should be set free. By law, adultery was no justifiable provocation for murder. The law provided penalties for crimes if proven and Larkyns had received no trial from Muybridge. Muybridge had deliberately committed the murder and ignored the law, without any irresistible impulse or insanity as an excuse. \"A jury must decide upon the law and upon the evidence, even if it makes their hearts bleed to do it. If you decide that this man is not guilty, you add another to the catalogue of those who defied the law.\"<ref name=union6/>\n\n===The defense===\nMuybridge's attorneys intended to prove that Larkyns had been a man of bad character and deserved his fate. Larkyns seduced Mrs. Muybridge under false pretenses, claiming to be a married man and luring Flora to his lodgings. He boasted about it to friends. Learning about the depth of the deceit made Muybridge insane from anger, to the point that he passionately decided to kill the destroyer of his happiness, loving his wife deeply, only living for her. Muybridge had been prone to insanity since a stagecoach accident in 1860, his hair had turned grey in three days and he never was the same ever since.<ref name=\"union5\"/>\n\nSusan C. Smith, the maternity nurse who was well acquainted with the Muybridges and with Larkyns, testified that she had known about the relationship between Mrs. Muybridge and Larkyns. She gave several examples that implied that the couple thought that Florado was actually Larkyns' son. She had received letters from Mrs. Muybridge and Larkyns that proved their ongoing affair and had offered them to Muybridge to convince him to pay a debt. Muybridge had found the baby picture with \"Harry\" on the back at her place. The letters and the picture were introduced as evidence.<ref name=union5/>\n\nMuybridge testified about how he had sustained head injuries in a stagecoach accident in July 1860 that killed two others and injured all other passengers. He had been unconscious for nine days and woke up with double vision and loss of taste and smell. The problems persisted fully for three months and in a lesser extent for a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=SDI18750206.2.18&srpos=26&e=------187-en--20--21-byDA-txt-txIN-muybridge----1875---1|title=Stockton Independent 6 February 1875 \u2014 California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> All the witnesses related incidents that illustrated Muybridge's eccentricities. \n\nMrs. Smith told how one day Muybridge came home, looked happily at his wife and child, then suddenly got confused over who had fed the canaries. After being told that he himself had done so, he replied \"Ah dear me, I feel bad here sometimes\" while pointing at his forehead.

It was impossible that Muybridge had gone insane after receiving proof for his dishonor, if he afterwards had quietly conversed with witness Harry Edwards and informed about business options.<ref name=union8/> In his closing adress, Stoney stated that there was not the least conclusive evidence of insanity. The expert witness for the defense had argued that Muybridge had not been insane and the conclusion was incontrovertible. Muybridge was either guilty of murder in the first degree or should be set free. By law, adultery was no justifiable provocation for murder. The law provided penalties for crimes if proven and Larkyns had received no trial from Muybridge. Muybridge had deliberately committed the murder and ignored the law, without any irresistible impulse or insanity as an excuse. \"A jury must decide upon the law and upon the evidence, even if it makes their hearts bleed to do it. If you decide that this man is not guilty, you add another to the catalogue of those who defied the law.\"<ref name=union6/>\n\n===Witnesses for the defense===\nThe defense intended to prove that Larkyns had been a man of bad character and deserved his fate. Larkyns seduced Mrs. Muybridge under false pretenses, claiming to be a married man and luring Flora to his lodgings. He boasted about it to friends. Learning about the depth of the deceit made Muybridge insane from anger, to the point that he passionately decided to kill the destroyer of his happiness, loving his wife deeply, only living for her. Muybridge had been prone to insanity since a stagecoach accident in 1860, his hair had turned grey in three days and he never was the same ever since.<ref name=\"union5\"/>\n\nSusan C. Smith, the maternity nurse who was well acquainted with the Muybridges and with Larkyns, testified that she had known about the relationship between Mrs. Muybridge and Larkyns. She gave several examples that implied that the couple thought that Florado was actually Larkyns' son. She had received letters from Mrs. Muybridge and Larkyns that proved their ongoing affair and had offered them to Muybridge to convince him to pay a debt. Muybridge had found the baby picture with \"Harry\" on the back at her place. The letters and the picture were introduced as evidence.<ref name=union5/>\n\nMuybridge testified about how he had sustained head injuries in a stagecoach accident in July 1860 that killed two others and injured all other passengers.

It is the only building in the world that houses all three of a country's branches of government. The name Christiansborg is thus also frequently used as a [[metonym]] for the Danish political system, and colloquially it is often referred to as ''Rigsborgen'' ('the castle of the realm') or simply ''Borgen'' ('the castle').<ref>[[#larsen|Larsen et al]]</ref>\n\nThe present building, the third with this name, is the last in a series of successive castles and palaces constructed on the same site since the erection of the first [[castle]] in 1167. Since the early fifteenth century, the various buildings have served as the base of the central administration; until 1794 as the principal [[Dwelling|residence]] of the Danish kings and after 1849 as the seat of parliament.\n\nThe palace today bears witness to three eras of Danish architecture, as the result of two serious fires. The first fire occurred in 1794 and the second in 1884. The main part of the current palace, finished in 1928, is in the historicist [[Neo-baroque]] style. The chapel dates back to 1826 and is in a neoclassical style. The showgrounds were built from 1738-46, in a baroque style.\n\nChristiansborg Palace is owned by the Danish Government, and is run by the Palaces and Properties Agency.

The castle was made up by a curtain wall, encircling an enclosed courtyard with several buildings, such as the bishop's palace, a [[chapel]] and several minor buildings.\n\nAt the death of Absalon in 1201, possession of the castle and city of Copenhagen passed to the [[Diocese of Roskilde (Roman-Catholic)|bishops of Roskilde]]. A few decades later, however, a bitter feud erupted between crown and church, and for almost two centuries the ownership of the castle and city was contested between kings and bishops. Furthermore, the castle was frequently under attack, for example by [[Wends|Wend]] pirates and the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities, and during the years 1249 to 1259 it was occupied and plundered.\n\nIn 1370, King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]] was defeated in a conflict with the Hanseatic League, who ordered the castle to be demolished.<ref name=\"TheDanishParliament\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thedanishparliament.dk/en/christiansborg-palace/the-history-of-christiansborg-palace |title=The History of Christiansborg |accessdate=19 September 2018 |work=[[Danish Parliament]]}}</ref> They sent 40 stonemasons to demolish the castle stone by stone.

From then on the castle in Copenhagen was occupied by the king. In the middle of the 15th century, the castle became the principal residence of the Danish kings and the centre of government.\n\nThe castle was rebuilt several times. In the 1720s, [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederick IV]] entirely rebuilt the castle, but it became so heavy that the walls began to give way and to crack. It became therefore evident to [[Christian VI of Denmark|Christian VI]], Frederik IV's successor, immediately after his accession to the throne in 1730, that an entirely new castle had to be built.\n\nThe demolition of the overextended and antiquated Copenhagen Castle was commenced in 1731 to make room for the first Christiansborg.<ref name=\"TheDanishParliament\"/> The ruins of Absalon's castle and Copenhagen Castle were excavated at the start of the 20th century and can be seen today in the subterranean excavations under the present palace.<ref name=\"visitcopenhagen.com\"/>\n\n===First Christiansborg===\n{{Main|Christiansborg Palace (1st)}}\n[[File:Den danske Vitruvius 1 tab022 - Prospect af det Kongl Slott Christiansborg imod Hoved Indgangen.jpg|thumb|The first Christiansborg Palace in 1746]]\nKing Christian VI commissioned architect [[Elias David H\u00e4usser]] to build the first Christiansborg Palace ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''Christiansborg Slot''), and in 1733 work started on a magnificent [[baroque]] palace.

Hansen started building the second Christiansborg in 1803 in a French [[Empire]] style. By the time the palace was finished in 1828, [[Frederick VI of Denmark|King Frederick VI]] had decided he did not want to live there after all, and he only used the palace for entertainment. [[Frederick VII of Denmark|King Frederick VII]] was the only monarch to live in the palace. This was between 1852-1863.\n\nAfter the introduction of the [[constitutional monarchy]] with the [[Constitution]] of 1849, the south wing of the palace became the meeting place of the two houses of the first Danish Parliament (the [[Rigsdagen]]).\n\nThe second Christiansborg burned down in 1884.<ref name=\"TheDanishParliament\"/> Saved were the showgrounds and Hansen's chapel.<ref name=\"TheDanishParliament\"/> The ruins remained in place for the following 23 years due to political fighting.<ref name=\"TheDanishParliament\"/>\n\n===Third Christiansborg===\n[[File:Det tredje Christiansborg opf\u00f8res 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Construction of the third (and current) palace in 1914]]\n[[Thorvald J\u00f8rgensen]] won an architecture competition to decide who would design the third (and current) Christiansborg, which was built from 1907-1928.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/en/palaces/christiansborg-palace |title=Christiansborg Palace |work=[[Kongehuset]] |accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> The palace was to contain premises for the royal family, the legislature and the judiciary, and was built in [[Neo-baroque]] style in reinforced concrete with granite-covered facades. Fragments from C.F. Hansen's palace were preserved in the north facade facing [[Prince George of Denmark|Prince George]]'s Yard (''Prins J\u00f8rgens G\u00e5rd''). The original roof was tiled, but after a national collection, the tiles were replaced with copper in 1937-1938. A weather vane with two crowns was later added to the tower, and at 106 meters became the tallest tower in the city.\n\nDuring the digging work, they came across the ruins of Absalon's Castle and Copenhagen Castle. It was decided to make them publicly accessible, and the ruins under the current palace, and the historical exhibition opened to the public in 1924.\n\n==Christiansborg Palace today==\n[[File:Christiansborg-overview.svg|left|thumb|'''1''': The palace, '''2''': King's Gate, '''3''': The Palace Square, '''4''': Inner Courtyard, '''5''': Entrance to the parliament, '''6''': The Rigsdag Courtyard, '''7''': The Theatre Museum, '''8''': The Royal Stables, '''9''': The Marble Bridge, '''10''': The Show Grounds, '''11''': The Riding School, '''12''': Thorvaldsen's Museum, '''13''': Entrance to the Supreme Court, '''14''': Queen's Gate, Entrance to the Royal Reception Rooms,'''15''' The Palace Chapel, '''16''': Prince George's Courtyard]]\nThe palace is roughly divided in the middle, with [[Folketing|the Parliament]] located in the southern wing and the Royal Reception Rooms, the [[Supreme Court of Denmark|Supreme Court]] and the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister's Office]] in the northern wing.\n\nSeveral parts of the palace are open to the public after published schedule with guided tours available, for a substantial fee. It is centrally located in Copenhagen's [[Indre By]] (\"City Center\") district.\n\n===Royal Reception Rooms===\n[[File:Christiansborg-Dronningeporten-2009.JPG|thumb|''The Queen's Gate'' is the principal entrance to The Royal Reception Rooms]]The Royal Reception Rooms at Christiansborg Palace are located on the ground floor and first floor in the northern half of the palace. The Rooms are used for official functions of the monarch such as [[banquet]]s, [[state dinner]]s, the [[Lev\u00e9e (event)|New Year's lev\u00e9e]], [[diplomatic accreditation]]s, [[audience (meeting)|audience]]s and meetings of the [[Danish council of state|council of state]].\n\nThe Reception Rooms are richly adorned with furniture and works of art rescued from the two earlier palaces, as well as decorations by some of the best Danish artists, such as [[Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard]], [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]], [[Laurits Tuxen]], [[Joakim Skovgaard]] and [[Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard]].\n\nTo reach the Royal Reception Rooms one goes through the ''Queen's Gate'' (Dronningeporten), and through the ''Hall of the Halberdiers'' (Drabantsalen) to the ''King's Stairway'' (Kongetrappen). At the foot of the stairs are the ''Audience Chamber'' (Audiensgemakket) and the ''State Council Room'' (Statsr\u00e5dssalen). The Queen holds an audience every other Monday and attends Council with the government as required&nbsp;\u2013 usually on Wednesdays. The Queen in Council signs new Acts after their adoption in Parliament. The Audience Chamber and the State Council Room are the only Royal Reception Rooms that are closed to the public.\n\nThe King's Stairway gives access to the ''Tower Hall'' (T\u00e5rnsalen). The Tower Hall displays a series of tapestries with motifs from Danish folk songs, woven after cartoons painted by [[Joakim Skovgaard]].\n\n[[File:THRONE ROOM, CHRISTIANSBORG PALACE, COPENHAGEN.jpg|thumb|''The Throne Room'' is where foreign ambassadors present their [[credentials]] to the Queen.]]Facing the [[Christiansborg Slotsplads|Palace Square]] is the oval ''Throne Room'' (Tronsalen) where foreign ambassadors present their [[credentials]] to Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]]. The Throne Room gives access to the balcony where the Danish monarchs are proclaimed. The Throne Room is decorated with a large ceiling painting by Kr\u00e6sten Iversen, depicting how the Danish flag, [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]], fell from the sky in Estonia in 1219.\n\nThe Royal Reception Rooms also include the ''Fredensborg Hall'' (Fredensborgsalen), with [[Laurits Tuxen]]'s painting of King [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] and his whole family together at [[Fredensborg Palace]], and parts of the Queen's Library.\n\nThe Great Hall is the largest and most spectacular of the Royal Reception Rooms. The Hall is 40 metres long with a ceiling height of 10 metres, and a gallery runs all the way around the room. The Hall seats 400 guests and is used for banquets, state dinners and receptions.\n\nThe Great Hall was renovated on the occasion of Queen Margrethe II's 60th birthday when artist [[Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard]]'s 17 tapestries recounting the history of Denmark were hung on the walls. The tapestries were a gift from the Danish business community on the occasion of Queen Margrethe II's 50th birthday.\n\nThe ''Alexander Hall'' (Alexandersalen) is named for [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s marble [[frieze]] \"Alexander the Great Enters Babylon\". The frieze was made for the second Christiansborg Palace, and parts of it survived the fire. It was later restored and mounted in this room. The Hall is used for smaller receptions and official dinners, often in connection with state visits.\n\n===Parliament Wing===\n[[File:Folketingssalen 2018a.jpg|thumb|The [[Folketing]] Chamber]]\n[[File:Vandrehallen 2018b.jpg|thumb|The Lobby (Vandrehallen)]]\n[[File:Landstingssalen 2018b.jpg|thumb|The [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]] Chamber]]\n\nThe first floor of the Parliament Wing is structured around the Lobby. At both ends of Lobby are the chambers of [[Rigsdagen]], the former [[bicameral]] parliament; the [[Folketing]] chamber is located at the far end and the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]] located at the other (the far chamber has been the only one in use since the Folketing became the sole legislative assembly in 1953). Along the hall are various rooms such as the Speaker's office and offices for the administration.\n\n===Ruins under the palace===\nUnder the present palace lie the ruins of Bishop Absalon's Castle and Copenhagen Castle. When the foundations of the present Christiansborg Palace were being cast, workers came across ruins of several buildings and parts of a curtain wall.\n\nExperts were called in from the [[National Museum of Denmark]] and the ruins, which lay beneath the inner palace yard, were unearthed. Public interest in these ruins, which dated back to around the year 1167, was tremendous. It was therefore decided that the ruins should not be covered over again but preserved for posterity. The reinforced concrete structure erected to cover the ruins was the biggest of its kind in Denmark when it was built in 1908.\n\nThe ruins beneath the palace square were excavated in 1917 and a cover was also built over them. The ruins have been open to the public since 1924. The Ruins Exhibition was renovated during the period 1974-77 and has remained more or less untouched since then.\n\n===The Palace Chapel===\n[[File:C.f.hansen, christiansborg palace church.jpg|thumb|left|The Palace Chapel]]\n\nChristiansborg Palace Chapel is a part of the palace which is at the disposal of the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish Monarch]].<ref name=\"Civil-list\"/> It is used for religious ceremonies for members of the [[Danish Royal Family]], most notably [[baptism]]s, [[confirmation]]s and official [[lying in state]]. It is also used by the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]] for the [[Church service]] in connection with the [[opening of parliament]].\n\nThe history of Christiansborg Palace Chapel goes back to the first Christiansborg Palace, which was built by the contractor general Elias David H\u00e4usser from 1733-45. King Christian VI was keen on architecture, and he commissioned a talented young architect in the King's building service, [[Nicolai Eigtved]], to design the palace chapel (1738\u201342). Eigtved seized the opportunity and designed one of the most distinguished Rococo interiors in Denmark.\n\nIn 1794 fire ravaged the palace and it was decided to demolish the ruins completely. The demolition, however, never took place.\n\nArchitect Christian Frederik Hansen, who resurrected the palace between 1803\u20131828, was also commissioned to rebuild the palace chapel in 1810. Work commenced in 1813, using the existing foundations and masonry as far as possible. The church and main palace were built in strict neo-classical style, with a dome construction on top of a central church interior. The palace chapel was inaugurated on [[Pentecost|Whit Sunday]], 14 May 1826, to mark the 1,000 anniversary of the introduction of [[Christianity]] to Denmark.\n\nThe second palace fire in 1884 spared the church, as the fire was stopped in the buildings linking it to the palace. However, fate finally caught up with the church on 7 June 1992. The church burned to the ground, probably set ablaze by fireworks set off during the Whitsun carnival.\n\nDuring the 1992 church fire, the roof, dome and dividing floor were burned down and the inventory severely damaged. Shortly afterwards, the Danish Ministry of Finance's Palaces and Properties Agency began rebuilding the chapel in collaboration with Erik M\u00f8ller's Drawing Studio A/S and Royal Inspector of Listed State Buildings Jens Fredslund. No drawings existed of the dome and roof, but a systematic exercise in building archaeology registered the charred remains of the building, and made it possible to recreate the dome and roof. Historically accurate building methods were also used throughout the rebuilding process.\n\nDanish craftsmen were unable to undertake the difficult work of restoring and recreating the interior's [[scagliola]]. One of Germany's leading experts, Manfred Siller, took charge and taught the venerable technique to Danish stucco workers.\n\nThe rebuilt church was inaugurated on 14 January 1997 to celebrate Queen Margrethe II's Silver Jubilee. The rebuilding was awarded the prestigious [[Europa Nostra]] prize.\n\n===Riding Ground Complex===\n[[File:Christiansborg Riding Grounds and Stables.jpg|thumb|right|Christiansborg Riding Grounds and the Royal Stables]]The Show Grounds are now all that remain of the first Christiansborg Palace. They consist of two symmetrical wings with a straight, low and narrow stable building followed by a high broad building and narrow, curved stables, after which a one-story narrow end building closes off the wings at the Frederiksholm Canal end.\n\nIn 1742, the north wing became the first one to be finished. Building work on the south wing started in June 1740 but ground to a halt by the autumn due to difficulties in obtaining supplies. Work did not recommence until January 1744, now under the supervision of the young architect Nicolai Eigtved. Eigtved's superior artistic insight meant it turned out more beautiful than the north wing. In 1746, 87 hunting horses and 165 carriage horses moved into the new stables, the largest number ever.\n\nIn 1766-67, the architect [[Nicolas-Henri Jardin]] built a court theatre on the floor above the big stables. It now houses the Theatre Museum.\n\nThe [[Royal Stables (Denmark)|Royal Stables]] are home to the horses and carriages used to perform the ceremonial transport for the [[Danish Royal Family]] during state events and festive occasions. In 1789 the number of horses reached a peak with 270 horses stabled. Today, there are about 20 horses left, and some parts of the original stable buildings have been converted into offices and [[garage (house)|garage]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/Historical-Collections/Coaches-and-horses| title=Coaches and horses| publisher=The Danish Monarchy| accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009 the Royal Stables underwent a thorough renovation to meet the requirements of current animal welfare law.\n\n[[File:ChrBrg-Ridehuset-20090104.jpg|thumb|The Riding School with the [[royal box]] on the balcony in the background.]]\nA Riding School is located in the northern wing of the Riding Ground Complex, opposite the Court Theatre. The Riding School is used for horse shows and to exercise the horses of the Royal Stables. On occasion it is also used for various cultural events such as [[opera]] or [[theatre]] performances.\n\nThe interior is more or less unchanged since the construction in the 1740s. It is equipped with a balcony and a royal box to allow audiences the possibility to attend exercises and performances. The royal box is unique as it is the only royal room preserved from the first palace.\n\n====The Court Theatre====\n{{main|Theatre Museum in the Court Theatre}}\n[[File:Hofteatret-03-2007.jpg|thumb|The [[auditorium]] of the Court Theatre]]\nThe Court Theatre is located over the stables in the southern wing of the Riding Ground Complex, opposite the Riding School. Since 1922 the Court Theatre has housed the collection of the [[Theatre Museum in the Court Theatre|Theatre Museum]]. The auditorium is often used for theatre performances, lectures and television programmes.\n\nAlready at the Copenhagen Castle, one of the wings was fitted out as a theatre. However, the first Christiansborg Palace was constructed without a theatre. During the early reign of [[Christian VII of Denmark|King Christian VII]] it became customary to have theatre performances in the Banqueting Hall, and in 1766 it was decided to construct a proper court theatre. A [[Horse harness|harness]] storeroom was adapted to an auditorium. The theatre was designed by the French architect [[Nicolas-Henri Jardin]] and inaugurated by King Christian VII and [[Caroline Matilda of Great Britain|Queen Caroline Matilda]] in January 1767. Little remains of this original theatre as it was reconstructed in 1842 following the designs of architect [[J\u00f8rgen Hansen Koch]]. In time the Court Theatre came to function as an annex to the [[Royal Danish Theatre]]. In 1881 the theatre was closed as performance venue following the tragic fire of the [[Ringtheater]] in [[Vienna]] which underlined the dangers involved in the continued use of old theatres.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.teatermuseet.dk/?sid=13| title=About the museum| publisher=Teatermuseet| accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===The Tower===\n\nIn June 2014, a viewing platform in the Tower, still the tallest in the city, was made accessible to the public, while the interior of the Tower was refurbished and a restaurant opened in place of what was once a storage room.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.dk/da/copenhagen/taarnet-christiansborg-slot-gdk917422| title=T\u00e5rnet, Christiansborg Slot| publisher=Visit Copenhagen| accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref> Access to the viewing platform is free, though passing through a security check is required due to the official nature of the building.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://taarnet.dk/praktisk-info/?lang=en| title=Practical Info, T\u00e5rnet| publisher=T\u00e5rnet| accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref> There is the comfortable elevator.\n\n====The View====\n\nThe View, an [[observation deck]] of the Tower, gives an opportunity to enjoy the views of the following buildings:<ref>{{cite web|title=Photographs of Slotsholmen, November 2016|url=https://independent-travellers.com/denmark/copenhagen/slotsholmen/|website=Independent Travellers|publisher=independent-travellers.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{bulleted list |the southeastern direction: [[B\u00f8rsen]], [[Church_of_Our_Saviour,_Copenhagen|the Church of Our Saviour]], [[Christian's_Church,_Copenhagen|Christian's Church]], [[Black_Diamond_(library)|the Black Diamond]], {{ill|Radisson_Blu_Scandinavia_Hotel_(K\u00f8benhavn)|da}}, [[Koncerthuset]], [[AC_Hotel_Bella_Sky_Copenhagen|the AC Hotel Bella Sky Copenhagen]]; |the southwestern direction: [[Danhostel_Copenhagen_City|the Danhostel Copenhagen City]], [[The_Crystal,_Copenhagen|the Crystal]], [[Ny_Carlsberg_Glyptotek|the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], [[Tivoli Gardens]], [[Copenhagen Central Station]], {{ill|Carlsberg_Hovedkontor|da}}, {{ill|Carlsberg-siloen|da}}, [[Radisson_Blu_Royal_Hotel,_Copenhagen|the Radisson Blu Royal Hotel]], [[Copenhagen City Hall]], [[Palace_Hotel_(Copenhagen)|the Scandic Palace Hotel]]; |the northwestern direction: [[Frederiksberg Town Hall]], [[Church_of_Our_Lady_(Copenhagen)|the Church of Our Lady]], [[the Round Tower]], [[Church_of_the_Holy_Ghost,_Copenhagen|the Church of the Holy Ghost]], [[Kunsthallen_Nikolaj|the Nikolaj contemporary art center]], [[Rigshospitalet]]; |the northeastern direction: [[the Marble Church]], [[Amalienborg]], [[Magasin du Nord]], {{ill|Amagerv\u00e6rket|da}}, [[Holmen Church]], [[Danmarks Nationalbank]].}}\n\n===Other features===\n\n====The Marble Bridge and the pavilions====\n[[File:Marmorbroen-03-2007.jpg|thumb|The Marble Bridge and the pavilions]]\nIn H\u00e4usser's original project from the first Christiansborg, the two wings of the palace were linked by a gatehouse at the Frederiksholm Canal end, and a drawbridge led over the canal. The Palace Building Commission was not completely satisfied with the proposal and asked two young architects working for the royal building authority, Nicolai Eigtved and [[Lauritz de Thurah]], to come up with an alternative suggestion.\n\nTheir proposal included a permanent bridge over Frederiksholm Canal forming the main entrance to the palace and two portal pavilions flanking an open drive and closing the complex off between the two wings. Both bridge and pavilions were in the new [[rococo]] style.\n\nResponsibility was transferred to Eigtved, who was the prime mover behind the project.\n\nThe bridge was extremely elegant\u2014 sandstone covered with medallion decorations by the sculptor [[Louis August le Clerc]]. The pavements were paved with Norwegian marble, hence the name the Marble Bridge (''Marmorbro''), and the roadway paved with cobblestones.\n\nThe pavilions were every bit as magnificent as the bridge. They were covered with sandstone from [[Saxony]], and the sculptor [[Johan Christof Petzoldt]] richly decorated the concave roofs with the royal couple's back-to-back [[monogram]]s and four figures on each roof symbolising the royal couple's positive traits. The interior decoration was by the court's master stonemason [[Jacob Fortling]]. The bridge and pavilions were finished in 1744.\n\nIn 1996, when Copenhagen was [[European Capital of Culture]], the Palaces and Properties Agency finished a restoration of the Showgrounds that had taken many years. The Marble Bridge and Pavilions were restored between 1978 and 1996 by architect [[Erik Hansen (architect)|Erik Hansen]] and the Show Grounds from 1985-1996 by Royal Inspector of Listed State Buildings Gehrdt Bornebusch.\n\n====King Christian IX's equestrian statue====\n\nA collection was started for the construction of a monument to King [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] shortly after his death in 1906. The following year four artists were invited to compete for the commission. There was no discussion about the position of the statue. It would be erected on Christiansborg Riding Ground Complex as a pendant to the statue of King Frederick VII on the Palace Square.\n\nSculptor [[Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen]], the wife of composer [[Carl Nielsen]], won the competition with her proposal for a new equestrian statue. In the proposal, the statue was shown on a high pedestal, on the sides of which were reliefs depicting a procession of the leading men of the day, including industrialist [[Carl Frederik Tietgen]], politician [[Jakob Br\u00f8nnum Scavenius Estrup]] and poets [[Jens Peter Jacobsen]] and [[Holger Drachmann]]. The reliefs were later axed, and the architect [[Andreas Clemmensen]] designed the pedestal that bears the horse today.\n\nThe sculptor sought throughout the country for the right horse to stand as a model, but found it in [[Hanover]] in Germany. This gave rise to a good deal of displeasure among Danish horse breeders.\n\nThe monument took a long time to complete, but in 1927, 21 years after the king's death, it was unveiled on the Riding Ground Complex.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"170\" heights=\"140\">\nFile:Christiansborg Kopenhamn Danmark, Johannes Jansson (3).jpg|alt=An equestrian statue |Equestrian statue of Christian IX.

It is the only building in the world that houses all three of a country's branches of government. The name Christiansborg is thus also frequently used as a [[metonym]] for the Danish political system, and colloquially it is often referred to as ''Rigsborgen'' ('the castle of the realm') or simply ''Borgen'' ('the castle').<ref>[[#larsen|Larsen et al]]</ref>\n\nThe present building, the third with this name, is the last in a series of successive castles and palaces constructed on the same site since the erection of the first [[castle]] in 1167. Since the early fifteenth century, the various buildings have served as the base of the central administration; until 1794 as the principal [[Dwelling|residence]] of the Danish kings and after 1849 as the seat of parliament.\n\nThe palace today bears witness to three eras of Danish architecture, as the result of two serious fires. The first fire occurred in 1794 and the second in 1884. The main part of the current palace, finished in 1928, is in the historicist [[Neo-baroque]] style. The chapel dates back to 1826 and is in a neoclassical style. The showgrounds were built from 1738-46, in a baroque style.\n\nChristiansborg Palace is owned by the Danish Government, and is run by the Palaces and Properties Agency.

The castle was made up by a curtain wall, encircling an enclosed courtyard with several buildings, such as the bishop's palace, a [[chapel]] and several minor buildings.\n\nAt the death of Absalon in 1201, possession of the castle and city of Copenhagen passed to the [[Diocese of Roskilde (Roman-Catholic)|bishops of Roskilde]]. A few decades later, however, a bitter feud erupted between crown and church, and for almost two centuries the ownership of the castle and city was contested between kings and bishops. Furthermore, the castle was frequently under attack, for example by [[Wends|Wend]] pirates and the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities, and during the years 1249 to 1259 it was occupied and plundered.\n\nIn 1370, King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]] was defeated in a conflict with the Hanseatic League, who ordered the castle to be demolished.<ref name=\"TheDanishParliament\">{{cite web |url=https://www.thedanishparliament.dk/en/christiansborg-palace/the-history-of-christiansborg-palace |title=The History of Christiansborg |accessdate=19 September 2018 |work=[[Danish Parliament]]}}</ref> They sent 40 stonemasons to demolish the castle stone by stone.

From then on the castle in Copenhagen was occupied by the king. In the middle of the 15th century, the castle became the principal residence of the Danish kings and the centre of government.\n\nThe castle was rebuilt several times. In the 1720s, [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederick IV]] entirely rebuilt the castle, but it became so heavy that the walls began to give way and to crack. It became therefore evident to [[Christian VI of Denmark|Christian VI]], Frederik IV's successor, immediately after his accession to the throne in 1730, that an entirely new castle had to be built.\n\nThe demolition of the overextended and antiquated Copenhagen Castle was commenced in 1731 to make room for the first Christiansborg.<ref name=\"TheDanishParliament\"/> The ruins of Absalon's castle and Copenhagen Castle were excavated at the start of the 20th century and can be seen today in the subterranean excavations under the present palace.<ref name=\"visitcopenhagen.com\"/>\n\n===First Christiansborg===\n{{Main|Christiansborg Palace (1st)}}\n[[File:Den danske Vitruvius 1 tab022 - Prospect af det Kongl Slott Christiansborg imod Hoved Indgangen.jpg|thumb|The first Christiansborg Palace in 1746]]\nKing Christian VI commissioned architect [[Elias David H\u00e4usser]] to build the first Christiansborg Palace ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''Christiansborg Slot''), and in 1733 work started on a magnificent [[baroque]] palace.

By the time the palace was finished in 1828, [[Frederick VI of Denmark|King Frederick VI]] had decided he did not want to live there after all, and he only used the palace for entertainment. [[Frederick VII of Denmark|King Frederick VII]] was the only monarch to live in the palace. This was between 1852-1863.\n\nAfter the introduction of the [[constitutional monarchy]] with the [[Constitution]] of 1849, the south wing of the palace became the meeting place of the two houses of the first Danish Parliament (the [[Rigsdagen]]).\n\nThe second Christiansborg burned down in 1884.<ref name=\"TheDanishParliament\"/> Saved were the showgrounds and Hansen's chapel.<ref name=\"TheDanishParliament\"/> The ruins remained in place for the following 23 years due to political fighting.<ref name=\"TheDanishParliament\"/>\n\n===Third Christiansborg===\n[[File:Det tredje Christiansborg opf\u00f8res 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Construction of the third (and current) palace in 1914]]\n[[Thorvald J\u00f8rgensen]] won an architecture competition to decide who would design the third (and current) Christiansborg, which was built from 1907-1928.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/en/palaces/christiansborg-palace |title=Christiansborg Palace |work=[[Kongehuset]] |accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> The palace was to contain premises for the royal family, the legislature and the judiciary, and was built in [[Neo-baroque]] style in reinforced concrete with granite-covered facades.

The Throne Room is decorated with a large ceiling painting by Kr\u00e6sten Iversen, depicting how the Danish flag, [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]], fell from the sky in Estonia in 1219.\n\nThe Royal Reception Rooms also include the ''Fredensborg Hall'' (Fredensborgsalen), with [[Laurits Tuxen]]'s painting of King [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] and his whole family together at [[Fredensborg Palace]], and parts of the Queen's Library.\n\nThe Great Hall is the largest and most spectacular of the Royal Reception Rooms. The Hall is 40 metres long with a ceiling height of 10 metres, and a gallery runs all the way around the room. The Hall seats 400 guests and is used for banquets, state dinners and receptions.\n\nThe Great Hall was renovated on the occasion of Queen Margrethe II's 60th birthday when artist [[Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard]]'s 17 tapestries recounting the history of Denmark were hung on the walls. The tapestries were a gift from the Danish business community on the occasion of Queen Margrethe II's 50th birthday.\n\nThe ''Alexander Hall'' (Alexandersalen) is named for [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s marble [[frieze]] \"Alexander the Great Enters Babylon\". The frieze was made for the second Christiansborg Palace, and parts of it survived the fire. It was later restored and mounted in this room. The Hall is used for smaller receptions and official dinners, often in connection with state visits.\n\n===Parliament Wing===\n[[File:Folketingssalen 2018a.jpg|thumb|The [[Folketing]] Chamber]]\n[[File:Vandrehallen 2018b.jpg|thumb|The Lobby (Vandrehallen)]]\n[[File:Landstingssalen 2018b.jpg|thumb|The [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]] Chamber]]\n\nThe first floor of the Parliament Wing is structured around the Lobby. At both ends of Lobby are the chambers of [[Rigsdagen]], the former [[bicameral]] parliament; the [[Folketing]] chamber is located at the far end and the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]] located at the other (the far chamber has been the only one in use since the Folketing became the sole legislative assembly in 1953). Along the hall are various rooms such as the Speaker's office and offices for the administration.\n\n===Ruins under the palace===\nUnder the present palace lie the ruins of Bishop Absalon's Castle and Copenhagen Castle. When the foundations of the present Christiansborg Palace were being cast, workers came across ruins of several buildings and parts of a curtain wall.\n\nExperts were called in from the [[National Museum of Denmark]] and the ruins, which lay beneath the inner palace yard, were unearthed. Public interest in these ruins, which dated back to around the year 1167, was tremendous. It was therefore decided that the ruins should not be covered over again but preserved for posterity. The reinforced concrete structure erected to cover the ruins was the biggest of its kind in Denmark when it was built in 1908.\n\nThe ruins beneath the palace square were excavated in 1917 and a cover was also built over them. The ruins have been open to the public since 1924. The Ruins Exhibition was renovated during the period 1974-77 and has remained more or less untouched since then.\n\n===The Palace Chapel===\n[[File:C.f.hansen, christiansborg palace church.jpg|thumb|left|The Palace Chapel]]\n\nChristiansborg Palace Chapel is a part of the palace which is at the disposal of the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Danish Monarch]].<ref name=\"Civil-list\"/> It is used for religious ceremonies for members of the [[Danish Royal Family]], most notably [[baptism]]s, [[confirmation]]s and official [[lying in state]]. It is also used by the [[Folketing|Danish Parliament]] for the [[Church service]] in connection with the [[opening of parliament]].\n\nThe history of Christiansborg Palace Chapel goes back to the first Christiansborg Palace, which was built by the contractor general Elias David H\u00e4usser from 1733-45. King Christian VI was keen on architecture, and he commissioned a talented young architect in the King's building service, [[Nicolai Eigtved]], to design the palace chapel (1738\u201342). Eigtved seized the opportunity and designed one of the most distinguished Rococo interiors in Denmark.\n\nIn 1794 fire ravaged the palace and it was decided to demolish the ruins completely. The demolition, however, never took place.\n\nArchitect Christian Frederik Hansen, who resurrected the palace between 1803\u20131828, was also commissioned to rebuild the palace chapel in 1810. Work commenced in 1813, using the existing foundations and masonry as far as possible. The church and main palace were built in strict neo-classical style, with a dome construction on top of a central church interior. The palace chapel was inaugurated on [[Pentecost|Whit Sunday]], 14 May 1826, to mark the 1,000 anniversary of the introduction of [[Christianity]] to Denmark.\n\nThe second palace fire in 1884 spared the church, as the fire was stopped in the buildings linking it to the palace. However, fate finally caught up with the church on 7 June 1992. The church burned to the ground, probably set ablaze by fireworks set off during the Whitsun carnival.\n\nDuring the 1992 church fire, the roof, dome and dividing floor were burned down and the inventory severely damaged. Shortly afterwards, the Danish Ministry of Finance's Palaces and Properties Agency began rebuilding the chapel in collaboration with Erik M\u00f8ller's Drawing Studio A/S and Royal Inspector of Listed State Buildings Jens Fredslund. No drawings existed of the dome and roof, but a systematic exercise in building archaeology registered the charred remains of the building, and made it possible to recreate the dome and roof. Historically accurate building methods were also used throughout the rebuilding process.\n\nDanish craftsmen were unable to undertake the difficult work of restoring and recreating the interior's [[scagliola]]. One of Germany's leading experts, Manfred Siller, took charge and taught the venerable technique to Danish stucco workers.\n\nThe rebuilt church was inaugurated on 14 January 1997 to celebrate Queen Margrethe II's Silver Jubilee. The rebuilding was awarded the prestigious [[Europa Nostra]] prize.\n\n===Riding Ground Complex===\n[[File:Christiansborg Riding Grounds and Stables.jpg|thumb|right|Christiansborg Riding Grounds and the Royal Stables]]The Show Grounds are now all that remain of the first Christiansborg Palace. They consist of two symmetrical wings with a straight, low and narrow stable building followed by a high broad building and narrow, curved stables, after which a one-story narrow end building closes off the wings at the Frederiksholm Canal end.\n\nIn 1742, the north wing became the first one to be finished. Building work on the south wing started in June 1740 but ground to a halt by the autumn due to difficulties in obtaining supplies. Work did not recommence until January 1744, now under the supervision of the young architect Nicolai Eigtved. Eigtved's superior artistic insight meant it turned out more beautiful than the north wing. In 1746, 87 hunting horses and 165 carriage horses moved into the new stables, the largest number ever.\n\nIn 1766-67, the architect [[Nicolas-Henri Jardin]] built a court theatre on the floor above the big stables. It now houses the Theatre Museum.\n\nThe [[Royal Stables (Denmark)|Royal Stables]] are home to the horses and carriages used to perform the ceremonial transport for the [[Danish Royal Family]] during state events and festive occasions. In 1789 the number of horses reached a peak with 270 horses stabled. Today, there are about 20 horses left, and some parts of the original stable buildings have been converted into offices and [[garage (house)|garage]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/Historical-Collections/Coaches-and-horses| title=Coaches and horses| publisher=The Danish Monarchy| accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009 the Royal Stables underwent a thorough renovation to meet the requirements of current animal welfare law.\n\n[[File:ChrBrg-Ridehuset-20090104.jpg|thumb|The Riding School with the [[royal box]] on the balcony in the background.]]\nA Riding School is located in the northern wing of the Riding Ground Complex, opposite the Court Theatre. The Riding School is used for horse shows and to exercise the horses of the Royal Stables. On occasion it is also used for various cultural events such as [[opera]] or [[theatre]] performances.\n\nThe interior is more or less unchanged since the construction in the 1740s. It is equipped with a balcony and a royal box to allow audiences the possibility to attend exercises and performances. The royal box is unique as it is the only royal room preserved from the first palace.\n\n====The Court Theatre====\n{{main|Theatre Museum in the Court Theatre}}\n[[File:Hofteatret-03-2007.jpg|thumb|The [[auditorium]] of the Court Theatre]]\nThe Court Theatre is located over the stables in the southern wing of the Riding Ground Complex, opposite the Riding School. Since 1922 the Court Theatre has housed the collection of the [[Theatre Museum in the Court Theatre|Theatre Museum]]. The auditorium is often used for theatre performances, lectures and television programmes.\n\nAlready at the Copenhagen Castle, one of the wings was fitted out as a theatre. However, the first Christiansborg Palace was constructed without a theatre. During the early reign of [[Christian VII of Denmark|King Christian VII]] it became customary to have theatre performances in the Banqueting Hall, and in 1766 it was decided to construct a proper court theatre. A [[Horse harness|harness]] storeroom was adapted to an auditorium. The theatre was designed by the French architect [[Nicolas-Henri Jardin]] and inaugurated by King Christian VII and [[Caroline Matilda of Great Britain|Queen Caroline Matilda]] in January 1767. Little remains of this original theatre as it was reconstructed in 1842 following the designs of architect [[J\u00f8rgen Hansen Koch]]. In time the Court Theatre came to function as an annex to the [[Royal Danish Theatre]]. In 1881 the theatre was closed as performance venue following the tragic fire of the [[Ringtheater]] in [[Vienna]] which underlined the dangers involved in the continued use of old theatres.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.teatermuseet.dk/?sid=13| title=About the museum| publisher=Teatermuseet| accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===The Tower===\n\nIn June 2014, a viewing platform in the Tower, still the tallest in the city, was made accessible to the public, while the interior of the Tower was refurbished and a restaurant opened in place of what was once a storage room.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.dk/da/copenhagen/taarnet-christiansborg-slot-gdk917422| title=T\u00e5rnet, Christiansborg Slot| publisher=Visit Copenhagen| accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref> Access to the viewing platform is free, though passing through a security check is required due to the official nature of the building.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://taarnet.dk/praktisk-info/?lang=en| title=Practical Info, T\u00e5rnet| publisher=T\u00e5rnet| accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref> There is the comfortable elevator.\n\n====The View====\n\nThe View, an [[observation deck]] of the Tower, gives an opportunity to enjoy the views of the following buildings:<ref>{{cite web|title=Photographs of Slotsholmen, November 2016|url=https://independent-travellers.com/denmark/copenhagen/slotsholmen/|website=Independent Travellers|publisher=independent-travellers.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{bulleted list |the southeastern direction: [[B\u00f8rsen]], [[Church_of_Our_Saviour,_Copenhagen|the Church of Our Saviour]], [[Christian's_Church,_Copenhagen|Christian's Church]], [[Black_Diamond_(library)|the Black Diamond]], {{ill|Radisson_Blu_Scandinavia_Hotel_(K\u00f8benhavn)|da}}, [[Koncerthuset]], [[AC_Hotel_Bella_Sky_Copenhagen|the AC Hotel Bella Sky Copenhagen]]; |the southwestern direction: [[Danhostel_Copenhagen_City|the Danhostel Copenhagen City]], [[The_Crystal,_Copenhagen|the Crystal]], [[Ny_Carlsberg_Glyptotek|the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], [[Tivoli Gardens]], [[Copenhagen Central Station]], {{ill|Carlsberg_Hovedkontor|da}}, {{ill|Carlsberg-siloen|da}}, [[Radisson_Blu_Royal_Hotel,_Copenhagen|the Radisson Blu Royal Hotel]], [[Copenhagen City Hall]], [[Palace_Hotel_(Copenhagen)|the Scandic Palace Hotel]]; |the northwestern direction: [[Frederiksberg Town Hall]], [[Church_of_Our_Lady_(Copenhagen)|the Church of Our Lady]], [[the Round Tower]], [[Church_of_the_Holy_Ghost,_Copenhagen|the Church of the Holy Ghost]], [[Kunsthallen_Nikolaj|the Nikolaj contemporary art center]], [[Rigshospitalet]]; |the northeastern direction: [[the Marble Church]], [[Amalienborg]], [[Magasin du Nord]], {{ill|Amagerv\u00e6rket|da}}, [[Holmen Church]], [[Danmarks Nationalbank]].}}\n\n===Other features===\n\n====The Marble Bridge and the pavilions====\n[[File:Marmorbroen-03-2007.jpg|thumb|The Marble Bridge and the pavilions]]\nIn H\u00e4usser's original project from the first Christiansborg, the two wings of the palace were linked by a gatehouse at the Frederiksholm Canal end, and a drawbridge led over the canal. The Palace Building Commission was not completely satisfied with the proposal and asked two young architects working for the royal building authority, Nicolai Eigtved and [[Lauritz de Thurah]], to come up with an alternative suggestion.\n\nTheir proposal included a permanent bridge over Frederiksholm Canal forming the main entrance to the palace and two portal pavilions flanking an open drive and closing the complex off between the two wings. Both bridge and pavilions were in the new [[rococo]] style.\n\nResponsibility was transferred to Eigtved, who was the prime mover behind the project.\n\nThe bridge was extremely elegant\u2014 sandstone covered with medallion decorations by the sculptor [[Louis August le Clerc]]. The pavements were paved with Norwegian marble, hence the name the Marble Bridge (''Marmorbro''), and the roadway paved with cobblestones.\n\nThe pavilions were every bit as magnificent as the bridge. They were covered with sandstone from [[Saxony]], and the sculptor [[Johan Christof Petzoldt]] richly decorated the concave roofs with the royal couple's back-to-back [[monogram]]s and four figures on each roof symbolising the royal couple's positive traits. The interior decoration was by the court's master stonemason [[Jacob Fortling]]. The bridge and pavilions were finished in 1744.\n\nIn 1996, when Copenhagen was [[European Capital of Culture]], the Palaces and Properties Agency finished a restoration of the Showgrounds that had taken many years. The Marble Bridge and Pavilions were restored between 1978 and 1996 by architect [[Erik Hansen (architect)|Erik Hansen]] and the Show Grounds from 1985-1996 by Royal Inspector of Listed State Buildings Gehrdt Bornebusch.\n\n====King Christian IX's equestrian statue====\n\nA collection was started for the construction of a monument to King [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] shortly after his death in 1906. The following year four artists were invited to compete for the commission. There was no discussion about the position of the statue. It would be erected on Christiansborg Riding Ground Complex as a pendant to the statue of King Frederick VII on the Palace Square.\n\nSculptor [[Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen]], the wife of composer [[Carl Nielsen]], won the competition with her proposal for a new equestrian statue. In the proposal, the statue was shown on a high pedestal, on the sides of which were reliefs depicting a procession of the leading men of the day, including industrialist [[Carl Frederik Tietgen]], politician [[Jakob Br\u00f8nnum Scavenius Estrup]] and poets [[Jens Peter Jacobsen]] and [[Holger Drachmann]]. The reliefs were later axed, and the architect [[Andreas Clemmensen]] designed the pedestal that bears the horse today.\n\nThe sculptor sought throughout the country for the right horse to stand as a model, but found it in [[Hanover]] in Germany. This gave rise to a good deal of displeasure among Danish horse breeders.\n\nThe monument took a long time to complete, but in 1927, 21 years after the king's death, it was unveiled on the Riding Ground Complex.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"170\" heights=\"140\">\nFile:Christiansborg Kopenhamn Danmark, Johannes Jansson (3).jpg|alt=An equestrian statue |Equestrian statue of Christian IX.

Allen 1973 ''Report of the Archaeological Survey: Alligator Rivers Environmental Fact-Finding Study''. Darwin: Government Printer.</ref> (of course, Mirarr people had always known about the existence of the site). In 1973 archaeologist [[Johan Kamminga]] carried out a small-scale test pit excavation to a depth of nearly 2.5 m below surface, which provided the first evidence that the site contained a [[Pleistocene]]-aged occupation history. The uppermost 60 cm of the site was rich shell midden, with abundant shells, faunal remains, stone artefacts and human remains. Below this the site was very sandy and contained mostly stone artefacts.\n\nIn 1988 the site was re-visited by archaeologists [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]] and [[Christopher Chippindale]], along with geochronologist Richard 'Bert' Roberts.

As many of the images are faded, and many overlap, this is the minimum number of motifs the site that can be seen today; no doubt in the past there were many hundreds more present that no longer survive.\n\nThe Madjedbebe motifs are mostly paintings (created using wet paint), but there are also some stencils (where a negative image is created by spraying wet paint around the outside of an object held up against the wall), drawings (created by dragging a piece of dry ochre or charcoal across the wall) and beeswax figures (created by applying small, rolled up pieces of beeswax to the wall surface).\n\nA variety of different coloured pigments have been used to create the art at Madjedbebe. These are mostly [[Ochre|ochres]] (red, yellow and orange), but many are also white clay ([[kaolinite]]) and some black charcoal.\n\nRock art is highly significant for the Mirarr people. The same image can convey different meanings to different people, depending on their cultural standing. \n\nThe Madjedbebe motifs include many human-like figures ('anthropomorphs'), geometric designs, hand stencils, fish (including catfish, barramundi, freshwater long-tom, mullet and saratoga), fibre objects,<ref>Miller, E. 2016 ''The Case for Baskets: Rock Paintings of Bags and Baskets in Western Arnhem Land, Australia''.

This suggests that the majority of the art presented today was created in the last 1500 years,<ref name=\":2\" /> though some motifs may be several thousand years old. It is highly likely that the tradition of painting in the site is far older than this, with older paintings having faded away or been painted over. \n\nOf relevance here are the fragments of ochre recovered from the lowest occupation levels during the 2012 and 2015 excavations at Madjedbebe, some of which have ground facets.<ref name=\":0\" /> These are a tantalising suggestion that even at this early time people were engaging in some form of artistic pursuit, whether that was painting motifs on the walls of the shelter, or decorating objects or themselves with the ground ochre.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Navbox prehistoric caves}}\n\n[[Category:History of Australia]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in the Northern Territory]]\n[[Category:Rock shelters in Australia]]\n\n\n{{Archaeology-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=January 2020}} \n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}} \n{{short description|Ancient rock shelter in the Northern Territory of Australia}}\n{{Infobox ancient site\n| name = Madjedbebe\n| native_name =Madjedbebe\n| alternate_name = Malakunanja II\n| image =\n| alt =\n| caption =\n| image_size = 240\n| map_type =Northern Territory#Australia\n| map_alt = Location of Madjedbebe marked on map\n| map_caption =\n| map_size = 240\n| relief = yes\n| coordinates = {{coord|12|30|S|132|53|E|type:landmark_region:AU-NT|display=inline,title}}\n| location = [[Arnhem Land]]\n| region = [[Northern Territory]]\n| type = [[Rock shelter]] site\n| part_of = \n| length =\n| width =\n| area =\n| height =\n| depth =\n| builder =\n| material =\n| built =\n| abandoned =\n| epochs = [[Pleistocene]]\n| cultures = [[Aboriginal Australians]]\n| dependency_of =\n| occupants =\n| event = \n| excavations = 1973, 1989, 2012, 2015\n| archaeologists = [[Chris Clarkson (archaeologist)|Chris Clarkson]] Johan Kamminga, [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]], Mike Smith\n| condition =\n| ownership =\n| management = Mirrar Tradition Aboriginal (Bininj) Owners of lands\n| public_access =No\n| website =\n| notes =\n}}\n\n'''Madjedbebe''' (formerly known as '''Malakunanja II)''' is a sandstone [[rock shelter]] in [[Arnhem Land]], in the [[Northern Territory]] of Australia, said to be the site of the oldest evidence of human habitation in the country.

In 1973 archaeologist [[Johan Kamminga]] carried out a small-scale test pit excavation to a depth of nearly 2.5 m below surface, which provided the first evidence that the site contained a [[Pleistocene]]-aged occupation history. The uppermost 60 cm of the site was rich shell midden, with abundant shells, faunal remains, stone artefacts and human remains. Below this the site was very sandy and contained mostly stone artefacts.\n\nIn 1988 the site was re-visited by archaeologists [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]] and [[Christopher Chippindale]], along with geochronologist Richard 'Bert' Roberts. At this time they augered a single core at the site in order to trial the then new technique of [[thermoluminescence dating]] at the site.

As many of the images are faded, and many overlap, this is the minimum number of motifs the site that can be seen today; no doubt in the past there were many hundreds more present that no longer survive.\n\nThe Madjedbebe motifs are mostly paintings (created using wet paint), but there are also some stencils (where a negative image is created by spraying wet paint around the outside of an object held up against the wall), drawings (created by dragging a piece of dry ochre or charcoal across the wall) and beeswax figures (created by applying small, rolled up pieces of beeswax to the wall surface).\n\nA variety of different coloured pigments have been used to create the art at Madjedbebe. These are mostly [[Ochre|ochres]] (red, yellow and orange), but many are also white clay ([[kaolinite]]) and some black charcoal.\n\nRock art is highly significant for the Mirarr people. The same image can convey different meanings to different people, depending on their cultural standing. \n\nThe Madjedbebe motifs include many human-like figures ('anthropomorphs'), geometric designs, hand stencils, fish (including catfish, barramundi, freshwater long-tom, mullet and saratoga), fibre objects,<ref>Miller, E. 2016 ''The Case for Baskets: Rock Paintings of Bags and Baskets in Western Arnhem Land, Australia''. BA (Hons), The Australian National University, Canberra.</ref> and objects from the 'European-contact period'. The latter include firearms,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=May|first=Sally K.|last2=Wesley|first2=Daryl|last3=Goldhahn|first3=Joakim|last4=Litster|first4=Mirani|last5=Manera|first5=Brad|date=2017-02-13|title=Symbols of Power: The Firearm Paintings of Madjedbebe (Malakunanja II)|journal=International Journal of Historical Archaeology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=690\u2013707|doi=10.1007/s10761-017-0393-6|issn=1092-7697}}</ref> European people (wearing clothing, hats and standing in a characteristic 'hands on hip' manner), pipes, knives and ships.\n\nThere are no [[Absolute dating|absolute ages]] for any of the rock art motifs at Madjedbebe. Instead, the art has been dating used [[Relative dating|relative techniques]]. This suggests that the majority of the art presented today was created in the last 1500 years,<ref name=\":2\" /> though some motifs may be several thousand years old. It is highly likely that the tradition of painting in the site is far older than this, with older paintings having faded away or been painted over. \n\nOf relevance here are the fragments of ochre recovered from the lowest occupation levels during the 2012 and 2015 excavations at Madjedbebe, some of which have ground facets.<ref name=\":0\" /> These are a tantalising suggestion that even at this early time people were engaging in some form of artistic pursuit, whether that was painting motifs on the walls of the shelter, or decorating objects or themselves with the ground ochre.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Navbox prehistoric caves}}\n\n[[Category:History of Australia]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in the Northern Territory]]\n[[Category:Rock shelters in Australia]]\n\n\n{{Archaeology-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Laterthanyouthink", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Copyedit (minor)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madjedbebe"}

However, soon after she was announced as Lex, Mariah Rose Faith was cast in the national tour of ''[[Mean Girls (musical)|Mean Girls]]'', making her the only cast member of the prior musical not to appear in ''Black Friday''. Angela Giarratana was then cast as Faith's replacement. ''Black Friday'' is also notable for the return of Dylan Saunders, a founding member of StarKid, who had not appeared since ''[[Twisted (musical)|Twisted]]'' in 2013.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n{{Plot|date=April 2020}}\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe show opens with the entire cast dressed as Sniggles, the cast of the TV and radio ad for the new Tickle Me Wiggly Doll by Uncle Wiley\u2019s Toys, led by Uncle Wiley (\"Wiggly Jingle\"). A radio announcer advertises the toy available at a store called Toy Zone, and the upcoming Black Friday as the camera pans down onto an animation of the \u201cWelcome to Hatchetfield, est. 1824\u201d sign. The end of the jingle plays out as the lights come up on two people driving in a car, listening to it on the radio.\n\nThe man flicks off the radio and expresses disdain for the musical advertisement, worried about how these ads affect people. It is revealed that they are Paul and Emma, from the previous Starkid musical, The Guy Who Didn\u2019t Like Musicals. Paul hates Black Friday, and he and Emma get into an exchange about toys that have caused shopping mania. They are driving on [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] to Emma's brother-in-law Tom Houston's house. Paul laments the modern trick of using jingles to promote a toy and how he longs for older days. Emma warns him to keep happy for Tom's son Tim. She tells him about the recent car accident in which her sister, Tom's wife, died. They arrive at Tom's house but quickly discover that Tom only invited them to babysit Tim. After Tim angrily leaves the room, Tom tells them that he's actually going to get Tim a Tickle-Me-Wiggly as a surprise for Christmas. After learning that they are running out fast, he leaves right away and vows to get the doll any way he can to make up for their loss the year before (\"What Tim Wants\"). Once he arrives at the mall, he runs into Lex Foster, a delinquent high-schooler and an employee at ToyZone who used to be a student in a class he taught before he was fired due to the violent outbursts he suffered from because of the PTSD he developed being deployed in Afghanistan. As Tom goes inside, Lex's stingy boss Frank Pricely tells her to unpack a box of the Tickle-Me-Wigglies. After he leaves, she sneaks one into her backpack. Lex's boyfriend Ethan Green surprises her with her troubled and paranoid sister Hannah who only speaks a few words at a time in vague mystical warnings who they take care of together.  Ethan tells Lex what a hot ticket item the doll is and how their plans to sell Lex's stolen doll have changed. While the doll originally sells for $49.95, Ethan found a buyer willing to pay $7,000.  They celebrate and plan to move to California.  Lex writes a letter to her alcoholic mother telling her that they are leaving and taking Hannah (\"Califor.M.I.A.\").  Getting ready for her shift, Lex gives her backpack containing the stolen doll to Hannah to calm her down from one of her spells and to hide the doll.\n\nLinda Monroe, a rich trophy-wife and mother of four beautiful blonde boys, enters on the phone with her husband Gerald. She finds the line outside ToyZone and bribes her way to the front of the line. Nurse Becky Barnes attempts to rally the crowd into shaming Linda, but no one is interested. Linda berates Becky for still being the same as she was in high school, and for the abusive relationship she endured while no one bothered to speak up. The argument is interrupted by Tom who bumps into Becky. They instantly recognize each other. The shoppers gossip about Becky and Tom and their relationship in high school before they split up when Tom left to fight in the army (\"What Do You Say?\"). They awkwardly babble and try to catch up to make up for the lost time. Becky admits that she misses Tom, but before they can continue catching up, Frank and Lex open the store (\"Our Doors Are Open\"). However, when middle-aged toy collector Sherman Young attempts to buy all the Tickle-Me-Wigglies, a fight breaks out amongst the shoppers.  Frank, blinded by his greed, allows a bidding war to start, resulting in chaos and mayhem that spread to the rest of the mall as the desire for the doll becomes greater (\"Feast or Famine\").\n\nAt the mall's movie theater, two shoppers, driven mad by their need for a Wiggly, attack Hannah and Ethan before realizing they don't have what they want. Hannah runs off into the mall while Ethan holds the shoppers off but gets beaten up and Becky, holding a Tickle-Me-Wiggly, stumbles upon the two shoppers. They try to attack her but Tom rushes in and fights them off.  They find Ethan and realize he is dying.  Delirious, he promises to get Lex to California before slipping away.  As Becky and Tom prepare to leave, a man in a hurry steals Becky's doll and stabs Tom. Elsewhere in the mall, Linda is found by a mysterious man who knows who she is.  He explains what she's always known but never realized: that she doesn't want to be loved, but rather worshiped.  The man shows her a vision of Wiggly and tells her to do what she does best in order to get one, be a mother.\n\nMeanwhile, in the [[Oval Office]], President Howard Goodman and his Cabinet are debating what to do about the mounting chaos across America.  The Vice President produces the doll and the members in the room begin to fall under Wiggly's trance. They are interrupted by General John McNamara of P.E.I.P., a super-secret agency that handles paranormal, extraterrestrial, and inter-dimensional threats. McNamara informs them that they have to make a quick decision about what to do and the cabinet decides to fight back (\"Monsters and Men\").\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nAs the movie ''Santa Claus is Going to High School'' plays (\"Deck the Halls (of Northville High)\"), Tom wakes up in the theater. Becky tells him that she has stitched up his stab wound and hid him in the theater. She tells him that the shoppers have banded together to find any remaining Tickle-Me-Wigglies in the mall. Tom admits that he feels responsible for Jane's death because he was driving. Becky confesses to stabbing her abusive husband Stanley and leaving him for dead. As they watch the movie and reminisce, they both admit they still have feelings for each other and try to console each other (\"Take Me Back\").\n\nAt P.E.I.P. headquarters, McNamara introduces President Goodman to his second-in-command Xander Lee and reveals to the President the existence of \"the Black and White,\" a place between dimensions and the origin of the entity known as Wiggly. They believe that Wiggly is attempting to push its way into Earth's dimension where it will remake existence according to its own liking. \"In essence,\" says McNamara, \"we're trying to stop the birth of a god.\"  To do so, they will send Goodman through a portal into the Black and White, where the President will attempt to work out a peace treaty with Wiggly. If that fails, they will deploy a nuclear bomb inside the Black and White, hopefully destroying Wiggly once and for all. Sherman leads the mall survivors in a sermon worshiping Wiggly.  Two followers bring out hostages Lex and Frank. Sherman introduces their [[Messiah]], the prophet chosen by Wiggly itself: Linda. She preaches to the believers that Wiggly will only bless them if she gets a doll.  After Frank tells her that there are none left, she kills him. Linda tries to get information out of Lex but she says nothing. A security guard tells Linda that with the security footage, he saw Hannah with the doll. Linda orders her followers to find Hannah and obey her (\"Adore Me\").\n\nHiding in the mall, Hannah sees a vision of Ethan, who tells her to give the doll to Linda. Hannah realizes that something is wrong. Ethan is really a manifestation of Wiggly from the Black and White. Hannah takes out the doll from her backpack and hears Wiggly's voice threatening to kill her. She is snapped back into reality when Tom and Becky find her.  When Tom threatens her for the doll, she runs away, but the adults continue to search for her, intending to [[Local anesthetic|anesthetize her]] and steal the doll (\"Do You Want To Play?\").  They eventually find her, but Becky accidentally injects herself with the anesthesia. Tom finally gets the Tickle-Me-Wiggly and abandons Becky. Two members of the Wiggly cult find Becky and Hannah and take them to Linda.\n\nAs Goodman enters the portal, he encounters the same mysterious man who ran into Linda: Uncle Wiley. More terrifyingly, Goodman also encounters an enormous Wiggly creature.  Wiley and the Sniggles taunt Goodman for the capitalist, consumerist culture that allowed their plan to unfold (\"Made in America\"). All of a sudden, McNamara appears unprotected, saving Goodman and allowing himself to be lost to the Black and White. Goodman returns to P.E.I.P. headquarters and tells Lee to release the bomb even though McNamara is still inside. The bomb, however, does not explode in the Black and White. Goodman and Lee receive news that a bomb has, instead, exploded in [[Moscow]].  Wiggly tells them that he has pushed the bomb through another portal that the Russians had created on their own.  The President is taken to safety and Lee acknowledges that World War III has begun.\n\nBack in the mall, Sherman holds Lex hostage, but lets her go when offered all the [[My Little Pony|ponies]] left in the storeroom. Once free, Lex tells him that she lied and in anger, Sherman strangles Lex. In her dying moments, she laments over the failure of her life (\"Black Friday\"). At the last moment, McNamara appears to her, reminding her that she isn't dead yet and that she, like her sister, has powers. He offers her his gun, but because he is still in the Black and White, she has to reach through dimensions to get to it (\"Monsters and Men (Reprise)\"). She successfully manifests the gun, shoots Sherman, and follows McNamara's instructions to save the world from Wiggly. Finding Tom in possession of the last doll she tells him that Tim doesn't actually want the doll and that it's all part of Wiggly's plan to make people think that a doll can fill a hole in their lives.  Tom ponders the possibility of giving up the doll and eventually does so (\"If I Fail You\").\n\nIn the mall's food court, the followers bring Becky and Hannah to Linda. Believing that Becky is dead, they focus on Hannah, ripping away her backpack in an attempt to find the doll.  When Linda realizes that Hannah doesn't have the doll, she goes to stab the girl but is stopped when Lex rushes in holding the last remaining doll in the mall. Tom sneaks up on Linda and holds a gun to her head, shocking the followers. Linda, however, is able to distract Lex and disarm Tom. She finally gets her hands on a Tickle-Me-Wiggly and the followers praise their god (\"Wiggle\"). Having been forgotten, Becky gets ahold of the gun and kills Linda. Lex sets fire to the doll and the mall burns down, killing the followers inside.  Hannah, Lex, Tom, and Becky reunite with Paul and Emma. Hannah recounts an ambiguous vision of an uncertain future (\"What If Tomorrow Comes?\"). In the last seconds of the day, the surviving shoppers gather together as a [[missile]] rockets toward them.\n\n== Roles ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Character'''\n!Los Angeles (2019)\n|-\n|'''Tom Houston'''\n|Dylan Saunders\n|-\n|'''Lex Foster'''\n|Angela Giarratana\n|-\n|'''Becky Barnes'''\n|Kim Whalen\n|-\n|'''Linda Monroe / Emma'''\n|Lauren Lopez\n|-\n|'''General John MacNamara / Man in a Hurry'''\n|Jeff Blim\n|-\n|'''Hannah Foster / Tim Houston'''\n|Kendall Nicole Yakshe\n|-\n|'''President Howard Goodman'''\n|Curt Mega\n|-\n|'''Frank Pricely'''\n|Corey Dorris\n|-\n|'''Uncle Wiley'''\n|Joey Ritcher\n|-\n|'''Sherman Young / Noel'''\n|Jamie Lyn Beatty\n|-\n|'''Xander Lee'''\n|James Tolbert\n|-\n|'''Ethan Green / [[Santa Claus|Christopher Kringle]]'''\n|Robert Manion\n|-\n|'''Wiggly / Gary Goldstein / Paul'''\n|Jon Matteson\n|}\nNote: All actors besides Dylan Saunders played additional ensemble roles.\n\n=== Characters ===\n\n* '''Tom Houston,''' a war veteran.

The Vice President produces the doll and the members in the room begin to fall under Wiggly's trance. They are interrupted by General John McNamara of P.E.I.P., a super-secret agency that handles paranormal, extraterrestrial, and inter-dimensional threats. McNamara informs them that they have to make a quick decision about what to do and the cabinet decides to fight back (\"Monsters and Men\").\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nAs the movie ''Santa Claus is Going to High School'' plays (\"Deck the Halls (of Northville High)\"), Tom wakes up in the theater. Becky tells him that she has stitched up his stab wound and hid him in the theater. She tells him that the shoppers have banded together to find any remaining Tickle-Me-Wigglies in the mall. Tom admits that he feels responsible for Jane's death because he was driving. Becky confesses to stabbing her abusive husband Stanley and leaving him for dead. As they watch the movie and reminisce, they both admit they still have feelings for each other and try to console each other (\"Take Me Back\").\n\nAt P.E.I.P. headquarters, McNamara introduces President Goodman to his second-in-command Xander Lee and reveals to the President the existence of \"the Black and White,\" a place between dimensions and the origin of the entity known as Wiggly. They believe that Wiggly is attempting to push its way into Earth's dimension where it will remake existence according to its own liking. \"In essence,\" says McNamara, \"we're trying to stop the birth of a god.\"  To do so, they will send Goodman through a portal into the Black and White, where the President will attempt to work out a peace treaty with Wiggly. If that fails, they will deploy a nuclear bomb inside the Black and White, hopefully destroying Wiggly once and for all. Sherman leads the mall survivors in a sermon worshiping Wiggly.  Two followers bring out hostages Lex and Frank. Sherman introduces their [[Messiah]], the prophet chosen by Wiggly itself: Linda. She preaches to the believers that Wiggly will only bless them if she gets a doll.  After Frank tells her that there are none left, she kills him. Linda tries to get information out of Lex but she says nothing. A security guard tells Linda that with the security footage, he saw Hannah with the doll. Linda orders her followers to find Hannah and obey her (\"Adore Me\").\n\nHiding in the mall, Hannah sees a vision of Ethan, who tells her to give the doll to Linda. Hannah realizes that something is wrong. Ethan is really a manifestation of Wiggly from the Black and White. Hannah takes out the doll from her backpack and hears Wiggly's voice threatening to kill her. She is snapped back into reality when Tom and Becky find her.  When Tom threatens her for the doll, she runs away, but the adults continue to search for her, intending to [[Local anesthetic|anesthetize her]] and steal the doll (\"Do You Want To Play?\").  They eventually find her, but Becky accidentally injects herself with the anesthesia. Tom finally gets the Tickle-Me-Wiggly and abandons Becky. Two members of the Wiggly cult find Becky and Hannah and take them to Linda.\n\nAs Goodman enters the portal, he encounters the same mysterious man who ran into Linda: Uncle Wiley. More terrifyingly, Goodman also encounters an enormous Wiggly creature.  Wiley and the Sniggles taunt Goodman for the capitalist, consumerist culture that allowed their plan to unfold (\"Made in America\"). All of a sudden, McNamara appears unprotected, saving Goodman and allowing himself to be lost to the Black and White. Goodman returns to P.E.I.P. headquarters and tells Lee to release the bomb even though McNamara is still inside. The bomb, however, does not explode in the Black and White. Goodman and Lee receive news that a bomb has, instead, exploded in [[Moscow]].  Wiggly tells them that he has pushed the bomb through another portal that the Russians had created on their own.  The President is taken to safety and Lee acknowledges that World War III has begun.\n\nBack in the mall, Sherman holds Lex hostage, but lets her go when offered all the [[My Little Pony|ponies]] left in the storeroom. Once free, Lex tells him that she lied and in anger, Sherman strangles Lex. In her dying moments, she laments over the failure of her life (\"Black Friday\"). At the last moment, McNamara appears to her, reminding her that she isn't dead yet and that she, like her sister, has powers. He offers her his gun, but because he is still in the Black and White, she has to reach through dimensions to get to it (\"Monsters and Men (Reprise)\"). She successfully manifests the gun, shoots Sherman, and follows McNamara's instructions to save the world from Wiggly. Finding Tom in possession of the last doll she tells him that Tim doesn't actually want the doll and that it's all part of Wiggly's plan to make people think that a doll can fill a hole in their lives.  Tom ponders the possibility of giving up the doll and eventually does so (\"If I Fail You\").\n\nIn the mall's food court, the followers bring Becky and Hannah to Linda. Believing that Becky is dead, they focus on Hannah, ripping away her backpack in an attempt to find the doll.  When Linda realizes that Hannah doesn't have the doll, she goes to stab the girl but is stopped when Lex rushes in holding the last remaining doll in the mall. Tom sneaks up on Linda and holds a gun to her head, shocking the followers. Linda, however, is able to distract Lex and disarm Tom. She finally gets her hands on a Tickle-Me-Wiggly and the followers praise their god (\"Wiggle\"). Having been forgotten, Becky gets ahold of the gun and kills Linda. Lex sets fire to the doll and the mall burns down, killing the followers inside.  Hannah, Lex, Tom, and Becky reunite with Paul and Emma. Hannah recounts an ambiguous vision of an uncertain future (\"What If Tomorrow Comes?\"). In the last seconds of the day, the surviving shoppers gather together as a [[missile]] rockets toward them.\n\n== Roles ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Character'''\n!Los Angeles (2019)\n|-\n|'''Tom Houston'''\n|Dylan Saunders\n|-\n|'''Lex Foster'''\n|Angela Giarratana\n|-\n|'''Becky Barnes'''\n|Kim Whalen\n|-\n|'''Linda Monroe / Emma'''\n|Lauren Lopez\n|-\n|'''General John MacNamara / Man in a Hurry'''\n|Jeff Blim\n|-\n|'''Hannah Foster / Tim Houston'''\n|Kendall Nicole Yakshe\n|-\n|'''President Howard Goodman'''\n|Curt Mega\n|-\n|'''Frank Pricely'''\n|Corey Dorris\n|-\n|'''Uncle Wiley'''\n|Joey Ritcher\n|-\n|'''Sherman Young / Noel'''\n|Jamie Lyn Beatty\n|-\n|'''Xander Lee'''\n|James Tolbert\n|-\n|'''Ethan Green / [[Santa Claus|Christopher Kringle]]'''\n|Robert Manion\n|-\n|'''Wiggly / Gary Goldstein / Paul'''\n|Jon Matteson\n|}\nNote: All actors besides Dylan Saunders played additional ensemble roles.\n\n=== Characters ===\n\n* '''Tom Houston,''' a war veteran.

However, rather than playing tennis, Ulrich began playing drums. After publishing an advertisement in ''[[The Recycler]]'', Ulrich met vocalist/guitarist [[James Hetfield]] and formed Metallica. Along with Hetfield, Ulrich has songwriting credits on all but two of the band\u2019s songs. He was the face of the band during the [[Napster]] controversy.

He has since been considerably influential due to both the popularity of his band, as well as his drum techniques, such as the [[double bass drum]] in the song \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\" (''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'') and  \"Dyer's Eve\". Since the release of ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'', Ulrich adopted a less focused and simplified style of drumming, and reduced his kit from a 9-piece to a 7-piece.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2002, Ulrich tried running a record label, the Music Company.

During the 1980s he was known for his fast, aggressive thrash beats. He would often utilize the double bass technique in Latin breakbeats, which became highly popular among heavy metal drummers. The best examples of this are found in songs such as \"[[Metal Militia (song)|Metal Militia]]\" (''[[Kill 'Em All]]''), \"Fight Fire with Fire\" (''[[Ride the Lightning]]''), \"[[Battery (song)|Battery]]\", \"[[Damage, Inc.]]\" (''[[Master of Puppets]]''), \"[[Blackened (song)|Blackened]]\", \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\", \"Dyers Eve\" (''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]''), \"That Was Just Your Life\", \"[[All Nightmare Long]]\" and \"[[My Apocalypse]]\" (''[[Death Magnetic]]''). Even though \"[[Hardwired (song)|Hardwired]]\", \"[[Moth Into Flame]]\", \"[[Spit Out the Bone]]\", and \"[[Lords of Summer]]\" have the same double bass technique, the 2016 release of Metallica's ''[[Hardwired... to Self-Destruct]]'' saw a more aggressive and experimental drumming style from Ulrich. Ulrich uses groove in his drum style, including clean and fast double bass beats in many songs and heavy drum fills. He has been known to drum in sync with the rhythm guitar played by [[James Hetfield]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wall|first1=Mick|title=Enter Night: A Biography Of Metallica|date=2011|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-1409121671}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Relationships===\nUlrich has been married four times.

During the 1980s he was known for his fast, aggressive thrash beats. He would often utilize the double bass technique in Latin breakbeats, which became highly popular among heavy metal drummers. The best examples of this are found in songs such as \"[[Metal Militia (song)|Metal Militia]]\" (''[[Kill 'Em All]]''), \"Fight Fire with Fire\" (''[[Ride the Lightning]]''), \"[[Battery (song)|Battery]]\", \"[[Damage, Inc.]]\" (''[[Master of Puppets]]''), \"[[Blackened (song)|Blackened]]\", \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\", \"Dyers Eve\" (''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]''), \"That Was Just Your Life\", \"[[All Nightmare Long]]\" and \"[[My Apocalypse]]\" (''[[Death Magnetic]]''). Even though \"[[Hardwired (song)|Hardwired]]\", \"[[Moth Into Flame]]\", \"[[Spit Out the Bone]]\", and \"[[Lords of Summer]]\" have the same double bass technique, the 2016 release of Metallica's ''[[Hardwired... to Self-Destruct]]'' saw a more aggressive and experimental drumming style from Ulrich. Ulrich uses groove in his drum style, including clean and fast double bass beats in many songs and heavy drum fills. He has been known to drum in sync with the rhythm guitar played by [[James Hetfield]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wall|first1=Mick|title=Enter Night: A Biography Of Metallica|date=2011|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-1409121671}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Relationships===\nUlrich has been married four times. His first marriage was in 1988 to Debbie Jones, a British woman he met on tour, but they divorced in 1990 due to Ulrich's constant absence during the recording of the 1991 album [[Metallica (album)|''Metallica'']] as well as his alleged [[infidelity]].

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan.

They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods.

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884. The Habr Awal continued a to have a lucrative trading agreement with Arabs and Indian traders, many of whom were also under British rule in their respective nations.

Farming was not very successful, and in 1697 most of the town burned down. This meant that the peasants were unable to pay [[tax]]es, and the land reverted to the crown by Frederik III's son [[Christian V]].\n\nIn 1700\u20131703, [[Frederick IV of Denmark|King Frederik IV]] built a [[palace]] on top of the hill known as [[Valby Bakke]] (''bakke'' = hill). He named the palace ''Frederichs Berg'', and the rebuilt town at the foot of the hill consequently changed its name to Frederiksberg. A number of the local houses were bought by wealthy citizens of Copenhagen who did not farm the land, but rather used the properties as country houses.\n\nThe town changed slowly from a farming community to a merchant town, with craftsmen and merchants. During the summer rooms were offered for rent, and restaurants served food to the people of Copenhagen who had left the cramped city for the open land, and to be near the royals.\n\nInitially the town grew slowly with population growing from 1,000 in 1770, to 1,200 in 1800, and to 3,000 in 1850.\n\nIn 1852, [[Parliament]] removed restrictions which prohibited permanent construction outside Copenhagen's city walls. Almost immediately numerous residential areas were constructed, starting in the eastern part near Copenhagen, and ending in the western part farthest away from Copenhagen in 1950. This led to rapid population growth; in 1900 the population reached 80,000, and in 1950 Frederiksberg peaked with a population of 120,000.\n\nToday Frederiksberg consists almost entirely of 3- to 5-story residential houses, large single-family homes, and large parks; only a few small areas with light [[industry]] remain.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Kopenhagen-frederiksberg.PNG|thumb|Fredericksberg's location inside Copenhagen's municipality area]]\n[[File:People in Frederiksberg Have, Copenhagen, Denmark.JPG|thumb|180px|Frederiksberg Have]]\n[[File:Frederiksberg All\u00e9 - parking lanes.jpg|thumb|180px|Frederiksberg All\u00e9]]\nFrederiksberg, which lies west of central [[Copenhagen]], is completely surrounded by boroughs forming part of the city of Copenhagen \u2013 the result of an expansion of the [[Copenhagen municipality|Copenhagen Municipality's]] boundary in 1901, which nevertheless did not include Frederiksberg in the list of municipalities to be incorporated in the enlarged area. Frederiksberg is thus effectively a municipal island within the country's capital \u2013 a unique phenomenon in present-day Europe. Other than administratively, however, it is largely indistinguishable in character from the districts of Copenhagen city which surround it.<ref name=\"visit\" />\n\nFrederiksberg has several stations on the [[Copenhagen Metro]] system, and is home to the tallest residential structure in Denmark and the second tallest residential building in [[Scandinavia]]: the 102-metre high [[Domus Vista]].\n\n==Culture==\nThe [[Danmark Rundt]] cycling race traditionally finishes on Frederiksberg Alle, often in a sprint finish.\n\n===Education===\nFrederiksberg houses the University of Copenhagen's [[Frederiksberg Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Frederiksberg Campus]], [[Copenhagen Business School]], 9 public schools (run by the municipality), 3 private schools, 1 technical college, and more.\n\nThe ''[[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Prins Henrik]]'', a French international school, is in Frederiksberg.<ref>[http://www.lfph.dk/?page_id=81 \"Plan d\u2019acc\u00e8s\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427124655/http://www.lfph.dk/?page_id=81 |date=2015-04-27 }}/[http://www.lfph.dk/?page_id=81&lang=dk S\u00e5dan finder du skolen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427111614/http://www.lfph.dk/?page_id=81&lang=dk |date=2015-04-27 }}.

Farming was not very successful, and in 1697 most of the town burned down. This meant that the peasants were unable to pay [[tax]]es, and the land reverted to the crown by Frederik III's son [[Christian V]].\n\nIn 1700\u20131703, [[Frederick IV of Denmark|King Frederik IV]] built a [[palace]] on top of the hill known as [[Valby Bakke]] (''bakke'' = hill). He named the palace ''Frederichs Berg'', and the rebuilt town at the foot of the hill consequently changed its name to Frederiksberg. A number of the local houses were bought by wealthy citizens of Copenhagen who did not farm the land, but rather used the properties as country houses.\n\nThe town changed slowly from a farming community to a merchant town, with craftsmen and merchants. During the summer rooms were offered for rent, and restaurants served food to the people of Copenhagen who had left the cramped city for the open land, and to be near the royals.\n\nInitially the town grew slowly with population growing from 1,000 in 1770, to 1,200 in 1800, and to 3,000 in 1850.\n\nIn 1852, [[Parliament]] removed restrictions which prohibited permanent construction outside Copenhagen's city walls. Almost immediately numerous residential areas were constructed, starting in the eastern part near Copenhagen, and ending in the western part farthest away from Copenhagen in 1950. This led to rapid population growth; in 1900 the population reached 80,000, and in 1950 Frederiksberg peaked with a population of 120,000.\n\nToday Frederiksberg consists almost entirely of 3- to 5-story residential houses, large single-family homes, and large parks; only a few small areas with light [[industry]] remain.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Kopenhagen-frederiksberg.PNG|thumb|Fredericksberg's location inside Copenhagen's municipality area]]\n[[File:People in Frederiksberg Have, Copenhagen, Denmark.JPG|thumb|180px|Frederiksberg Have]]\n[[File:Frederiksberg All\u00e9 - parking lanes.jpg|thumb|180px|Frederiksberg All\u00e9]]\nFrederiksberg, which lies west of central [[Copenhagen]], is completely surrounded by boroughs forming part of the city of Copenhagen \u2013 the result of an expansion of the [[Copenhagen municipality|Copenhagen Municipality's]] boundary in 1901, which nevertheless did not include Frederiksberg in the list of municipalities to be incorporated in the enlarged area. Frederiksberg is thus effectively a municipal island within the country's capital \u2013 a unique phenomenon in present-day Europe.

Awarded a [[Kellett Fellowship]], he studied at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], and received an M.Phil. in History and Philosophy of Science in 1981. He earned his Ph.D. in the same subject from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1985, where he was an Andrew Mellon Pre-Doctoral Fellow. Fuller's doctoral dissertation, \"Bounded Rationality in Law and Science\", explored the implications of the views of [[Herbert A. Simon]] for political theory and philosophy of science.\n\nFuller held assistant and associate professorships at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], [[Virginia Tech]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1994, he was appointed to the chair in sociology and social policy at the [[University of Durham]], [[England]]. He moved in 1999 to the [[University of Warwick]], England.

Social [[epistemology]] is a normative discipline that addresses philosophical problems of knowledge using the tools of history and the social sciences. Fuller founded the first journal (1987)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&journalCode=tsep20#.VJ6H3V4gMA | title=Social Epistemology}}</ref> and wrote the first book (1988)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Steve|title=Philosophy, Rhetoric, and the end of knowledge|date=1993|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|page=xii}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-jJmvfREmQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Social+Epistemology%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K4qeVPCNAo3sasbwgrAF&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Social%20Epistemology%22&f=false ]</ref> devoted to this topic. The most obvious feature of Fuller's approach, already present in his 1988 book, is that he rejects out of hand the Cartesian problem of [[scepticism]].\n\nAlong with 21 books, Fuller has written 65 book chapters, 155 academic articles and many minor pieces. He has given many distinguished lectures and plenary addresses, and has presented to academic and non-academic audiences throughout the world, including over 100 media interviews. His works have been translated into fifteen languages. 23 academic symposia have been published on his work. He moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1994, the year he organized a conference in Durham on \"Science's Social Standing\".<ref name=\"CV\"/>\n\nSince moving to the UK, Fuller has increasingly oriented himself towards public intellectual expression, including television, radio and internet, which he interprets as a natural outgrowth of his version of social epistemology. Two of his books have been recognised in this regard. ''[[Kuhn vs. Popper]]'' was Book of the Month for February 2005 in the US mass circulation magazine, ''Popular Science''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mone |first=Gregory |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-02/not-quite-rumble-theoretical-jungle |title=(Not Quite a) Rumble in the Theoretical Jungle &#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date=13 July 1965 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> However, [[Rupert Read]] wrote: \"I did not have to read far into this book in order to conclude that it is worthless. ...

In 2005, in the case of ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', he testified on behalf of a local school system in the United States that required the teaching of intelligent design. The decision of the U.S. District Court held that intelligent design was a form of [[creationism]] and that its inclusion in the curriculum violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on the [[Establishment Clause|establishment of religion]]. The decision repeatedly cited Fuller's testimony to undermine the school system's position. Some of Fuller's critics within the [[Science and Technology Studies]] community described his participation in the trial as \"naive\" and suggested that the field needs further development before it can constructively engage the legal community on the nature of science.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Lynch | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist) | title = From Ruse to Farce | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 819\u2013826  | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067897 | date = December 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Edmond | first1 = Gary | last2 = Mercer | first2 = David | title = Anti-social epistemologies | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 843\u2013853 | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067900 | date = December 2006| url = https://zenodo.org/record/897465 }}</ref>\n\nFuller has said that he does not support intelligent design \"but feels that it should have a 'fair run for its money{{'\"}}.<ref>{{cite news|last=Corbyn|first=Zoe|title=Steve Fuller: Designer trouble |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/jan/31/academicexperts.highereducationprofile|publisher=The Guardian |location=London|date=1 February 2006}}</ref> In his book ''Dissent over Descent'', he says he sees religion in general as a motivating influence in scientific pursuits and believes that the difference between science and religion is more institutional than intellectual.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Dissent Over Descent|year=2007|publisher=Icon|isbn=9781840468045|pages=8\u20139}}</ref><ref>[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=200538&sectioncode=26 Schools for the Enlightenment or epiphany?: Steve Fuller], [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]], 25 December 2005</ref> Critics have called his views on science [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]], though others characterise them as more closely related to [[Social constructionism#Social constructionism and postmodernism|social constructionism]].<ref>[http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf Brief for Amicus Curiae, Scipolicy Journal of Science and Health Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204245/http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf |date=30 September 2007 }}, ''Kitzmiller v.

Social [[epistemology]] is a normative discipline that addresses philosophical problems of knowledge using the tools of history and the social sciences. Fuller founded the first journal (1987)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&journalCode=tsep20#.VJ6H3V4gMA | title=Social Epistemology}}</ref> and wrote the first book (1988)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Steve|title=Philosophy, Rhetoric, and the end of knowledge|date=1993|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|page=xii}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-jJmvfREmQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22Social+Epistemology%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K4qeVPCNAo3sasbwgrAF&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Social%20Epistemology%22&f=false ]</ref> devoted to this topic. The most obvious feature of Fuller's approach, already present in his 1988 book, is that he rejects out of hand the Cartesian problem of [[scepticism]].\n\nAlong with 21 books, Fuller has written 65 book chapters, 155 academic articles and many minor pieces. He has given many distinguished lectures and plenary addresses, and has presented to academic and non-academic audiences throughout the world, including over 100 media interviews. His works have been translated into fifteen languages. 23 academic symposia have been published on his work. He moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1994, the year he organized a conference in Durham on \"Science's Social Standing\".<ref name=\"CV\"/>\n\nSince moving to the UK, Fuller has increasingly oriented himself towards public intellectual expression, including television, radio and internet, which he interprets as a natural outgrowth of his version of social epistemology. Two of his books have been recognised in this regard. ''[[Kuhn vs. Popper]]'' was Book of the Month for February 2005 in the US mass circulation magazine, ''Popular Science''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mone |first=Gregory |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-02/not-quite-rumble-theoretical-jungle |title=(Not Quite a) Rumble in the Theoretical Jungle &#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date=13 July 1965 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> However, [[Rupert Read]] wrote: \"I did not have to read far into this book in order to conclude that it is worthless. ...

The decision of the U.S. District Court held that intelligent design was a form of [[creationism]] and that its inclusion in the curriculum violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on the [[Establishment Clause|establishment of religion]]. The decision repeatedly cited Fuller's testimony to undermine the school system's position. Some of Fuller's critics within the [[Science and Technology Studies]] community described his participation in the trial as \"naive\" and suggested that the field needs further development before it can constructively engage the legal community on the nature of science.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Lynch | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist) | title = From Ruse to Farce | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 819\u2013826  | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067897 | date = December 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Edmond | first1 = Gary | last2 = Mercer | first2 = David | title = Anti-social epistemologies | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 843\u2013853 | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067900 | date = December 2006| url = https://zenodo.org/record/897465 }}</ref>\n\nFuller has said that he does not support intelligent design \"but feels that it should have a 'fair run for its money{{'\"}}.<ref>{{cite news|last=Corbyn|first=Zoe|title=Steve Fuller: Designer trouble |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/jan/31/academicexperts.highereducationprofile|publisher=The Guardian |location=London|date=1 February 2006}}</ref> In his book ''Dissent over Descent'', he says he sees religion in general as a motivating influence in scientific pursuits and believes that the difference between science and religion is more institutional than intellectual.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Dissent Over Descent|year=2007|publisher=Icon|isbn=9781840468045|pages=8\u20139}}</ref><ref>[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=200538&sectioncode=26 Schools for the Enlightenment or epiphany?: Steve Fuller], [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]], 25 December 2005</ref> Critics have called his views on science [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]], though others characterise them as more closely related to [[Social constructionism#Social constructionism and postmodernism|social constructionism]].<ref>[http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf Brief for Amicus Curiae, Scipolicy Journal of Science and Health Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204245/http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf |date=30 September 2007 }}, ''Kitzmiller v.
