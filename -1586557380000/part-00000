However, ''Honey to the B'' found limited success in other territories, such as Australia, where it debuted and peaked at number  31 despite the success of \"[[Honey to the Bee]]\", and in the US, it almost went completely unnoticed, peaking at number  17 on the Heatseekers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/honey-to-the-b-mw0000664131/awards|title=Honey to the Bee - Billie|publisher=AllMusic.com|accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAt the 1998 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' Poll Winners' party, Piper was nominated for Best New Act (for which she came second, it being won by [[B*Witched]]) and won Princess of Pop (she was the first to win this award). She then released \"[[She Wants You#Billie version|She Wants You]]\" as the third single from the album. The song reached number three. \"Honey to the Bee\" was released as the fourth single from the album; like the previous single, it reached number three. <!--note: the album is ''Honey to the B'', but the song is \"Honey to the Bee.\"-->At the same time, \"She Wants You\" was released in the US, reaching number  9 on the \"Hot Club Dance Play\" chart.\n\nIn 1999, Piper was nominated for two [[BRIT Awards]] and won two awards at the 1999 ''[[Smash Hits]]'' Poll Winners' party, although she was reduced to tears at the latter ceremony after being booed by fans of [[Ritchie Neville]], whom she was dating at the time. She then started to tour and release in Asia. The singles and the album were released during mid- to late 1999. In August of that year, the follow-up to \"Because We Want To\" was released in Japan, a single comprising \"Girlfriend\" and \"She Wants You\" combined. She recorded a song for ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie]]'' titled \"[[Billie Piper discography#Other appearances|Makin' My Way (Any Way That I Can)]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pokemon-the-first-movie-mw0000254801|title= Pokemon: The First Movie > Overview|accessdate=8 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n====''Walk of Life''====\n[[File:Billie Piper (16) edited.jpg|thumb|Piper in 2004]]\nDuring that time, Piper recorded her second album. She decided to release further records under her full name of Billie Piper. She returned to the Singles Chart in May 2000 with her third number-one single \"[[Day & Night (song)|Day & Night]]\". She waited until September to release \"[[Something Deep Inside]]\", which reached number four, but her success waned. In October 2000, Piper released her second album, ''[[Walk of Life (album)|Walk of Life]]'', which reached #14 in the UK Album Chart, but quickly fell off the charts and was certified silver in the UK. The album only charted in two other countries: New Zealand, where it reached #17 only, and Australia, where it was a minor success and peaked at #23. In Piper's autobiography, she states that the album was a \"commercial bomb\". The song \"Walk of Life\", the final single off this album, was released in December 2000 and reached #25 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn February 2001, Piper appeared in court to testify against a woman named Juliet Peters. Peters was charged with, and eventually convicted of, stalking as well as making numerous threats against Piper and members of her family.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1321339/Billie-Piper-needs-head-cut-off-said-telephone-threats.html |title=Billie Piper 'needs head cut off', said telephone threats |date=6 February 2001 |last=Demetriou |first=Danielle |accessdate=28 June 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}</ref> Peters received psychiatric treatment as part of her sentence.

Since Jackson won the popular vote in that state and the whole country, such straw votes gradually became more popular, but they remained local, usually citywide phenomena. In 1916, ''[[The Literary Digest]]'' embarked on a national survey (partly as a circulation-raising exercise) and correctly predicted [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s election as president. Mailing out millions of [[postcard]]s and simply counting the returns, ''The Literary Digest'' correctly predicted the victories of [[Warren Harding]] in 1920, [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924, [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1928, and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1932.\n\nThen, in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], its 2.3 million \"voters\" constituted a huge sample, but they were generally more affluent Americans who tended to have [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] sympathies. ''The Literary Digest'' was ignorant of this new bias; the week before election day, it reported that [[Alf Landon]] was far more popular than Roosevelt. At the same time, [[George Gallup]] conducted a far smaller (but more scientifically based) survey, in which he polled a demographically representative sample. [[Gallup (company)|the Gallup organization]] correctly predicted Roosevelt's landslide victory. ''The Literary Digest'' soon went out of business, while polling started to take off.\n\n[[Elmo Roper]] was another American pioneer in [[political forecasting]] using scientific polls.<ref name=\"cantril\">{{cite web |last1=Cantril |first1=Hadley |first2=Mildred |last2=Strunk |year=1951 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/98754561?title=Public%20Opinion%2c%201935-1946 |title=Public Opinion, 1935-1946 |publisher= Princeton University Press |page= vii }}</ref> He predicted the reelection of President Franklin D. Roosevelt three times, in 1936, 1940, and 1944. [[Louis Harris]] had been in the field of public opinion since 1947 when he joined the Elmo Roper firm, then later became partner.\n\nIn September 1938 Jean Stoetzel, after having met Gallup, created IFOP, the Institut Fran\u00e7ais d'Opinion Publique, as the first European survey institute in Paris and started political polls in summer 1939 with the question \"[[Why Die for Danzig?|Why die for Danzig?]]\", looking for popular support or dissent with this question asked by appeasement politician and future collaborationist [[Marcel D\u00e9at]].\n\n[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] launched a subsidiary in the [[United Kingdom]] that, almost alone, correctly predicted [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] victory in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], unlike virtually all other commentators, who expected a victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[Winston Churchill]].\n[[File:USA Gallup abortion opinion poll stacked area.svg|thumb|281x281px|An example of a poll on abortion.]]\nThe Allied occupation powers helped to create survey institutes in all of the Western occupation zones of Germany in 1947 and 1948 to better steer [[denazification]]. By the 1950s, various types of polling had spread to most democracies.\n\nIn long-term perspective, advertising had come under heavy pressure in the early 1930s. The Great Depression forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The [[New Deal]] furthermore aggressively promoted consumerism, and minimized the value of (or need for) advertising. Historian Jackson Lears argues that \"By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics.\" They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own market research, as well as the key to understanding politics. [[George Gallup]], the vice president of Young and Rubicam, and numerous other advertising experts, led the way. Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people for fighting the Nazis and Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the \"American Way of Life\" in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. \"Advertisers,\" Lears concludes, \"played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Jackson Lears|title=Fables Of Abundance: A Cultural History Of Advertising In America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgoXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA235|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|page=235|isbn=9780465090754}}</ref><ref>Jean M.

Also, the following has also led to differentiating results:<ref name=\"cantril\"/> Some polling organizations, such as [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]], [[YouGov]] and [[Zogby International|Zogby]] use [[Internet]] surveys, where a sample is drawn from a large panel of volunteers, and the results are weighted to reflect the demographics of the population of interest. In contrast, popular web polls draw on whoever wishes to participate, rather than a scientific sample of the population, and are therefore not generally considered professional.\n\nRecently, statistical learning methods have been proposed in order to exploit [[social media]] content (such as posts on the micro-blogging platform of [[Twitter]]) for modelling and predicting voting intention polls.<ref name=\"lampos2013\">[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236142275_A_user-centric_model_of_voting_intention_from_Social_Media Vasileios Lampos, Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro and Trevor Cohn.

Their job would be to present the misinterpreted interests of large institutions to public. They would also gauge the typically ignored interests of the public through polls.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Benchmark polls ===\nA ''benchmark poll'' is generally the first poll taken in a campaign. It is often taken before a candidate announces their bid for office but sometimes it happens immediately following that announcement after they have had some opportunity to raise funds. This is generally a short and simple survey of likely voters.\n\nA ''benchmark poll'' serves a number of purposes for a campaign, whether it is a political campaign or some other type of campaign. First, it gives the candidate a picture of where they stand with the electorate before any campaigning takes place. If the poll is done prior to announcing for office the candidate may use the poll to decide whether or not they should even run for office. Secondly, it shows them where their weaknesses and strengths are in two main areas. The first is the electorate. A ''benchmark poll'' shows them what types of voters they are sure to win, those they are sure to lose, and everyone in-between these two extremes. This lets the campaign know which voters are persuadable so they can spend their limited resources in the most effective manner. Second, it can give them an idea of what messages, ideas, or slogans are the strongest with the electorate.<ref name=\"Benchmark Polls\">Kenneth F. Warren (1992). \"in Defense of Public Opinion Polling.\" Westview Press. p. 200-1.</ref>\n\n=== Brushfire polls ===\n''Brushfire polls'' are polls taken during the period between the ''benchmark poll'' and ''tracking polls''. The number of ''brushfire polls'' taken by a campaign is determined by how competitive the race is and how much money the campaign has to spend. These polls usually focus on likely voters and the length of the survey varies on the number of messages being tested.\n\n''Brushfire polls'' are used for a number of purposes. First, it lets the candidate know if they have made any progress on the ballot, how much progress has been made, and in what demographics they have been making or losing ground. Secondly, it is a way for the campaign to test a variety of messages, both positive and negative, on themselves and their opponent(s). This lets the campaign know what messages work best with certain demographics and what messages should be avoided. Campaigns often use these polls to test possible attack messages that their opponent may use and potential responses to those attacks. The campaign can then spend some time preparing an effective response to any likely attacks. Thirdly, this kind of poll can be used by candidates or political parties to convince primary challengers to drop out of a race and support a stronger candidate.\n\n=== Tracking polls ===\nA ''tracking poll'' or ''rolling poll'' is a poll in which responses are obtained in a number of consecutive periods, for instance daily, and then results are calculated using a [[moving average]] of the responses that were gathered over a fixed number of the most recent periods, for example the past five days.<ref name=\"CNNtrackingpoll\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/polls/cnn.usa.gallup/tracking/FAQ.html |title=About the Tracking Polls |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> In this example, the next calculated results will use data for five days counting backwards from the next day, namely the same data as before, but with the data from the next day included, and without the data from the sixth day before that day.\n\n== Potential for inaccuracy ==\nOver time, a number of theories and mechanisms have been offered to explain erroneous polling results. Some of these reflect errors on the part of the pollsters; many of them are statistical in nature. Others blame the respondents for not giving candid answers (''e.g.'', the [[Bradley effect]], the [[Shy Tory Factor]]); these can be more controversial.\n\n=== Margin of error due to sampling ===\nPolls based on samples of populations are subject to [[sampling error]] which reflects the effects of chance and uncertainty in the sampling process. Sampling polls rely on the [[law of large numbers]] to measure the opinions of the whole population based only on a subset, and for this purpose the absolute size of the sample is important, but the percentage of the whole population is not important (unless it happens to be close to the sample size). The possible difference between the sample and whole population is often expressed as a [[margin of error]] - usually defined as the radius of a 95% confidence interval for a particular statistic. One example is the percent of people who prefer product A versus product B. When a single, global margin of error is reported for a survey, it refers to the maximum margin of error for all reported percentages using the full sample from the survey. If the statistic is a percentage, this maximum margin of error can be calculated as the radius of the confidence interval for a reported percentage of 50%. Others suggest that a poll with a random sample of 1,000 people has margin of sampling error of \u00b13% for the estimated percentage of the whole population.\n\nA 3% margin of error means that if the same procedure is used a large number of times, 95% of the time the true population average will be within the sample estimate plus or minus 3%. The margin of error can be reduced by using a larger sample, however if a pollster wishes to reduce the margin of error to 1% they would need a sample of around 10,000 people.<ref>An estimate of the margin of error in percentage terms can be gained by the formula 100 \u00f7 square root of sample size</ref> In practice, pollsters need to balance the cost of a large sample against the reduction in sampling error and a sample size of around 500\u20131,000 is a typical compromise for political polls. (Note that to get complete responses it may be necessary to include thousands of additional participators.)<ref>[http://www.ncpp.org/?q=node/4 20 Questions Journalists Should Ask About Poll Results], National Council on Public Polls Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref><ref>[http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Election-Polling-Resources/Margin-of-Sampling-Error-Credibility-Interval.aspx Margin of Sampling Error and Credibility Interval], American Association for Public Opinion Research, Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref>\n\nAnother way to reduce the margin of error is to rely on [[poll average]]s. This makes the assumption that the procedure is similar enough between many different polls and uses the sample size of each poll to create a polling average.<ref>Lynch, Scott M. ''Introduction to Bayesian Statistics and Estimation for Social Scientists'' (2007).</ref> An example of a polling average can be found here: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926154657/http://www.daytodaypolitics.com/polls/presidential_election_Obama_vs_McCain_2008.htm 2008 Presidential Election polling average]. Another source of error stems from faulty demographic models by pollsters who weigh their samples by particular variables such as party identification in an election. For example, if you assume that the breakdown of the US population by party identification has not changed since the previous presidential election, you may underestimate a victory or a defeat of a particular party candidate that saw a surge or decline in its party registration relative to the previous presidential election cycle.\n\nA caution is that an estimate of a trend is subject to a larger error than an estimate of a level. This is because if one estimates the change, the difference between two numbers ''X'' and ''Y,'' then one has to contend with errors in both ''X'' and ''Y''. A rough guide is that if the change in measurement falls outside the margin of error it is worth attention.\n\n=== Nonresponse bias ===\nSince some people do not answer calls from strangers, or refuse to the answer the poll, poll samples may not be representative samples from a population due to a [[non-response bias]]. Response rates have been declining, and are down to about 10% in recent years.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/survey_bias_how_can_we_trust_opinion_polls_when_so_few_people_respond_.single.html| title=Minority Opinions:Hardly anyone responds to public opinion surveys anymore. Can we still trust them?|author=Will Oremus| date=2012-05-17| accessdate=2013-11-21| magazine=Slate}}</ref> Because of this [[selection bias]], the characteristics of those who agree to be interviewed may be markedly different from those who decline. That is, the actual sample is a biased version of the universe the pollster wants to analyze. In these cases, bias introduces new errors, one way or the other, that are in addition to errors caused by sample size. Error due to bias does not become smaller with larger sample sizes, because taking a larger sample size simply repeats the same mistake on a larger scale. If the people who refuse to answer, or are never reached, have the same characteristics as the people who do answer, then the final results should be unbiased. If the people who do not answer have different opinions then there is bias in the results. In terms of election polls, studies suggest that bias effects are small, but each polling firm has its own techniques for adjusting weights to minimize selection bias.<ref name=\"Langer2003\">{{cite web|publisher=ABC News|author=Langer, Gary|title=About Response Rates: Some Unresolved Questions|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/responserates.pdf|date=May 2003|accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/For-Researchers/Poll-Survey-FAQ/Response-Rates-An-Overview.aspx Response Rates: An Overview] American Association for Public Opinion Research, Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref>\n\n=== Response bias ===\nSurvey results may be affected by [[response bias]], where the answers given by respondents do not reflect their true beliefs. This may be deliberately engineered by unscrupulous pollsters in order to generate a certain result or please their clients, but more often is a result of the detailed wording or ordering of questions (see below). Respondents may deliberately try to manipulate the outcome of a poll by e.g. advocating a more extreme position than they actually hold in order to boost their side of the argument or give rapid and ill-considered answers in order to hasten the end of their questioning. Respondents may also feel under social pressure not to give an unpopular answer. For example, respondents might be unwilling to admit to unpopular attitudes like [[racism]] or [[sexism]], and thus polls might not reflect the true incidence of these attitudes in the population. In American political parlance, this phenomenon is often referred to as the [[Bradley effect]]. If the results of surveys are widely publicized this effect may be magnified - a phenomenon commonly referred to as the [[spiral of silence]].\n\nUse of the [[plurality voting system]] (select only one candidate) in a poll puts an unintentional bias into the poll, since people who favor more than one candidate cannot indicate this. The fact that they must choose only one candidate biases the poll, causing it to favor the candidate most different from the others while it disfavors candidates who are similar to other candidates. The [[plurality voting system]] also biases elections in the same way.\n\nSome people responding may not understand the words being used, but may wish to avoid the embarrassment of admitting this, or the poll mechanism may not allow clarification, so they may make an arbitrary choice. Some percentage of people also answer whimsically or out of annoyance at being polled. This results in perhaps 4% of Americans reporting they have personally been decapitated<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=487654380 Planet Money Episode 714: Can A Game Show Lose?]</ref> or that \"lizardmen are running the Earth\".<ref>[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/ Noisy Poll Results and Reptilian Muslim Climatologists from Mars]</ref>\n\n=== Wording of questions ===\nIt is well established that the wording of the questions, the order in which they are asked and the number and form of alternative answers offered can influence results of polls. For instance, the public is more likely to indicate support for a person who is described by the operator as one of the \"leading candidates\". This support itself overrides subtle bias for one candidate, as does lumping some candidates in an \"other\" category or vice versa. Thus comparisons between polls often boil down to the wording of the question. On some issues, question wording can result in quite pronounced differences between surveys.<ref>[http://www.people-press.org/2013/07/26/government-surveillance-a-question-wording-experiment/ Government Surveillance: A Question Wording Experiment], Pew Research Center Published 2013-07-26 Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref><ref>[http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/whats-in-a-name-global-warming-vs-climate-change/ What\u2019s In A Name? Global Warming vs Climate Change], Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, Published 2014-05-27, Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref> This can also, however, be a result of legitimately conflicted feelings or evolving attitudes, rather than a poorly constructed survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicagenda.org/pages/seven-stages-public-opinion |title=The Seven Stages of Public Opinion Public Agenda |publisher=Publicagenda.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref>\n\nA common technique to control for this bias is to rotate the order in which questions are asked. Many pollsters also split-sample. This involves having two different versions of a question, with each version presented to half the respondents.\n\nThe most effective controls, used by [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] researchers, are:\n\n* asking enough questions to allow all aspects of an issue to be covered and to control effects due to the form of the question (such as positive or negative wording), the adequacy of the number being established quantitatively with [[psychometrics|psychometric]] measures such as reliability coefficients, and\n* analyzing the results with psychometric techniques which synthesize the answers into a few reliable scores and detect ineffective questions.\n\nThese controls are not widely used in the polling industry.{{Why?|date=July 2010}}. However, as it is important that questions to test the product have a high quality, survey methodologists work on methods to test them. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire, some may be more complex than others. For instance, testing a questionnaire can be done by:\n* conducting [[cognitive pretesting|cognitive interviewing]]. By asking a sample of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can \n* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.\n* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest,<ref>Lord, F. and Novick, M. R.(1968). Statistical theories of mental test scores. Addison \u2013 Wesley.</ref> quasi-simplex,<ref>Heise, D. R.(1969). Separating reliability and stability in test-retest correlation. American Sociological Review, 34, 93-101.</ref> or mutlitrait-multimethod models.<ref>Andrews, F. M. (1984). Construct validity and error components of survey measures: a structural modelling approach. Public Opinion Quarterly, 48, 409-442.</ref>\n* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).<ref>Saris, W. E. and Gallhofer, I. N. (2014). Design, evaluation and analysis of questionnaires for survey research. Second Edition. Hoboken, Wiley.</ref>\n\n=== Involuntary facades and false correlations ===\nOne of the criticisms of opinion polls is that societal assumptions that opinions between which there is no logical link are \"correlated attitudes\" can push people with one opinion into a group that forces them to pretend to have a supposedly linked but actually unrelated opinion. That, in turn, may cause people who have the first opinion to claim on polls that they have the second opinion without having it, causing opinion polls to become part of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] problems. It have been suggested that attempts to counteract unethical opinions by condemning supposedly linked opinions may favor the groups that promote the actually unethical opinions by forcing people with supposedly linked opinions into them by ostracism elsewhere in society making such efforts counterproductive, that not being sent between groups that assume ulterior motives from each other and not being allowed to express consistent critical thought anywhere may create psychological stress because humans are sapient, and that discussion spaces free from assumptions of ulterior motives behind specific opinions should be created. In this context, rejection of the assumption that opinion polls show actual links between opinions is considered important.<ref>\"Political Polling in the Digital Age: The Challenge of Measuring and Understanding Public Opinion\" by Robert K. Goidel, yr twenty-eleven</ref><ref>\"Understanding Public Opinion Polls\" by Jelke Bethlehem, yr twenty-seventeen</ref>\n\n=== Coverage bias ===\nAnother source of error is the use of samples that are not representative of the population as a consequence of the methodology used, as was the experience of ''The Literary Digest'' in 1936. For example, telephone sampling has a built-in error because in many times and places, those with telephones have generally been richer than those without.\n\nIn some places many people have only [[mobile telephone]]s. Because pollsters cannot use automated dialing machines to call mobile phones in the United States (because the phone's owner may be charged for taking a call<ref>http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/TCPA-Rules.pdf</ref>), these individuals are typically excluded from polling samples. There is concern that, if the subset of the population without cell phones differs markedly from the rest of the population, these differences can skew the results of the poll.<ref>[http://www.pewresearch.org/2010/11/22/the-growing-gap-between-landline-and-dual-frame-election-polls/ The Growing Gap between Landline and Dual Frame Election Polls: Republican Vote Share Bigger in Landline-Only Surveys] Pew Research Center, 2010-11-22; Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref>\n\nPolling organizations have developed many weighting techniques to help overcome these deficiencies, with varying degrees of success. Studies of mobile phone users by the Pew Research Center in the US, in 2007, concluded that \"cell-only respondents are different from landline respondents in important ways, (but) they were neither numerous enough nor different enough on the questions we examined to produce a significant change in overall general population survey estimates when included with the landline samples and weighted according to US Census parameters on basic demographic characteristics.\"<ref name=\"Keeter2007\">{{cite web|author=Keeter, Scott|publisher=Pew Research Center Publications|title=How Serious Is Polling's Cell-Only Problem?|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/515/polling-cell-only-problem|date=2007-06-27|access-date=2008-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030215501/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/515/polling-cell-only-problem|archive-date=2008-10-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> <!---since Pew is in the business of polling, their quote is pretty much self-serving.

There are a number of problems with including cellphones in a telephone poll:\n# It is difficult to get co-operation from cellphone users, because in many parts of the US, users are charged for both outgoing and incoming calls. That means that pollsters have had to offer financial compensation to gain co-operation.\n# US federal law prohibits the use of automated dialling devices to call cellphones ([[Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991]]). Numbers therefore have to be dialled by hand, which is more time-consuming and expensive for pollsters.\n\n=== 1992 UK general election ===\nAn oft-quoted example of opinion polls succumbing to errors occurred during the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 UK general election]]. Despite the polling organizations using different methodologies, virtually all the polls taken before the vote, and to a lesser extent, [[exit poll]]s taken on voting day, showed a lead for the opposition Labour party, but the actual vote gave a clear victory to the ruling Conservative party.\n\nIn their deliberations after this embarrassment the pollsters advanced several ideas to account for their errors, including:\n\n; Late [[swing (politics)|swing]] : Voters who changed their minds shortly before voting tended to favour the Conservatives, so the error was not as great as it first appeared.\n; Nonresponse bias : Conservative voters were less likely to participate in surveys than in the past and were thus under-represented.\n; The [[Shy Tory Factor]] : The Conservatives had suffered a sustained period of unpopularity as a result of economic difficulties and a series of minor scandals, leading to a [[spiral of silence]] in which some Conservative supporters were reluctant to disclose their sincere intentions to pollsters.\n\nThe relative importance of these factors was, and remains, a matter of controversy, but since then the polling organizations have adjusted their methodologies and have achieved more accurate results in subsequent election campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nA comprehensive discussion of these biases and how they should be understood and mitigated is included in several sources including Dillman and Salant (1994).<ref>Salant, Priscilla, I. Dillman, and A. Don. How to conduct your own survey. No. 300.723 S3.. 1994.</ref>\n\n== Failures ==\nA widely publicized failure of opinion polling to date in the [[United States]] was the prediction that [[Thomas Dewey]] would defeat [[Harry S. Truman]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 US presidential election]]. Major polling organizations, including Gallup and Roper, indicated a landslide victory for Dewey.\n\nIt was widely predicted that [[Donald Trump]] would lose the [[U.S. presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]] to Former US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]; however, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/final-election-update-theres-a-wide-range-of-outcomes-and-most-of-them-come-up-clinton/ | title=Final Election Update: There's a Wide Range of Outcomes, and Most of Them Come up Clinton| date=2016-11-08}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most polls failed to predict the Conservative election victories of [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] and [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]], and Labour's victory in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]]. In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 election]] virtually every poll predicted a hung parliament with Labour and the Conservatives neck and neck when the actual result was a clear Conservative majority. On the other hand, in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]], the opposite appears to have occurred. Most polls predicted an increased Conservative majority, even though in reality the election resulted in a hung parliament with a Conservative plurality. However, some polls correctly predicted this outcome.\n\n== Social media as a source of opinion on candidates ==\nSocial media today is a popular medium for the candidates to campaign and for gauging the public reaction to the campaigns. Social media can also be used as an indicator of the voter opinion regarding the poll. Some research studies have shown that predictions made using social media signals can match traditional opinion polls.<ref name=\"lampos2013\"/><ref name=\"oconnor2010\"/>\n\nRegarding the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a major concern has been that of the effect of false stories spread throughout social media. Evidence shows that social media plays a huge role in the supplying of news: 62 percent of US adults get news on social media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/|title=News Use Across Social Media Platforms 2016|date=2016-05-26|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}</ref> This fact makes the issue of fake news on social media more pertinent. Other evidence shows that the most popular fake news stories were more widely shared on Facebook than the most popular mainstream news stories; many people who see fake news stories report that they believe them; and the most discussed fake news stories tended to favor Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. As a result of these facts, some have concluded that if not for these stories, Donald Trump may not have won the election over Hillary Clinton.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allcott|first=Hunt|last2=Gentzkow|first2=Matthew|date=Spring 2017|title=Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/fakenews.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=31|issue=2|pages=211\u2013236|via=Stanford|doi=10.1257/jep.31.2.211}}</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n=== Effect on voters ===\nBy providing information about voting intentions, opinion polls can sometimes influence the behavior of electors, and in his book ''[[The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way|The Broken Compass]]'', [[Peter Hitchens]] asserts that opinion polls are actually a device for influencing public opinion.<ref name=\"Hitchens2009\">{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Peter|title=The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way |chapter=Chapter 1, Guy Fawkes Gets a Blackberry|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84706-405-9}}</ref> The various theories about how this happens can be split into two groups: bandwagon/underdog effects, and strategic (\"tactical\") voting.\n\nA [[bandwagon effect]] occurs when the poll prompts voters to back the candidate shown to be winning in the poll. The idea that voters are susceptible to such effects is old, stemming at least from 1884; [[William Safire]] reported that the term was first used in a political cartoon in the magazine ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' in that year.<ref>Safire, William, ''Safire's Political Dictionary'', page 42. Random House, 1993.</ref> It has also remained persistent in spite of a lack of empirical corroboration until the late 20th century. [[George Gallup]] spent much effort in vain trying to discredit this theory in his time by presenting empirical research. A recent meta-study of scientific research on this topic indicates that from the 1980s onward the Bandwagon effect is found more often by researchers.<ref name=\"irwin\">Irwin, Galen A. and Joop J. M. Van Holsteyn. ''Bandwagons, Underdogs, the Titanic and the Red Cross: The Influence of Public Opinion Polls on Voters'' (2000).</ref>\n\nThe opposite of the bandwagon effect is the [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] effect. It is often mentioned in the media. This occurs when people vote, out of sympathy, for the party perceived to be \"losing\" the elections. There is less empirical evidence for the existence of this effect than there is for the existence of the bandwagon effect.<ref name=\"irwin\"/>\n\nThe second category of theories on how polls directly affect voting is called strategic or [[tactical voting]]. This theory is based on the idea that voters view the act of voting as a means of selecting a government. Thus they will sometimes not choose the candidate they prefer on ground of ideology or sympathy, but another, less-preferred, candidate from strategic considerations. An example can be found in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election]]. As he was then a Cabinet Minister, [[Michael Portillo]]'s constituency of [[Enfield Southgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Enfield Southgate]] was believed to be a [[safe seat]] but opinion polls showed the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate [[Stephen Twigg]] steadily gaining support, which may have prompted undecided voters or supporters of other parties to support Twigg in order to remove Portillo. Another example is the boomerang effect where the likely supporters of the candidate shown to be winning feel that chances are slim and that their vote is not required, thus allowing another candidate to win.\n\nIn addition, Mark Pickup in Cameron Anderson and Laura Stephenson's \"Voting Behaviour in Canada\" outlines three additional \"behavioural\" responses that voters may exhibit when faced with polling data.\n\nThe first is known as a \"cue taking\" effect which holds that poll data is used as a \"proxy\" for information about the candidates or parties. Cue taking is \"based on the psychological phenomenon of using heuristics to simplify a complex decision\" (243).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Cameron |title=Voting Behaviour in Canada|url=https://archive.org/details/votingbehaviouri00came |url-access=registration |year=2010|publisher=UBC Press|location=Vancouver|pages=[https://archive.org/details/votingbehaviouri00came/page/243 243\u2013278] |author2=Pickup, Mark |authorlink=Election Campaign Polls and Democracy in Canada: Examining the Evidence Behind Common Claims|chapter=10}}</ref>\n\nThe second, first described by Petty and Cacioppo (1996) is known as \"cognitive response\" theory. This theory asserts that a voter's response to a poll may not line with their initial conception of the electoral reality. In response, the voter is likely to generate a \"mental list\" in which they create reasons for a party's loss or gain in the polls. This can reinforce or change their opinion of the candidate and thus affect voting behaviour.\n\nThird, the final possibility is a \"behavioural response\" which is similar to a cognitive response. The only salient difference is that a voter will go and seek new information to form their \"mental list\", thus becoming more informed of the election. This may then affect voting behaviour.\n\nThese effects indicate how opinion polls can directly affect political choices of the electorate. But directly or indirectly, other effects can be surveyed and analyzed on all political parties. The form of [[Framing (social sciences)|media framing]] and party ideology shifts must also be taken under consideration. Opinion polling in some instances is a measure of cognitive bias, which is variably considered and handled appropriately in its various applications.\n\n=== Effect on politicians ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2011}}\nStarting in the 1980s, tracking polls and related technologies began having a notable impact on U.S. political leaders.<ref name=\"washpost201103\">{{cite news| title= David S.

He can [find out] with a nightly tracking poll. So it's no longer likely that political leaders are going to lead. Instead, they're going to follow.\"<ref name=\"washpost201103\"/>\n\n== Regulation ==\nSome jurisdictions over the world restrict the publication of the results of opinion polls, especially during the period around an election, in order to prevent the possibly erroneous results from affecting voters' decisions. For instance, in Canada, it is prohibited to publish the results of opinion surveys that would identify specific political parties or candidates in the final three days before a poll closes.<ref name=\"Emery1994\">{{citation|author=Claude Emery|title=Public opinion polling in Canada|date=January 1994|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/bp371-e.htm|publisher=Library of Parliament, Canada}}</ref>\n\nHowever, most [[Western democratic nations]] do not support the entire prohibition of the publication of pre-election opinion polls; most of them have no regulation and some only prohibit it in the final days or hours until the relevant poll closes.<ref name=\"Tim2002\">{{cite journal|author=Tim Bale|title=Restricting the broadcast and publication of pre-election and exit polls: some selected examples|year=2002|doi=10.1080/00344890208523210|journal=Representation|pages=15\u201322|volume=39|issue=1}}</ref> A survey by Canada's Royal Commission on Electoral Reform reported that the prohibition period of publication of the survey results largely differed in different countries. Out of the 20 countries examined, 3 prohibit the publication during the entire period of campaigns, while others prohibit it for a shorter term such as the polling period or the final 48 hours before a poll closes.<ref name=\"Emery1994\"/> In India, the Election Commission has prohibited it in the 48 hours before the start of polling.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Deliberative opinion poll]]\n* [[Entrance poll]]\n* [[Electoral geography]]\n* [[Europe Elects]]\n* [[Everett Carll Ladd]]\n* [[Exit poll]]\n* [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections]]\n* [[List of polling organizations]]\n* [[Metallic Metals Act]]\n* [[Open access poll]]\n* [[Psephology]]\n* [[Political analyst]]\n* [[data science|Political data scientists]]\n* [[Political forecasting]]\n* [[Push poll]]\n* [[Referendum]]\n* [[Roper Center for Public Opinion Research]]\n* [[Sample size determination]]\n* [[Straw poll]]\n* [[Swing (politics)]]\n* [[Types of democracy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* Asher, Herbert: ''Polling and the Public.

Opinion polls are usually designed to represent the opinions of a population by conducting a series of questions and then extrapolating generalities in ratio or within [[confidence intervals]].\n\n== History ==\nThe first known example of an opinion poll was a local [[straw poll]] conducted by ''The Harrisburg Pennsylvanian''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/a/49678/24858|title=Who conducted the first \"straw poll\" in U.S. election politics, and when was it conducted?|website=History Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Tom W.|date=1990|title=The First Straw?: A Study of the Origins of Election Polls|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=54|issue=1|pages=21\u201336|jstor=2749389|doi=10.1086/269181}}</ref> in [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], showing [[Andrew Jackson]] leading [[John Quincy Adams]] by 335 votes to 169 in the contest for the [[United States Presidency]]. Since Jackson won the popular vote in that state and the whole country, such straw votes gradually became more popular, but they remained local, usually citywide phenomena. In 1916, ''[[The Literary Digest]]'' embarked on a national survey (partly as a circulation-raising exercise) and correctly predicted [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s election as president. Mailing out millions of [[postcard]]s and simply counting the returns, ''The Literary Digest'' correctly predicted the victories of [[Warren Harding]] in 1920, [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924, [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1928, and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1932.\n\nThen, in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], its 2.3 million \"voters\" constituted a huge sample, but they were generally more affluent Americans who tended to have [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] sympathies. ''The Literary Digest'' was ignorant of this new bias; the week before election day, it reported that [[Alf Landon]] was far more popular than Roosevelt. At the same time, [[George Gallup]] conducted a far smaller (but more scientifically based) survey, in which he polled a demographically representative sample. [[Gallup (company)|the Gallup organization]] correctly predicted Roosevelt's landslide victory. ''The Literary Digest'' soon went out of business, while polling started to take off.\n\n[[Elmo Roper]] was another American pioneer in [[political forecasting]] using scientific polls.<ref name=\"cantril\">{{cite web |last1=Cantril |first1=Hadley |first2=Mildred |last2=Strunk |year=1951 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/98754561?title=Public%20Opinion%2c%201935-1946 |title=Public Opinion, 1935-1946 |publisher= Princeton University Press |page= vii }}</ref> He predicted the reelection of President Franklin D. Roosevelt three times, in 1936, 1940, and 1944. [[Louis Harris]] had been in the field of public opinion since 1947 when he joined the Elmo Roper firm, then later became partner.\n\nIn September 1938 Jean Stoetzel, after having met Gallup, created IFOP, the Institut Fran\u00e7ais d'Opinion Publique, as the first European survey institute in Paris and started political polls in summer 1939 with the question \"[[Why Die for Danzig?|Why die for Danzig?]]\", looking for popular support or dissent with this question asked by appeasement politician and future collaborationist [[Marcel D\u00e9at]].\n\n[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] launched a subsidiary in the [[United Kingdom]] that, almost alone, correctly predicted [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] victory in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], unlike virtually all other commentators, who expected a victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[Winston Churchill]].\n[[File:USA Gallup abortion opinion poll stacked area.svg|thumb|281x281px|An example of a poll on abortion.]]\nThe Allied occupation powers helped to create survey institutes in all of the Western occupation zones of Germany in 1947 and 1948 to better steer [[denazification]]. By the 1950s, various types of polling had spread to most democracies.\n\nIn long-term perspective, advertising had come under heavy pressure in the early 1930s. The Great Depression forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The [[New Deal]] furthermore aggressively promoted consumerism, and minimized the value of (or need for) advertising. Historian Jackson Lears argues that \"By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics.\" They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own market research, as well as the key to understanding politics. [[George Gallup]], the vice president of Young and Rubicam, and numerous other advertising experts, led the way. Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people for fighting the Nazis and Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the \"American Way of Life\" in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. \"Advertisers,\" Lears concludes, \"played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Jackson Lears|title=Fables Of Abundance: A Cultural History Of Advertising In America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgoXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA235|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|page=235|isbn=9780465090754}}</ref><ref>Jean M.

Also, the following has also led to differentiating results:<ref name=\"cantril\"/> Some polling organizations, such as [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]], [[YouGov]] and [[Zogby International|Zogby]] use [[Internet]] surveys, where a sample is drawn from a large panel of volunteers, and the results are weighted to reflect the demographics of the population of interest. In contrast, popular web polls draw on whoever wishes to participate, rather than a scientific sample of the population, and are therefore not generally considered professional.\n\nRecently, statistical learning methods have been proposed in order to exploit [[social media]] content (such as posts on the micro-blogging platform of [[Twitter]]) for modelling and predicting voting intention polls.<ref name=\"lampos2013\">[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236142275_A_user-centric_model_of_voting_intention_from_Social_Media Vasileios Lampos, Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro and Trevor Cohn.

Their job would be to present the misinterpreted interests of large institutions to public. They would also gauge the typically ignored interests of the public through polls.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Benchmark polls ===\nA ''benchmark poll'' is generally the first poll taken in a campaign. It is often taken before a candidate announces their bid for office but sometimes it happens immediately following that announcement after they have had some opportunity to raise funds. This is generally a short and simple survey of likely voters.\n\nA ''benchmark poll'' serves a number of purposes for a campaign, whether it is a political campaign or some other type of campaign. First, it gives the candidate a picture of where they stand with the electorate before any campaigning takes place. If the poll is done prior to announcing for office the candidate may use the poll to decide whether or not they should even run for office. Secondly, it shows them where their weaknesses and strengths are in two main areas. The first is the electorate. A ''benchmark poll'' shows them what types of voters they are sure to win, those they are sure to lose, and everyone in-between these two extremes. This lets the campaign know which voters are persuadable so they can spend their limited resources in the most effective manner. Second, it can give them an idea of what messages, ideas, or slogans are the strongest with the electorate.<ref name=\"Benchmark Polls\">Kenneth F. Warren (1992). \"in Defense of Public Opinion Polling.\" Westview Press. p. 200-1.</ref>\n\n=== Brushfire polls ===\n''Brushfire polls'' are polls taken during the period between the ''benchmark poll'' and ''tracking polls''. The number of ''brushfire polls'' taken by a campaign is determined by how competitive the race is and how much money the campaign has to spend. These polls usually focus on likely voters and the length of the survey varies on the number of messages being tested.\n\n''Brushfire polls'' are used for a number of purposes. First, it lets the candidate know if they have made any progress on the ballot, how much progress has been made, and in what demographics they have been making or losing ground. Secondly, it is a way for the campaign to test a variety of messages, both positive and negative, on themselves and their opponent(s). This lets the campaign know what messages work best with certain demographics and what messages should be avoided. Campaigns often use these polls to test possible attack messages that their opponent may use and potential responses to those attacks. The campaign can then spend some time preparing an effective response to any likely attacks. Thirdly, this kind of poll can be used by candidates or political parties to convince primary challengers to drop out of a race and support a stronger candidate.\n\n=== Tracking polls ===\nA ''tracking poll'' or ''rolling poll'' is a poll in which responses are obtained in a number of consecutive periods, for instance daily, and then results are calculated using a [[moving average]] of the responses that were gathered over a fixed number of the most recent periods, for example the past five days.<ref name=\"CNNtrackingpoll\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/polls/cnn.usa.gallup/tracking/FAQ.html |title=About the Tracking Polls |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref> In this example, the next calculated results will use data for five days counting backwards from the next day, namely the same data as before, but with the data from the next day included, and without the data from the sixth day before that day.\n\n== Potential for inaccuracy ==\nOver time, a number of theories and mechanisms have been offered to explain erroneous polling results. Some of these reflect errors on the part of the pollsters; many of them are statistical in nature. Others blame the respondents for not giving candid answers (''e.g.'', the [[Bradley effect]], the [[Shy Tory Factor]]); these can be more controversial.\n\n=== Margin of error due to sampling ===\nPolls based on samples of populations are subject to [[sampling error]] which reflects the effects of chance and uncertainty in the sampling process. Sampling polls rely on the [[law of large numbers]] to measure the opinions of the whole population based only on a subset, and for this purpose the absolute size of the sample is important, but the percentage of the whole population is not important (unless it happens to be close to the sample size). The possible difference between the sample and whole population is often expressed as a [[margin of error]] - usually defined as the radius of a 95% confidence interval for a particular statistic. One example is the percent of people who prefer product A versus product B. When a single, global margin of error is reported for a survey, it refers to the maximum margin of error for all reported percentages using the full sample from the survey. If the statistic is a percentage, this maximum margin of error can be calculated as the radius of the confidence interval for a reported percentage of 50%. Others suggest that a poll with a random sample of 1,000 people has margin of sampling error of \u00b13% for the estimated percentage of the whole population.\n\nA 3% margin of error means that if the same procedure is used a large number of times, 95% of the time the true population average will be within the sample estimate plus or minus 3%. The margin of error can be reduced by using a larger sample, however if a pollster wishes to reduce the margin of error to 1% they would need a sample of around 10,000 people.<ref>An estimate of the margin of error in percentage terms can be gained by the formula 100 \u00f7 square root of sample size</ref> In practice, pollsters need to balance the cost of a large sample against the reduction in sampling error and a sample size of around 500\u20131,000 is a typical compromise for political polls. (Note that to get complete responses it may be necessary to include thousands of additional participators.)<ref>[http://www.ncpp.org/?q=node/4 20 Questions Journalists Should Ask About Poll Results], National Council on Public Polls Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref><ref>[http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Election-Polling-Resources/Margin-of-Sampling-Error-Credibility-Interval.aspx Margin of Sampling Error and Credibility Interval], American Association for Public Opinion Research, Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref>\n\nAnother way to reduce the margin of error is to rely on [[poll average]]s. This makes the assumption that the procedure is similar enough between many different polls and uses the sample size of each poll to create a polling average.<ref>Lynch, Scott M. ''Introduction to Bayesian Statistics and Estimation for Social Scientists'' (2007).</ref> An example of a polling average can be found here: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926154657/http://www.daytodaypolitics.com/polls/presidential_election_Obama_vs_McCain_2008.htm 2008 Presidential Election polling average]. Another source of error stems from faulty demographic models by pollsters who weigh their samples by particular variables such as party identification in an election. For example, if you assume that the breakdown of the US population by party identification has not changed since the previous presidential election, you may underestimate a victory or a defeat of a particular party candidate that saw a surge or decline in its party registration relative to the previous presidential election cycle.\n\nA caution is that an estimate of a trend is subject to a larger error than an estimate of a level. This is because if one estimates the change, the difference between two numbers ''X'' and ''Y,'' then one has to contend with errors in both ''X'' and ''Y''. A rough guide is that if the change in measurement falls outside the margin of error it is worth attention.\n\n=== Nonresponse bias ===\nSince some people do not answer calls from strangers, or refuse to the answer the poll, poll samples may not be representative samples from a population due to a [[non-response bias]]. Response rates have been declining, and are down to about 10% in recent years.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/survey_bias_how_can_we_trust_opinion_polls_when_so_few_people_respond_.single.html| title=Minority Opinions:Hardly anyone responds to public opinion surveys anymore. Can we still trust them?|author=Will Oremus| date=2012-05-17| accessdate=2013-11-21| magazine=Slate}}</ref> Because of this [[selection bias]], the characteristics of those who agree to be interviewed may be markedly different from those who decline. That is, the actual sample is a biased version of the universe the pollster wants to analyze. In these cases, bias introduces new errors, one way or the other, that are in addition to errors caused by sample size. Error due to bias does not become smaller with larger sample sizes, because taking a larger sample size simply repeats the same mistake on a larger scale. If the people who refuse to answer, or are never reached, have the same characteristics as the people who do answer, then the final results should be unbiased. If the people who do not answer have different opinions then there is bias in the results. In terms of election polls, studies suggest that bias effects are small, but each polling firm has its own techniques for adjusting weights to minimize selection bias.<ref name=\"Langer2003\">{{cite web|publisher=ABC News|author=Langer, Gary|title=About Response Rates: Some Unresolved Questions|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/responserates.pdf|date=May 2003|accessdate=2010-05-17}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/For-Researchers/Poll-Survey-FAQ/Response-Rates-An-Overview.aspx Response Rates: An Overview] American Association for Public Opinion Research, Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref>\n\n=== Response bias ===\nSurvey results may be affected by [[response bias]], where the answers given by respondents do not reflect their true beliefs. This may be deliberately engineered by unscrupulous pollsters in order to generate a certain result or please their clients, but more often is a result of the detailed wording or ordering of questions (see below). Respondents may deliberately try to manipulate the outcome of a poll by e.g. advocating a more extreme position than they actually hold in order to boost their side of the argument or give rapid and ill-considered answers in order to hasten the end of their questioning. Respondents may also feel under social pressure not to give an unpopular answer. For example, respondents might be unwilling to admit to unpopular attitudes like [[racism]] or [[sexism]], and thus polls might not reflect the true incidence of these attitudes in the population. In American political parlance, this phenomenon is often referred to as the [[Bradley effect]]. If the results of surveys are widely publicized this effect may be magnified - a phenomenon commonly referred to as the [[spiral of silence]].\n\nUse of the [[plurality voting system]] (select only one candidate) in a poll puts an unintentional bias into the poll, since people who favor more than one candidate cannot indicate this. The fact that they must choose only one candidate biases the poll, causing it to favor the candidate most different from the others while it disfavors candidates who are similar to other candidates. The [[plurality voting system]] also biases elections in the same way.\n\nSome people responding may not understand the words being used, but may wish to avoid the embarrassment of admitting this, or the poll mechanism may not allow clarification, so they may make an arbitrary choice. Some percentage of people also answer whimsically or out of annoyance at being polled. This results in perhaps 4% of Americans reporting they have personally been decapitated<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=487654380 Planet Money Episode 714: Can A Game Show Lose?]</ref> or that \"lizardmen are running the Earth\".<ref>[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/ Noisy Poll Results and Reptilian Muslim Climatologists from Mars]</ref>\n\n=== Wording of questions ===\nIt is well established that the wording of the questions, the order in which they are asked and the number and form of alternative answers offered can influence results of polls. For instance, the public is more likely to indicate support for a person who is described by the operator as one of the \"leading candidates\". This support itself overrides subtle bias for one candidate, as does lumping some candidates in an \"other\" category or vice versa. Thus comparisons between polls often boil down to the wording of the question. On some issues, question wording can result in quite pronounced differences between surveys.<ref>[http://www.people-press.org/2013/07/26/government-surveillance-a-question-wording-experiment/ Government Surveillance: A Question Wording Experiment], Pew Research Center Published 2013-07-26 Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref><ref>[http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/whats-in-a-name-global-warming-vs-climate-change/ What\u2019s In A Name? Global Warming vs Climate Change], Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, Published 2014-05-27, Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref> This can also, however, be a result of legitimately conflicted feelings or evolving attitudes, rather than a poorly constructed survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicagenda.org/pages/seven-stages-public-opinion |title=The Seven Stages of Public Opinion Public Agenda |publisher=Publicagenda.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}</ref>\n\nA common technique to control for this bias is to rotate the order in which questions are asked. Many pollsters also split-sample. This involves having two different versions of a question, with each version presented to half the respondents.\n\nThe most effective controls, used by [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] researchers, are:\n\n* asking enough questions to allow all aspects of an issue to be covered and to control effects due to the form of the question (such as positive or negative wording), the adequacy of the number being established quantitatively with [[psychometrics|psychometric]] measures such as reliability coefficients, and\n* analyzing the results with psychometric techniques which synthesize the answers into a few reliable scores and detect ineffective questions.\n\nThese controls are not widely used in the polling industry.{{Why?|date=July 2010}}. However, as it is important that questions to test the product have a high quality, survey methodologists work on methods to test them. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire, some may be more complex than others. For instance, testing a questionnaire can be done by:\n* conducting [[cognitive pretesting|cognitive interviewing]]. By asking a sample of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can \n* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.\n* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest,<ref>Lord, F. and Novick, M. R.(1968). Statistical theories of mental test scores. Addison \u2013 Wesley.</ref> quasi-simplex,<ref>Heise, D. R.(1969). Separating reliability and stability in test-retest correlation. American Sociological Review, 34, 93-101.</ref> or mutlitrait-multimethod models.<ref>Andrews, F. M. (1984). Construct validity and error components of survey measures: a structural modelling approach. Public Opinion Quarterly, 48, 409-442.</ref>\n* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).<ref>Saris, W. E. and Gallhofer, I. N. (2014). Design, evaluation and analysis of questionnaires for survey research. Second Edition. Hoboken, Wiley.</ref>\n\n=== Involuntary facades and false correlations ===\nOne of the criticisms of opinion polls is that societal assumptions that opinions between which there is no logical link are \"correlated attitudes\" can push people with one opinion into a group that forces them to pretend to have a supposedly linked but actually unrelated opinion. That, in turn, may cause people who have the first opinion to claim on polls that they have the second opinion without having it, causing opinion polls to become part of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] problems. It have been suggested that attempts to counteract unethical opinions by condemning supposedly linked opinions may favor the groups that promote the actually unethical opinions by forcing people with supposedly linked opinions into them by ostracism elsewhere in society making such efforts counterproductive, that not being sent between groups that assume ulterior motives from each other and not being allowed to express consistent critical thought anywhere may create psychological stress because humans are sapient, and that discussion spaces free from assumptions of ulterior motives behind specific opinions should be created. In this context, rejection of the assumption that opinion polls show actual links between opinions is considered important.<ref>\"Political Polling in the Digital Age: The Challenge of Measuring and Understanding Public Opinion\" by Robert K. Goidel, yr twenty-eleven</ref><ref>\"Understanding Public Opinion Polls\" by Jelke Bethlehem, yr twenty-seventeen</ref>\n\n=== Coverage bias ===\nAnother source of error is the use of samples that are not representative of the population as a consequence of the methodology used, as was the experience of ''The Literary Digest'' in 1936. For example, telephone sampling has a built-in error because in many times and places, those with telephones have generally been richer than those without.\n\nIn some places many people have only [[mobile telephone]]s. Because pollsters cannot use automated dialing machines to call mobile phones in the United States (because the phone's owner may be charged for taking a call<ref>http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/TCPA-Rules.pdf</ref>), these individuals are typically excluded from polling samples. There is concern that, if the subset of the population without cell phones differs markedly from the rest of the population, these differences can skew the results of the poll.<ref>[http://www.pewresearch.org/2010/11/22/the-growing-gap-between-landline-and-dual-frame-election-polls/ The Growing Gap between Landline and Dual Frame Election Polls: Republican Vote Share Bigger in Landline-Only Surveys] Pew Research Center, 2010-11-22; Retrieved 2016-06-05</ref>\n\nPolling organizations have developed many weighting techniques to help overcome these deficiencies, with varying degrees of success. Studies of mobile phone users by the Pew Research Center in the US, in 2007, concluded that \"cell-only respondents are different from landline respondents in important ways, (but) they were neither numerous enough nor different enough on the questions we examined to produce a significant change in overall general population survey estimates when included with the landline samples and weighted according to US Census parameters on basic demographic characteristics.\"<ref name=\"Keeter2007\">{{cite web|author=Keeter, Scott|publisher=Pew Research Center Publications|title=How Serious Is Polling's Cell-Only Problem?|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/515/polling-cell-only-problem|date=2007-06-27|access-date=2008-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030215501/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/515/polling-cell-only-problem|archive-date=2008-10-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> <!---since Pew is in the business of polling, their quote is pretty much self-serving.

This tends to include minorities and younger voters; and occurs more frequently in metropolitan areas. Men are more likely to be cellphone-only compared to women.\n# Some people may not be contactable by landline from Monday to Friday and may be contactable only by cellphone.\n# Some people use their landlines only to access the Internet, and answer calls only to their cellphones.\n\nSome polling companies have attempted to get around that problem by including a \"cellphone supplement\". There are a number of problems with including cellphones in a telephone poll:\n# It is difficult to get co-operation from cellphone users, because in many parts of the US, users are charged for both outgoing and incoming calls. That means that pollsters have had to offer financial compensation to gain co-operation.\n# US federal law prohibits the use of automated dialling devices to call cellphones ([[Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991]]). Numbers therefore have to be dialled by hand, which is more time-consuming and expensive for pollsters.\n\n=== 1992 UK general election ===\nAn oft-quoted example of opinion polls succumbing to errors occurred during the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 UK general election]]. Despite the polling organizations using different methodologies, virtually all the polls taken before the vote, and to a lesser extent, [[exit poll]]s taken on voting day, showed a lead for the opposition Labour party, but the actual vote gave a clear victory to the ruling Conservative party.\n\nIn their deliberations after this embarrassment the pollsters advanced several ideas to account for their errors, including:\n\n; Late [[swing (politics)|swing]] : Voters who changed their minds shortly before voting tended to favour the Conservatives, so the error was not as great as it first appeared.\n; Nonresponse bias : Conservative voters were less likely to participate in surveys than in the past and were thus under-represented.\n; The [[Shy Tory Factor]] : The Conservatives had suffered a sustained period of unpopularity as a result of economic difficulties and a series of minor scandals, leading to a [[spiral of silence]] in which some Conservative supporters were reluctant to disclose their sincere intentions to pollsters.\n\nThe relative importance of these factors was, and remains, a matter of controversy, but since then the polling organizations have adjusted their methodologies and have achieved more accurate results in subsequent election campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nA comprehensive discussion of these biases and how they should be understood and mitigated is included in several sources including Dillman and Salant (1994).<ref>Salant, Priscilla, I. Dillman, and A. Don. How to conduct your own survey. No. 300.723 S3.. 1994.</ref>\n\n== Failures ==\nA widely publicized failure of opinion polling to date in the [[United States]] was the prediction that [[Thomas Dewey]] would defeat [[Harry S. Truman]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 US presidential election]]. Major polling organizations, including Gallup and Roper, indicated a landslide victory for Dewey.\n\nIt was widely predicted that [[Donald Trump]] would lose the [[U.S. presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]] to Former US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]; however, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/final-election-update-theres-a-wide-range-of-outcomes-and-most-of-them-come-up-clinton/ | title=Final Election Update: There's a Wide Range of Outcomes, and Most of Them Come up Clinton| date=2016-11-08}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most polls failed to predict the Conservative election victories of [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] and [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]], and Labour's victory in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]]. In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 election]] virtually every poll predicted a hung parliament with Labour and the Conservatives neck and neck when the actual result was a clear Conservative majority. On the other hand, in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]], the opposite appears to have occurred. Most polls predicted an increased Conservative majority, even though in reality the election resulted in a hung parliament with a Conservative plurality. However, some polls correctly predicted this outcome.\n\n== Social media as a source of opinion on candidates ==\nSocial media today is a popular medium for the candidates to campaign and for gauging the public reaction to the campaigns. Social media can also be used as an indicator of the voter opinion regarding the poll. Some research studies have shown that predictions made using social media signals can match traditional opinion polls.<ref name=\"lampos2013\"/><ref name=\"oconnor2010\"/>\n\nRegarding the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a major concern has been that of the effect of false stories spread throughout social media. Evidence shows that social media plays a huge role in the supplying of news: 62 percent of US adults get news on social media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/|title=News Use Across Social Media Platforms 2016|date=2016-05-26|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}</ref> This fact makes the issue of fake news on social media more pertinent. Other evidence shows that the most popular fake news stories were more widely shared on Facebook than the most popular mainstream news stories; many people who see fake news stories report that they believe them; and the most discussed fake news stories tended to favor Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. As a result of these facts, some have concluded that if not for these stories, Donald Trump may not have won the election over Hillary Clinton.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allcott|first=Hunt|last2=Gentzkow|first2=Matthew|date=Spring 2017|title=Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/fakenews.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=31|issue=2|pages=211\u2013236|via=Stanford|doi=10.1257/jep.31.2.211}}</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n=== Effect on voters ===\nBy providing information about voting intentions, opinion polls can sometimes influence the behavior of electors, and in his book ''[[The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way|The Broken Compass]]'', [[Peter Hitchens]] asserts that opinion polls are actually a device for influencing public opinion.<ref name=\"Hitchens2009\">{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Peter|title=The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way |chapter=Chapter 1, Guy Fawkes Gets a Blackberry|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84706-405-9}}</ref> The various theories about how this happens can be split into two groups: bandwagon/underdog effects, and strategic (\"tactical\") voting.\n\nA [[bandwagon effect]] occurs when the poll prompts voters to back the candidate shown to be winning in the poll. The idea that voters are susceptible to such effects is old, stemming at least from 1884; [[William Safire]] reported that the term was first used in a political cartoon in the magazine ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' in that year.<ref>Safire, William, ''Safire's Political Dictionary'', page 42. Random House, 1993.</ref> It has also remained persistent in spite of a lack of empirical corroboration until the late 20th century. [[George Gallup]] spent much effort in vain trying to discredit this theory in his time by presenting empirical research. A recent meta-study of scientific research on this topic indicates that from the 1980s onward the Bandwagon effect is found more often by researchers.<ref name=\"irwin\">Irwin, Galen A. and Joop J. M. Van Holsteyn. ''Bandwagons, Underdogs, the Titanic and the Red Cross: The Influence of Public Opinion Polls on Voters'' (2000).</ref>\n\nThe opposite of the bandwagon effect is the [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] effect. It is often mentioned in the media. This occurs when people vote, out of sympathy, for the party perceived to be \"losing\" the elections. There is less empirical evidence for the existence of this effect than there is for the existence of the bandwagon effect.<ref name=\"irwin\"/>\n\nThe second category of theories on how polls directly affect voting is called strategic or [[tactical voting]]. This theory is based on the idea that voters view the act of voting as a means of selecting a government. Thus they will sometimes not choose the candidate they prefer on ground of ideology or sympathy, but another, less-preferred, candidate from strategic considerations. An example can be found in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election]]. As he was then a Cabinet Minister, [[Michael Portillo]]'s constituency of [[Enfield Southgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Enfield Southgate]] was believed to be a [[safe seat]] but opinion polls showed the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate [[Stephen Twigg]] steadily gaining support, which may have prompted undecided voters or supporters of other parties to support Twigg in order to remove Portillo. Another example is the boomerang effect where the likely supporters of the candidate shown to be winning feel that chances are slim and that their vote is not required, thus allowing another candidate to win.\n\nIn addition, Mark Pickup in Cameron Anderson and Laura Stephenson's \"Voting Behaviour in Canada\" outlines three additional \"behavioural\" responses that voters may exhibit when faced with polling data.\n\nThe first is known as a \"cue taking\" effect which holds that poll data is used as a \"proxy\" for information about the candidates or parties. Cue taking is \"based on the psychological phenomenon of using heuristics to simplify a complex decision\" (243).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Cameron |title=Voting Behaviour in Canada|url=https://archive.org/details/votingbehaviouri00came |url-access=registration |year=2010|publisher=UBC Press|location=Vancouver|pages=[https://archive.org/details/votingbehaviouri00came/page/243 243\u2013278] |author2=Pickup, Mark |authorlink=Election Campaign Polls and Democracy in Canada: Examining the Evidence Behind Common Claims|chapter=10}}</ref>\n\nThe second, first described by Petty and Cacioppo (1996) is known as \"cognitive response\" theory. This theory asserts that a voter's response to a poll may not line with their initial conception of the electoral reality. In response, the voter is likely to generate a \"mental list\" in which they create reasons for a party's loss or gain in the polls. This can reinforce or change their opinion of the candidate and thus affect voting behaviour.\n\nThird, the final possibility is a \"behavioural response\" which is similar to a cognitive response. The only salient difference is that a voter will go and seek new information to form their \"mental list\", thus becoming more informed of the election. This may then affect voting behaviour.\n\nThese effects indicate how opinion polls can directly affect political choices of the electorate. But directly or indirectly, other effects can be surveyed and analyzed on all political parties. The form of [[Framing (social sciences)|media framing]] and party ideology shifts must also be taken under consideration. Opinion polling in some instances is a measure of cognitive bias, which is variably considered and handled appropriately in its various applications.\n\n=== Effect on politicians ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2011}}\nStarting in the 1980s, tracking polls and related technologies began having a notable impact on U.S. political leaders.<ref name=\"washpost201103\">{{cite news| title= David S.

He can [find out] with a nightly tracking poll. So it's no longer likely that political leaders are going to lead. Instead, they're going to follow.\"<ref name=\"washpost201103\"/>\n\n== Regulation ==\nSome jurisdictions over the world restrict the publication of the results of opinion polls, especially during the period around an election, in order to prevent the possibly erroneous results from affecting voters' decisions. For instance, in Canada, it is prohibited to publish the results of opinion surveys that would identify specific political parties or candidates in the final three days before a poll closes.<ref name=\"Emery1994\">{{citation|author=Claude Emery|title=Public opinion polling in Canada|date=January 1994|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/bp371-e.htm|publisher=Library of Parliament, Canada}}</ref>\n\nHowever, most [[Western democratic nations]] do not support the entire prohibition of the publication of pre-election opinion polls; most of them have no regulation and some only prohibit it in the final days or hours until the relevant poll closes.<ref name=\"Tim2002\">{{cite journal|author=Tim Bale|title=Restricting the broadcast and publication of pre-election and exit polls: some selected examples|year=2002|doi=10.1080/00344890208523210|journal=Representation|pages=15\u201322|volume=39|issue=1}}</ref> A survey by Canada's Royal Commission on Electoral Reform reported that the prohibition period of publication of the survey results largely differed in different countries. Out of the 20 countries examined, 3 prohibit the publication during the entire period of campaigns, while others prohibit it for a shorter term such as the polling period or the final 48 hours before a poll closes.<ref name=\"Emery1994\"/> In India, the Election Commission has prohibited it in the 48 hours before the start of polling.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Deliberative opinion poll]]\n* [[Entrance poll]]\n* [[Electoral geography]]\n* [[Europe Elects]]\n* [[Everett Carll Ladd]]\n* [[Exit poll]]\n* [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections]]\n* [[List of polling organizations]]\n* [[Metallic Metals Act]]\n* [[Open access poll]]\n* [[Psephology]]\n* [[Political analyst]]\n* [[data science|Political data scientists]]\n* [[Political forecasting]]\n* [[Push poll]]\n* [[Referendum]]\n* [[Roper Center for Public Opinion Research]]\n* [[Sample size determination]]\n* [[Straw poll]]\n* [[Swing (politics)]]\n* [[Types of democracy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* Asher, Herbert: ''Polling and the Public.

{"title_page": "Ion Iovescu", "text_new": "'''Ion Iovescu''' (August 6, 1912&ndash;August 9, 1977) was a [[Romania]]n prose writer.\n\nBorn in [[Spineni]], [[Olt County]], his parents were poor peasants. He attended high school in [[Slatina, Romania|Slatina]] and [[Constan\u021ba]], followed by the literature and philosophy faculty of [[Bucharest University]]. Until 1968, he worked as a high school teacher, traveling salesman, clerk and librarian. From 1932 to 1936, he was a participant in the ''[[Sbur\u0103torul]]'' circle. He made his published debut in 1934 in ''[[Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103]]'', then edited by [[Liviu Rebreanu]]. His first novel was the 1936 ''Nunt\u0103 cu bucluc'', which came with an appreciative preface by [[Eugen Lovinescu]], who called him \"[[Muntenia]]'s [[Ion Creang\u0103|Creang\u0103]]\". Among his other books are ''O daravel\u0103 de proces'' (1941), ''Lacrimi pe p\u00e2ine'' (1967), ''Soare cu din\u021bi'' (1974) and ''Marea v\u00e2lv\u0103taie'', vol. I (1977).

He was also the father of prominent industrialist [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong]].\n\nArmstrong was born in a small [[Cumbria]] village, where he came in contact with the wealthy Losh family. This contact helped him gain a commercial foothold when, in the 1750s, he moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, joining a Losh-owned corn firm. Upon the proprietors' bankruptcy, Armstrong collected together the funds to establish his own corn firm: Armstrong, & Co.\n\nFinancially established, Armstrong was able to pursue his own interests. Armstrong took part local reformist politics, where he and his friends, [[James Losh]] and [[Armorer Donkin]], campaigned for parliamentary acts in Newcastle, and Armstrong attempted to reform the administration of the [[River Tyne]], to limited success. He entertained the local high society at the [[Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society]], warmly supporting its growth. Armstrong also pursued a [[recreational mathematics|recreational mathematical]] interest, contributing to some minor journals, and leaving a large collection of mathematical volumes to the Society.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:James Losh.jpg|thumb|[[James Losh]] (1763\u20131833), friend of Armstrong, member of the powerful Losh family, and fellow reformer of Newcastle.]]\nVery little is known of Armstrong's early life. He was born in 1778, in the small village of [[Wreay]], [[Cumbria]], the son of a local shoemaker,{{sfn|Linsley|2006}} and descended from a long line of [[yeomen]]. Armstrong attended the local village school, developing an early interest in mathematics, and attending alongside the children of John Losh, from the local Losh family: James (1763\u20131833), George (1766\u20131846), and William.{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=15}} The Losh family were powerful in this area, descended from the Arloshes, who had occupied the area for over two centuries, and residing in the large local mansion, known as Woodside. Though the family were never honoured with titles, John Losh was known locally as \"the big black squire\" of Woodside.{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=15}} At this school, Armstrong was tutored by the local priest, William Gaskin, an eccentric man who James Losh recalled as \"uncouth in his manners and abrupt and confused in his manner of speaking\", if also \"a man of considerable powers of mind\".{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=16}} Armstrong was also likely introduced to the celebrated mathematics teacher, [[John Dawson (surgeon)|John Dawson]], by John and James Losh, who both later studied under him at [[Sedbergh School]].{{sfn|Heald|2011|pp=15-6}}\n\n==Career as a corn merchant==\n\nIn the mid-1790s, Armstrong arrived in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], promptly joining Losh, Lubbren & Co, a [[Quayside]] firm of corn merchants, as a [[clerk]] in the firm's counting house. George Losh was here, a senior partner in the firm, alongside the [[naturalised]] German merchant, John Diedrich Lubbren. The Losh family had grown powerful in Newcastle, with George also owning the local Newcastle Fire Office and Water Company, and his brothers - William and James - later becoming influential members of [[Tyneside]]'s high society.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Heald|2011|pp=16-7}} In Summer 1803, the firm went bankrupt, when the abrupt collapse of the Newcastle banking house, Surtrees and Burdon, left George Losh and his partners financially embarrassed, the first of a series of failures that led Losh to migrate to France. Armstrong - then married and with one daughter - was forced to rely on financial support from his wife's family, Diedrich Lubbren, and possibly William Losh, using the funds to start his own enterprise in the corn industry: \"Armstrong & Co., merchants, [[Cowgate, Newcastle upon Tyne|Cowgate]]\".{{sfn|Gurney|1901}}{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=17}}\n\n==Career as a local politician==\n\n[[File:Armorer Donkin, 19th-century, National Trust, Cragside.jpg|left|thumb|[[Armorer Donkin]] (1779\u20131851), close friend of Armstrong and fellow reformer of Newcastle.]]\n\nIn August 1824, Armstrong and Armorer Donkin, a close friend of Armstrong's, both with a passion for reform in their city, were appointed by the [[Moot Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne|Moot Hall]] to a committee to recommend the construction of either a [[horse-drawn railway]] or canal between Newcastle and Carlisle. Armstrong clearly saw the importance of his duty, noting: \"We can bring corn from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to Newcastle cheaper than we can convey it between Newcastle and Carlisle\". Armstrong was cautious of a railway system, as a relatively new form of transport, referring to the plan as \"spiritless\". This argument did not meet with agreement on the committee, and the following year, it recommended the construction of the [[Newcastle & Carlisle Railway]], headed by the more radical reformer, James Losh.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=20}} This preference has variously been suggested as evidence of his innate fear of new technology, or his rational preference as a cautious corn merchant, wanting his stock to be carried in more safe and established modes of transport.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}\n\nIn 1831, Armstrong, James Losh, and Donkin attended [[Northumberland]] reform meeting in support of the [[Great Reform Act]] - a wide-ranging democratic act of parliament, which had met with much opposition - and supporting a resolution against the [[House of Lords]], who had most vigorously opposed the act. After the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which reformed the governance of local boroughs, Armstrong was elected as a reformist candidate in the Newcastle town council, an office he attained with a substantial majority against the reactionary, Matthew Anderson. At the council, Armstrong voted in favour of the removal of the furniture and fittings of the Mayor's residence, and the end of the tradition of the Mayor's feasts, held at the public expense. His success didn't sustain in the following, 1839 election, where he was defeated by a landslide by the \"more formidable opponent\", George Palmer, losing his seat 38 votes to 8. With Palmer's retirement, Armstrong returned to the office in 1842, unopposed. In January 1849, upon the vacancy of a seat, he was unanimously elected an alderman of Newcastle. The aldermen were not so harmonious when, a few months later, he was proposed to be made the [[List of mayors of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|mayor of Newcastle]], as the queen was expected to visit the town soon. The better known watercolourist, [[Joseph Crawhall II]] was selected in his stead to preside over the royal visit. By November the following year, Armstrong was elected mayor; he lead a mayoralty described by local historian Richard Welford as \"quiet and uneventful\", in which Armstrong led the \"usual festivities\" and \"presided over the usual number of public meetings\".{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Mayors & Sheriffs}}{{sfn|Welford|1895|p=106-8}}\n\nArmstrong was generally a progressive, but began as a more independent, and sometimes reactionary, politician, remaining a \"timid reformer\" even afterwards, according to Welford. In the [[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832 general election]] he voted for both [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] and [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections of the_1820s|Newcastle MP]] candidates. By the [[1835 United Kingdom general election|1835 election]], he was decidedly in favour of the Whigs. By 1837, he was divided between two candidates - [[Charles John Bigge]] and [[William Ord]] - after which he expressly favoured Whig (or, later, [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]) candidates.{{sfn|Welford|1895|p=108}} One political concern he held, despite his reformist reputation, was against the abolition of the [[Corn Laws]] - a set of taxes on imported food, which kept domestic grain prices high - a reform he spoke out vigorously against in 1845, perhaps out of self interest as a corn merchant.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Welford|1895|p=108}}\n\nWhile a local politician, Armstrong primarily concerned himself with the management of the [[River Tyne]]. Before the 1835 Act, the council had been derided for its neglect of the river, and many hoped the new council would attend to its problems. In his first term as councillor, Armstrong issued a polemical pamphlet of his observations on the river's improvement, and in 1843, promptly took over the local River Committee, upon the previous chairman's death. Despite the many heated debates Armstrong held on it, \"neither he nor the council's appointed engineer had the skills needed to enable a programme of improvement to be pursued with any degree of confidence\", according to [[Stafford M. Linsley]], writing for the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Armstrong's incompetence, as well as the widespread belief that the Committee's funds were being inappropriately used, led to agitation against the Committee, especially from those heavily economically invested in the river, as in [[North Shields|North]] and [[South Shields]]. Armstrong held this position, continuing his demands for reformation, which invariably met with the formidable opposition of the council, until the Tyne Improvement Act of 1850 was passed. This act dismantled the council's authority over the river, instead putting it under the control of a group of commissioners.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Gurney|1901}}{{sfn|Guthrie|1880|p=65}} The bill was put forth to the House of Commons in June 1850, naming Armstrong as one of the life commissioners, but, after complaints from the council, Armstrong's name was substituted for that of William Rutherford Hunter before the bill was presented to the [[House of Lords]].{{sfn|Guthrie|1880|p=89-90}}\n\n==Personal life and death==\n[[File:William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong, aged 21, 1831, National Trust, Cragside.jpg|thumb|William George Armstrong, Armstrong's son and later 1st Baron Armstrong, aged 21]]\nAround 1801, Armstrong married Ann Potter,{{sfn|Linsley|2006}} the eldest daughter of William Potter of Walbottle House, and a \"highly cultured woman\" according to [[Henry Palin Gurney]], writing for the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.{{sfn|Gurney|1901}} They had two children, a daughter and a son. The daughter, Ann, the eldest of the two, married [[William Henry Watson]], a minor politician and judge. The son, William, later to become first [[Baron Armstrong]], was a prominent industrialist, scientist, and inventor. The Armstrong household allowed William to nurture an early mechanical interest, often visiting the [[joiner]] employed by William Potter for lessons in mechanics.{{sfn|Gurney|1901}} The family initially lived in a three-storey terraced house on 9 Pleasant Row, Shieldfield, where his son, William was born, and spent his early childhood, developing a passion for water and fishing. The house no longer exists, but the remaining [[lintel]] refers to the establishment as the 'Armstrong House', and a stone adjacent to Christ Church, Shieldfield, commemorates it. By the 1820s, with Armstrong's trade flourishing, the family moved to a larger, 12 acre establishment in [[Ouseburn Valley]], where Armstrong built a house, known as South Jesmond House.{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=11, 20}}{{sfn|Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery}}\n\nHis financial success in the corn industry allowed Armstrong to pursue several personal interests, including a passion for mathematics. He contributed to the recreational mathematics journals, ''[[The Ladies' Diary]]'' and ''[[Gentleman's Diary]]'', and collected  a large mathematical library. Armstrong joined the recently founded Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society in 1798, \"a warm supporter of the institution and man of scholarly acquirements\" according to a contemporary,{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=20}} and helped found the local Natural History Society. He also provided funds for the establishment of a local [[chamber of commerce]], where he served on the committee.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Gurney|1901}}{{sfn|Welford|1895|p=106}} At the Literary and Philosophical Society, Armstrong became close friends with the local solicitor, Armorer Donkin. \"Their tastes were similar; their political views harmonized; their aims were practically identical, and they became as brothers\" according to local historian, Alfred Cochrane. Donkin remained a family friend and, later in his life, took the younger William as an apprentice.{{sfn|Heald|2011|pp=20-22}}{{sfn|Gurney|1901}}\n\nArmstrong died on 2 June 1857, having given up many of his offices weeks earlier. Armstrong requested that his son, William, leave his large library of mathematical and local tracts to the Literary and Philosophical Society, a wish William fulfilled the following year, with 1284 works added to the society's libraries.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=79}}{{sfn|Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery}} This allowed the society \"a more complete mathematical department than any other provincial institution in the kingdom\" according to Dr. [[Robert Spence Watson]], Secretary of the Society, 1862\u201393.{{sfn|Gurney|1901}} Armstrong was buried in the local [[Jesmond Old Cemetery]], in the same grave as his wife, who had predeceased him on 8 June 1848, and next to the grave of Armorer Donkin, who had died in 1851. Armstrong and Donkin's graves are, aside from their inscriptions, identical, with the twin low, [[cruciform]], granite structures likely designed by the younger Armstrong.{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=79}}{{sfn|Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |title=William Armstrong (1778-1857) |website=Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery |url=http://www.jesmondoldcemetery.co.uk/armstrong_21.html |ref={{harvid|Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery}} |access-date=1 January 2020 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Heald |first=Henrietta |date=2011 |title=William Armstrong: Magician of the North |publisher=McNidder and Grace Limited |isbn=978-0-85716-035-5 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=opfKCEOzUY4C |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=James |date=1880 |title=The River Tyne: Its History and Resources |location=London |publisher=Longmans & Co. |url=https://www.electricscotland.com/history/articles/river_tyne.pdf |oclc=1127098438 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite DNB |last=Gurney |first=Henry Palin |author-link=Henry Palin Gurney |wstitle=Armstrong, William George |supplement=1 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite ODNB |last=Linsley |first=Stafford M. |date=2006 |id=668 |title=Armstrong, William (1778\u20131857), corn merchant and local politician |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite web |title=Mayors and Sheriffs 1216 to date |website=Newcastle City Council |url=https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Lord%20Mayors%20and%20Sheriffs%201216%20to%20date.pdf |access-date=30 September 2019 |ref={{harvid|Mayors & Sheriffs}} }}\n* {{cite book |last=Welford |first=Richard |date=1895 |title=Men of Mark 'twixt Tyne and Tweed |chapter=William Armstrong, father of Lord Armstrong |volume=1 |location=London |publisher=Walter Scott, Ltd. |pages=106-108 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/menmarktwixttyn00welfgoog/page/n129 |ref=harv |oclc=54294917 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''On Armstrong'''\n* {{cite book |last=Wallis |first=Peter John |date=1972 |title=Newcastle Mathematical Libraries: William Armstrong, Charles Hutton and others |series=Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne |publisher=University of Durham |oclc=123100890 }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia |title=William Armstrong (1778\u20131857) |encyclopedia=[[International Genealogical Index]] |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of the Latterday Saints }}\n\n'''On Armstrong's son, containing information on Armstrong'''\n* {{cite book |last=McKenzie |first=Peter |date=1983 |title=W.G.

Though the family were never honoured with titles, John Losh was known locally as \"the big black squire\" of Woodside.{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=15}} At this school, Armstrong was tutored by the local priest, William Gaskin, an eccentric man who James Losh recalled as \"uncouth in his manners and abrupt and confused in his manner of speaking\", if also \"a man of considerable powers of mind\".{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=16}} Armstrong was also likely introduced to the celebrated mathematics teacher, [[John Dawson (surgeon)|John Dawson]], by John and James Losh, who both later studied under him at [[Sedbergh School]].{{sfn|Heald|2011|pp=15-6}}\n\n==Career as a corn merchant==\n\nIn the mid-1790s, Armstrong arrived in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], promptly joining Losh, Lubbren & Co, a [[Quayside]] firm of corn merchants, as a [[clerk]] in the firm's counting house. George Losh was here, a senior partner in the firm, alongside the [[naturalised]] German merchant, John Diedrich Lubbren. The Losh family had grown powerful in Newcastle, with George also owning the local Newcastle Fire Office and Water Company, and his brothers - William and James - later becoming influential members of [[Tyneside]]'s high society.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Heald|2011|pp=16-7}} In Summer 1803, the firm went bankrupt, when the abrupt collapse of the Newcastle banking house, Surtrees and Burdon, left George Losh and his partners financially embarrassed, the first of a series of failures that led Losh to migrate to France. Armstrong - then married and with one daughter - was forced to rely on financial support from his wife's family, Diedrich Lubbren, and possibly William Losh, using the funds to start his own enterprise in the corn industry: \"Armstrong & Co., merchants, [[Cowgate, Newcastle upon Tyne|Cowgate]]\".{{sfn|Gurney|1901}}{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=17}}\n\n==Career as a local politician==\n\n[[File:Armorer Donkin, 19th-century, National Trust, Cragside.jpg|left|thumb|[[Armorer Donkin]] (1779\u20131851), close friend of Armstrong and fellow reformer of Newcastle.]]\n\nIn August 1824, Armstrong and Armorer Donkin, a close friend of Armstrong's, both with a passion for reform in their city, were appointed by the [[Moot Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne|Moot Hall]] to a committee to recommend the construction of either a [[horse-drawn railway]] or canal between Newcastle and Carlisle. Armstrong clearly saw the importance of his duty, noting: \"We can bring corn from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to Newcastle cheaper than we can convey it between Newcastle and Carlisle\". Armstrong was cautious of a railway system, as a relatively new form of transport, referring to the plan as \"spiritless\". This argument did not meet with agreement on the committee, and the following year, it recommended the construction of the [[Newcastle & Carlisle Railway]], headed by the more radical reformer, James Losh.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=20}} This preference has variously been suggested as evidence of his innate fear of new technology, or his rational preference as a cautious corn merchant, wanting his stock to be carried in more safe and established modes of transport.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}\n\nIn 1831, Armstrong, James Losh, and Donkin attended [[Northumberland]] reform meeting in support of the [[Great Reform Act]] - a wide-ranging democratic act of parliament, which had met with much opposition - and supporting a resolution against the [[House of Lords]], who had most vigorously opposed the act. After the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which reformed the governance of local boroughs, Armstrong was elected as a reformist candidate in the Newcastle town council, an office he attained with a substantial majority against the reactionary, Matthew Anderson. At the council, Armstrong voted in favour of the removal of the furniture and fittings of the Mayor's residence, and the end of the tradition of the Mayor's feasts, held at the public expense. His success didn't sustain in the following, 1839 election, where he was defeated by a landslide by the \"more formidable opponent\", George Palmer, losing his seat 38 votes to 8. With Palmer's retirement, Armstrong returned to the office in 1842, unopposed. In January 1849, upon the vacancy of a seat, he was unanimously elected an alderman of Newcastle. The aldermen were not so harmonious when, a few months later, he was proposed to be made the [[List of mayors of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|mayor of Newcastle]], as the queen was expected to visit the town soon. The better known watercolourist, [[Joseph Crawhall II]] was selected in his stead to preside over the royal visit. By November the following year, Armstrong was elected mayor; he lead a mayoralty described by local historian Richard Welford as \"quiet and uneventful\", in which Armstrong led the \"usual festivities\" and \"presided over the usual number of public meetings\".{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Mayors & Sheriffs}}{{sfn|Welford|1895|p=106-8}}\n\nArmstrong was generally a progressive, but began as a more independent, and sometimes reactionary, politician, remaining a \"timid reformer\" even afterwards, according to Welford. In the [[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832 general election]] he voted for both [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] and [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections of the_1820s|Newcastle MP]] candidates. By the [[1835 United Kingdom general election|1835 election]], he was decidedly in favour of the Whigs. By 1837, he was divided between two candidates - [[Charles John Bigge]] and [[William Ord]] - after which he expressly favoured Whig (or, later, [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]) candidates.{{sfn|Welford|1895|p=108}} One political concern he held, despite his reformist reputation, was against the abolition of the [[Corn Laws]] - a set of taxes on imported food, which kept domestic grain prices high - a reform he spoke out vigorously against in 1845, perhaps out of self interest as a corn merchant.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Welford|1895|p=108}}\n\nWhile a local politician, Armstrong primarily concerned himself with the management of the [[River Tyne]]. Before the 1835 Act, the council had been derided for its neglect of the river, and many hoped the new council would attend to its problems. In his first term as councillor, Armstrong issued a polemical pamphlet of his observations on the river's improvement, and in 1843, promptly took over the local River Committee, upon the previous chairman's death. Despite the many heated debates Armstrong held on it, \"neither he nor the council's appointed engineer had the skills needed to enable a programme of improvement to be pursued with any degree of confidence\", according to [[Stafford M. Linsley]], writing for the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Armstrong's incompetence, as well as the widespread belief that the Committee's funds were being inappropriately used, led to agitation against the Committee, especially from those heavily economically invested in the river, as in [[North Shields|North]] and [[South Shields]]. Armstrong held this position, continuing his demands for reformation, which invariably met with the formidable opposition of the council, until the Tyne Improvement Act of 1850 was passed. This act dismantled the council's authority over the river, instead putting it under the control of a group of commissioners.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Gurney|1901}}{{sfn|Guthrie|1880|p=65}} The bill was put forth to the House of Commons in June 1850, naming Armstrong as one of the life commissioners, but, after complaints from the council, Armstrong's name was substituted for that of William Rutherford Hunter before the bill was presented to the [[House of Lords]].{{sfn|Guthrie|1880|p=89-90}}\n\n==Personal life and death==\n[[File:William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong, aged 21, 1831, National Trust, Cragside.jpg|thumb|William George Armstrong, Armstrong's son and later 1st Baron Armstrong, aged 21]]\nAround 1801, Armstrong married Ann Potter,{{sfn|Linsley|2006}} the eldest daughter of William Potter of Walbottle House, and a \"highly cultured woman\" according to [[Henry Palin Gurney]], writing for the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.{{sfn|Gurney|1901}} They had two children, a daughter and a son. The daughter, Ann, the eldest of the two, married [[William Henry Watson]], a minor politician and judge. The son, William, later to become first [[Baron Armstrong]], was a prominent industrialist, scientist, and inventor. The Armstrong household allowed William to nurture an early mechanical interest, often visiting the [[joiner]] employed by William Potter for lessons in mechanics.{{sfn|Gurney|1901}} The family initially lived in a three-storey terraced house on 9 Pleasant Row, Shieldfield, where his son, William was born, and spent his early childhood, developing a passion for water and fishing. The house no longer exists, but the remaining [[lintel]] refers to the establishment as the 'Armstrong House', and a stone adjacent to Christ Church, Shieldfield, commemorates it. By the 1820s, with Armstrong's trade flourishing, the family moved to a larger, 12 acre establishment in [[Ouseburn Valley]], where Armstrong built a house, known as South Jesmond House.{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=11, 20}}{{sfn|Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery}}\n\nHis financial success in the corn industry allowed Armstrong to pursue several personal interests, including a passion for mathematics. He contributed to the recreational mathematics journals, ''[[The Ladies' Diary]]'' and ''[[Gentleman's Diary]]'', and collected  a large mathematical library. Armstrong joined the recently founded Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society in 1798, \"a warm supporter of the institution and man of scholarly acquirements\" according to a contemporary,{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=20}} and helped found the local Natural History Society. He also provided funds for the establishment of a local [[chamber of commerce]], where he served on the committee.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Gurney|1901}}{{sfn|Welford|1895|p=106}} At the Literary and Philosophical Society, Armstrong became close friends with the local solicitor, Armorer Donkin. \"Their tastes were similar; their political views harmonized; their aims were practically identical, and they became as brothers\" according to local historian, Alfred Cochrane. Donkin remained a family friend and, later in his life, took the younger William as an apprentice.{{sfn|Heald|2011|pp=20-22}}{{sfn|Gurney|1901}}\n\nArmstrong died on 2 June 1857, having given up many of his offices weeks earlier. Armstrong requested that his son, William, leave his large library of mathematical and local tracts to the Literary and Philosophical Society, a wish William fulfilled the following year, with 1284 works added to the society's libraries.{{sfn|Linsley|2006}}{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=79}}{{sfn|Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery}} This allowed the society \"a more complete mathematical department than any other provincial institution in the kingdom\" according to Dr. [[Robert Spence Watson]], Secretary of the Society, 1862\u201393.{{sfn|Gurney|1901}} Armstrong was buried in the local [[Jesmond Old Cemetery]], in the same grave as his wife, who had predeceased him on 8 June 1848, and next to the grave of Armorer Donkin, who had died in 1851. Armstrong and Donkin's graves are, aside from their inscriptions, identical, with the twin low, [[cruciform]], granite structures likely designed by the younger Armstrong.{{sfn|Heald|2011|p=79}}{{sfn|Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |title=William Armstrong (1778-1857) |website=Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery |url=http://www.jesmondoldcemetery.co.uk/armstrong_21.html |ref={{harvid|Friends of Jesmond Old Cemetery}} |access-date=1 January 2020 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Heald |first=Henrietta |date=2011 |title=William Armstrong: Magician of the North |publisher=McNidder and Grace Limited |isbn=978-0-85716-035-5 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=opfKCEOzUY4C |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=James |date=1880 |title=The River Tyne: Its History and Resources |location=London |publisher=Longmans & Co. |url=https://www.electricscotland.com/history/articles/river_tyne.pdf |oclc=1127098438 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite DNB |last=Gurney |first=Henry Palin |author-link=Henry Palin Gurney |wstitle=Armstrong, William George |supplement=1 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite ODNB |last=Linsley |first=Stafford M. |date=2006 |id=668 |title=Armstrong, William (1778\u20131857), corn merchant and local politician |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite web |title=Mayors and Sheriffs 1216 to date |website=Newcastle City Council |url=https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Lord%20Mayors%20and%20Sheriffs%201216%20to%20date.pdf |access-date=30 September 2019 |ref={{harvid|Mayors & Sheriffs}} }}\n* {{cite book |last=Welford |first=Richard |date=1895 |title=Men of Mark 'twixt Tyne and Tweed |chapter=William Armstrong, father of Lord Armstrong |volume=1 |location=London |publisher=Walter Scott, Ltd. |pages=106-108 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/menmarktwixttyn00welfgoog/page/n129 |ref=harv |oclc=54294917 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''On Armstrong'''\n* {{cite book |last=Wallis |first=Peter John |date=1972 |title=Newcastle Mathematical Libraries: William Armstrong, Charles Hutton and others |series=Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne |publisher=University of Durham |oclc=123100890 }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia |title=William Armstrong (1778\u20131857) |encyclopedia=[[International Genealogical Index]] |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of the Latterday Saints }}\n\n'''On Armstrong's son, containing information on Armstrong'''\n* {{cite book |last=McKenzie |first=Peter |date=1983 |title=W.G.
