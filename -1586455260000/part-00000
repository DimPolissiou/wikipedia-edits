The most contemporaneous textual evidence is the [[Chronica Gallica of 452|''Chronica Gallica of 452'']], which records for the year 441: \"The British provinces, which to this time had suffered various defeats and misfortunes, are reduced to Saxon rule.\"<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|Casey|1988|pp= 367\u201398}} \"The Gallic Chronicle Restored: a Chronology for the Anglo-Saxon Invasions and the End of Roman Britain\"</ref> This is an earlier date than that of 451 for the \"coming of the Saxons\" used by [[Bede]] in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]],'' written around 731.

The Saxons went back to \"their eastern home\". Gildas calls the peace a \"grievous divorce with the barbarians\".

The most developed vision of a continuation in sub-Roman Britain, with control over its own political and military destiny for well over a century, is that of Kenneth Dark,<ref>Dark, K., ''Civitas to Kingdom: British Political Continuity 300\u201380'' (London, Leicester University Press, 1994)</ref> who suggests that the sub-Roman elite survived in culture, politics and military power up to c. 570.<ref name=\"Higham, Nick 2004\">Higham, Nick. \"From sub-Roman Britain to Anglo-Saxon England: Debating the Insular Dark Ages.\" ''History Compass'' 2.1 (2004).</ref> However, Higham seems to agree with Bede, who identifies three phases of settlement: an exploration phase, when mercenaries came to protect the resident population; a migration phase, which was substantial as implied by the statement that ''Anglus'' was deserted; and an establishment phase, in which Anglo-Saxons started to control areas, implied in Bede's statement about the origins of the tribes.<ref>Brugmann, B.

Paper circulated in connection with the conference Britons and Saxons, 14\u201316 April.

But even based on a fairly high Anglo-Saxon figure (200,000) and a low Brittonic one (800,000), Brittonic people are likely to have outnumbered Anglo-Saxons by at least four to one. The interpretation of such figures is that while \"culturally, the later Anglo-Saxons and English did emerge as remarkably un-British, . . . their genetic, biological make-up is none the less likely to have been substantially, indeed predominantly, British\".<ref>Ward-Perkins, Bryan. \"Why did the Anglo-Saxons not become more British?.\" ''The English Historical Review'' 115.462 (2000): page 523</ref> The development of Anglo-Saxon culture is described by two processes.

Higham summarizes in this way:{{quote|As Bede later implied, language was a key indicator of ethnicity in early England. In circumstances where freedom at law, acceptance with the kindred, access to patronage, and the use and possession of weapons were all exclusive to those who could claim Germanic descent, then speaking Old English without Latin or Brittonic inflection had considerable value.<ref name=\"Higham, Nicholas J. 2013\" />}}\n[[File:Tribal Hidage Spelman.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Tribal Hidage]], from an edition of [[Henry Spelman]]'s ''Glossarium Archaiologicum'']]\n\nBy the middle of the 6th century, some Brittonic people in the lowlands of Britain had moved across the sea to form [[Brittany]], and some had moved west, but the majority were abandoning their past language and culture and adopting the new culture of the Anglo-Saxons.

However, a [[churl|''ceorl'']], who was the lowest ranking freeman in early Anglo-Saxon society, was not a peasant but an arms-owning male with the support of a kindred, access to law and the ''[[wergild]]''; situated at the apex of an extended household working at least one hide of land.<ref>Higham, Nicholas J.

The [[Bretwalda]] concept is taken as evidence of a number of early Anglo-Saxon elite families.

Kent was probably chosen because \u00c6thelberht had married a Christian princess, [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], daughter of [[Charibert I]] the [[List of Frankish kings|King of Paris]], who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. \u00c6thelberht was converted to Christianity, churches were established, and wider-scale conversion to Christianity began in the kingdom. [[\u00c6thelberht's law]] for Kent, the earliest written code in any [[Germanic language]], instituted a complex system of fines. Kent was rich, with strong trade ties to the continent, and \u00c6thelberht may have instituted royal control over trade.

He had been at the monastery in Iona when Oswald asked to be sent a mission to Christianise the [[Northumbria|Kingdom of Northumbria]] from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. Oswald had probably chosen Iona because after his father had been killed he had fled into south-west Scotland and had encountered Christianity, and had returned determined to make Northumbria Christian. Aidan achieved great success in spreading the Christian faith, and since Aidan could not speak English and Oswald had learned Irish during his exile, Oswald acted as Aidan's interpreter when the latter was preaching.<ref>[[s:Ecclesiastical History of the English People/Book 3|Bede, Book III, chapters 3 and 5.]]</ref> Later, [[Northumberland]]'s patron saint, [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert]], was an [[abbot]] of the monastery, and then [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]].

The development of kingdoms, with a particular king being recognised as an overlord, developed out of an early loose structure that, Higham believes, is linked back to the original ''feodus''.<ref>Higham, Nicholas J.

Mercia was a diverse area of tribal groups, as shown by the Tribal Hidage; the peoples were a mixture of Brittonic speaking peoples and \"Anglo-Saxon\" pioneers and their early leaders had Brittonic names, such as [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]].<ref name=\"Yorke, Barbara p101\">Yorke, Barbara. Kings and kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England. Routledge, 2002: p101</ref> Although Penda does not appear in Bede's list of great overlords, it would appear from what Bede says elsewhere that he was dominant over the southern kingdoms. At the time of the battle of the river Winw\u00e6d, thirty ''duces regii'' (royal generals) fought on his behalf. Although there are many gaps in the evidence, it is clear that the seventh-century Mercian kings were formidable rulers who were able to exercise a wide-ranging overlordship from their [[The Midlands|Midland]] base.\n\nMercian military success was the basis of their power; it succeeded against not only 106 kings and kingdoms by winning set-piece battles,<ref>Yorke, Barbara. Kings and kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England. Routledge, 2002: p103</ref> but by ruthlessly ravaging any area foolish enough to withhold tribute. There are a number of casual references scattered throughout the [[Bede]]'s history to this aspect of Mercian military policy. Penda is found ravaging Northumbria as far north as [[Bamburgh]] and only a miraculous intervention from Aidan prevents the complete destruction of the settlement.<ref>Scharer, Anton. \"The writing of history at King Alfred's court.\" Early Medieval Europe 5.2 (1996): 177\u2013206.</ref> In 676 [[\u00c6thelred of Mercia|\u00c6thelred]] conducted a similar ravaging in Kent and caused such damage in the [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] diocese that two successive bishops gave up their position because of lack of funds.<ref name=\"Yorke, Barbara p.101\" /> In these accounts there is a rare glimpse of the realities of early Anglo-Saxon overlordship and how a widespread overlordship could be established in a relatively short period. By the middle of the 8th century, other kingdoms of southern Britain were also affected by Mercian expansionism. The East Saxons seem to have lost control of London, [[Middlesex]] and [[Hertfordshire]] to \u00c6thelbald, although the East Saxon homelands do not seem to have been affected, and the East Saxon dynasty continued into the ninth century.<ref>Yorke, B A E 1985: 'The kingdom of the East Saxons.'

Because of the plundering raids that followed, the raiders attracted the name [[Viking]] \u2013 from the Old Norse ''v\u00edkingr'' meaning an expedition \u2013 which soon became used for the raiding activity or piracy reported in western Europe.<ref>Sawyer, Peter Hayes, ed. Illustrated history of the Vikings. Oxford University Press, 2001</ref> In 793, Lindisfarne was raided and while this was not the first raid of its type it was the most prominent. In 794, Jarrow, the monastery where Bede wrote, was attacked; in 795 Iona was attacked; and in 804 the nunnery at Lyminge Kent was granted refuge inside the walls of Canterbury. Sometime around 800, a Reeve from Portland in Wessex was killed when he mistook some raiders for ordinary traders.\n\nViking raids continued until in 850, then the ''Chronicle'' says: \"The heathen for the first time remained over the winter\". The fleet does not appear to have stayed long in England, but it started a trend which others subsequently followed. In particular, the army which arrived in 865 remained over many winters, and part of it later settled what became known as the [[Danelaw]]. This was the \"[[Great Heathen Army|Great Army]]\", a term used by the ''Chronicle'' in England and by Adrevald of Fleury on the Continent. The invaders were able to exploit the feuds between and within the various kingdoms and to appoint puppet kings, such as Ceolwulf in Mercia in 873 and perhaps others in Northumbria in 867 and East Anglia in 870.<ref name=\"Whitelock, Dorothy 1965\" /> The third phase was an era of settlement; however, the \"Great Army\" went wherever it could find the richest pickings, crossing the [[English Channel]] when faced with resolute opposition, as in England in 878, or with famine, as on the Continent in 892.<ref name=\"Whitelock, Dorothy 1965\" /> By this stage, the Vikings were assuming ever increasing importance as catalysts of social and political change. They constituted the common enemy, making the English more conscious of a national identity which overrode deeper distinctions; they could be perceived as an instrument of divine punishment for the people's sins, raising awareness of a collective Christian identity; and by 'conquering' the kingdoms of the East Angles, the Northumbrians and the Mercians, they created a vacuum in the leadership of the English people.<ref>Coupland, Simon. \"The Vikings in Francia and Anglo-Saxon England to 911.\" The New Cambridge Medieval History 2 (1995): 190\u2013201.</ref>\n\nDanish settlement continued in Mercia in 877 and East Anglia in 879\u201480 and 896. The rest of the army meanwhile continued to harry and plunder on both sides of the Channel, with new recruits evidently arriving to swell its ranks, for it clearly continued to be a formidable fighting force.<ref name=\"Whitelock, Dorothy 1965\" /> At first, Alfred responded by the offer of repeated tribute payments. However, after a decisive victory at Edington in 878, Alfred offered vigorous opposition. He established a chain of fortresses across the south of England, reorganised the army, \"so that always half its men were at home, and half out on service, except for those men who were to garrison the burhs\",<ref>Anglo-Saxon Chronicel s.a. 893</ref><ref name=\"Whitelock, Dorothy 1965\" /> and in 896 ordered a new type of craft to be built which could oppose the Viking [[longship]]s in shallow coastal waters. When the Vikings returned from the Continent in 892, they found they could no longer roam the country at will, for wherever they went they were opposed by a local army. After four years, the Scandinavians therefore split up, some to settle in Northumbria and East Anglia, the remainder to try their luck again on the Continent.<ref name=\"Whitelock, Dorothy 1965\" />\n\n=== King Alfred and the rebuilding (878\u2013899) ===\n[[File:Alfred Jewel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A royal gift, the [[Alfred Jewel]]]]\nMore important to Alfred than his military and political victories were his religion, his love of learning, and his spread of writing throughout England.

Woodbridge, CT: Twayne Publishers, 1986</ref> One book that was particularly valuable to him was [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great's]] ''Cura Pastoralis'' (Pastoral Care). This is a priest's guide on how to care for people. Alfred took this book as his own guide on how to be a good king to his people; hence, a good king to Alfred increases literacy. Alfred translated this book himself and explains in the preface:\n\n{{quote|...When I had learned it I translated it into English, just as I had understood it, and as I could most meaningfully render it.

However, the major political problem for [[Edmund I|Edmund]] and [[Eadred]], who succeeded \u00c6thelstan, remained the difficulty of subjugating the north.<ref name=\"Dumville, David N 1992\">Dumville, David N. \"Between Alfred the Great and Edgar the Peacemaker: \u00c6thelstan, First King of England.\" Wessex and England from Alfred to Edgar (1992): 141\u2013171.</ref> In 959 [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]] is said to have \"succeeded to the kingdom both in Wessex and in Mercia and in Northumbria, and he was then 16 years old\" (ASC, version 'B', 'C'), and is called \"the Peacemaker\".<ref name=\"Dumville, David N 1992\" /> By the early 970s, after a decade of Edgar's 'peace', it may have seemed that the kingdom of England was indeed made whole. In his formal address to the gathering at Winchester the king urged his bishops, abbots and abbesses \"to be of one mind as regards monastic usage . . . lest differing ways of observing the customs of one Rule and one country should bring their holy conversation into disrepute\".<ref>Regularis concordia Anglicae nationis, ed.

This put all the monks and nuns in England under one set of detailed customs for the first time. In 973, Edgar received a special second, 'imperial coronation' at Bath, and from this point England was ruled by Edgar under the strong influence of Dunstan, Athelwold, and [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]], the Bishop of Worcester.\n\n=== \u00c6thelred and the return of the Scandinavians (978\u20131016) ===\nThe reign of King \u00c6thelred the Unready witnessed the resumption of Viking raids on England, putting the country and its leadership under strains as severe as they were long sustained. Raids began on a relatively small scale in the 980s but became far more serious in the 990s, and brought the people to their knees in 1009\u201312, when a large part of the country was devastated by the army of [[Thorkell the Tall]]. It remained for [[Swein Forkbeard]], king of Denmark, to conquer the kingdom of England in 1013\u201314, and (after \u00c6thelred's restoration) for his son Cnut to achieve the same in 1015\u201316. The tale of these years incorporated in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' must be read in its own right,<ref>ASC, pp. 230\u2013251</ref> and set beside other material which reflects in one way or another on the conduct of government and warfare during \u00c6thelred's reign.<ref>See, e.g., EHD, no. 10 (the poem on the battle of Maldon), nos. 42\u20136 (law-codes), nos. 117\u201329 (charters, etc.), nos.230\u20131 (letters), and no. 240 (Archbishop Wulfstan's Sermo ad Anglos).</ref> It is this evidence which is the basis for Keynes's view that the king lacked the strength, judgement and resolve to give adequate leadership to his people in a time of grave national crisis; who soon found out that he could rely on little but the treachery of his military commanders; and who, throughout his reign, tasted nothing but the ignominy of defeat. The raids exposed tensions and weaknesses which went deep into the fabric of the late Anglo-Saxon state, and it is apparent that events proceeded against a background more complex than the chronicler probably knew. It seems, for example, that the death of Bishop \u00c6thelwold in 984 had precipitated further reaction against certain ecclesiastical interests; that by 993 the king had come to regret the error of his ways, leading to a period when the internal affairs of the kingdom appear to have prospered.<ref>White, Stephen D. \"Timothy Reuter, ed., The New Cambridge Medieval History, 3: C. 900\u2013c. 1024.

The final struggles were complicated by internal dissension, and especially by the treacherous acts of Ealdorman Eadric of Mercia, who opportunistically changed sides to Cnut's party. After the defeat of the English in the [[Battle of Assandun]] in October 1016, Edmund and Cnut agreed to divide the kingdom so that Edmund would rule Wessex and Cnut Mercia, but Edmund died soon after his defeat in November 1016, making it possible for Cnut to seize power over all England.<ref>Keynes, S.

The consequences of each conquest changed the Anglo-Saxon cutlure. Politically and chronologically, the texts of this period are not Anglo-Saxon; linguistically, those written in English (as opposed to Latin or French, the other official written languages of the period) moved away from the late West Saxon standard that is called \"Old English\". Yet neither are they \"Middle English\"; moreover, as Treharne explains, for around three-quarters of this period, \"there is barely any 'original' writing in English at all\". These factors have led to a gap in scholarship, implying a discontinuity either side of the Norman Conquest, however this assumption is being challenged.<ref>Treharne, Elaine. Living Through Conquest: The Politics of Early English, 1020\u20131220. Oxford University Press, 2012.</ref>\n\nAt first sight, there would seem little to debate. Cnut appeared to have adopted wholeheartedly the traditional role of Anglo-Saxon kingship.<ref>[[Robin Fleming]] ''Kings and lords in Conquest England''. Vol. 15. Cambridge University Press, 2004.</ref> However an examination of the laws, homilies, wills, and charters dating from this period suggests that as a result of widespread aristocratic death and the fact that Cnut did not systematically introduce a new landholding class, major and permanent alterations occurred in the Saxon social and political structures.<ref>Mack, Katharin. \"Changing thegns: Cnut's conquest and the English aristocracy.\" ''Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies'' (1984): 375\u2013387.</ref> Eric John remarks that for Cnut \"the simple difficulty of exercising so wide and so unstable an empire made it necessary to practise a delegation of authority against every tradition of English kingship\".<ref>Eric John, ''Orbis Britanniae'' (Leicester, 1966), p. 61.</ref> The disappearance of the aristocratic families which had traditionally played an active role in the governance of the realm, coupled with Cnut's choice of [[thegn]]ly advisors, put an end to the balanced relationship between monarchy and aristocracy so carefully forged by the West Saxon Kings.\n\n[[Edward the Confessor|Edward]] became king in 1042, and given his upbringing might have been considered a Norman by those who lived across the English Channel. Following Cnut's reforms, excessive power was concentrated in the hands of the rival houses of [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric of Mercia]] and [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Godwine of Wessex]]. Problems also came for Edward from the resentment caused by the king's introduction of Norman friends. A crisis arose in 1051 when Godwine defied the king's order to punish the men of Dover, who had resisted an attempt by [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne|Eustace of Boulogne]] to quarter his men on them by force.<ref name=\"Maddicott, J.

Godwine and his sons came back the following year with a strong force, and the magnates were not prepared to engage them in civil war but forced the king to make terms. Some unpopular Normans were driven out, including [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges|Archbishop Robert]], whose archbishopric was given to [[Stigand]]; this act supplied an excuse for the Papal support of William's cause.<ref name=\"Maddicott, J.

In this time, and because of the cultural shock of the Conquest, Anglo-Saxon began to change very rapidly, and by 1200 or so, it was no longer Anglo-Saxon English, but what scholars call early [[Middle English]].<ref>Jack, George B. \"Negative adverbs in early Middle English.\" (1978): 295\u2013309.</ref> But this language had deep roots in Anglo-Saxon, which was being spoken much later than 1066.

There seem to have been over thirty of such units, many of which were certainly controlled by kings, in the parts of Britain which the Anglo-Saxons controlled. Bede's use of the term ''imperium'' has been seen as significant in defining the status and powers of the bretwaldas, in fact it is a word Bede used regularly as an alternative to ''regnum''; scholars believe this just meant the collection of tribute.<ref>Fanning, Steven. \"Bede, Imperium, and the bretwaldas.\" Speculum 66.01 (1991): 1\u201326.</ref> Oswiu's extension of overlordship over the Picts and Scots is expressed in terms of making them tributary.

It attested his grants of land to churches or laymen, consented to his issue of new laws or new statements of ancient custom, and helped him deal with rebels and persons suspected of disaffection.\n\nOnly five Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are known to have survived to 800, and several British kingdoms in the west of the country had disappeared as well. The major kingdoms had grown through absorbing smaller principalities, and the means through which they did it and the character their kingdoms acquired as a result are one of the major themes of the Middle Saxon period. [[Beowulf]], for all its heroic content, clearly makes the point that economic and military success were intimately linked.

According to place name evidence, these sites of worship were known alternately as either ''[[H\u00f6rgr|hearg]]'' or as ''[[V\u00e9 (shrine)|w\u0113oh]]''. Most poems from before the Norman Conquest are steeped in pagan symbolism, and their integration into the new faith goes beyond the literary sources. Thus, as Lethbridge reminds us, \"to say, 'this is a monument erected in Christian times and therefore the symbolism on it must be Christian,' is an unrealistic approach.

Bede writes, \"[t]here was in the Monastery of this Abbess (Streon\u00e6shalch \u2013 now known as [[Whitby Abbey]]) a certain brother particularly remarkable for the Grace of God, who was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of [[Bible|scripture]], he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in Old English, which was his native language. By his verse the minds of many were often excited to despise the world, and to aspire to heaven.\" The story of C\u00e6dmon illustrates the blending of Christian and Germanic, Latin and oral tradition, monasteries and double monasteries, pre-existing customs and new learning, popular and elite, that characterizes the Conversion period of Anglo-Saxon history and culture. C\u00e6dmon does not destroy or ignore traditional Anglo-Saxon poetry. Instead, he converts it into something that helps the Church. Anglo-Saxon England finds ways to synthesize the religion of the Church with the existing \"northern\" customs and practices. Thus the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons was not just their switching from one practice to another, but making something new out of their old inheritance and their new belief and learning.<ref>Frantzen, Allen J., and I.

Hatton 48 fol. 6v-7r.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|An 8th-century copy of the Rule of St. Benedict]]\n[[Christian monasticism|Monasticism]], and not just the church, was at the centre of Anglo-Saxon Christian life. Western monasticism, as a whole, had been evolving since the time of the [[Desert Fathers]], but in the seventh century, monasticism in England confronted a dilemma that brought to question the truest representation of the Christian faith. The two monastic traditions were the Celtic and the Roman, and a decision was made to adopt the Roman tradition. ''Monasteria'' seem to describe all religious congregations other than those of the bishop.\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Dunstan]] brought Athelwold to [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], where the two of them set up a monastery on [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] lines. For many years, this was the only monastery in England that strictly followed the [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine Rule]] and observed complete monastic discipline. What Mechthild Gretsch calls an \"Aldhelm Seminar\" developed at Glastonbury, and the effects of this seminar on the curriculum of learning and study in Anglo-Saxon England were enormous.<ref name=\"Gretsch, Mechthild 2009\" /> Royal power was put behind the reforming impulses of Dunstan and Athelwold, helping them to enforce their reform ideas. This happened first at the Old Minster in [[Winchester]], before the reformers built new foundations and refoundations at Thorney, Peterborough, and Ely, among other places. Benedictine monasticism spread throughout England, and these became centers of learning again, run by people trained in Glastonbury, with one rule, the works of Aldhelm at the center of their curricula but also influenced by the vernacular efforts of Alfred. From this mixture sprung a great flowering of literary production.<ref>Keynes, Simon. \"The 'Dunstan B'charters.\" Anglo-Saxon England 23 (1994): 165\u2013193.</ref>\n\n=== Fighting and warfare ===\nSoldiers throughout the country were summoned, for both offensive and defensive war; early armies consisted essentially of household bands, while later on men were recruited on a territorial basis. The mustering of an army, annually at times, occupied an important place in Frankish history, both military and constitutional. The English kingdoms appear to have known no institution similar to this. The earliest reference is Bede's account of the overthrow of the Northumbrian [[\u00c6thelfrith]] by [[R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia|R\u00e6dwald]] overlord of the southern English. R\u00e6dwald raised a large army, presumably from among the kings who accepted his overlordship, and \"not giving him time to summon and assemble his whole army, R\u00e6dwald met him with a much greater force and slew him on the Mercian border on the east bank of the river Idle.\"<ref>HE. Bede, Ecdesiastical History of the English People, quoted from the ed. by B. Colgrave and R.A.B. Mynors (Oxford, 1969). ii.12</ref> At the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878, when the Danes made a surprise attack on Alfred at Chippenham after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], Alfred retreated to Athelney after Easter and then seven weeks after Easter mustered an army at \"Egbert's stone\".<ref>ASC, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in Whitelock 878, Asser c. 55</ref> It is not difficult to imagine that Alfred sent out word to the ealdormen to call his men to arms. This may explain the delay, and it is probably no more than coincidence that the army mustered at the beginning of May, a time when there would have been sufficient grass for the horses. There is also information about the mustering of fleets in the eleventh century. From 992 to 1066 fleets were assembled at London, or returned to the city at the end of their service, on several occasions. Where they took up station depended on the quarter from which a threat was expected: Sandwich if invasion was expected from the north, or the Isle of Wight if it was from Normandy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hollister, C.W. 1962: Anglo-Saxon Military Institutions (Oxford)</ref>\n\n[[File:2004 sutton hoo 01.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Replica of the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]]]]\nOnce they left home, these armies and fleets had to be supplied with food and clothing for the men as well as forage for the horses. Yet if armies of the seventh and eighth centuries were accompanied by servants and a supply train of lesser free men, Alfred found these arrangements insufficient to defeat the Vikings. One of his reforms was to divide his military resources into thirds. One part manned the burhs and found the permanent garrisons which would make it impossible for the Danes to overrun Wessex, although they would also take to the field when extra soldiers were needed. The remaining two would take it in turns to serve. They were allocated a fixed term of service and brought the necessary provisions with them. This arrangement did not always function well. On one occasion a division on service went home in the middle of blockading a Danish army on Thorney Island; its provisions were consumed and its term had expired before the king came to relieve them.<ref>ASC, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in Whitelock 893; also Asser c. 100 for the Organisation of the royal household</ref> This method of division and rotation remained in force up to 1066. In 917, when armies from Wessex and Mercia were in the field from early April until November, one division went home and another took over. Again, in 1052 when Edward's fleet was waiting at Sandwich to intercept Godwine's return, the ships returned to London to take on new earls and crews.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The importance of supply, vital to military success, was appreciated even if it was taken for granted and features only incidentally in the sources.<ref>Brooks, N.P.1971: The Development of Military Obligations in Eighth-and Ninth-century England, in Clemoes, P. and Hughes, K. (ed.), England Before the Conquest (Cambridge) pp. 69\u201484.</ref>\n\nMilitary training and strategy are two important matters on which the sources are typically silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, and so it is necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance.<ref>Webb, J.F. and Farmer, D.H. 1965: The Age of Bede (Harmondsworth)., pp. 43\u20134</ref> Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence gives the impression that Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on your side. But if you were in a position so advantageous that you were willing to take the chance, it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Battles put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown how few pitched battles [[Charlemagne]] and [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] chose to fight.<ref>Gillingham, J. 1984: Richard I and the Science of War in the Middle Ages, in J. Holt and J. Gillingham (eds.), War and Government in the Middle Ages (Woodbridge).</ref>\n\nA defensive strategy becomes more apparent in the later part of Alfred's reign. It was built around the possession of fortified places and the close pursuit of the Danes to harass them and impede their preferred occupation of plundering. Alfred and his lieutenants were able to fight the Danes to a standstill by their repeated ability to pursue and closely besiege them in fortified camps throughout the country. The fortification of sites at Witham, Buckingham, Towcester and Colchester persuaded the Danes of the surrounding regions to submit.<ref>ASC, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in Whitelock 1979 912, 914, 917</ref> The key to this warfare was sieges and the control of fortified places. It is clear that the new fortresses had permanent garrisons, and that they were supported by the inhabitants of the existing burhs when danger threatened. This is brought out most clearly in the description of the campaigns of 917 in the ''Chronicle'', but throughout the conquest of the Danelaw by Edward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d it is clear that a sophisticated and coordinated strategy was being applied.<ref>Campbell, J. 1981: The Anglo-Saxons (Oxford).</ref>\n\nIn 973, a single currency was introduced into England in order to bring about political unification, but by concentrating bullion production at many coastal mints, the new rulers of England created an obvious target which attracted a new wave of Viking invasions, which came close to breaking up the kingdom of the English. From 980 onwards, the ''Anglo -Saxon Chronicle'' records renewed raiding against England. At first, the raids were probing ventures by small numbers of ships' crews, but soon grew in size and effect, until the only way of dealing with the Vikings appeared to be to pay protection money to buy them off: \"And in that year [991] it was determined that tribute should first be paid to the Danish men because of the great terror they were causing along the coast. The first payment was 10,000 pounds.\"<ref>[[Julian D. Richards|Richards, Julian D.]] (2013-06-01). Viking Age England (Kindle Locations 418\u2013422). The History Press. Kindle Edition.</ref>\nThe payment of Danegeld had to be underwritten by a huge balance of payments surplus; this could only be achieved by stimulating exports and cutting imports, itself accomplished through currency devaluation. This affected everyone in the kingdom.\n\n=== Settlements and working life ===\n[[File:West Stow Anglo-Saxon village 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Panorama of the reconstructed 7th century village]]\nHelena Hamerow suggests that the prevailing model of working life and settlement, particularly for the early period, was one of shifting settlement and building tribal kinship. The mid-Saxon period saw diversification, the development of enclosures, the beginning of the toft system, closer management of livestock, the gradual spread of the mould-board plough, 'informally regular plots' and a greater permanence, with further settlement consolidation thereafter foreshadowing post-Norman Conquest villages. The later periods saw a proliferation of service features including barns, mills and latrines, most markedly on high-status sites. Throughout the Anglo-Saxon period as Hamerow suggests, \"local and extended kin groups remained...the essential unit of production\". This is very noticeable in the early period. However, by the tenth and eleventh centuries, the rise of the manor and its significance in terms of both settlement and the management of land, which becomes very evident in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref name=\"Hamerow, Helena 2012\">Hamerow, Helena. Rural Settlements and Society in Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford University Press, 2012.</ref>\n\nThe collection of buildings discovered at [[Yeavering]] formed part of an Anglo-Saxon [[royal vill]] or king's tun. These 'tun' consisted of a series of buildings designed to provide short-term accommodation for the king and his household. It is thought that the king would have travelled throughout his land dispensing justice and authority and collecting rents from his various estates. Such visits would be periodic, and it is likely that he would visit each royal villa only once or twice per year. The Latin term ''villa regia'' which Bede uses of the site suggests an estate centre as the functional heart of a territory held in the king's demesne. The territory is the land whose surplus production is taken into the centre as food-render to support the king and his retinue on their periodic visits as part of a progress around the kingdom. This territorial model, known as a [[Anglo-Saxon multiple estate|multiple estate]] or [[shire]], has been developed in a range of studies. Colm O'Brien, in applying this to Yeavering, proposes a geographical definition of the wider shire of Yeavering and also a geographical definition of the principal estate whose structures Hope-Taylor excavated.<ref>O'Brien C (2002) The Early Medieval Shires of Yeavering, Bamburgh and Breamish. Archaeologia Aeliana 5th Series, 30, 53\u201373.</ref> One characteristic that the king's tun shared with some other groups of places is that it was a point of public assembly. People came together not only to give the king and his entourage board and lodging; but they attended upon the king in order to have disputes settled, cases appealed, lands granted, gifts given, appointments made, laws promulgated, policy debated, and ambassadors heard. People also assembled for other reasons, such as to hold fairs and to trade.<ref name=\"Sawyer, Peter 2013\">Sawyer, Peter. The Wealth of Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford University Press, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe first creations of towns are linked to a system of specialism at individual settlements, which is evidenced in studying place-names. Sutterton, \"shoe-makers' tun\" (in the area of the Danelaw such places are Sutterby) was so named because local circumstances allowed the growth of a craft recognised by the people of surrounding places. Similarly with Sapperton, the \"soap-makers' tun\". While Boultham, the \"meadow with burdock plants\", may well have developed a specialism in the production of burrs for wool-carding, since meadows with burdock merely growing in them must have been relatively numerous. From places named for their services or location within a single district, a category of which the most obvious perhaps are the Eastons and Westons, it is possible to move outwards to glimpse component settlements within larger economic units. Names betray some role within a system of seasonal pasture, Winderton in Warwickshire is the winter tun and various Somertons are self-explanatory. Hardwicks are dairy farms and Swinhopes the valleys where pigs were pastured.<ref>Higham, Nicholas J., and Martin J. Ryan, eds. Place-names, Language and the Anglo-Saxon Landscape. Vol. 10. Boydell Press, 2011.</ref>\n\nSettlement patterns as well as village plans in England fall into two great categories: scattered farms and homesteads in upland and woodland Britain, nucleated villages across a swathe of central England.<ref>Pickles, Thomas. \"The Landscape Archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England, ed. Nicholas J. Higham and Martin J. Ryan.\" The English Historical Review 127.528 (2012): 1184\u20131186.</ref> The chronology of nucleated villages is much debated and not yet clear. Yet there is strong evidence to support the view that nucleation occurred in the tenth century or perhaps the ninth, and was a development parallel to the growth of towns.<ref>Hamerow, Helena, David A. Hinton, and Sally Crawford, eds. The Oxford Handbook of Anglo-Saxon Archaeology. OUP Oxford, 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Women, children and slaves ===\nAlfred's view of his society overlooks certain classes of people. The main division in Anglo-Saxon society was between slave and free. Both groups were hierarchically structured, with several classes of freemen and many types of slaves. These varied at different times and in different areas, but the most prominent ranks within free society were the king, the nobleman or thegn, and the ordinary freeman or ceorl. They were differentiated primarily by the value of their [[weregild]] or 'man price', which was not only the amount payable in compensation for homicide, but was also used as the basis for other legal formulations such as the value of the oath that they could swear in a court of law. Slaves had no weregild, as offences against them were taken to be offences against their owners, but the earliest laws set out a detailed scale of penalties depending both on the type of slave and the rank of owner.<ref>Anglo-Saxon Dictionary edited by Joseph Bosworth, T. Northcote Toller and Alistair Campbell (1972), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-863101-4}}.</ref>\n\nA certain amount of social mobility is implied by regulations detailing the conditions under which a ceorl could become a thegn. Again these would have been subject to local variation, but one text refers to the possession of five hides of land (around 600 acres), a bell and a castle-gate, a seat and a special office in the king's hall. In the context of the control of [[Ancient borough|boroughs]], [[Frank Stenton]] notes that according to an 11th-century source, \"a merchant who had carried out three voyages at his own charge [had also been] regarded as of thegnly status.\"{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=530}}<!-- Annoyingly Stenton refers only to \"a well-known English tract\": it's \"Ge\u00feync\u00f0o\", q.v. --> Loss of status could also occur, as with penal slavery, which could be imposed not only on the perpetrator of a crime but on his wife and family. Some slaves may have been members of the native British population conquered by the Anglo-Saxons when they arrived from the continent; others may have been captured in wars between the early kingdoms, or have sold themselves for food in times of famine. However, slavery was not always permanent, and slaves who had gained their freedom would become part of an underclass of freedmen below the rank of ceorl.<ref>Stenton, F. M. \"The Thriving of the Anglo-Saxon Ceorl.\" Preparatory to Anglo-Saxon England (1970): 383\u201393.</ref>\n\nAnglo-Saxon women appear to have enjoyed considerable independence, whether as abbesses of the great 'double monasteries' of monks and nuns founded during the seventh and eighth centuries, as major land-holders recorded in Domesday Book (1086), or as ordinary members of society. They could act as principals in legal transactions, were entitled to the same weregild as men of the same class, and were considered 'oath-worthy', with the right to defend themselves on oath against false accusations or claims. Sexual and other offences against them were penalised heavily. There is evidence that even married women could own property independently, and some surviving wills are in the joint names of husband and wife.<ref>Klinck, A. L., 'Anglo-Saxon women and the law', Journal of Medieval History 8 (1982), 107\u201321.</ref> Marriage comprised a contract between the woman's family and the prospective bridegroom, who was required to pay a 'bride-price' in advance of the wedding and a 'morning gift' following its consummation. The latter became the woman's personal property, but the former may have been paid to her relatives, at least during the early period. Widows were in a particularly favourable position, with inheritance rights, custody of their children and authority over dependents. However, a degree of vulnerability may be reflected in laws stating that they should not be forced into nunneries or second marriages against their will. The system of [[primogeniture]] (inheritance by the first-born male) was not introduced to England until after the Norman Conquest, so Anglo-Saxon siblings \u2013 girls as well as boys \u2013 were more equal in terms of status. The age of majority was usually either ten or twelve, when a child could legally take charge of inherited property, or be held responsible for a crime.<ref>Rivers, T. J., 'Widows' rights in Anglo-Saxon law', American Journal of Legal History 19 (1975), 208\u201315.</ref> It was common for children to be fostered, either in other households or in monasteries, perhaps as a means of extending the circle of protection beyond the kin group. Laws also make provision for orphaned children and foundlings.<ref>Fell, C., Women in Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford, 1984).</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon architecture}}\n[[File:Saxon palace at Cheddar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Reconstruction of the Anglo-Saxon royal palace at Cheddar around 1000]]\nEarly Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, not using masonry except in foundations but constructed mainly using timber with [[thatch]] roofing. Generally preferring not to settle within the old Roman cities, the Anglo-Saxons built small towns near their centres of agriculture, at fords in rivers, or near natural ports. In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth.<ref>[[History of York|York]] and [[History of London|London]] both offer examples of this trend.</ref>\n\nOnly ten of the hundreds of settlement sites that have been excavated in England from this period have revealed masonry domestic structures and confined to a few specific contexts.  Timber was the natural building medium of the age:<ref>Turner, H. L. (1970), Town Defences in England and Wales: An Architectural and Documentary Study A. D. 900\u20131500 (London: John Baker)</ref> the Anglo\u2013Saxon word for \"building\" is ''timbe''. Unlike in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] world, late Anglo\u2013Saxon royal halls continued to be of timber in the manner of [[Yeavering]] centuries before, even though the king could clearly have mustered the resources to build in stone.<ref>Higham, R. and Barker, P. (1992), Timber Castles (London: B. T. Batsford):193</ref> Their preference must have been a conscious choice, perhaps an expression of deeply\u2013embedded Germanic identity on the part of the Anglo\u2013Saxon royalty.\n\nEven the elite had simple buildings, with a central fire and a hole in the roof to let the smoke escape; the largest homes rarely had more than one floor and one room. Buildings varied widely in size, most were square or rectangular, though some round houses have been found. Frequently these buildings have sunken floors, with a shallow pit over which a plank floor was suspended. The pit may have been used for storage, but more likely was filled with straw for insulation. A variation on the sunken floor design has been found in towns, where the \"basement\" may be as deep as 9 feet, suggesting a storage or work area below a suspended floor. Another common design was simple post framing, with heavy posts set directly into the ground, supporting the roof. The space between the posts was filled in with wattle and daub, or occasionally, planks. The floors were generally packed earth, though planks were sometimes used. Roofing materials varied, with thatch being the most common, though turf and even wooden shingles were also used.<ref name=\"Hamerow, Helena 2012\" />\n[[File:EarlsBartonChurch.JPG|thumb|left|Distinctive Anglo-Saxon pilaster strips on the tower of [[All Saints' Church, Earls Barton]]]]\n\nStone was sometimes used to build churches. Bede makes it clear that the masonry construction of churches, including his own at Jarrow, was undertaken ''morem Romanorum'', 'in the manner of the Romans,' in explicit contrast to existing traditions of timber construction. Even at Canterbury, Bede believed that St Augustine's first cathedral had been 'repaired' or 'recovered' (''recuperavit'') from an existing Roman church, when in fact it had been newly constructed from Roman materials. The belief was \"the Christian Church was Roman therefore a masonry church was a Roman building\".\n\nThe building of churches in Anglo-Saxon England essentially began with [[Augustine of Canterbury]] in Kent following 597; for this he probably imported workmen from [[Francia|Frankish Gaul]]. The [[Canterbury Cathedral|cathedral and abbey in Canterbury]], together with churches in Kent at [[Minster, Swale|Minster in Sheppey]] (c.664) and [[St Mary's Church, Reculver|Reculver]] (669), and in Essex at the [[Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall]] at [[Bradwell-on-Sea]], define the earliest type in southeast England. A simple nave without aisles provided the setting for the main altar; east of this a chancel arch separated the apse for use by the clergy. Flanking the apse and east end of the nave were side chambers serving as sacristies; further [[porticus]] might continue along the nave to provide for burials and other purposes. In Northumbria the early development of Christianity was influenced by the Irish mission, important churches being built in timber. Masonry churches became prominent from the late 7th century with the foundations of [[Wilfrid]] at [[Ripon]] and [[Hexham]], and of [[Benedict Biscop]] at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow. These buildings had long naves and small rectangular chancels; porticus sometimes surrounded the naves. Elaborate crypts are a feature of Wilfrid's buildings. The best preserved early Northumbrian church is [[Escomb Church]].<ref name=\"Wilkinson, David John 1964\">Wilkinson, David John, and Alan McWhirr.

One group comprises the first known churches utilizing aisles: [[All Saints' Church, Brixworth|Brixworth]], the most ambitious Anglo-Saxon church to survive largely intact; [[Lady St. Mary Church, Wareham|Wareham St Mary's]]; Cirencester; and the rebuilding of [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. These buildings may be compared with churches in the [[Carolingian Empire]]. Other lesser churches may be dated to the late eighth and early ninth centuries on the basis of their elaborate sculptured decoration and have simple naves with side porticus.<ref>Whitehead, Matthew Alexander, and J.

In plan, however, the churches remained essentially conservative.\n\nFrom the monastic revival of the second half of the tenth century, only a few documented buildings survive or have been excavated. Examples include the abbeys of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]]; [[Old Minster, Winchester]]; [[Romsey Abbey|Romsey]]; [[Cholsey Abbey|Cholsey]]; and [[Peterborough Cathedral]]. The majority of churches that have been described as Anglo-Saxon fall into the period between the late 10th century and the early 12th century. During this period, many settlements were first provided with stone churches, but timber also continued to be used; the best wood-framed church to survive is [[Greensted Church]] in Essex, no earlier than the 9th century, and no doubt typical of many parish churches. On the continent during the eleventh century, a group of interrelated [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] styles developed, associated with the rebuilding of many churches on a grand scale, made possible by a general advance in architectural technology and mason-craft.<ref name=\"Wilkinson, David John 1964\" />\n\nThe first fully Romanesque church in England was Edward the Confessor's rebuilding of Westminster Abbey (c.1042-60, now entirely lost to later construction), while the main development of the style only followed the Norman Conquest. However, at [[Stow Minster]] the crossing piers of the early 1050s are clearly proto-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. A more decorative interpretation of Romanesque in lesser churches can be dated only somewhere between the mid and late 11th century, e.g. [[Hadstock]] (Essex), [[Clayton, West Sussex|Clayton]] and [[Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting|Sompting]] (Sussex); this style continued towards the end of the century as at Milborne Port (Somerset). At St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury (c.1048\u201361) Abbot Wulfric aimed to retain the earlier churches while linking them with an octagonal rotunda, but the concept was still essentially [[Pre-Romanesque architecture|Pre-Romanesque]]. Anglo-Saxon churches of all periods would have been embellished with a range of arts,<ref>Conant, Kenneth John. Carolingian and Romanesque architecture, 800 to 1200. Vol. 13.

Characteristic of the 5th century is the [[Quoit (brooch)|quoit brooch]] with motifs based on crouching animals, as seen on the silver quoit brooch from [[Sarre, Kent]]. While the origins of this style are disputed, it is either an offshoot of provincial Roman art, Frank, or Jute art. One style flourished from the late 5th century, and continued throughout the 6th, and is on many square-headed brooches, it is characterised by [[chip carving|chip-carved]] patterns based on animals and masks. A different style, which gradually superseded it is dominated by serpentine beasts with interlacing bodies.<ref>Suzuki, Seiichi.

The possible symbolism of the decorative elements like [[interlace (art)|interlace]] and beast forms that were used in these early works remains unclear, it is clear. These objects were the products of a society that invested its modest surpluses in personal display, who fostered craftsmen and jewellers of a high standard, and a society where the possession of a fine brooch or buckle was a valuable status symbol and possible tribal emblem \u2013 in death as much as in life.<ref name=\"Richards, Julian D 1992\">[[Julian D.

It also shows that, superb though individual pieces may be in terms of craftsmanship, the value of such items as currency and their potential roles as tribute or the spoils of war could, in a warrior society, outweigh appreciation of their integrity and artistry.<ref name=\"Sawyer, Peter 2013\" />\n\nThe coming of Christianity revolutionised the visual arts, as well as other aspects of society. Art had to fulfil new functions, and whereas pagan art was abstract, Christianity required images clearly representing subjects. The transition between the Christian and pagan traditions is occasionally apparent in 7th century works; examples include the Crundale buckle<ref name=\"Adams, No\u00ebl 2010\" /> and the Canterbury pendant.<ref>Mills, Allan A. \"The Canterbury Pendant: A Saxon Seasonal-Hour Altitude Dial.\" PI Drinkwater:'Comments upon the Canterbury Pendant', and AJ Turner:'The Canterbury Dial', Bull BSS 95.2 (1995): 95.</ref> In addition to fostering metalworking skills, Christianity stimulated stone sculpture and [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]]. In these Germanic motifs, such as interlace and animal ornament along with Celtic spiral patterns, are juxtaposed with Christian imagery and Mediterranean decoration, notably vine-scroll. The [[Ruthwell Cross]], [[Bewcastle Cross]] and [[Easby Cross]] are leading Northumbrian examples of the Anglo-Saxon version of the Celtic [[high cross]], generally with a slimmer shaft.\n\nThe jamb of the doorway at [[Monkwearmouth]], carved with a pair of [[lacertine]] beasts, probably dates from the 680s; the golden, garnet-adorned pectoral cross of St [[Cuthbert]] was presumably made before 687; while [[St Cuthbert's coffin|his wooden inner coffin]] (incised with Christ and the [[Evangelists' symbols]], the Virgin and Child, archangels and apostles), the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], and the [[Codex Amiatinus]] all date from c.700. The fact that these works are all from Northumbria might be held to reflect the particular strength of the church in that kingdom during the second half of the century.<ref>[[Leslie Webster (art historian)|Leslie Webster]], [[Janet Backhouse]], and Marion Archibald.

Some fine decorated southern books, above all the Bible fragment<!-- which? Something missing here -->, can be securely assigned to the earlier 9th century, owing to the similarity of their script to that of charters from that period; The [[Book of Cerne]] is an early 9th century Insular or [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Latin]] personal prayer book with [[Old English]] components. This manuscript was decorated and embellished with four painted full-page miniatures, major and minor letters, continuing panels, and litterae notibiliores.<ref>Brown 1996, pp. 70, 73.</ref> Further decorated motifs used in these manuscripts, such as hunched, triangular beasts, also appear on objects from the [[Trewhiddle]] hoard (buried in the 870s) and on the rings which bear the names of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex|\u00c6thelwulf]] and Queen [[\u00c6thelswith]], which are the centre of a small corpus of fine ninth-century metalwork.\n\nThere was demonstrable continuity in the south, even though the Danish settlement represented a watershed in England's artistic tradition. Wars and pillaging removed or destroyed much Anglo-Saxon art, while the settlement introduced new Scandinavian craftsmen and patrons. The result was to accentuate the pre-existing distinction between the art of the north and that of the south.<ref>Reynolds, Andrew, and [[Leslie Webster (art historian)|Webster, Leslie]]. \"Early Medieval Art and Archaeology in the Northern World.\" (2013).</ref> In the 10th and 11th centuries, the Viking dominated areas were characterised by stone sculpture in which the Anglo-Saxon tradition of cross shafts took on new forms, and a distinctive Anglo-Scandinavian monument, the 'hogback' tomb, was produced.<ref>O'Sullivan, Deirdre. \"Normanising the North: The Evidence of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Scandinavian Sculpture.\" Medieval Archaeology 55.1 (2011): 163\u2013191.</ref> The decorative motifs used on these northern carvings (as on items of personal adornment or everyday use) echo Scandinavian styles. The [[#King Alfred and the rebuilding (878-899)|Wessexan hegemony]] and the [[#Reform and formation of England (899-978)|monastic reform movement]] appear to have been the catalysts for the rebirth of art in southern England from the end of the 9th century. Here artists responded primarily to continental art; foliage supplanting interlace as the preferred decorative motif. Key early works are the [[Alfred Jewel]], which has fleshy leaves engraved on the back plate; and the stole and maniples of Bishop [[Frithestan]] of Winchester, which are ornamented with [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves, alongside figures that bear the stamp of [[Byzantine art]]. The surviving evidence points to Winchester and Canterbury as the leading centres of manuscript art in the second half of the 10th century: they developed colourful paintings with lavish foliate borders, and coloured line drawings.\n\nBy the early 11th century, these two traditions had fused and had spread to other centres. Although manuscripts dominate the corpus, sufficient architectural sculpture, [[ivory carving]] and metalwork survives to show that the same styles were current in secular art, and became widespread in the south at parochial level. The wealth of England in the later tenth and eleventh century is clearly reflected in the lavish use of gold in manuscript art as well as for vessels, textiles and statues (now known only from descriptions). Widely admired, southern English art was highly influential in Normandy, France and [[Flanders]] from c.1000.<ref>[[Janet Backhouse]], Derek Howard Turner, and [[Leslie Webster (art historian)|Leslie Webster]], eds.

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]], probably designed by a Canterbury artist for Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], is arguably the swansong of Anglo-Saxon art. Surveying nearly 600 years of continuous change, three common strands stand out: lavish colour and rich materials; an interplay between abstract ornament and representational subject matter; and a fusion of art styles reflecting English links to other parts of Europe.<ref>Grape, Wolfgang.

Old English is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] closely related to [[Old Frisian]] and [[Old Saxon]]. It had a grammar similar in many ways to [[Classical Latin]]. In most respects, including its grammar, it was much closer to modern [[German language|German]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] than to modern English. It was fully [[inflection|inflected]] with five [[grammatical case]]s ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], and [[instrumental case|instrumental]]), three [[grammatical number]]s ([[wikt:singular|singular]], [[plural]], and [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]]) and three [[grammatical gender]]s ([[masculine]], [[feminine]], and [[neuter gender|neuter]]). The dual forms occurred in the first and second persons only and referred to groups of two.\n\nSome of the characteristics of the language were: adjectives, pronouns and (sometimes) participles that agreed with their antecedent nouns in case, number and gender; finite verbs that agreed with their subject in person and number; and [[noun]]s that came in numerous [[declension]]s (with deep parallels in [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]]). [[Verb]]s came in nine main [[Conjugation (grammar)|conjugations]] (seven ''strong'' and two ''weak''), each with numerous subtypes, as well as a few additional smaller conjugations and a handful of irregular verbs. The main difference from other ancient Indo-European languages, such as [[Latin]], is that verbs can be conjugated in only two tenses (vs. the six \"tenses\"&nbsp;\u2013 really tense/aspect combinations&nbsp;\u2013 of Latin), and have no synthetic passive voice (although it did still exist in [[Gothic language|Gothic]]). Gender in [[noun]]s was [[grammatical gender|grammatical]], as opposed to the [[natural gender]] that prevails in modern English.\n\nMany linguists believe that Old English received little influence from the local insular languages, especially [[Common Brittonic]] (the language that may have been the majority language in Lowland Britain, although it's also possible that [[British Latin]] had already replaced it in this region). Linguists such as [[Richard Coates]] have suggested there could not have been meaningful contact between the languages, which is reasonable argued from the small amount of [[loanword]]s. Recently a number of linguists have argued that many of the grammar changes observed in English were due to a Brittonic influence (see [[Brittonicisms in English]]). [[John McWhorter]] suggests that the language changes seen later in English were always there in vernacular speech and this was not written, especially since those who did the writing were educated individuals that most likely spoke a standard form of Old English. The speech of an illiterate ''[[Churl|ceorl]]'', on the other hand, can not be reconstructed.<ref>McWhorter, John. 2008. Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue: the Untold Story of English. New York: Penguin Group.</ref> The progressive nature of this language acquisition, and the \"retrospective reworking\" of kinship ties to the dominant group led, ultimately, to the \"myths which tied the entire society to immigration as an explanation of their origins in Britain\".<ref>Higham, N. 1992. ''Rome, Britain and the Anglo-Saxons''. Guildford: Seaby p229-230</ref>\n\nWhat survives through writing represents primarily the register of Anglo-Saxon, and this is most often in the [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon dialect]]. Little is known about the everyday spoken language of people living in the migration period. Old English is a [[Language contact|contact language]] and it is hard to reconstruct the [[pidgin]] used in this period from the written language found in the West Saxon literature of some 400 years later. Two general theories are proposed regarding why people changed their language to Old English (or an early form of such): either, a person or household changed so as to serve an elite; or, a person or household changed through choice as it provided some advantage economically or legally.<ref>Killie, Kristin. \"Old English\u2013Late British language contact and the English progressive.\" Language Contact and Development Around the North Sea 321 (2012): p119</ref> Over time, Old English developed into four major dialects: Northumbrian, spoken north of the river Humber; Mercian, spoken in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]]; Kentish, spoken in [[Kent]] in the far southeastern part of the island; and West Saxon, spoken in the southwest. All of these dialects have direct descendants in modern England, and [[American English#Regional differences|American regional dialects]] also have their roots in the dialects of Old English. \"Standard\" Modern English (if there is such a thing), or at least modern English spelling, owes most to the Anglian dialect, since that was the dialect of London.<ref>Kemola, Juhani. 2000 \"The Origins of the Northern Subject Rule \u2013 A Case of Early contact?\"</ref>\n\nNear the end of the Old English period the English language underwent a third foreign influence, namely the Scandinavian influence of [[Old Norse]]. In addition to a great many [[toponym|place names]], these consist mainly of items of basic vocabulary, and words concerned with particular administrative aspects of the [[Danelaw]] (that is, the area of land under Viking control, which included extensive holdings all along the eastern coast of England and [[Scotland]]). The Scandinavians spoke [[Old Norse]], a language related to Old English in that both derived from the same ancestral [[Proto-Germanic language]]. It is very common for the intermixing of speakers of different dialects, such as those that occur during times of political unrest, to result in a [[mixed language]], and one theory holds that exactly such a mixture of Old Norse and Old English is thought to have accelerated the decline of case endings in Old English.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Charles|title=The English Language: A Historical Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-67001-2|page=137}}</ref> The [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|influence of Old Norse on the lexicon of the English language]] has been profound: responsible for such basic vocabulary items as ''[[wikt:sky|sky]]'', ''[[wikt:leg|leg]]'', the [[pronoun]] ''[[wikt:they|they]]'' and hundreds of other words.<ref name=\"Shay2008\">{{cite book|author =Scott Shay|title=The history of English: a linguistic introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1vj0-f_U1SQC&pg=PA86|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=30 January 2008|publisher=Wardja Press|isbn=978-0-615-16817-3|page=86}}</ref>\n\nNick Higham <!-- NB! Not the mathematician! Do not link to [[Nicholas Higham]]--> has provided a summary of the importance of language to the Anglo-Saxon culture:\n{{quote|As Bede later implied, language was a key indicator of ethnicity in early England. In circumstances where freedom at law, acceptance with the kindred, access to patronage, and the use of possession of weapons were all exclusive to those who could claim Germanic descent, then speaking Old English without Latin or Brittonic inflection had considerable value.<ref name=\"Higham, Nicholas J. 2013\" />}}\n\n=== Kinship ===\n[[Helena Hamerow]] has made an observation that in Anglo-Saxon society \"local and extended kin groups remained...the essential unit of production throughout the Anglo-Saxon period\". \"Local and extended kin groups\" was a key aspect of Anglo-Saxon culture. Kinship fueled societal advantages, freedom and the relationships to an elite, that allowed the Anglo-Saxons' culture and language to flourish.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. Rural Settlements and Society in Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford University Press, 2012.p166</ref>\n\nThe ties of loyalty to a lord, were to the person of a lord, not to his station; there was no real concept of patriotism or loyalty to a cause. This explains why dynasties waxed and waned so quickly, a kingdom was only as strong as its leader-king. There was no underlying administration or bureaucracy to maintain any gains beyond the lifetime of a leader. An example of this was the leadership of [[R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia]] and how the East Anglian primacy did not survive his death.<ref>Fisher, Genevieve. \"Kingdom and community in early Anglo-Saxon eastern England.\" Regional approaches to mortuary analysis. Springer US, 1995. 147\u2013166.</ref> Kings could not, except in exceptional circumstances, make new laws. Their role instead was to uphold and clarify previous custom and to assure his subjects that he would uphold their ancient privileges, laws, and customs. Although the person of the king as a leader could be exalted, the office of kingship was not in any sense as powerful or as invested with authority as it was to become. One of the tools kings used was to tie themselves closely to the new Christian church; through the practice of having a church leader anoint and crown the king; God and king were joined in peoples' minds.<ref>Lynch, Joseph H. Christianizing kinship: ritual sponsorship in Anglo-Saxon England. Cornell University Press, 1998</ref>\n\nThe ties of kinship meant that the relatives of a murdered person were obliged to exact vengeance for his or her death. This led to bloody and extensive feuds. As a way out of this deadly and futile custom the system of 'wergilds' was instituted. The 'wergild' set a monetary value on each person's life according to their wealth and social status. This value could also be used to set the fine payable if a person was injured or offended against. Robbing a thane called for a higher penalty than robbing a ceorl. On the other hand, a thane who thieved could pay a higher fine than a ceorl who did likewise. Men were willing to die for the lord and to support their 'comitatus'; their warrior band. Evidence of this behavior (though it may be more a literary ideal than an actual social practice), can be observed in the story, made famous in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' entry for 755, of Cynewulf and Cyneheard, in which the followers of a defeated king decided to fight to the death rather than be reconciled after the death of their lord.<ref>Hough, C. \"Wergild.\" (1999): 469\u2013470.</ref>\n\nThis emphasis on social standing affected all parts of the Anglo-Saxon world. The courts, for example did not attempt to discover the facts in a case; instead, in any dispute it was up to each party to get as many people as possible to swear to the rightness of their case; \"oath-swearing\". The word of a thane counted for that of six ceorls.<ref>Harrison, Mark. Anglo-Saxon Thegn AD 449\u20131066. Vol. 5. Osprey Publishing, 1993</ref> It was assumed that any person of good character would be able to find enough people to swear to his innocence that his case would prosper. Anglo-Saxon society was also decidedly patriarchal, but women were in some ways better off than they would be in later times. A woman could own property in her own right. She could and did rule a kingdom if her husband died. She could not be married without her consent and any personal goods, including lands, that she brought into a marriage remained her own property. If she were injured or abused in her marriage her relatives were expected to look after her interests.<ref>Fell, Christine E., Cecily Clark, and Elizabeth Williams. Women in Anglo-Saxon England.

The early Anglo-Saxons were organised in various small kingdoms often corresponding to later shires or counties. The kings of these small kingdoms issued written Laws, one of earliest of which is that attributed to Ethelbert, king of Kent, ca.560\u2013616.<ref>Simpson, A.W.B. 'The Laws of Ethelbert' in Arnold et al. (1981) 3.</ref> The Anglo-Saxon law codes follow a pattern found in continental Europe where other groups of the former Roman empire encountered government dependent upon written sources of law and hastened to display the claims of their own native traditions by reducing them to writing. These legal systems should not be thought of as operating like modern legislation, rather they are educational and political tools designed to demonstrate standards of good conduct rather than act as criteria for subsequent legal judgment.<ref>Baker, J.H. An Introduction to English Legal History. (London: Butterworths, 1990) 3rd edition, {{ISBN|0-406-53101-3}}, Chapters 1\u20132.</ref>\n\nAlthough not themselves sources of law, Anglo-Saxon charters are a most valuable historical source for tracing the actual legal practices of the various Anglo-Saxon communities. A charter was a written document from a king or other authority confirming a grant either of land or some other valuable right. Their prevalence in the Anglo-Saxon state is a sign of sophistication. They were frequently appealed to and relied upon in litigation. Making grants and confirming those made by others was a major way in which Anglo-Saxon kings demonstrated their authority.<ref>Milsom, S.F.C. Historical Foundations of the Common Law.

The main feature of the system was its high degree of decentralisation. The interference by the king through his granting of charters and the activity of his witan in litigation are exceptions rather than the rule in Anglo-Saxon times.<ref>Robertson, Agnes Jane, ed. Anglo-Saxon Charters. Vol. 1. Cambridge University Press, 2009.</ref> The most important court in the later Anglo-Saxon period was the Shire Court. It is of interest that many shires (such as Kent and Sussex) were in the early days of the Anglo-Saxon settlement the centre of small independent kingdoms. As the kings first of Mercia and then of Wessex slowly extended their authority over the whole of England they left the Shire Courts with overall responsibility for the administration of law.<ref>Milsom, S.F.C. Historical Foundations of the Common Law. (London: Butterworths, 1981) 2nd edition, {{ISBN|0-406-62503-4}} (limp), 1\u201323</ref> The Shire met in one or more traditional places, earlier in the open air and then later in a Moot or meeting hall. The meeting of the Shire Court was presided over by an officer, the shire reeve or sheriff, whose appointment came in later Anglo-Saxon times into the hands of the king but had in earlier times been elective. The sheriff was not the judge of the court, merely its president. The judges of the court were all those who had the right and duty of attending the court, the suitors. These were originally all free male inhabitants of the neighbourhood but, over time, suit of court became an obligation attached to particular holdings of land. The sessions of a Shire Court resembled more closely those of a modern local administrative body than a modern court. It could and did act judicially but this was not its prime function. In the Shire Court, charters and writs would be read out for all to hear.<ref>Pollock, F. and Maitland, F.M. A History of English Law. Two volumes.

These were original groups of families rather than geographical areas. The Hundred Court was a smaller version of the shire, presided over by the hundred bailiff, formerly a sheriff's appointment, but over the years many hundreds fell into the private hands of a local large landowner. We are not well-informed about Hundred Court business, which must have been a mix of the administrative and judicial, but they remained in some areas an important forum for the settlement of local disputes well into the post-Conquest period.<ref>Reynolds, Andrew. \"Judicial culture and social complexity: a general model from Anglo-Saxon England.\" World Archaeology ahead-of-print (2014): 1\u201315.</ref> The Anglo-Saxon system put an emphasis upon compromise and arbitration: litigating parties were enjoined to settle their differences if at all possible. If they persisted in bringing a case for decision before a Shire Court then it could be determined there. The suitors of the court would pronounce a judgment which fixed how the case would be decided: legal problems were considered to be too complex and difficult for mere human decision and so proof or demonstration of the right would depend upon some irrational, non-human criterion. The normal methods of proof were oath-helping or the ordeal.<ref name=\"Hyams, P 1981\">Hyams, P. 'Trial by ordeal: the key to proof in the early common law' in Arnold, M.S. et al.. (eds) On the Laws and Customs of England: Essays in honor of S.E. Thorne. (Harvard: Harvard University Press, 1981) {{ISBN|0-8078-1434-2}}, p. 90.</ref>\n\nOath-helping involved the party undergoing proof swearing to the truth of his claim or denial and having that oath reinforced by five or more others, chosen either by the party or by the court. The numbers of helpers required and the form of their oath differed from place to place and upon the nature of the dispute.<ref>Leeson, Peter T. \"Ordeals.\" Journal of Law and Economics 55.3 (2012): 691\u2013714.</ref> If either the party or any of the helpers failed in the oath, either refusing to take it or sometimes even making an error in the required formula, the proof failed and the case was adjudged to the other side. It appears surprising to moderns that so important a matter might be settled by one and his friends falsely swearing an oath. In a society in which each was known to his neighbour and in which religious emphasis was placed upon the sanctity of an oath, the system was probably more satisfactory. As 'wager of law' it remained a way of determining cases in the common law until its abolition in the 19th century.<ref>Higham, Nicholas, and Martin J. Ryan. The Anglo-Saxon World. Yale University Press, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe ordeal offered an alternative for those unable or unwilling to swear an oath. The two most common methods were the ordeal by hot iron and by cold water. The former consisted in carrying a red-hot iron for five paces: the wound was immediately bound up and if, on unbinding, it was found to be festering the case was lost. In the ordeal by water the victim, usually an accused person, was cast bound into water: if he sunk he was innocent, if he floated, guilty. Although for perhaps understandable reasons the ordeals became associated with trials in criminal matters they were in essence tests of the truth of a claim or denial of a party and appropriate for trying any\nlegal issue. The allocation of a mode of proof and who should bear it was the substance of the Shire Court's judgment or doom and perhaps followed known customary rules of which we have no knowledge. Some measure of discretion must have existed in the determining of the outcome of an ordeal by hot iron but result of the cold water and the oath-helping would have been obvious to all.<ref name=\"Hyams, P 1981\" />\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon literature}}\n[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|First page of the epic ''[[Beowulf]]'']]\nOld English literary works include genres such as [[epic poem|epic poetry]], [[hagiography]], [[sermon]]s, [[Old English Bible translations|Bible translations]], legal works, [[chronicle]]s, mainly the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', [[Anglo-Saxon riddles|riddles]] and others. In all there are about 400 surviving [[manuscript]]s from the period, a significant corpus of both popular interest and specialist research. The manuscripts use a modified [[Roman alphabet]], but [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] or ''futhorc'' are used in under 200 inscriptions on objects, sometimes mixed with Roman letters.\n\nThis literature is remarkable for being in the vernacular (Old English) in the early medieval period: almost all other written literature was in Latin at this time, but due to Alfred's programme of vernacular literacy, the oral traditions of Anglo-Saxon England ended up being converted into writing and preserved. We owe much of this preservation to the monks of the tenth century, who made \u2013 at the very least \u2013 the copies of most of the literary manuscripts that still exist. Manuscripts were not common items. They were expensive and hard to make.<ref>Karkov, Catherine E. The Art of Anglo-Saxon England. Vol. 1. Boydell Press, 2011.</ref> First, cows or sheep had to be slaughtered and their skins tanned. Then people had to decide to use this leather for manuscripts rather than for any of the other things leather can be used for. The leather was then scraped, stretched, and cut into sheets, which were sewn into books. Then inks had to be made from oak galls and other ingredients, and the books had to be hand written by monks using quill pens. Every manuscript is slightly different from every other one, even if they are copies of each other, because every scribe had different handwriting and made different errors. We can sometimes identify individual scribes from their handwriting, and we can often guess where manuscripts were written because different [[scriptoria]] (centres of manuscript production) wrote in different [[paleography|styles of hand]].<ref>Fulk, R. D., and Christopher M. Cain. \"Making Old English New: Anglo-Saxonism and the Cultural Work of Old English Literature.\" (2013).</ref>\n\nThere are four great poetic codices of [[Old English poetry]] (a [[codex]] is a book in modern format, as opposed to a [[scroll]]): the [[Junius Manuscript]], the [[Vercelli Book]], the [[Exeter Book]], and the [[Nowell Codex]] or ''Beowulf'' Manuscript; most of the well-known lyric poems such as ''[[The Wanderer (Old English poem)|The Wanderer]]'', ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]]'', ''[[Deor]]'' and ''[[The Ruin]]'' are found in the Exeter Book, while the Vercelli Book has the ''[[Dream of the Rood]]'',<ref>Godden, Malcolm, and Michael Lapidge, eds. The Cambridge Companion to Old English Literature. Cambridge University Press, 1991; there is also the Paris Psalter (not the [[Paris Psalter]]), a metrical version of most of the [[Psalms]], described by its most recent specialist as \"a pedestrian and unimaginative piece of poetic translation. It is rarely read by students of Old English, and most Anglo-Saxonists make only passing reference to it. There is scarcely any literary criticism written on the text, although some work has been done on its vocabulary and metre\", [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=A6553EFEF5479C1641CC3FEF8221A280.journals?fromPage=online&aid=2312048 \"Poetic language and the Paris Psalter: the decay of the Old English tradition\", by M.

The [[Franks Casket]] also has carved riddles, a popular form with the Anglo-Saxons. Old English secular poetry is mostly characterized by a somewhat gloomy and introspective cast of mind, and the grim determination found in ''[[The Battle of Maldon]]'', recounting an [[Battle of Maldon|action against the Vikings in 991]]. This is from a book that was lost in the [[Cotton Library]] fire of 1731, but it had been transcribed previously.\n\nRather than being organized around rhyme, the poetic line in Anglo-Saxon is organised around alliteration, the repetition of stressed sounds, any repeated stressed sound, vowel or consonant, could be used. Anglo-Saxon lines are made up of two half-lines (in old-fashioned scholarship, these are called [[hemistich]]es) divided by a breath-pause or [[caesura]]. There must be at least one of the alliterating sounds on each side of the caesura.\n{{quote|''<u>hr</u>eran mid hondum{{spaces|4}}<u>hr</u>imcealde s\u00e6''{{efn|Example from the Wanderer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=text&id=Wdr&textOnly=true|title=Anglo-Saxons.net|publisher=}}</ref>}}}}\nThe line above illustrates the principle: note that there is a natural pause after 'hondum' and that the first stressed syllable after that pause begins with the same sound as a stressed line from the first half-line (the first halfline is called the a-verse and the second is the b-verse).<ref>Bradley, S.A.J. Anglo-Saxon Poetry. New York: Everyman Paperbacks, 1995.</ref>\n\nThere is very strong evidence that Anglo-Saxon poetry has deep roots in oral tradition, but, keeping with the cultural practices we have seen elsewhere in Anglo-Saxon culture, there was a blending between tradition and new learning.<ref>Alexander, Michael. The Earliest English Poems. 3rd rev. ed. New York:\nPenguin Classics, 1992.</ref> Thus while all Old English poetry has common features, we can also identify three strands: religious poetry, which includes poems about specifically Christian topics, such as the cross and the saints; Heroic or [[epic poetry]], such as ''Beowulf'', which is about heroes, warfare, monsters, and the Germanic past; and poetry about \"smaller\" topics, including introspective poems (the so-called elegies), \"wisdom\" poems (which communicate both traditional and Christian wisdom), and riddles. For a long time all Anglo-Saxon poetry was divided into three groups: [[C\u00e6dmon]]ian (the biblical paraphrase poems), heroic, and \"Cynewulfian,\" named after [[Cynewulf]], one of the only named poets in Anglo-Saxon. The most famous works from this period include the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', which has achieved [[national epic]] status in Britain.<ref>Anglo Saxon Poetry. Hachette UK, 2012.</ref>\n\nThere are about 30,000 surviving lines of Old English poetry and about ten times that much prose, and the majority of both is religious. The prose was influential and obviously very important to the Anglo-Saxons and more important than the poetry to those who came after the Anglo-Saxons. [[Homily|Homilies]] are sermons, lessons to be given on moral and doctrinal matters, and the two most prolific and respected writers of Anglo-Saxon prose, [[\u00c6lfric of Eynsham|\u00c6lfric]] and [[Wulfstan the Cantor|Wulfstan]], were both homilists.<ref>Sweet, Henry. An Anglo-Saxon reader in prose and verse: with grammar, metre, notes and glossary. At the Clarendon Press, 1908.</ref> \u00c6lfric also wrote the 'Lives of Saints' which very popular and were highly prized.<ref>Gneuss, Helmut. \u00c6lfric of Eynsham: His Life, Times, and Writings. Vol. 34. Western Michigan Univ Medieval, 2009.</ref> Almost all surviving poetry is found in only one manuscript copy, but there are a number of different versions of some prose works, especially the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which was apparently promulgated to monasteries by the royal court. Anglo-Saxon clergy also continued to write in Latin, the language of [[Bede]]'s works, monastic chronicles, and theological writing, although Bede's biographer records that he was familiar with Old English poetry and gives a five line lyric which he either wrote or liked to quote \u2013 the sense is unclear.\n\n=== Symbolism ===\n[[Symbolic anthropology|Symbolism]] was an essential element to Anglo-Saxon culture. [[Julian D. Richards]] suggested that in societies with strong [[oral tradition]]s, [[material culture]] is used to store and pass on information and stand instead of literature in those cultures. This symbolism is less logical than literature and more difficult to read. Anglo-Saxons used symbolism, not just to communicate, but as tools to aid their thinking about the world. Symbols were also used to change the world, Anglo-Saxons used symbols to differentiate between groups and people, status and role in society.<ref name=\"Richards, Julian D 1992\" />\n\nThe visual riddles and ambiguities of early Anglo-Saxon animal art, for example has been seen as emphasing the protective roles of animals on dress accessories, weapons, armour and horse equipment, and its evocation of pre-Christian mythological themes. However Howard Williams and Ruth Nugent have suggest that the number of artefact categories that have animals or eyes; from pots to combs, buckets to weaponry was to make artefacts 'see' by impressing and punching circular and lentoid shapes onto them. This symbolism of making the object seems to be more than decoration.<ref>Nugent, Ruth, and Howard Williams. \"Sighted surfaces. Ocular Agency in early Anglo-Saxon cremation burials.\" Encountering images: materialities, perceptions, relations. Stockholm studies in archaeology 57 (2012): 187\u2013208.</ref>\n\nConventional interpretations of the symbolism of grave goods revolved around religion (equipment for the hereafter), legal concepts (inalienable possessions) and social structure (status display, ostentatious destruction of wealth). There was multiplicity of messages and variability of meanings characterised the deposition of objects in Anglo-Saxon graves. In Early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, 47% of male adults and 9 % of all juveniles were buried with weapons, some of which were very young. The proportion of adult weapon burials is much too high to suggest that they all represent a social \u00e9lite.<ref>H\u00e4rke, Heinrich. \"Grave goods in early medieval burials: messages and meanings.\" Mortality ahead-of-print (2014): 1\u201321.</ref> The usual assumption is that these are 'warrior burials', and this term is used throughout the archaeological and historical literature. However, a systematic comparison of burials with and without weapons, using archaeological and skeletal data, suggests that this assumption is much too simplistic and even misleading. Anglo-Saxon weapon burial rite involved a complex ritual symbolism: it was multi-dimensional, displaying ethnic affiliation, descent, wealth, \u00e9lite status, and age groups. This symbol continued until c.700 when it ceased to have the symbolic power that it had before.<ref>Pader, E.J. 1982. Symbolism, social relations and the interpretation of mortuary remains. Oxford. (B.A.R. S 130)</ref> Heinrich H\u00e4rke suggests this change was due to the changing structure of society and especially in ethnicity and assimilation implying the lowering of ethnic boundaries in the Anglo-Saxon settlement areas of England, towards a common culture.<ref name=\"H\u00e4rke, Heinrich 1992\" />\n\nThe word ''bead'' comes from the Anglo-Saxon words ''bidden'' (to pray) and ''bede'' (prayer). The vast majority of early Anglo-Saxon female graves contain beads, which are often found in large numbers in the area of the neck and chest. Beads are also sometimes found in male burials, with large beads often associated with prestigious weapons. A variety of materials other than glass were available for Anglo-Saxon beads, including amber, rock crystal, amethyst, bone, shells, coral and even metal.<ref name=\"Guido2000\">Guido and Welch. Indirect evidence for glass bead manufacture in early Anglo-Saxon England. In Price 2000 115\u2013120.</ref> These beads are usually considered to have a social or ritual function. Anglo-Saxon glass beads show a wide variety of bead manufacturing techniques, sizes, shapes, colours and decorations. Various studies have been carried out investigating the distribution and chronological change of bead types.<ref>Guido, M. & M. Welch 1999. The glass beads of Anglo-Saxon England c.

Oxford: Oxbow</ref> The crystal beads which appear on bead strings in the pagan Anglo-Saxon period seems to have gone through various changes in meaning in the Christian period, which Gale Owen-Crocker suggests was linked to symbolism of the Virgin Mary, and hence to intercession.<ref>Owen-Crocker, Gale R. Dress in Anglo-Saxon England. Boydell Press, 2004.</ref> John Hines has suggested that the over 2000 different types of beads found at Lakenheath show that the beads symbolise identity, roles, status and micro cultures within the tribal landscape of the early Anglo-Saxon world.<ref>John Hines (1998) The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Edix Hill (Barrington A), Cambridgeshire. Council for British Archaeology.</ref>\n\nSymbolism continued to have a hold on the minds of Anglo-Saxon people into the Christian eras. The interiors of churches would have glowed with colour, and the walls of the halls were painted with decorative scenes from the imagination telling stories of monsters and heroes like those in the poem Beowulf. Although nothing much is left of the wall paintings, evidence of their pictorial art is found in Bibles and Psalters, in illuminated manuscripts. The poem, 'The [[Dream of the Rood]]', is an example how symbolism of trees was fused into Christian symbolism.\nRichard North suggests that the sacrifice of the tree was in accordance with pagan virtues and \"the image of Christ's death was constructed in this poem with reference to an Anglian ideology of the world tree\".<ref name=\"North273\">North, Richard. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=X_LKUIqNvPQC&pg=PP1&dq=Heathen+Gods+in+Old+English+Literature#v=onepage Heathen Gods in Old English Literature]''. [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997, p. 273</ref> North suggests that the author of ''The Dream of the Rood'' \"uses the language of the myth of Ingui in order to present the Passion to his newly Christianized countrymen as a story from their native tradition\".<ref name=\"North273\" /> Furthermore, the tree's triumph over death is celebrated by adorning the cross with gold and jewels.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of [[coin]]age of the first half of the 8th century is its portrayal of animals, to an extent found in no other European coinage of the Early Middle Ages. Some animals, such as lions or peacocks, would have been known in England only through descriptions in texts or through images in manuscripts or on portable objects. The animals were not merely illustrated out of an interest in the natural world. Each was imbued with meanings and acted as a symbol which would have been understood at the time.<ref>Gannon, Anna. The iconography of early Anglo-Saxon coinage: sixth to eighth centuries. Oxford University Press, 2003.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n''Anglo-Saxon'' is still used as a term for the original [[Old English]]-derived vocabulary within the modern [[English language]], in contrast to vocabulary derived from [[Old Norse]] and [[French language|French]].\n\nThroughout the history of Anglo-Saxon studies, different narratives of the people have been used to justify contemporary ideologies. In the early Middle Ages the views of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] produced a personally inspired history that wasn't challenged for five hundred years. In the [[Reformation]], churchmen looking for signs of an English church reinterpreted Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 19th century the term ''Anglo-Saxon'' was broadly used in [[philology]], and is sometimes so used at present. In Victorian Britain, some writers such as [[Robert Knox]], [[James Anthony Froude]], [[Charles Kingsley]]<ref>Rule of Darkness: British Literature and Imperialism, 1830\u20131914 by Patrick Brantlinger. Cornell University Press, 1990</ref> and [[Edward A. Freeman]]<ref>Race and Empire in British Politics by Paul B. Rich. CUP Archive, 1990</ref> used the term ''Anglo-Saxon'' to justify [[racism]] and [[imperialism]], claiming that the \"Anglo-Saxon\" ancestry of the English made them racially superior to the colonised peoples. Similar racist ideas were advocated in the 19th-century United States by [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[George Fitzhugh]].<ref>Race and Manifest Destiny: The Origins of American Racial Anglo-Saxonism by Reginald Horsman. Harvard University Press, 1981. (pgs. 126,273)</ref> These views have influenced how versions of early English history are embedded in the sub-conscious of people \"re-emerging in school textbooks and television programmes and still very congenial to some strands of political thinking.\"<ref>Hills, Catherine. Origins of the English. Duckworth Pub, 2003.p35</ref>\n\nThe term ''Anglo-Saxon'' is sometimes used to refer to peoples descended or associated in some way with the [[English (ethnic group)|English ethnic group]], but there is no universal definition for the term. In contemporary [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] cultures outside Britain, \"Anglo-Saxon\" may be contrasted with \"Celtic\" as a socioeconomic identifier, invoking or reinforcing historical prejudices against non-English British immigrants. \"[[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]\", i.e. [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], is a term especially popular in the United States that refers chiefly to old wealthy families with mostly English ancestors. As such, WASP is not a historical label or a precise ethnological term, but rather a (often derogatory) reference to contemporary family-based political, financial and cultural power\u2014 e.g., [[Boston Brahmin|The Boston Brahmin]].\n\nOutside Anglophone countries in Europe and in the rest of the world, the term ''Anglo-Saxon'' and its direct translations are used to refer to the Anglophone peoples and societies of Britain, the United States, and other countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand\u2013areas which are sometimes referred to as the [[Anglosphere]]. The term ''Anglo-Saxon'' can be used in a variety of contexts, often to identify the English-speaking world's distinctive language, culture, technology, wealth, markets, economy, and legal systems. Variations include the [[German language|German]] \"Angelsachsen\", [[French language|French]] \"Anglo-Saxon\", [[Spanish language|Spanish]] \"anglosaj\u00f3n\", [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] \"Anglo-sax\u00e3o\", [[Russian language|Russian]] \"\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043a\u0441\u044b\", [[Polish language|Polish]] \"anglosakso\u0144ski\", [[Italian language|Italian]] \"anglosassone\", [[Catalan language|Catalan]] \"anglosax\u00f3\" and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] \"Angurosakuson\". As with the English-language use of the term, what constitutes the \"Anglo-Saxon\" varies from speaker to speaker.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn modern parlance, Anglo-Saxon is increasingly used to define a set of economic belief and systems rooted in anglophone countries. Characteristics of this model include low levels of regulation and taxes, and the public sector providing very few services. It can also mean strong private property rights, contract enforcement, and overall ease of doing business as well as low barriers to free trade. The Anglo-Saxon model is seen distinctly and competes versus other recognized economic models like continental bureaucracy or Chinese socialist model of central control.<ref>[[Anglo-Saxon model]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=June 2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Anglo-Saxon England}}\n*[[Anglo-Frisian]]\n*[[Anglo-Saxon dress]]\n*[[Coinage in Anglo-Saxon England]]\n*[[Anglo-Saxon military organization]]\n*[[Burial in Anglo-Saxon England]]\n*[[Frisia]]\n*[[States in Medieval Britain]]\n*[[Timeline of Anglo-Saxon settlement in Britain]]\n\n'''Modern concepts:'''\n* [[Anglo-Saxon economy]]\n* [[English people]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Oppenheimer, Stephen.

They comprised people from [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] who migrated to the island from [[continental Europe]], their descendants, and [[Celtic Britons|indigenous British groups]] who adopted many aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture and language. The Anglo-Saxons established the [[Kingdom of England]], and the modern [[English language]] owes almost half of its words \u2013 including the most common words of everyday speech \u2013 to their language. \n\nHistorically, the Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period in Britain between about 450 and 1066, after [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|their initial settlement]] and up until the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]].<ref name=\"Higham, Nicholas J. 2013\">Higham, Nicholas J., and Martin J.

During this period, [[Christianity]] was established and there was a flowering of literature and language. Charters and law were also established.<ref>Higham, Nicholas J., and Martin J. Ryan. ''The Anglo-Saxon World''. Yale University Press, 2013. p. 7</ref> The term ''Anglo-Saxon'' is popularly used for the language that was spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England and eastern [[Scotland]] between at least the mid-5th century and the mid-12th century.

''The Cambridge History of the English Language: Vol 1: the Beginnings to 1066'' (1992)</ref>\n\nThe history of the Anglo-Saxons is the history of a cultural identity. It developed from divergent groups in association with the people's adoption of Christianity and was integral to the establishment of various kingdoms. Threatened by extended [[Danes|Danish]] invasions and military occupation of eastern England, this identity was re-established; it dominated until after the Norman Conquest.<ref>Higham, Nicholas J., and Martin J.

Behind the symbolic nature of these cultural emblems, there are strong elements of tribal and lordship ties. The elite declared themselves as kings who developed ''[[burh]]s'', and identified their roles and peoples in Biblical terms.

The most contemporaneous textual evidence is the [[Chronica Gallica of 452|''Chronica Gallica of 452'']], which records for the year 441: \"The British provinces, which to this time had suffered various defeats and misfortunes, are reduced to Saxon rule.\"<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|Casey|1988|pp= 367\u201398}} \"The Gallic Chronicle Restored: a Chronology for the Anglo-Saxon Invasions and the End of Roman Britain\"</ref> This is an earlier date than that of 451 for the \"coming of the Saxons\" used by [[Bede]] in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]],'' written around 731.

The most developed vision of a continuation in sub-Roman Britain, with control over its own political and military destiny for well over a century, is that of Kenneth Dark,<ref>Dark, K., ''Civitas to Kingdom: British Political Continuity 300\u201380'' (London, Leicester University Press, 1994)</ref> who suggests that the sub-Roman elite survived in culture, politics and military power up to c. 570.<ref name=\"Higham, Nick 2004\">Higham, Nick. \"From sub-Roman Britain to Anglo-Saxon England: Debating the Insular Dark Ages.\" ''History Compass'' 2.1 (2004).</ref> However, Higham seems to agree with Bede, who identifies three phases of settlement: an exploration phase, when mercenaries came to protect the resident population; a migration phase, which was substantial as implied by the statement that ''Anglus'' was deserted; and an establishment phase, in which Anglo-Saxons started to control areas, implied in Bede's statement about the origins of the tribes.<ref>Brugmann, B.

But even based on a fairly high Anglo-Saxon figure (200,000) and a low Brittonic one (800,000), Brittonic people are likely to have outnumbered Anglo-Saxons by at least four to one. The interpretation of such figures is that while \"culturally, the later Anglo-Saxons and English did emerge as remarkably un-British, . . . their genetic, biological make-up is none the less likely to have been substantially, indeed predominantly, British\".<ref>Ward-Perkins, Bryan. \"Why did the Anglo-Saxons not become more British?.\" ''The English Historical Review'' 115.462 (2000): page 523</ref> The development of Anglo-Saxon culture is described by two processes.

However, a [[churl|''ceorl'']], who was the lowest ranking freeman in early Anglo-Saxon society, was not a peasant but an arms-owning male with the support of a kindred, access to law and the ''[[wergild]]''; situated at the apex of an extended household working at least one hide of land.<ref>Higham, Nicholas J.

The [[Bretwalda]] concept is taken as evidence of a number of early Anglo-Saxon elite families.

Kent was probably chosen because \u00c6thelberht had married a Christian princess, [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], daughter of [[Charibert I]] the [[List of Frankish kings|King of Paris]], who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. \u00c6thelberht was converted to Christianity, churches were established, and wider-scale conversion to Christianity began in the kingdom. [[\u00c6thelberht's law]] for Kent, the earliest written code in any [[Germanic language]], instituted a complex system of fines. Kent was rich, with strong trade ties to the continent, and \u00c6thelberht may have instituted royal control over trade. For the first time following the Anglo-Saxon invasion, coins began circulating in Kent during his reign.\n\nIn 635 [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]], an Irish monk from [[Iona]], chose the [[Lindisfarne|Isle of Lindisfarne]] to establish a monastery which was close to King [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]]'s main fortress of [[Bamburgh]]. He had been at the monastery in Iona when Oswald asked to be sent a mission to Christianise the [[Northumbria|Kingdom of Northumbria]] from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. Oswald had probably chosen Iona because after his father had been killed he had fled into south-west Scotland and had encountered Christianity, and had returned determined to make Northumbria Christian. Aidan achieved great success in spreading the Christian faith, and since Aidan could not speak English and Oswald had learned Irish during his exile, Oswald acted as Aidan's interpreter when the latter was preaching.<ref>[[s:Ecclesiastical History of the English People/Book 3|Bede, Book III, chapters 3 and 5.]]</ref> Later, [[Northumberland]]'s patron saint, [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert]], was an [[abbot]] of the monastery, and then [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]].

At the time of the battle of the river Winw\u00e6d, thirty ''duces regii'' (royal generals) fought on his behalf. Although there are many gaps in the evidence, it is clear that the seventh-century Mercian kings were formidable rulers who were able to exercise a wide-ranging overlordship from their [[The Midlands|Midland]] base.\n\nMercian military success was the basis of their power; it succeeded against not only 106 kings and kingdoms by winning set-piece battles,<ref>Yorke, Barbara. Kings and kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England. Routledge, 2002: p103</ref> but by ruthlessly ravaging any area foolish enough to withhold tribute.

Because of the plundering raids that followed, the raiders attracted the name [[Viking]] \u2013 from the Old Norse ''v\u00edkingr'' meaning an expedition \u2013 which soon became used for the raiding activity or piracy reported in western Europe.<ref>Sawyer, Peter Hayes, ed. Illustrated history of the Vikings. Oxford University Press, 2001</ref> In 793, Lindisfarne was raided and while this was not the first raid of its type it was the most prominent. In 794, Jarrow, the monastery where Bede wrote, was attacked; in 795 Iona was attacked; and in 804 the nunnery at Lyminge Kent was granted refuge inside the walls of Canterbury. Sometime around 800, a Reeve from Portland in Wessex was killed when he mistook some raiders for ordinary traders.\n\nViking raids continued until in 850, then the ''Chronicle'' says: \"The heathen for the first time remained over the winter\". The fleet does not appear to have stayed long in England, but it started a trend which others subsequently followed. In particular, the army which arrived in 865 remained over many winters, and part of it later settled what became known as the [[Danelaw]]. This was the \"[[Great Heathen Army|Great Army]]\", a term used by the ''Chronicle'' in England and by Adrevald of Fleury on the Continent. The invaders were able to exploit the feuds between and within the various kingdoms and to appoint puppet kings, such as Ceolwulf in Mercia in 873 and perhaps others in Northumbria in 867 and East Anglia in 870.<ref name=\"Whitelock, Dorothy 1965\" /> The third phase was an era of settlement; however, the \"Great Army\" went wherever it could find the richest pickings, crossing the [[English Channel]] when faced with resolute opposition, as in England in 878, or with famine, as on the Continent in 892.<ref name=\"Whitelock, Dorothy 1965\" /> By this stage, the Vikings were assuming ever increasing importance as catalysts of social and political change. They constituted the common enemy, making the English more conscious of a national identity which overrode deeper distinctions; they could be perceived as an instrument of divine punishment for the people's sins, raising awareness of a collective Christian identity; and by 'conquering' the kingdoms of the East Angles, the Northumbrians and the Mercians, they created a vacuum in the leadership of the English people.<ref>Coupland, Simon. \"The Vikings in Francia and Anglo-Saxon England to 911.\" The New Cambridge Medieval History 2 (1995): 190\u2013201.</ref>\n\nDanish settlement continued in Mercia in 877 and East Anglia in 879\u201480 and 896. The rest of the army meanwhile continued to harry and plunder on both sides of the Channel, with new recruits evidently arriving to swell its ranks, for it clearly continued to be a formidable fighting force.<ref name=\"Whitelock, Dorothy 1965\" /> At first, Alfred responded by the offer of repeated tribute payments. However, after a decisive victory at Edington in 878, Alfred offered vigorous opposition. He established a chain of fortresses across the south of England, reorganised the army, \"so that always half its men were at home, and half out on service, except for those men who were to garrison the burhs\",<ref>Anglo-Saxon Chronicel s.a. 893</ref><ref name=\"Whitelock, Dorothy 1965\" /> and in 896 ordered a new type of craft to be built which could oppose the Viking [[longship]]s in shallow coastal waters. When the Vikings returned from the Continent in 892, they found they could no longer roam the country at will, for wherever they went they were opposed by a local army. After four years, the Scandinavians therefore split up, some to settle in Northumbria and East Anglia, the remainder to try their luck again on the Continent.<ref name=\"Whitelock, Dorothy 1965\" />\n\n=== King Alfred and the rebuilding (878\u2013899) ===\n[[File:Alfred Jewel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A royal gift, the [[Alfred Jewel]]]]\nMore important to Alfred than his military and political victories were his religion, his love of learning, and his spread of writing throughout England.

Alfred saw kingship as a priestly office, a shepherd for his people.<ref>Frantzen, Allen J. King Alfred. Woodbridge, CT: Twayne Publishers, 1986</ref> One book that was particularly valuable to him was [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great's]] ''Cura Pastoralis'' (Pastoral Care). This is a priest's guide on how to care for people. Alfred took this book as his own guide on how to be a good king to his people; hence, a good king to Alfred increases literacy. Alfred translated this book himself and explains in the preface:\n\n{{quote|...When I had learned it I translated it into English, just as I had understood it, and as I could most meaningfully render it. And I will send one to each bishopric in my kingdom, and in each will be an \u00e6stel worth fifty mancuses.

The prestige, and indeed the pretensions, of the monarchy increased, the institutions of government strengthened, and kings and their agents sought in various ways to establish social order.<ref name=\"Keynes, Simon 2001\">Keynes, Simon. \"Edward, King of the Anglo-Saxons.\".\" Edward the Elder: 899 924 (2001): 40\u201366.</ref> This process started with [[Edward the Elder]] \u2013 who with his sister, [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]], Lady of the Mercians, initially, charters reveal, encouraged people to purchase estates from the Danes, thereby to reassert some degree of English influence in territory which had fallen under Danish control.

His claim to be \"king of the English\" was by no means widely recognised.<ref>Keynes, Simon. \"Edgar, King of the English 959\u2013975 New Interpretations.\" (2008).</ref> The situation was complex: the [[Norse\u2013Gaels|Hiberno-Norse]] rulers of Dublin still coveted their interests in the [[Scandinavian York|Danish kingdom of York]]; terms had to be made with the Scots, who had the capacity not merely to interfere in Northumbrian affairs, but also to block a line of communication between Dublin and York; and the inhabitants of northern Northumbria were considered a law unto themselves. It was only after twenty years of crucial developments following \u00c6thelstan's death in 939 that a unified kingdom of England began to assume its familiar shape. However, the major political problem for [[Edmund I|Edmund]] and [[Eadred]], who succeeded \u00c6thelstan, remained the difficulty of subjugating the north.<ref name=\"Dumville, David N 1992\">Dumville, David N. \"Between Alfred the Great and Edgar the Peacemaker: \u00c6thelstan, First King of England.\" Wessex and England from Alfred to Edgar (1992): 141\u2013171.</ref> In 959 [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]] is said to have \"succeeded to the kingdom both in Wessex and in Mercia and in Northumbria, and he was then 16 years old\" (ASC, version 'B', 'C'), and is called \"the Peacemaker\".<ref name=\"Dumville, David N 1992\" /> By the early 970s, after a decade of Edgar's 'peace', it may have seemed that the kingdom of England was indeed made whole.

This put all the monks and nuns in England under one set of detailed customs for the first time. In 973, Edgar received a special second, 'imperial coronation' at Bath, and from this point England was ruled by Edgar under the strong influence of Dunstan, Athelwold, and [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]], the Bishop of Worcester.\n\n=== \u00c6thelred and the return of the Scandinavians (978\u20131016) ===\nThe reign of King \u00c6thelred the Unready witnessed the resumption of Viking raids on England, putting the country and its leadership under strains as severe as they were long sustained. Raids began on a relatively small scale in the 980s but became far more serious in the 990s, and brought the people to their knees in 1009\u201312, when a large part of the country was devastated by the army of [[Thorkell the Tall]]. It remained for [[Swein Forkbeard]], king of Denmark, to conquer the kingdom of England in 1013\u201314, and (after \u00c6thelred's restoration) for his son Cnut to achieve the same in 1015\u201316. The tale of these years incorporated in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' must be read in its own right,<ref>ASC, pp. 230\u2013251</ref> and set beside other material which reflects in one way or another on the conduct of government and warfare during \u00c6thelred's reign.<ref>See, e.g., EHD, no. 10 (the poem on the battle of Maldon), nos. 42\u20136 (law-codes), nos. 117\u201329 (charters, etc.), nos.230\u20131 (letters), and no. 240 (Archbishop Wulfstan's Sermo ad Anglos).</ref> It is this evidence which is the basis for Keynes's view that the king lacked the strength, judgement and resolve to give adequate leadership to his people in a time of grave national crisis; who soon found out that he could rely on little but the treachery of his military commanders; and who, throughout his reign, tasted nothing but the ignominy of defeat. The raids exposed tensions and weaknesses which went deep into the fabric of the late Anglo-Saxon state, and it is apparent that events proceeded against a background more complex than the chronicler probably knew. It seems, for example, that the death of Bishop \u00c6thelwold in 984 had precipitated further reaction against certain ecclesiastical interests; that by 993 the king had come to regret the error of his ways, leading to a period when the internal affairs of the kingdom appear to have prospered.<ref>White, Stephen D. \"Timothy Reuter, ed., The New Cambridge Medieval History, 3: C. 900\u2013c. 1024.

The final struggles were complicated by internal dissension, and especially by the treacherous acts of Ealdorman Eadric of Mercia, who opportunistically changed sides to Cnut's party. After the defeat of the English in the [[Battle of Assandun]] in October 1016, Edmund and Cnut agreed to divide the kingdom so that Edmund would rule Wessex and Cnut Mercia, but Edmund died soon after his defeat in November 1016, making it possible for Cnut to seize power over all England.<ref>Keynes, S.

The consequences of each conquest changed the Anglo-Saxon cutlure. Politically and chronologically, the texts of this period are not Anglo-Saxon; linguistically, those written in English (as opposed to Latin or French, the other official written languages of the period) moved away from the late West Saxon standard that is called \"Old English\". Yet neither are they \"Middle English\"; moreover, as Treharne explains, for around three-quarters of this period, \"there is barely any 'original' writing in English at all\". These factors have led to a gap in scholarship, implying a discontinuity either side of the Norman Conquest, however this assumption is being challenged.<ref>Treharne, Elaine. Living Through Conquest: The Politics of Early English, 1020\u20131220. Oxford University Press, 2012.</ref>\n\nAt first sight, there would seem little to debate. Cnut appeared to have adopted wholeheartedly the traditional role of Anglo-Saxon kingship.<ref>[[Robin Fleming]] ''Kings and lords in Conquest England''. Vol. 15. Cambridge University Press, 2004.</ref> However an examination of the laws, homilies, wills, and charters dating from this period suggests that as a result of widespread aristocratic death and the fact that Cnut did not systematically introduce a new landholding class, major and permanent alterations occurred in the Saxon social and political structures.<ref>Mack, Katharin. \"Changing thegns: Cnut's conquest and the English aristocracy.\" ''Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies'' (1984): 375\u2013387.</ref> Eric John remarks that for Cnut \"the simple difficulty of exercising so wide and so unstable an empire made it necessary to practise a delegation of authority against every tradition of English kingship\".<ref>Eric John, ''Orbis Britanniae'' (Leicester, 1966), p. 61.</ref> The disappearance of the aristocratic families which had traditionally played an active role in the governance of the realm, coupled with Cnut's choice of [[thegn]]ly advisors, put an end to the balanced relationship between monarchy and aristocracy so carefully forged by the West Saxon Kings.\n\n[[Edward the Confessor|Edward]] became king in 1042, and given his upbringing might have been considered a Norman by those who lived across the English Channel. Following Cnut's reforms, excessive power was concentrated in the hands of the rival houses of [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric of Mercia]] and [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Godwine of Wessex]]. Problems also came for Edward from the resentment caused by the king's introduction of Norman friends. A crisis arose in 1051 when Godwine defied the king's order to punish the men of Dover, who had resisted an attempt by [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne|Eustace of Boulogne]] to quarter his men on them by force.<ref name=\"Maddicott, J.

Godwine and his sons came back the following year with a strong force, and the magnates were not prepared to engage them in civil war but forced the king to make terms. Some unpopular Normans were driven out, including [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges|Archbishop Robert]], whose archbishopric was given to [[Stigand]]; this act supplied an excuse for the Papal support of William's cause.<ref name=\"Maddicott, J.

In this time, and because of the cultural shock of the Conquest, Anglo-Saxon began to change very rapidly, and by 1200 or so, it was no longer Anglo-Saxon English, but what scholars call early [[Middle English]].<ref>Jack, George B. \"Negative adverbs in early Middle English.\" (1978): 295\u2013309.</ref> But this language had deep roots in Anglo-Saxon, which was being spoken much later than 1066.

With the passing of time, however, and particularly following the Norman conquest of England, this language changed significantly, and although some people (for example the scribe known as [[the Tremulous Hand of Worcester]]) could still read Old English into the thirteenth century, it fell out of use and the texts became useless. The [[Exeter Book]], for example, seems to have been used to press gold leaf and at one point had a pot of fish-based glue sitting on top of it.

These leaders who developed in the sixth century were able to seize the initiative and to establish a position of power for themselves and their successors. Anglo-Saxon leaders, unable to tax and coerce followers, extracted surplus by raiding and collecting [[food render]]s and 'prestige goods'.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hough|title=\"An Ald Reht\": Essays on Anglo-Saxon Law|page=117}}</ref> The later sixth century saw the end of a 'prestige goods' economy, as evidenced by the decline of accompanied burial, and the appearance of the first princely graves and high-status settlements.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. \"The earliest Anglo-Saxon kingdoms' in The New Cambridge Medieval History, I, c. 500-c. 700. ed.

(1997),'Urban centres in Pre-Viking England?', in Hines (1997), pp. 269\u201398</ref> Anglo-Saxon society, in short, looked very different in 600 than it did a hundred years earlier.\n\nBy 600, the establishment of the first Anglo-Saxon 'emporia' was in prospect. There seem to have been over thirty of such units, many of which were certainly controlled by kings, in the parts of Britain which the Anglo-Saxons controlled. Bede's use of the term ''imperium'' has been seen as significant in defining the status and powers of the bretwaldas, in fact it is a word Bede used regularly as an alternative to ''regnum''; scholars believe this just meant the collection of tribute.<ref>Fanning, Steven. \"Bede, Imperium, and the bretwaldas.\" Speculum 66.01 (1991): 1\u201326.</ref> Oswiu's extension of overlordship over the Picts and Scots is expressed in terms of making them tributary.

An example of this tendency for later boundaries to preserve earlier arrangements is Sussex; the county boundary is essentially the same as that of the West Saxon shire and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom.<ref>Leslie, Kim, and Brian Short. An historical atlas of Sussex. History Press, 1999.</ref> The Witan, also called Witenagemot, was the council of kings; its essential duty was to advise the king on all matters on which he chose to ask its opinion. It attested his grants of land to churches or laymen, consented to his issue of new laws or new statements of ancient custom, and helped him deal with rebels and persons suspected of disaffection.\n\nOnly five Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are known to have survived to 800, and several British kingdoms in the west of the country had disappeared as well. The major kingdoms had grown through absorbing smaller principalities, and the means through which they did it and the character their kingdoms acquired as a result are one of the major themes of the Middle Saxon period. [[Beowulf]], for all its heroic content, clearly makes the point that economic and military success were intimately linked. A 'good' king was a generous king who through his wealth won the support which would ensure his supremacy over other kingdoms.<ref>Campbell, J 1979: Bede's Reges and Principes. Jarrow Lecture</ref> King Alfred's digressions in his translation of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, provided these observations about the resources which every king needed:\n{{quote|In the case of the king, the resources and tools with which to rule are that he have his land fully manned: he must have praying men, fighting men and working men. You know also that without these tools no king may make his ability known. Another aspect of his resources is that he must have the means of support for his tools, the three classes of men. These, then, are their means of support: land to live on, gifts, weapons, food, ale, clothing and whatever else is necessary for each of the three classes of men.<ref>Irvine, Susan, Susan Elizabeth Irvine, and Malcolm Godden, eds.

The advent of Christianity brought with it the introduction of new concepts of land tenure. The role of churchmen was analogous with that of the warriors waging heavenly warfare. However what Alfred was alluding to was that in order for a king to fulfil his responsibilities towards his people, particularly those concerned with defence, he had the right to make considerable exactions from the landowners and people of his kingdom.<ref>Abels, Richard P.

However the Anglo-Saxons believed in 'luck' as a random element in the affairs of man and so would probably have agreed that there is a limit to the extent one can understand why one kingdom failed while another succeeded.<ref>{{cite book | ref = harv | last = Chaney | first = William A. | author-link = William Chaney | title = The Cult of Kingship in Anglo-Saxon England: The Transition from Paganism to Christianity | date = 1970 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester }}</ref> They also believed in 'destiny' and interpreted the fate of the kingdom of England with Biblical and Carolingian ideology, with parallels, between the Israelites, the great European empires and the Anglo-Saxons.

According to place name evidence, these sites of worship were known alternately as either ''[[H\u00f6rgr|hearg]]'' or as ''[[V\u00e9 (shrine)|w\u0113oh]]''. Most poems from before the Norman Conquest are steeped in pagan symbolism, and their integration into the new faith goes beyond the literary sources. Thus, as Lethbridge reminds us, \"to say, 'this is a monument erected in Christian times and therefore the symbolism on it must be Christian,' is an unrealistic approach. The rites of the older faith, now regarded as superstition, are practised all over the country today.

Bede writes, \"[t]here was in the Monastery of this Abbess (Streon\u00e6shalch \u2013 now known as [[Whitby Abbey]]) a certain brother particularly remarkable for the Grace of God, who was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of [[Bible|scripture]], he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in Old English, which was his native language. By his verse the minds of many were often excited to despise the world, and to aspire to heaven.\" The story of C\u00e6dmon illustrates the blending of Christian and Germanic, Latin and oral tradition, monasteries and double monasteries, pre-existing customs and new learning, popular and elite, that characterizes the Conversion period of Anglo-Saxon history and culture. C\u00e6dmon does not destroy or ignore traditional Anglo-Saxon poetry. Instead, he converts it into something that helps the Church. Anglo-Saxon England finds ways to synthesize the religion of the Church with the existing \"northern\" customs and practices. Thus the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons was not just their switching from one practice to another, but making something new out of their old inheritance and their new belief and learning.<ref>Frantzen, Allen J., and I.

Hatton 48 fol. 6v-7r.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|An 8th-century copy of the Rule of St. Benedict]]\n[[Christian monasticism|Monasticism]], and not just the church, was at the centre of Anglo-Saxon Christian life. Western monasticism, as a whole, had been evolving since the time of the [[Desert Fathers]], but in the seventh century, monasticism in England confronted a dilemma that brought to question the truest representation of the Christian faith. The two monastic traditions were the Celtic and the Roman, and a decision was made to adopt the Roman tradition. ''Monasteria'' seem to describe all religious congregations other than those of the bishop.\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Dunstan]] brought Athelwold to [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], where the two of them set up a monastery on [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] lines. For many years, this was the only monastery in England that strictly followed the [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine Rule]] and observed complete monastic discipline. What Mechthild Gretsch calls an \"Aldhelm Seminar\" developed at Glastonbury, and the effects of this seminar on the curriculum of learning and study in Anglo-Saxon England were enormous.<ref name=\"Gretsch, Mechthild 2009\" /> Royal power was put behind the reforming impulses of Dunstan and Athelwold, helping them to enforce their reform ideas. This happened first at the Old Minster in [[Winchester]], before the reformers built new foundations and refoundations at Thorney, Peterborough, and Ely, among other places. Benedictine monasticism spread throughout England, and these became centers of learning again, run by people trained in Glastonbury, with one rule, the works of Aldhelm at the center of their curricula but also influenced by the vernacular efforts of Alfred. From this mixture sprung a great flowering of literary production.<ref>Keynes, Simon. \"The 'Dunstan B'charters.\" Anglo-Saxon England 23 (1994): 165\u2013193.</ref>\n\n=== Fighting and warfare ===\nSoldiers throughout the country were summoned, for both offensive and defensive war; early armies consisted essentially of household bands, while later on men were recruited on a territorial basis. The mustering of an army, annually at times, occupied an important place in Frankish history, both military and constitutional. The English kingdoms appear to have known no institution similar to this. The earliest reference is Bede's account of the overthrow of the Northumbrian [[\u00c6thelfrith]] by [[R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia|R\u00e6dwald]] overlord of the southern English. R\u00e6dwald raised a large army, presumably from among the kings who accepted his overlordship, and \"not giving him time to summon and assemble his whole army, R\u00e6dwald met him with a much greater force and slew him on the Mercian border on the east bank of the river Idle.\"<ref>HE. Bede, Ecdesiastical History of the English People, quoted from the ed. by B. Colgrave and R.A.B. Mynors (Oxford, 1969). ii.12</ref> At the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878, when the Danes made a surprise attack on Alfred at Chippenham after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], Alfred retreated to Athelney after Easter and then seven weeks after Easter mustered an army at \"Egbert's stone\".<ref>ASC, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in Whitelock 878, Asser c. 55</ref> It is not difficult to imagine that Alfred sent out word to the ealdormen to call his men to arms. This may explain the delay, and it is probably no more than coincidence that the army mustered at the beginning of May, a time when there would have been sufficient grass for the horses. There is also information about the mustering of fleets in the eleventh century. From 992 to 1066 fleets were assembled at London, or returned to the city at the end of their service, on several occasions. Where they took up station depended on the quarter from which a threat was expected: Sandwich if invasion was expected from the north, or the Isle of Wight if it was from Normandy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hollister, C.W. 1962: Anglo-Saxon Military Institutions (Oxford)</ref>\n\n[[File:2004 sutton hoo 01.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Replica of the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]]]]\nOnce they left home, these armies and fleets had to be supplied with food and clothing for the men as well as forage for the horses. Yet if armies of the seventh and eighth centuries were accompanied by servants and a supply train of lesser free men, Alfred found these arrangements insufficient to defeat the Vikings. One of his reforms was to divide his military resources into thirds. One part manned the burhs and found the permanent garrisons which would make it impossible for the Danes to overrun Wessex, although they would also take to the field when extra soldiers were needed. The remaining two would take it in turns to serve. They were allocated a fixed term of service and brought the necessary provisions with them. This arrangement did not always function well. On one occasion a division on service went home in the middle of blockading a Danish army on Thorney Island; its provisions were consumed and its term had expired before the king came to relieve them.<ref>ASC, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in Whitelock 893; also Asser c. 100 for the Organisation of the royal household</ref> This method of division and rotation remained in force up to 1066. In 917, when armies from Wessex and Mercia were in the field from early April until November, one division went home and another took over. Again, in 1052 when Edward's fleet was waiting at Sandwich to intercept Godwine's return, the ships returned to London to take on new earls and crews.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The importance of supply, vital to military success, was appreciated even if it was taken for granted and features only incidentally in the sources.<ref>Brooks, N.P.1971: The Development of Military Obligations in Eighth-and Ninth-century England, in Clemoes, P. and Hughes, K. (ed.), England Before the Conquest (Cambridge) pp. 69\u201484.</ref>\n\nMilitary training and strategy are two important matters on which the sources are typically silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, and so it is necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance.<ref>Webb, J.F. and Farmer, D.H. 1965: The Age of Bede (Harmondsworth)., pp. 43\u20134</ref> Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence gives the impression that Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on your side. But if you were in a position so advantageous that you were willing to take the chance, it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Battles put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown how few pitched battles [[Charlemagne]] and [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] chose to fight.<ref>Gillingham, J. 1984: Richard I and the Science of War in the Middle Ages, in J. Holt and J. Gillingham (eds.), War and Government in the Middle Ages (Woodbridge).</ref>\n\nA defensive strategy becomes more apparent in the later part of Alfred's reign. It was built around the possession of fortified places and the close pursuit of the Danes to harass them and impede their preferred occupation of plundering. Alfred and his lieutenants were able to fight the Danes to a standstill by their repeated ability to pursue and closely besiege them in fortified camps throughout the country. The fortification of sites at Witham, Buckingham, Towcester and Colchester persuaded the Danes of the surrounding regions to submit.<ref>ASC, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in Whitelock 1979 912, 914, 917</ref> The key to this warfare was sieges and the control of fortified places. It is clear that the new fortresses had permanent garrisons, and that they were supported by the inhabitants of the existing burhs when danger threatened. This is brought out most clearly in the description of the campaigns of 917 in the ''Chronicle'', but throughout the conquest of the Danelaw by Edward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d it is clear that a sophisticated and coordinated strategy was being applied.<ref>Campbell, J. 1981: The Anglo-Saxons (Oxford).</ref>\n\nIn 973, a single currency was introduced into England in order to bring about political unification, but by concentrating bullion production at many coastal mints, the new rulers of England created an obvious target which attracted a new wave of Viking invasions, which came close to breaking up the kingdom of the English. From 980 onwards, the ''Anglo -Saxon Chronicle'' records renewed raiding against England. At first, the raids were probing ventures by small numbers of ships' crews, but soon grew in size and effect, until the only way of dealing with the Vikings appeared to be to pay protection money to buy them off: \"And in that year [991] it was determined that tribute should first be paid to the Danish men because of the great terror they were causing along the coast. The first payment was 10,000 pounds.\"<ref>[[Julian D. Richards|Richards, Julian D.]] (2013-06-01). Viking Age England (Kindle Locations 418\u2013422). The History Press.

This affected everyone in the kingdom.\n\n=== Settlements and working life ===\n[[File:West Stow Anglo-Saxon village 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Panorama of the reconstructed 7th century village]]\nHelena Hamerow suggests that the prevailing model of working life and settlement, particularly for the early period, was one of shifting settlement and building tribal kinship. The mid-Saxon period saw diversification, the development of enclosures, the beginning of the toft system, closer management of livestock, the gradual spread of the mould-board plough, 'informally regular plots' and a greater permanence, with further settlement consolidation thereafter foreshadowing post-Norman Conquest villages. The later periods saw a proliferation of service features including barns, mills and latrines, most markedly on high-status sites. Throughout the Anglo-Saxon period as Hamerow suggests, \"local and extended kin groups remained...the essential unit of production\". This is very noticeable in the early period. However, by the tenth and eleventh centuries, the rise of the manor and its significance in terms of both settlement and the management of land, which becomes very evident in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref name=\"Hamerow, Helena 2012\">Hamerow, Helena. Rural Settlements and Society in Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford University Press, 2012.</ref>\n\nThe collection of buildings discovered at [[Yeavering]] formed part of an Anglo-Saxon [[royal vill]] or king's tun. These 'tun' consisted of a series of buildings designed to provide short-term accommodation for the king and his household. It is thought that the king would have travelled throughout his land dispensing justice and authority and collecting rents from his various estates. Such visits would be periodic, and it is likely that he would visit each royal villa only once or twice per year. The Latin term ''villa regia'' which Bede uses of the site suggests an estate centre as the functional heart of a territory held in the king's demesne. The territory is the land whose surplus production is taken into the centre as food-render to support the king and his retinue on their periodic visits as part of a progress around the kingdom. This territorial model, known as a [[Anglo-Saxon multiple estate|multiple estate]] or [[shire]], has been developed in a range of studies. Colm O'Brien, in applying this to Yeavering, proposes a geographical definition of the wider shire of Yeavering and also a geographical definition of the principal estate whose structures Hope-Taylor excavated.<ref>O'Brien C (2002) The Early Medieval Shires of Yeavering, Bamburgh and Breamish. Archaeologia Aeliana 5th Series, 30, 53\u201373.</ref> One characteristic that the king's tun shared with some other groups of places is that it was a point of public assembly. People came together not only to give the king and his entourage board and lodging; but they attended upon the king in order to have disputes settled, cases appealed, lands granted, gifts given, appointments made, laws promulgated, policy debated, and ambassadors heard. People also assembled for other reasons, such as to hold fairs and to trade.<ref name=\"Sawyer, Peter 2013\">Sawyer, Peter. The Wealth of Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford University Press, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe first creations of towns are linked to a system of specialism at individual settlements, which is evidenced in studying place-names. Sutterton, \"shoe-makers' tun\" (in the area of the Danelaw such places are Sutterby) was so named because local circumstances allowed the growth of a craft recognised by the people of surrounding places. Similarly with Sapperton, the \"soap-makers' tun\". While Boultham, the \"meadow with burdock plants\", may well have developed a specialism in the production of burrs for wool-carding, since meadows with burdock merely growing in them must have been relatively numerous. From places named for their services or location within a single district, a category of which the most obvious perhaps are the Eastons and Westons, it is possible to move outwards to glimpse component settlements within larger economic units. Names betray some role within a system of seasonal pasture, Winderton in Warwickshire is the winter tun and various Somertons are self-explanatory. Hardwicks are dairy farms and Swinhopes the valleys where pigs were pastured.<ref>Higham, Nicholas J., and Martin J. Ryan, eds. Place-names, Language and the Anglo-Saxon Landscape. Vol. 10. Boydell Press, 2011.</ref>\n\nSettlement patterns as well as village plans in England fall into two great categories: scattered farms and homesteads in upland and woodland Britain, nucleated villages across a swathe of central England.<ref>Pickles, Thomas. \"The Landscape Archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England, ed.

OUP Oxford, 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Women, children and slaves ===\nAlfred's view of his society overlooks certain classes of people. The main division in Anglo-Saxon society was between slave and free. Both groups were hierarchically structured, with several classes of freemen and many types of slaves. These varied at different times and in different areas, but the most prominent ranks within free society were the king, the nobleman or thegn, and the ordinary freeman or ceorl. They were differentiated primarily by the value of their [[weregild]] or 'man price', which was not only the amount payable in compensation for homicide, but was also used as the basis for other legal formulations such as the value of the oath that they could swear in a court of law. Slaves had no weregild, as offences against them were taken to be offences against their owners, but the earliest laws set out a detailed scale of penalties depending both on the type of slave and the rank of owner.<ref>Anglo-Saxon Dictionary edited by Joseph Bosworth, T. Northcote Toller and Alistair Campbell (1972), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-863101-4}}.</ref>\n\nA certain amount of social mobility is implied by regulations detailing the conditions under which a ceorl could become a thegn. Again these would have been subject to local variation, but one text refers to the possession of five hides of land (around 600 acres), a bell and a castle-gate, a seat and a special office in the king's hall. In the context of the control of [[Ancient borough|boroughs]], [[Frank Stenton]] notes that according to an 11th-century source, \"a merchant who had carried out three voyages at his own charge [had also been] regarded as of thegnly status.\"{{sfn|Stenton|1987|p=530}}<!-- Annoyingly Stenton refers only to \"a well-known English tract\": it's \"Ge\u00feync\u00f0o\", q.v. --> Loss of status could also occur, as with penal slavery, which could be imposed not only on the perpetrator of a crime but on his wife and family. Some slaves may have been members of the native British population conquered by the Anglo-Saxons when they arrived from the continent; others may have been captured in wars between the early kingdoms, or have sold themselves for food in times of famine. However, slavery was not always permanent, and slaves who had gained their freedom would become part of an underclass of freedmen below the rank of ceorl.<ref>Stenton, F. M. \"The Thriving of the Anglo-Saxon Ceorl.\" Preparatory to Anglo-Saxon England (1970): 383\u201393.</ref>\n\nAnglo-Saxon women appear to have enjoyed considerable independence, whether as abbesses of the great 'double monasteries' of monks and nuns founded during the seventh and eighth centuries, as major land-holders recorded in Domesday Book (1086), or as ordinary members of society. They could act as principals in legal transactions, were entitled to the same weregild as men of the same class, and were considered 'oath-worthy', with the right to defend themselves on oath against false accusations or claims. Sexual and other offences against them were penalised heavily. There is evidence that even married women could own property independently, and some surviving wills are in the joint names of husband and wife.<ref>Klinck, A. L., 'Anglo-Saxon women and the law', Journal of Medieval History 8 (1982), 107\u201321.</ref> Marriage comprised a contract between the woman's family and the prospective bridegroom, who was required to pay a 'bride-price' in advance of the wedding and a 'morning gift' following its consummation. The latter became the woman's personal property, but the former may have been paid to her relatives, at least during the early period. Widows were in a particularly favourable position, with inheritance rights, custody of their children and authority over dependents. However, a degree of vulnerability may be reflected in laws stating that they should not be forced into nunneries or second marriages against their will. The system of [[primogeniture]] (inheritance by the first-born male) was not introduced to England until after the Norman Conquest, so Anglo-Saxon siblings \u2013 girls as well as boys \u2013 were more equal in terms of status. The age of majority was usually either ten or twelve, when a child could legally take charge of inherited property, or be held responsible for a crime.<ref>Rivers, T. J., 'Widows' rights in Anglo-Saxon law', American Journal of Legal History 19 (1975), 208\u201315.</ref> It was common for children to be fostered, either in other households or in monasteries, perhaps as a means of extending the circle of protection beyond the kin group. Laws also make provision for orphaned children and foundlings.<ref>Fell, C., Women in Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford, 1984).</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon architecture}}\n[[File:Saxon palace at Cheddar.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Reconstruction of the Anglo-Saxon royal palace at Cheddar around 1000]]\nEarly Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, not using masonry except in foundations but constructed mainly using timber with [[thatch]] roofing. Generally preferring not to settle within the old Roman cities, the Anglo-Saxons built small towns near their centres of agriculture, at fords in rivers, or near natural ports. In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth.<ref>[[History of York|York]] and [[History of London|London]] both offer examples of this trend.</ref>\n\nOnly ten of the hundreds of settlement sites that have been excavated in England from this period have revealed masonry domestic structures and confined to a few specific contexts.  Timber was the natural building medium of the age:<ref>Turner, H. L. (1970), Town Defences in England and Wales: An Architectural and Documentary Study A. D. 900\u20131500 (London: John Baker)</ref> the Anglo\u2013Saxon word for \"building\" is ''timbe''. Unlike in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] world, late Anglo\u2013Saxon royal halls continued to be of timber in the manner of [[Yeavering]] centuries before, even though the king could clearly have mustered the resources to build in stone.<ref>Higham, R. and Barker, P. (1992), Timber Castles (London: B. T. Batsford):193</ref> Their preference must have been a conscious choice, perhaps an expression of deeply\u2013embedded Germanic identity on the part of the Anglo\u2013Saxon royalty.\n\nEven the elite had simple buildings, with a central fire and a hole in the roof to let the smoke escape; the largest homes rarely had more than one floor and one room. Buildings varied widely in size, most were square or rectangular, though some round houses have been found. Frequently these buildings have sunken floors, with a shallow pit over which a plank floor was suspended. The pit may have been used for storage, but more likely was filled with straw for insulation. A variation on the sunken floor design has been found in towns, where the \"basement\" may be as deep as 9 feet, suggesting a storage or work area below a suspended floor. Another common design was simple post framing, with heavy posts set directly into the ground, supporting the roof. The space between the posts was filled in with wattle and daub, or occasionally, planks. The floors were generally packed earth, though planks were sometimes used. Roofing materials varied, with thatch being the most common, though turf and even wooden shingles were also used.<ref name=\"Hamerow, Helena 2012\" />\n[[File:EarlsBartonChurch.JPG|thumb|left|Distinctive Anglo-Saxon pilaster strips on the tower of [[All Saints' Church, Earls Barton]]]]\n\nStone was sometimes used to build churches. Bede makes it clear that the masonry construction of churches, including his own at Jarrow, was undertaken ''morem Romanorum'', 'in the manner of the Romans,' in explicit contrast to existing traditions of timber construction. Even at Canterbury, Bede believed that St Augustine's first cathedral had been 'repaired' or 'recovered' (''recuperavit'') from an existing Roman church, when in fact it had been newly constructed from Roman materials. The belief was \"the Christian Church was Roman therefore a masonry church was a Roman building\".\n\nThe building of churches in Anglo-Saxon England essentially began with [[Augustine of Canterbury]] in Kent following 597; for this he probably imported workmen from [[Francia|Frankish Gaul]]. The [[Canterbury Cathedral|cathedral and abbey in Canterbury]], together with churches in Kent at [[Minster, Swale|Minster in Sheppey]] (c.664) and [[St Mary's Church, Reculver|Reculver]] (669), and in Essex at the [[Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall]] at [[Bradwell-on-Sea]], define the earliest type in southeast England. A simple nave without aisles provided the setting for the main altar; east of this a chancel arch separated the apse for use by the clergy. Flanking the apse and east end of the nave were side chambers serving as sacristies; further [[porticus]] might continue along the nave to provide for burials and other purposes. In Northumbria the early development of Christianity was influenced by the Irish mission, important churches being built in timber. Masonry churches became prominent from the late 7th century with the foundations of [[Wilfrid]] at [[Ripon]] and [[Hexham]], and of [[Benedict Biscop]] at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow. These buildings had long naves and small rectangular chancels; porticus sometimes surrounded the naves. Elaborate crypts are a feature of Wilfrid's buildings. The best preserved early Northumbrian church is [[Escomb Church]].<ref name=\"Wilkinson, David John 1964\">Wilkinson, David John, and Alan McWhirr.

Cotswold Archaeological Trust, 1998.</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-8th century to the mid-10th century, several important buildings survive. One group comprises the first known churches utilizing aisles: [[All Saints' Church, Brixworth|Brixworth]], the most ambitious Anglo-Saxon church to survive largely intact; [[Lady St. Mary Church, Wareham|Wareham St Mary's]]; Cirencester; and the rebuilding of [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. These buildings may be compared with churches in the [[Carolingian Empire]]. Other lesser churches may be dated to the late eighth and early ninth centuries on the basis of their elaborate sculptured decoration and have simple naves with side porticus.<ref>Whitehead, Matthew Alexander, and J. D. Whitehead. The Saxon Church, Escomb. 1979.</ref> The tower of [[St John the Baptist's Church, Barnack|Barnack]] hearkens to the West Saxon reconquest in the early 10th century, when decorative features that were to be characteristic of Late Anglo-Saxon architecture were already developed, such as narrow raised bands of stone (pilaster strips) to surround archways and to articulate wall surfaces, as at [[St Peter's Church, Barton-upon-Humber|Barton-upon-Humber]] and [[All Saints' Church, Earls Barton|Earls Barton]]. In plan, however, the churches remained essentially conservative.\n\nFrom the monastic revival of the second half of the tenth century, only a few documented buildings survive or have been excavated. Examples include the abbeys of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]]; [[Old Minster, Winchester]]; [[Romsey Abbey|Romsey]]; [[Cholsey Abbey|Cholsey]]; and [[Peterborough Cathedral]]. The majority of churches that have been described as Anglo-Saxon fall into the period between the late 10th century and the early 12th century. During this period, many settlements were first provided with stone churches, but timber also continued to be used; the best wood-framed church to survive is [[Greensted Church]] in Essex, no earlier than the 9th century, and no doubt typical of many parish churches. On the continent during the eleventh century, a group of interrelated [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] styles developed, associated with the rebuilding of many churches on a grand scale, made possible by a general advance in architectural technology and mason-craft.<ref name=\"Wilkinson, David John 1964\" />\n\nThe first fully Romanesque church in England was Edward the Confessor's rebuilding of Westminster Abbey (c.1042-60, now entirely lost to later construction), while the main development of the style only followed the Norman Conquest. However, at [[Stow Minster]] the crossing piers of the early 1050s are clearly proto-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. A more decorative interpretation of Romanesque in lesser churches can be dated only somewhere between the mid and late 11th century, e.g. [[Hadstock]] (Essex), [[Clayton, West Sussex|Clayton]] and [[Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting|Sompting]] (Sussex); this style continued towards the end of the century as at Milborne Port (Somerset). At St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury (c.1048\u201361) Abbot Wulfric aimed to retain the earlier churches while linking them with an octagonal rotunda, but the concept was still essentially [[Pre-Romanesque architecture|Pre-Romanesque]]. Anglo-Saxon churches of all periods would have been embellished with a range of arts,<ref>Conant, Kenneth John. Carolingian and Romanesque architecture, 800 to 1200. Vol. 13.

Characteristic of the 5th century is the [[Quoit (brooch)|quoit brooch]] with motifs based on crouching animals, as seen on the silver quoit brooch from [[Sarre, Kent]]. While the origins of this style are disputed, it is either an offshoot of provincial Roman art, Frank, or Jute art. One style flourished from the late 5th century, and continued throughout the 6th, and is on many square-headed brooches, it is characterised by [[chip carving|chip-carved]] patterns based on animals and masks. A different style, which gradually superseded it is dominated by serpentine beasts with interlacing bodies.<ref>Suzuki, Seiichi.

The possible symbolism of the decorative elements like [[interlace (art)|interlace]] and beast forms that were used in these early works remains unclear, it is clear. These objects were the products of a society that invested its modest surpluses in personal display, who fostered craftsmen and jewellers of a high standard, and a society where the possession of a fine brooch or buckle was a valuable status symbol and possible tribal emblem \u2013 in death as much as in life.<ref name=\"Richards, Julian D 1992\">[[Julian D.

It also shows that, superb though individual pieces may be in terms of craftsmanship, the value of such items as currency and their potential roles as tribute or the spoils of war could, in a warrior society, outweigh appreciation of their integrity and artistry.<ref name=\"Sawyer, Peter 2013\" />\n\nThe coming of Christianity revolutionised the visual arts, as well as other aspects of society. Art had to fulfil new functions, and whereas pagan art was abstract, Christianity required images clearly representing subjects. The transition between the Christian and pagan traditions is occasionally apparent in 7th century works; examples include the Crundale buckle<ref name=\"Adams, No\u00ebl 2010\" /> and the Canterbury pendant.<ref>Mills, Allan A. \"The Canterbury Pendant: A Saxon Seasonal-Hour Altitude Dial.\" PI Drinkwater:'Comments upon the Canterbury Pendant', and AJ Turner:'The Canterbury Dial', Bull BSS 95.2 (1995): 95.</ref> In addition to fostering metalworking skills, Christianity stimulated stone sculpture and [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]]. In these Germanic motifs, such as interlace and animal ornament along with Celtic spiral patterns, are juxtaposed with Christian imagery and Mediterranean decoration, notably vine-scroll. The [[Ruthwell Cross]], [[Bewcastle Cross]] and [[Easby Cross]] are leading Northumbrian examples of the Anglo-Saxon version of the Celtic [[high cross]], generally with a slimmer shaft.\n\nThe jamb of the doorway at [[Monkwearmouth]], carved with a pair of [[lacertine]] beasts, probably dates from the 680s; the golden, garnet-adorned pectoral cross of St [[Cuthbert]] was presumably made before 687; while [[St Cuthbert's coffin|his wooden inner coffin]] (incised with Christ and the [[Evangelists' symbols]], the Virgin and Child, archangels and apostles), the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], and the [[Codex Amiatinus]] all date from c.700. The fact that these works are all from Northumbria might be held to reflect the particular strength of the church in that kingdom during the second half of the century.<ref>[[Leslie Webster (art historian)|Leslie Webster]], [[Janet Backhouse]], and Marion Archibald. The Making of England: Anglo-Saxon Art and Culture, AD 600\u2013900.

The Lindisfarne Gospels might be the single most beautiful book produced in the Middle Ages, and the [[Echternach Gospels]] and (probably) the [[Book of Durrow]] are other products of Lindisfarne.

Some fine decorated southern books, above all the Bible fragment<!-- which? Something missing here -->, can be securely assigned to the earlier 9th century, owing to the similarity of their script to that of charters from that period; The [[Book of Cerne]] is an early 9th century Insular or [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Latin]] personal prayer book with [[Old English]] components. This manuscript was decorated and embellished with four painted full-page miniatures, major and minor letters, continuing panels, and litterae notibiliores.<ref>Brown 1996, pp. 70, 73.</ref> Further decorated motifs used in these manuscripts, such as hunched, triangular beasts, also appear on objects from the [[Trewhiddle]] hoard (buried in the 870s) and on the rings which bear the names of King [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex|\u00c6thelwulf]] and Queen [[\u00c6thelswith]], which are the centre of a small corpus of fine ninth-century metalwork.\n\nThere was demonstrable continuity in the south, even though the Danish settlement represented a watershed in England's artistic tradition. Wars and pillaging removed or destroyed much Anglo-Saxon art, while the settlement introduced new Scandinavian craftsmen and patrons. The result was to accentuate the pre-existing distinction between the art of the north and that of the south.<ref>Reynolds, Andrew, and [[Leslie Webster (art historian)|Webster, Leslie]]. \"Early Medieval Art and Archaeology in the Northern World.\" (2013).</ref> In the 10th and 11th centuries, the Viking dominated areas were characterised by stone sculpture in which the Anglo-Saxon tradition of cross shafts took on new forms, and a distinctive Anglo-Scandinavian monument, the 'hogback' tomb, was produced.<ref>O'Sullivan, Deirdre. \"Normanising the North: The Evidence of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Scandinavian Sculpture.\" Medieval Archaeology 55.1 (2011): 163\u2013191.</ref> The decorative motifs used on these northern carvings (as on items of personal adornment or everyday use) echo Scandinavian styles. The [[#King Alfred and the rebuilding (878-899)|Wessexan hegemony]] and the [[#Reform and formation of England (899-978)|monastic reform movement]] appear to have been the catalysts for the rebirth of art in southern England from the end of the 9th century. Here artists responded primarily to continental art; foliage supplanting interlace as the preferred decorative motif. Key early works are the [[Alfred Jewel]], which has fleshy leaves engraved on the back plate; and the stole and maniples of Bishop [[Frithestan]] of Winchester, which are ornamented with [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves, alongside figures that bear the stamp of [[Byzantine art]]. The surviving evidence points to Winchester and Canterbury as the leading centres of manuscript art in the second half of the 10th century: they developed colourful paintings with lavish foliate borders, and coloured line drawings.\n\nBy the early 11th century, these two traditions had fused and had spread to other centres. Although manuscripts dominate the corpus, sufficient architectural sculpture, [[ivory carving]] and metalwork survives to show that the same styles were current in secular art, and became widespread in the south at parochial level. The wealth of England in the later tenth and eleventh century is clearly reflected in the lavish use of gold in manuscript art as well as for vessels, textiles and statues (now known only from descriptions). Widely admired, southern English art was highly influential in Normandy, France and [[Flanders]] from c.1000.<ref>[[Janet Backhouse]], Derek Howard Turner, and [[Leslie Webster (art historian)|Leslie Webster]], eds.

Old English is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] closely related to [[Old Frisian]] and [[Old Saxon]]. It had a grammar similar in many ways to [[Classical Latin]]. In most respects, including its grammar, it was much closer to modern [[German language|German]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] than to modern English. It was fully [[inflection|inflected]] with five [[grammatical case]]s ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], and [[instrumental case|instrumental]]), three [[grammatical number]]s ([[wikt:singular|singular]], [[plural]], and [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]]) and three [[grammatical gender]]s ([[masculine]], [[feminine]], and [[neuter gender|neuter]]). The dual forms occurred in the first and second persons only and referred to groups of two.\n\nSome of the characteristics of the language were: adjectives, pronouns and (sometimes) participles that agreed with their antecedent nouns in case, number and gender; finite verbs that agreed with their subject in person and number; and [[noun]]s that came in numerous [[declension]]s (with deep parallels in [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]]). [[Verb]]s came in nine main [[Conjugation (grammar)|conjugations]] (seven ''strong'' and two ''weak''), each with numerous subtypes, as well as a few additional smaller conjugations and a handful of irregular verbs. The main difference from other ancient Indo-European languages, such as [[Latin]], is that verbs can be conjugated in only two tenses (vs. the six \"tenses\"&nbsp;\u2013 really tense/aspect combinations&nbsp;\u2013 of Latin), and have no synthetic passive voice (although it did still exist in [[Gothic language|Gothic]]). Gender in [[noun]]s was [[grammatical gender|grammatical]], as opposed to the [[natural gender]] that prevails in modern English.\n\nMany linguists believe that Old English received little influence from the local insular languages, especially [[Common Brittonic]] (the language that may have been the majority language in Lowland Britain, although it's also possible that [[British Latin]] had already replaced it in this region). Linguists such as [[Richard Coates]] have suggested there could not have been meaningful contact between the languages, which is reasonable argued from the small amount of [[loanword]]s. Recently a number of linguists have argued that many of the grammar changes observed in English were due to a Brittonic influence (see [[Brittonicisms in English]]). [[John McWhorter]] suggests that the language changes seen later in English were always there in vernacular speech and this was not written, especially since those who did the writing were educated individuals that most likely spoke a standard form of Old English. The speech of an illiterate ''[[Churl|ceorl]]'', on the other hand, can not be reconstructed.<ref>McWhorter, John. 2008. Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue: the Untold Story of English. New York: Penguin Group.</ref> The progressive nature of this language acquisition, and the \"retrospective reworking\" of kinship ties to the dominant group led, ultimately, to the \"myths which tied the entire society to immigration as an explanation of their origins in Britain\".<ref>Higham, N. 1992. ''Rome, Britain and the Anglo-Saxons''. Guildford: Seaby p229-230</ref>\n\nWhat survives through writing represents primarily the register of Anglo-Saxon, and this is most often in the [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon dialect]]. Little is known about the everyday spoken language of people living in the migration period. Old English is a [[Language contact|contact language]] and it is hard to reconstruct the [[pidgin]] used in this period from the written language found in the West Saxon literature of some 400 years later. Two general theories are proposed regarding why people changed their language to Old English (or an early form of such): either, a person or household changed so as to serve an elite; or, a person or household changed through choice as it provided some advantage economically or legally.<ref>Killie, Kristin. \"Old English\u2013Late British language contact and the English progressive.\" Language Contact and Development Around the North Sea 321 (2012): p119</ref> Over time, Old English developed into four major dialects: Northumbrian, spoken north of the river Humber; Mercian, spoken in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]]; Kentish, spoken in [[Kent]] in the far southeastern part of the island; and West Saxon, spoken in the southwest. All of these dialects have direct descendants in modern England, and [[American English#Regional differences|American regional dialects]] also have their roots in the dialects of Old English. \"Standard\" Modern English (if there is such a thing), or at least modern English spelling, owes most to the Anglian dialect, since that was the dialect of London.<ref>Kemola, Juhani. 2000 \"The Origins of the Northern Subject Rule \u2013 A Case of Early contact?\"</ref>\n\nNear the end of the Old English period the English language underwent a third foreign influence, namely the Scandinavian influence of [[Old Norse]]. In addition to a great many [[toponym|place names]], these consist mainly of items of basic vocabulary, and words concerned with particular administrative aspects of the [[Danelaw]] (that is, the area of land under Viking control, which included extensive holdings all along the eastern coast of England and [[Scotland]]). The Scandinavians spoke [[Old Norse]], a language related to Old English in that both derived from the same ancestral [[Proto-Germanic language]]. It is very common for the intermixing of speakers of different dialects, such as those that occur during times of political unrest, to result in a [[mixed language]], and one theory holds that exactly such a mixture of Old Norse and Old English is thought to have accelerated the decline of case endings in Old English.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Charles|title=The English Language: A Historical Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-67001-2|page=137}}</ref> The [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|influence of Old Norse on the lexicon of the English language]] has been profound: responsible for such basic vocabulary items as ''[[wikt:sky|sky]]'', ''[[wikt:leg|leg]]'', the [[pronoun]] ''[[wikt:they|they]]'' and hundreds of other words.<ref name=\"Shay2008\">{{cite book|author =Scott Shay|title=The history of English: a linguistic introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1vj0-f_U1SQC&pg=PA86|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=30 January 2008|publisher=Wardja Press|isbn=978-0-615-16817-3|page=86}}</ref>\n\nNick Higham <!-- NB! Not the mathematician! Do not link to [[Nicholas Higham]]--> has provided a summary of the importance of language to the Anglo-Saxon culture:\n{{quote|As Bede later implied, language was a key indicator of ethnicity in early England. In circumstances where freedom at law, acceptance with the kindred, access to patronage, and the use of possession of weapons were all exclusive to those who could claim Germanic descent, then speaking Old English without Latin or Brittonic inflection had considerable value.<ref name=\"Higham, Nicholas J. 2013\" />}}\n\n=== Kinship ===\n[[Helena Hamerow]] has made an observation that in Anglo-Saxon society \"local and extended kin groups remained...the essential unit of production throughout the Anglo-Saxon period\". \"Local and extended kin groups\" was a key aspect of Anglo-Saxon culture. Kinship fueled societal advantages, freedom and the relationships to an elite, that allowed the Anglo-Saxons' culture and language to flourish.<ref>Hamerow, Helena. Rural Settlements and Society in Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford University Press, 2012.p166</ref>\n\nThe ties of loyalty to a lord, were to the person of a lord, not to his station; there was no real concept of patriotism or loyalty to a cause. This explains why dynasties waxed and waned so quickly, a kingdom was only as strong as its leader-king. There was no underlying administration or bureaucracy to maintain any gains beyond the lifetime of a leader. An example of this was the leadership of [[R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia]] and how the East Anglian primacy did not survive his death.<ref>Fisher, Genevieve. \"Kingdom and community in early Anglo-Saxon eastern England.\" Regional approaches to mortuary analysis. Springer US, 1995. 147\u2013166.</ref> Kings could not, except in exceptional circumstances, make new laws. Their role instead was to uphold and clarify previous custom and to assure his subjects that he would uphold their ancient privileges, laws, and customs. Although the person of the king as a leader could be exalted, the office of kingship was not in any sense as powerful or as invested with authority as it was to become. One of the tools kings used was to tie themselves closely to the new Christian church; through the practice of having a church leader anoint and crown the king; God and king were joined in peoples' minds.<ref>Lynch, Joseph H. Christianizing kinship: ritual sponsorship in Anglo-Saxon England. Cornell University Press, 1998</ref>\n\nThe ties of kinship meant that the relatives of a murdered person were obliged to exact vengeance for his or her death. This led to bloody and extensive feuds. As a way out of this deadly and futile custom the system of 'wergilds' was instituted. The 'wergild' set a monetary value on each person's life according to their wealth and social status. This value could also be used to set the fine payable if a person was injured or offended against. Robbing a thane called for a higher penalty than robbing a ceorl. On the other hand, a thane who thieved could pay a higher fine than a ceorl who did likewise. Men were willing to die for the lord and to support their 'comitatus'; their warrior band. Evidence of this behavior (though it may be more a literary ideal than an actual social practice), can be observed in the story, made famous in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' entry for 755, of Cynewulf and Cyneheard, in which the followers of a defeated king decided to fight to the death rather than be reconciled after the death of their lord.<ref>Hough, C. \"Wergild.\" (1999): 469\u2013470.</ref>\n\nThis emphasis on social standing affected all parts of the Anglo-Saxon world. The courts, for example did not attempt to discover the facts in a case; instead, in any dispute it was up to each party to get as many people as possible to swear to the rightness of their case; \"oath-swearing\". The word of a thane counted for that of six ceorls.<ref>Harrison, Mark. Anglo-Saxon Thegn AD 449\u20131066. Vol. 5. Osprey Publishing, 1993</ref> It was assumed that any person of good character would be able to find enough people to swear to his innocence that his case would prosper. Anglo-Saxon society was also decidedly patriarchal, but women were in some ways better off than they would be in later times. A woman could own property in her own right. She could and did rule a kingdom if her husband died. She could not be married without her consent and any personal goods, including lands, that she brought into a marriage remained her own property. If she were injured or abused in her marriage her relatives were expected to look after her interests.<ref>Fell, Christine E., Cecily Clark, and Elizabeth Williams. Women in Anglo-Saxon England. Blackwell, 1987</ref>\n\n=== Law ===\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon laws}}\n[[File:Law of \u00c6thelberht.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|The initial page of Rochester Cathedral Library, MS A.3.5, the ''[[Textus Roffensis]],'' which contains the only surviving copy of \u00c6thelberht's laws.]]\nThe most noticeable feature of the Anglo-Saxon legal system is the apparent prevalence of legislation in the form of law codes. The early Anglo-Saxons were organised in various small kingdoms often corresponding to later shires or counties. The kings of these small kingdoms issued written Laws, one of earliest of which is that attributed to Ethelbert, king of Kent, ca.560\u2013616.<ref>Simpson, A.W.B. 'The Laws of Ethelbert' in Arnold et al. (1981) 3.</ref> The Anglo-Saxon law codes follow a pattern found in continental Europe where other groups of the former Roman empire encountered government dependent upon written sources of law and hastened to display the claims of their own native traditions by reducing them to writing. These legal systems should not be thought of as operating like modern legislation, rather they are educational and political tools designed to demonstrate standards of good conduct rather than act as criteria for subsequent legal judgment.<ref>Baker, J.H. An Introduction to English Legal History. (London: Butterworths, 1990) 3rd edition, {{ISBN|0-406-53101-3}}, Chapters 1\u20132.</ref>\n\nAlthough not themselves sources of law, Anglo-Saxon charters are a most valuable historical source for tracing the actual legal practices of the various Anglo-Saxon communities. A charter was a written document from a king or other authority confirming a grant either of land or some other valuable right. Their prevalence in the Anglo-Saxon state is a sign of sophistication. They were frequently appealed to and relied upon in litigation. Making grants and confirming those made by others was a major way in which Anglo-Saxon kings demonstrated their authority.<ref>Milsom, S.F.C. Historical Foundations of the Common Law. (London: Butterworths, 1981) 2nd edition, {{ISBN|0-406-62503-4}} (limp), 1\u201323.</ref>\n\nThe royal council or witan played a central but limited role in the Anglo-Saxon period. The main feature of the system was its high degree of decentralisation. The interference by the king through his granting of charters and the activity of his witan in litigation are exceptions rather than the rule in Anglo-Saxon times.<ref>Robertson, Agnes Jane, ed. Anglo-Saxon Charters. Vol. 1. Cambridge University Press, 2009.</ref> The most important court in the later Anglo-Saxon period was the Shire Court. It is of interest that many shires (such as Kent and Sussex) were in the early days of the Anglo-Saxon settlement the centre of small independent kingdoms. As the kings first of Mercia and then of Wessex slowly extended their authority over the whole of England they left the Shire Courts with overall responsibility for the administration of law.<ref>Milsom, S.F.C. Historical Foundations of the Common Law. (London: Butterworths, 1981) 2nd edition, {{ISBN|0-406-62503-4}} (limp), 1\u201323</ref> The Shire met in one or more traditional places, earlier in the open air and then later in a Moot or meeting hall. The meeting of the Shire Court was presided over by an officer, the shire reeve or sheriff, whose appointment came in later Anglo-Saxon times into the hands of the king but had in earlier times been elective. The sheriff was not the judge of the court, merely its president. The judges of the court were all those who had the right and duty of attending the court, the suitors. These were originally all free male inhabitants of the neighbourhood but, over time, suit of court became an obligation attached to particular holdings of land. The sessions of a Shire Court resembled more closely those of a modern local administrative body than a modern court. It could and did act judicially but this was not its prime function. In the Shire Court, charters and writs would be read out for all to hear.<ref>Pollock, F. and Maitland, F.M. A History of English Law. Two volumes. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1898 reprinted 1968) 2nd edition, {{ISBN|0-521-07061-9}} and {{ISBN|0-521-09515-8}}, Volume I, Chapter 1.</ref>\n\nBelow the level of the shire each county was divided into areas known as hundreds (or wapentakes in the north of England). These were original groups of families rather than geographical areas. The Hundred Court was a smaller version of the shire, presided over by the hundred bailiff, formerly a sheriff's appointment, but over the years many hundreds fell into the private hands of a local large landowner. We are not well-informed about Hundred Court business, which must have been a mix of the administrative and judicial, but they remained in some areas an important forum for the settlement of local disputes well into the post-Conquest period.<ref>Reynolds, Andrew. \"Judicial culture and social complexity: a general model from Anglo-Saxon England.\" World Archaeology ahead-of-print (2014): 1\u201315.</ref> The Anglo-Saxon system put an emphasis upon compromise and arbitration: litigating parties were enjoined to settle their differences if at all possible. If they persisted in bringing a case for decision before a Shire Court then it could be determined there. The suitors of the court would pronounce a judgment which fixed how the case would be decided: legal problems were considered to be too complex and difficult for mere human decision and so proof or demonstration of the right would depend upon some irrational, non-human criterion. The normal methods of proof were oath-helping or the ordeal.<ref name=\"Hyams, P 1981\">Hyams, P. 'Trial by ordeal: the key to proof in the early common law' in Arnold, M.S. et al.. (eds) On the Laws and Customs of England: Essays in honor of S.E. Thorne. (Harvard: Harvard University Press, 1981) {{ISBN|0-8078-1434-2}}, p. 90.</ref>\n\nOath-helping involved the party undergoing proof swearing to the truth of his claim or denial and having that oath reinforced by five or more others, chosen either by the party or by the court. The numbers of helpers required and the form of their oath differed from place to place and upon the nature of the dispute.<ref>Leeson, Peter T. \"Ordeals.\" Journal of Law and Economics 55.3 (2012): 691\u2013714.</ref> If either the party or any of the helpers failed in the oath, either refusing to take it or sometimes even making an error in the required formula, the proof failed and the case was adjudged to the other side. It appears surprising to moderns that so important a matter might be settled by one and his friends falsely swearing an oath. In a society in which each was known to his neighbour and in which religious emphasis was placed upon the sanctity of an oath, the system was probably more satisfactory. As 'wager of law' it remained a way of determining cases in the common law until its abolition in the 19th century.<ref>Higham, Nicholas, and Martin J. Ryan. The Anglo-Saxon World. Yale University Press, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe ordeal offered an alternative for those unable or unwilling to swear an oath. The two most common methods were the ordeal by hot iron and by cold water. The former consisted in carrying a red-hot iron for five paces: the wound was immediately bound up and if, on unbinding, it was found to be festering the case was lost. In the ordeal by water the victim, usually an accused person, was cast bound into water: if he sunk he was innocent, if he floated, guilty. Although for perhaps understandable reasons the ordeals became associated with trials in criminal matters they were in essence tests of the truth of a claim or denial of a party and appropriate for trying any\nlegal issue. The allocation of a mode of proof and who should bear it was the substance of the Shire Court's judgment or doom and perhaps followed known customary rules of which we have no knowledge. Some measure of discretion must have existed in the determining of the outcome of an ordeal by hot iron but result of the cold water and the oath-helping would have been obvious to all.<ref name=\"Hyams, P 1981\" />\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon literature}}\n[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|First page of the epic ''[[Beowulf]]'']]\nOld English literary works include genres such as [[epic poem|epic poetry]], [[hagiography]], [[sermon]]s, [[Old English Bible translations|Bible translations]], legal works, [[chronicle]]s, mainly the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', [[Anglo-Saxon riddles|riddles]] and others. In all there are about 400 surviving [[manuscript]]s from the period, a significant corpus of both popular interest and specialist research. The manuscripts use a modified [[Roman alphabet]], but [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] or ''futhorc'' are used in under 200 inscriptions on objects, sometimes mixed with Roman letters.\n\nThis literature is remarkable for being in the vernacular (Old English) in the early medieval period: almost all other written literature was in Latin at this time, but due to Alfred's programme of vernacular literacy, the oral traditions of Anglo-Saxon England ended up being converted into writing and preserved. We owe much of this preservation to the monks of the tenth century, who made \u2013 at the very least \u2013 the copies of most of the literary manuscripts that still exist. Manuscripts were not common items. They were expensive and hard to make.<ref>Karkov, Catherine E. The Art of Anglo-Saxon England. Vol. 1. Boydell Press, 2011.</ref> First, cows or sheep had to be slaughtered and their skins tanned. Then people had to decide to use this leather for manuscripts rather than for any of the other things leather can be used for. The leather was then scraped, stretched, and cut into sheets, which were sewn into books. Then inks had to be made from oak galls and other ingredients, and the books had to be hand written by monks using quill pens. Every manuscript is slightly different from every other one, even if they are copies of each other, because every scribe had different handwriting and made different errors. We can sometimes identify individual scribes from their handwriting, and we can often guess where manuscripts were written because different [[scriptoria]] (centres of manuscript production) wrote in different [[paleography|styles of hand]].<ref>Fulk, R. D., and Christopher M. Cain. \"Making Old English New: Anglo-Saxonism and the Cultural Work of Old English Literature.\" (2013).</ref>\n\nThere are four great poetic codices of [[Old English poetry]] (a [[codex]] is a book in modern format, as opposed to a [[scroll]]): the [[Junius Manuscript]], the [[Vercelli Book]], the [[Exeter Book]], and the [[Nowell Codex]] or ''Beowulf'' Manuscript; most of the well-known lyric poems such as ''[[The Wanderer (Old English poem)|The Wanderer]]'', ''[[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]]'', ''[[Deor]]'' and ''[[The Ruin]]'' are found in the Exeter Book, while the Vercelli Book has the ''[[Dream of the Rood]]'',<ref>Godden, Malcolm, and Michael Lapidge, eds.

It is rarely read by students of Old English, and most Anglo-Saxonists make only passing reference to it. There is scarcely any literary criticism written on the text, although some work has been done on its vocabulary and metre\", [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=A6553EFEF5479C1641CC3FEF8221A280.journals?fromPage=online&aid=2312048 \"Poetic language and the Paris Psalter: the decay of the Old English tradition\", by M.

The [[Franks Casket]] also has carved riddles, a popular form with the Anglo-Saxons. Old English secular poetry is mostly characterized by a somewhat gloomy and introspective cast of mind, and the grim determination found in ''[[The Battle of Maldon]]'', recounting an [[Battle of Maldon|action against the Vikings in 991]]. This is from a book that was lost in the [[Cotton Library]] fire of 1731, but it had been transcribed previously.\n\nRather than being organized around rhyme, the poetic line in Anglo-Saxon is organised around alliteration, the repetition of stressed sounds, any repeated stressed sound, vowel or consonant, could be used. Anglo-Saxon lines are made up of two half-lines (in old-fashioned scholarship, these are called [[hemistich]]es) divided by a breath-pause or [[caesura]]. There must be at least one of the alliterating sounds on each side of the caesura.\n{{quote|''<u>hr</u>eran mid hondum{{spaces|4}}<u>hr</u>imcealde s\u00e6''{{efn|Example from the Wanderer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=text&id=Wdr&textOnly=true|title=Anglo-Saxons.net|publisher=}}</ref>}}}}\nThe line above illustrates the principle: note that there is a natural pause after 'hondum' and that the first stressed syllable after that pause begins with the same sound as a stressed line from the first half-line (the first halfline is called the a-verse and the second is the b-verse).<ref>Bradley, S.A.J. Anglo-Saxon Poetry. New York: Everyman Paperbacks, 1995.</ref>\n\nThere is very strong evidence that Anglo-Saxon poetry has deep roots in oral tradition, but, keeping with the cultural practices we have seen elsewhere in Anglo-Saxon culture, there was a blending between tradition and new learning.<ref>Alexander, Michael. The Earliest English Poems. 3rd rev. ed. New York:\nPenguin Classics, 1992.</ref> Thus while all Old English poetry has common features, we can also identify three strands: religious poetry, which includes poems about specifically Christian topics, such as the cross and the saints; Heroic or [[epic poetry]], such as ''Beowulf'', which is about heroes, warfare, monsters, and the Germanic past; and poetry about \"smaller\" topics, including introspective poems (the so-called elegies), \"wisdom\" poems (which communicate both traditional and Christian wisdom), and riddles. For a long time all Anglo-Saxon poetry was divided into three groups: [[C\u00e6dmon]]ian (the biblical paraphrase poems), heroic, and \"Cynewulfian,\" named after [[Cynewulf]], one of the only named poets in Anglo-Saxon. The most famous works from this period include the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', which has achieved [[national epic]] status in Britain.<ref>Anglo Saxon Poetry. Hachette UK, 2012.</ref>\n\nThere are about 30,000 surviving lines of Old English poetry and about ten times that much prose, and the majority of both is religious. The prose was influential and obviously very important to the Anglo-Saxons and more important than the poetry to those who came after the Anglo-Saxons. [[Homily|Homilies]] are sermons, lessons to be given on moral and doctrinal matters, and the two most prolific and respected writers of Anglo-Saxon prose, [[\u00c6lfric of Eynsham|\u00c6lfric]] and [[Wulfstan the Cantor|Wulfstan]], were both homilists.<ref>Sweet, Henry. An Anglo-Saxon reader in prose and verse: with grammar, metre, notes and glossary. At the Clarendon Press, 1908.</ref> \u00c6lfric also wrote the 'Lives of Saints' which very popular and were highly prized.<ref>Gneuss, Helmut. \u00c6lfric of Eynsham: His Life, Times, and Writings. Vol. 34. Western Michigan Univ Medieval, 2009.</ref> Almost all surviving poetry is found in only one manuscript copy, but there are a number of different versions of some prose works, especially the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', which was apparently promulgated to monasteries by the royal court. Anglo-Saxon clergy also continued to write in Latin, the language of [[Bede]]'s works, monastic chronicles, and theological writing, although Bede's biographer records that he was familiar with Old English poetry and gives a five line lyric which he either wrote or liked to quote \u2013 the sense is unclear.\n\n=== Symbolism ===\n[[Symbolic anthropology|Symbolism]] was an essential element to Anglo-Saxon culture. [[Julian D. Richards]] suggested that in societies with strong [[oral tradition]]s, [[material culture]] is used to store and pass on information and stand instead of literature in those cultures. This symbolism is less logical than literature and more difficult to read. Anglo-Saxons used symbolism, not just to communicate, but as tools to aid their thinking about the world. Symbols were also used to change the world, Anglo-Saxons used symbols to differentiate between groups and people, status and role in society.<ref name=\"Richards, Julian D 1992\" />\n\nThe visual riddles and ambiguities of early Anglo-Saxon animal art, for example has been seen as emphasing the protective roles of animals on dress accessories, weapons, armour and horse equipment, and its evocation of pre-Christian mythological themes. However Howard Williams and Ruth Nugent have suggest that the number of artefact categories that have animals or eyes; from pots to combs, buckets to weaponry was to make artefacts 'see' by impressing and punching circular and lentoid shapes onto them. This symbolism of making the object seems to be more than decoration.<ref>Nugent, Ruth, and Howard Williams. \"Sighted surfaces. Ocular Agency in early Anglo-Saxon cremation burials.\" Encountering images: materialities, perceptions, relations. Stockholm studies in archaeology 57 (2012): 187\u2013208.</ref>\n\nConventional interpretations of the symbolism of grave goods revolved around religion (equipment for the hereafter), legal concepts (inalienable possessions) and social structure (status display, ostentatious destruction of wealth). There was multiplicity of messages and variability of meanings characterised the deposition of objects in Anglo-Saxon graves. In Early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, 47% of male adults and 9% of all juveniles were buried with weapons, some of which were very young. The proportion of adult weapon burials is much too high to suggest that they all represent a social \u00e9lite.<ref>H\u00e4rke, Heinrich. \"Grave goods in early medieval burials: messages and meanings.\" Mortality ahead-of-print (2014): 1\u201321.</ref> The usual assumption is that these are 'warrior burials', and this term is used throughout the archaeological and historical literature. However, a systematic comparison of burials with and without weapons, using archaeological and skeletal data, suggests that this assumption is much too simplistic and even misleading. Anglo-Saxon weapon burial rite involved a complex ritual symbolism: it was multi-dimensional, displaying ethnic affiliation, descent, wealth, \u00e9lite status, and age groups. This symbol continued until c.700 when it ceased to have the symbolic power that it had before.<ref>Pader, E.J. 1982. Symbolism, social relations and the interpretation of mortuary remains. Oxford. (B.A.R. S 130)</ref> Heinrich H\u00e4rke suggests this change was due to the changing structure of society and especially in ethnicity and assimilation implying the lowering of ethnic boundaries in the Anglo-Saxon settlement areas of England, towards a common culture.<ref name=\"H\u00e4rke, Heinrich 1992\" />\n\nThe word bead comes from the Anglo-Saxon words bidden (to pray) and bede (prayer). The vast majority of early Anglo-Saxon female graves contain beads, which are often found in large numbers in the area of the neck and chest. Beads are also sometimes found in male burials, with large beads often associated with prestigious weapons. A variety of materials other than glass were available for Anglo-Saxon beads including; amber, rock crystal, amethyst, bone, shells, coral and even metal.<ref name=\"Guido2000\">Guido and Welch. Indirect evidence for glass bead manufacture in early Anglo-Saxon England. In Price 2000 115\u2013120.</ref> These beads are usually considered to have a social or ritual function. Anglo-Saxon glass beads show a wide variety of bead manufacturing techniques, sizes, shapes, colours and decorations. Various studies have been carried out investigating the distribution and chronological change of bead types.<ref>Guido, M. & M. Welch 1999. The glass beads of Anglo-Saxon England c.

Dress in Anglo-Saxon England. Boydell Press, 2004.</ref> John Hines has suggested that the over 2000 different types of beads found at Lakenheath show that the beads symbolise identity, roles, status and micro cultures within the tribal landscape of the early Anglo-Saxon world.<ref>John Hines (1998) The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Edix Hill (Barrington A), Cambridgeshire. Council for British Archaeology.</ref>\n\nSymbolism continued to have a hold on the minds of Anglo-Saxon people into the Christian eras. The interiors of churches would have glowed with colour, and the walls of the halls were painted with decorative scenes from the imagination telling stories of monsters and heroes like those in the poem Beowulf. Although nothing much is left of the wall paintings, evidence of their pictorial art is found in Bibles and Psalters, in illuminated manuscripts. The poem, 'The [[Dream of the Rood]]', is an example how symbolism of trees was fused into Christian symbolism.\nRichard North suggests that the sacrifice of the tree was in accordance with pagan virtues and \"the image of Christ's death was constructed in this poem with reference to an Anglian ideology of the world tree\".<ref name=\"North273\">North, Richard. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=X_LKUIqNvPQC&pg=PP1&dq=Heathen+Gods+in+Old+English+Literature#v=onepage Heathen Gods in Old English Literature]''. [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997, p. 273</ref> North suggests that the author of ''The Dream of the Rood'' \"uses the language of the myth of Ingui in order to present the Passion to his newly Christianized countrymen as a story from their native tradition\".<ref name=\"North273\" /> Furthermore, the tree's triumph over death is celebrated by adorning the cross with gold and jewels.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of [[coin]]age of the first half of the 8th century is its portrayal of animals, to an extent found in no other European coinage of the Early Middle Ages. Some animals, such as lions or peacocks, would have been known in England only through descriptions in texts or through images in manuscripts or on portable objects. The animals were not merely illustrated out of an interest in the natural world. Each was imbued with meanings and acted as a symbol which would have been understood at the time.<ref>Gannon, Anna. The iconography of early Anglo-Saxon coinage: sixth to eighth centuries. Oxford University Press, 2003.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n''Anglo-Saxon'' is still used as a term for the original [[Old English]]-derived vocabulary within the modern [[English language]], in contrast to vocabulary derived from [[Old Norse]] and [[French language|French]].\n\nThroughout the history of Anglo-Saxon studies, different narratives of the people have been used to justify contemporary ideologies. In the early Middle Ages the views of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] produced a personally inspired history that wasn't challenged for five hundred years. In the [[Reformation]], churchmen looking for signs of an English church reinterpreted Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 19th century the term ''Anglo-Saxon'' was broadly used in [[philology]], and is sometimes so used at present. In Victorian Britain, some writers such as [[Robert Knox]], [[James Anthony Froude]], [[Charles Kingsley]]<ref>Rule of Darkness: British Literature and Imperialism, 1830\u20131914 by Patrick Brantlinger. Cornell University Press, 1990</ref> and [[Edward A. Freeman]]<ref>Race and Empire in British Politics by Paul B. Rich. CUP Archive, 1990</ref> used the term ''Anglo-Saxon'' to justify [[racism]] and [[imperialism]], claiming that the \"Anglo-Saxon\" ancestry of the English made them racially superior to the colonised peoples. Similar racist ideas were advocated in the 19th-century United States by [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[George Fitzhugh]].<ref>Race and Manifest Destiny: The Origins of American Racial Anglo-Saxonism by Reginald Horsman. Harvard University Press, 1981. (pgs. 126,273)</ref> These views have influenced how versions of early English history are embedded in the sub-conscious of people \"re-emerging in school textbooks and television programmes and still very congenial to some strands of political thinking.\"<ref>Hills, Catherine. Origins of the English. Duckworth Pub, 2003.p35</ref>\n\nThe term ''Anglo-Saxon'' is sometimes used to refer to peoples descended or associated in some way with the [[English (ethnic group)|English ethnic group]], but there is no universal definition for the term. In contemporary [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] cultures outside Britain, \"Anglo-Saxon\" may be contrasted with \"Celtic\" as a socioeconomic identifier, invoking or reinforcing historical prejudices against non-English British immigrants. \"[[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]\", i.e. [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], is a term especially popular in the United States that refers chiefly to old wealthy families with mostly English ancestors. As such, WASP is not a historical label or a precise ethnological term, but rather a (often derogatory) reference to contemporary family-based political, financial and cultural power\u2014 e.g., [[Boston Brahmin|The Boston Brahmin]].\n\nOutside Anglophone countries in Europe and in the rest of the world, the term ''Anglo-Saxon'' and its direct translations are used to refer to the Anglophone peoples and societies of Britain, the United States, and other countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand\u2013areas which are sometimes referred to as the [[Anglosphere]]. The term ''Anglo-Saxon'' can be used in a variety of contexts, often to identify the English-speaking world's distinctive language, culture, technology, wealth, markets, economy, and legal systems. Variations include the [[German language|German]] \"Angelsachsen\", [[French language|French]] \"Anglo-Saxon\", [[Spanish language|Spanish]] \"anglosaj\u00f3n\", [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] \"Anglo-sax\u00e3o\", [[Russian language|Russian]] \"\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043a\u0441\u044b\", [[Polish language|Polish]] \"anglosakso\u0144ski\", [[Italian language|Italian]] \"anglosassone\", [[Catalan language|Catalan]] \"anglosax\u00f3\" and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] \"Angurosakuson\". As with the English-language use of the term, what constitutes the \"Anglo-Saxon\" varies from speaker to speaker.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn modern parlance, Anglo-Saxon is increasingly used to define a set of economic belief and systems rooted in anglophone countries. Characteristics of this model include low levels of regulation and taxes, and the public sector providing very few services. It can also mean strong private property rights, contract enforcement, and overall ease of doing business as well as low barriers to free trade. The Anglo-Saxon model is seen distinctly and competes versus other recognized economic models like continental bureaucracy or Chinese socialist model of central control.<ref>[[Anglo-Saxon model]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=June 2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Anglo-Saxon England}}\n*[[Anglo-Frisian]]\n*[[Anglo-Saxon dress]]\n*[[Coinage in Anglo-Saxon England]]\n*[[Anglo-Saxon military organization]]\n*[[Burial in Anglo-Saxon England]]\n*[[Frisia]]\n*[[States in Medieval Britain]]\n*[[Timeline of Anglo-Saxon settlement in Britain]]\n\n'''Modern concepts:'''\n* [[Anglo-Saxon economy]]\n* [[English people]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Oppenheimer, Stephen.

{"title_page": "Pied Piper of Hamelin in popular culture", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=May 2009}}\nThe '''[[Pied Piper of Hamelin]]''' has appeared many times in popular culture.\n\n==Film==\nThe story has been depicted many times on film: \n* In the 1920 ''[[Jerry on the Job]]'' short ''[[Cheating the Piper]]'', Jerry uses a saxophone to lure the rats away from the train station.\n* The poem was adapted in 1933 as an animated [[Walt Disney]] ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' short.\n* In 1945, an adaptation was produced as an animated Swing Symphony version of ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' by [[Walter Lantz Productions]] and was called ''[[Swing Symphony|The Pied Piper of Basin Street]]''.\n* The 1957 [[made-for-television]] special ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' was a musical version in [[color]], using the music of [[Edvard Grieg]] and starring [[Van Johnson]] in a dual role as both the title character and the local schoolmaster.\n* In the unreleased 1972 film ''[[The Day the Clown Cried]]'', Helmut Doork ([[Jerry Lewis]]) ends up accidentally accompanying the children on a boxcar train to Auschwitz, and he is eventually used, in Pied Piper fashion, to help lead the Jewish children to theihjedo cbvbfkvbofr deaths in the [[gas chamber]].\n* The 1972 film ''[[The Pied Piper (1972 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' was not a musical ''per se'', although it contained songs by [[Donovan]], who also played the title role. This was an especially dark and realistic version of the tale, set this time in the 14th Century during the time of the [[Black Plague]]. The film was directed by [[Jacques Demy]] and also starred [[Jack Wild]], [[Michael Hordern]], [[Donald Pleasence]] and [[John Hurt]].\n* A [[stop-motion]] \"[[claymation]]\" half-hour version was made in 1981 in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Cosgrove Hall]], directed by Mark Hall and narrated by [[Robert Hardy]], following the Browning poem exactly. This version was later shown as an episode of the PBS series ''[[Long Ago and Far Away (TV series)|Long Ago and Far Away]]''.\n* ''[[The Pied Piper (1986 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' is a 1986 Czechoslovak stop-motion animated feature film directed by [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Barta]], notable for its unusual dark art direction, innovative animation techniques and lack of almost any understandable dialogue with all words spoken in gibberish.\n* The 1989 film ''Food of the Gods II'' is about rats who grow to giant size. The sports complex, including a\nswimming pool, in the film, is named Hamlin (sic).\n* The 1997 movie ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'', about a town that suffers a horrifying school bus accident wherein nearly all their children are killed, heavily references [[the Pied Piper]] and quotes liberally from the Browning version.\n* A direct-to-video cartoon, ''[[It's the Pied Piper, Charlie Brown]]'', was released in 2000.  In the special, [[Charlie Brown]] reads to [[Sally Brown]] a less-scary version of the legend of The Pied Piper with dancing/sports mice instead of rampaging rats and the cheating mayor and town officials being bewitched out of town instead of the children. [[Snoopy]] portrays the title character, but plays a [[concertina]] instead of a flute.\n* In the 2001 film ''[[Shrek]]'', the Pied Piper is seen at the main character's swamp, where every fairy tale creature has gathered to escape Lord Farquaad. The 2010 sequel ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' also features Pied Piper as a minor character; he is hired by the main villain, Rumpelstiltskin, to use his music to lead the rebelling Ogres to their imprisonment (while making them dance to \"[[Shake Your Groove Thing]]\").\n* The 2003 [[Nickelodeon]] [[television film]] ''The Electric Piper'' is a musical adaptation of the story.\n* In ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (2010), the characters' research of [[Freddy Krueger]] provides them with the legend of the Piper.\n* [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons occasionally referenced the story.  ''[[Pied Piper Porky]]'' casts [[Porky Pig]] in the role, as does ''[[Paying the Piper]]''. ''[[Book Revue]]'' shows the cover of a book jokingly titled ''The Pie-Eyed Piper'', whose title character plays his instrument as part of the musical show that dominates the cartoon. (\"Pie-eyed\" is a colloquialism for \"drunk\".[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=pie-eyed&searchmode=none pie-eyed | Search Online Etymology Dictionary]) Probably most famous is ''[[The Pied Piper of Guadalupe]]'', starring [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] as the piper trying to trap mice (but he eventually gets defeated by [[Speedy Gonzales]]).\n* ''[[Sailor Moon Super S: The Movie]]'' draws strong inspirations from the Pied Piper.\n* In 2014, [[HitRecord]] recorded scenes for a fictional film about the Pied Piper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hitrecord.org/records/1552431|title=HITRECORD|website=hitrecord.org}}</ref>\n\n== Literature ==\nThis is a list of [[allusion]]s. For tellings and retellings, see the ''[[List of literary accounts of the Pied Piper]]''.\n* In 1556, ''De miraculis sui temporis'' (Latin: Concerning the Wonders of his Times) by [[Jobus Fincelius]] mentions the tale.

It is written in the voice of the deaf child in the poem, whom Richardson names Penelope.\n* ''The Maestro'' by [[Judd Palmer]] is a children's book and the second volume of Palmer's ''Preposterous Fables for Unusual Children''.  The protagonist is Hannah, a girl who has moved to a town where music is banned after a Maestro stole all the children with music. When she is caught singing, she is exiled to a mountain cave where she finds the evil Maestro with his orchestra. After she frees the children and saves the Maestro from the angry townspeople, she alone stays with the Maestro out of free will because she wants to be his student.\n* [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents]]'' (2001) is a humorous take on the Pied Piper.\n* [[Russell Brand]]'s first children's book, ''Russell Brand's Trickster Tales: the Pied Piper of Hamelin'' ({{ISBN|978-1782114567}}), published in 2001 by Canongate Books, provided an unusual take on the traditional Pied Piper story.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/nov/05/russell-brand-why-i-wrote-the-pied-piper-of-hamelin|title=Russell Brand: why I wrote the Pied Piper of Hamelin|first=Guardian|last=Staff|date=November 5, 2014|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n* In 2005, [[Adam McCune (novelist)|Adam McCune]] and [[Keith McCune]], a father\u2013son writing team, published ''[[The Rats of Hamelin]]'', in which an eighteen-year-old Pied Piper faces a hidden enemy with powers like his own.\n* In [[Garth Nix]]'s ''[[The Keys to the Kingdom]]'' series, a character called the Piper appears as an antagonist. Along with being able to use the music of his pipe to cast sorcery, he led both the Raised Rats and the Piper's Children into the House, a clear reference to the traditional story.\n* In [[Into the woods (book)|''Into the Woods'']], the three female protagonists' ancestor is hinted at being the Pied Piper.\n* The novel ''[[Peter & Max]]'', written by [[Bill Willingham]], tells the story of the Pied Piper, among other fairy tales.  This book is a tie-in to his popular comic series ''[[Fables (comic)|Fables]]''.\n* Helen McCabe's horror novel, ''Piper'', is based on the legend.\n* [[Jane Yolen]] and [[Adam Stemple]]'s ''[[Pay the Piper: A Rock 'n' Roll Fairy Tale]]'' reworks the story in an [[urban fantasy]] setting.\n* In ''[[Beyond the Spiderwick Chronicles: A Giant Problem]]'', the Pied Piper story inspires Nick Vargas to use mermaids to lure the giants away with their song.\n* [[Dan Rhodes]]' novel ''[[Little Hands Clapping]]'' references the Pied Piper story; a line from [[Robert Browning]]'s poem ''The Pied Piper of Hamelin'' provides its title.\n*In [[Eric Nylund]]'s ''Mortal Coils'', Louis Piper, who is Lucifer, is also an incarnation of the Pied Piper.\n*In 1954, Walt Kelly's ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]'' annual, ''[[The Pogo Stepmother Goose]]'', included an illustrated story called \"The Town on the Edge of the End\".  Here the townspeople are plagued by various monsters, not rats, and the Piper's only demand is that \"after the town has become bonny and gay, then you'll keep it that way.\"  After the piper leaves, the townspeople are so concerned with preventing the return of the monsters that they become suspicious of each other and cruel to their children.  Eventually the Piper returns and pipes the children away to a better life, leaving the townspeople grateful to be rid of them, and content to sink into their gloom.\n*In [[Darren Shan]]'s novel ''Hunters of the Dusk'', Darren describes Desmond Tiny as beaming like a rat catcher in league with the Pied Piper of Hamelin, and that his reappearance meant nothing but trouble would happen.\n*In [[Scott Westerfeld]]'s young adult novel ''Afterworlds'', Lizzie's main antagonist in the afterworld who preys on ghost children, is called Mr. Hamlyn.\n* [[Melanie Dickerson]] has written a retelling of the Pied Piper titled The Piper's Pursuit. It is set to release on December 3, 2019.\n\n== Comics ==\n* ''[[Captain Marvel Jr.]]'' #2 (December 1942) \"The Pied Piper of Himmler\" in which a Nazi [[Fifth column]] leads a group of mostly-teenage boys to a secret facility to radicalize them; the lame child shut out is none other than Freddy Freeman himself who transforms into his [[superhero]] form to rescue the others. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=18277|title=Captain Marvel Jr. #2 (Fawcett)|website=Comic Book Plus}}</ref>\n* The [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] (created in 1959) is a reformed villain from the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'s [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues Gallery]].\n* [[Carl Barks]] made reference to the story in an issue of ''[[Uncle Scrooge Adventures]]'' when Scrooge, concerned about rats gnawing at his cash, hires [[Gyro Gearloose]] to rid Duckburg of all rats. Rather than music, Gyro invents a powerful cheese which attracts all rodents, and when astonished citizens watch him leading a huge procession of rats through the streets, comments \"I am the Pied Piper of Duckburg!\". The problem does not recur, however, because Scrooge honestly pays Gyro for the work that he was hired for.\n* Writer Lars Jensen and artist [[Flemming Andersen]] created \"The Ghost Rats of Hamelin\" (2001), a [[Donald Duck]] comics adventure published in English in ''Donald Duck Adventures Take-Along Comic'' #6 (2004). In it, Hamelin is plagued once a year for a term of one week by the giant-size ghosts of the Pied Piper's rat victims. Donald and [[Fethry Duck]], members of the [[Tamers of Nonhuman Threats]], are sent to destroy these ghosts. Also true to the story was that the mayor is shown as a cowardly politician who uses political talk to stiff Fethry and Donald out of their fees.\n* The Pied Piper makes an appearance in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Promethea]]'' where he is unleashed on the children of a sect dedicated to hunting the heroine down after being warned to end their efforts.\n*[[Grimm Fairy Tales (comic series)|''Grimm Fairy Tales'']] #12 is entitled \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\".\n* The Pied Piper's pipe has an important role in ''[[Dylan Dog]]'' #210, \"Il Pifferaio Magico\" (trans. \"The Magic Piper\").\n\n==Music==\n\n===Artists===\n*[[R.

In 2005 it had 217 member organizations in 110 countries, representing a combined membership of over 10 million workers.\n\n==History==\nThe ITGLWF was founded in 1970 as a result of the merger of the [[International Textile and Garment Workers' Federation]] and the [[International Shoe and Leather Workers' Federation]]. These organizations were preceded by much older ones: the [[International Glove Workers' Union]] was founded in 1892, the [[International Secretariat of Shoemakers]] in 1893, and the [[International Secretariat of Leather Workers]] in 1896. The [[International Federation of Textile Workers' Associations]] originated in 1894 and the [[International Tailors' Secretariat]] in 1896.\n\nThe organization held a congress every four years, consisting of delegates from the member organisations. The congress established the broad lines of the ITGLWF's policies and actions.\n\nThe organisation's headquarters was located in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. There were four regional organisations within the ITGLWF: FITTVCC/ORI, the [[Americas]]' regional organisation, based in [[Venezuela]]; ITGLWF/ERO, the European regional organisation, based in Belgium; TWARO, the Asian regional organisation, based in [[Japan]]; and ARCC, the African Regional Consultative Council, based in [[South Africa]].\n\nThe ITGLWF worked closely with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] and the other global union federations.\n\nIn 2007, the [[International Federation Textile-Clothing]], a former affiliate of the [[World Confederation of Labour]], merged into the ITGLWF.<ref>{{cite web |title=International Federation Textile and Clothing (IFTC-WCL) |url=https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100042771 |website=Open Yearbook |publisher=Union of International Associations |accessdate=29 November 2019}}</ref>  In June 2012 affiliates of ITGLWF joined the new global federation [[IndustriALL Global Union]].\n\n==Affiliates==\nIn 1979, the following unions were affiliated to the federation:<ref name=\"coldrick\">{{cite book |last1=Coldrick |first1=Percy |last2=Jones |first2=Philip |title=The International Directory of the Trade Union Movement |date=1979 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |isbn=0871963744 |pages=109&ndash;114}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

In 2005 it had 217 member organizations in 110 countries, representing a combined membership of over 10 million workers.\n\n==History==\nThe ITGLWF was founded in 1970 as a result of the merger of the [[International Textile and Garment Workers' Federation]] and the [[International Shoe and Leather Workers' Federation]]. These organizations were preceded by much older ones: the [[International Glove Workers' Union]] was founded in 1892, the [[International Secretariat of Shoemakers]] in 1893, and the [[International Secretariat of Leather Workers]] in 1896. The [[International Federation of Textile Workers' Associations]] originated in 1894 and the [[International Tailors' Secretariat]] in 1896.\n\nThe organization held a congress every four years, consisting of delegates from the member organisations. The congress established the broad lines of the ITGLWF's policies and actions.\n\nThe organisation's headquarters was located in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. There were four regional organisations within the ITGLWF: FITTVCC/ORI, the [[Americas]]' regional organisation, based in [[Venezuela]]; ITGLWF/ERO, the European regional organisation, based in Belgium; TWARO, the Asian regional organisation, based in [[Japan]]; and ARCC, the African Regional Consultative Council, based in [[South Africa]].\n\nThe ITGLWF worked closely with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] and the other global union federations.\n\nIn 2007, the [[International Federation Textile-Clothing]], a former affiliate of the [[World Confederation of Labour]], merged into the ITGLWF.<ref>{{cite web |title=International Federation Textile and Clothing (IFTC-WCL) |url=https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100042771 |website=Open Yearbook |publisher=Union of International Associations |accessdate=29 November 2019}}</ref>  In June 2012 affiliates of ITGLWF joined the new global federation [[IndustriALL Global Union]].\n\n==Affiliates==\nIn 1979, the following unions were affiliated to the federation:<ref name=\"coldrick\">{{cite book |last1=Coldrick |first1=Percy |last2=Jones |first2=Philip |title=The International Directory of the Trade Union Movement |date=1979 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |isbn=0871963744 |pages=109&ndash;114}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
