Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the [[Internet]].  Data sent through the internet, such as a [[web page]] or [[email]], is in the form of data packets.   A packet is typically [[Packet forwarding|forwarded]] from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an [[internetwork]] (e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destination [[Node (networking)|node]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_OverviewOfKeyRoutingProtocolConceptsArchitecturesP.htm|title=Overview Of Key Routing Protocol Concepts: Architectures, Protocol Types, Algorithms and Metrics|publisher=Tcpipguide.com|accessdate=15 January 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111345/http://tcpipguide.com/free/t_OverviewOfKeyRoutingProtocolConceptsArchitecturesP.htm|archivedate=20 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nA router is connected to two or more data lines from different [[IP network]]s.{{efn|As opposed to a [[network switch]], which connects data lines from one single network}} When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the [[network address]] information in the packet header to determine the ultimate destination.  Then, using information in its [[routing table]] or [[routing policy]], it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.\n\nThe most familiar type of IP routers are [[Home router|home and small office routers]] that simply forward [[IP packet (disambiguation)|IP packet]]s<!--intentional link to disambig, could be either IPv4 or IPv6 packet--> between the home computers and the Internet. An example of a router would be the owner's cable or DSL router, which connects to the Internet through an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, connect large business or ISP networks up to the powerful [[core router]]s that forward data at high speed along the [[optical fiber]] lines of the [[Internet backbone]].  \n\n==Operation==\nWhen multiple routers are used in interconnected networks, the routers can exchange information about destination addresses using a [[routing protocol]]. Each router builds up a [[routing table]] listing the preferred routes between any two computer systems on the interconnected networks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cisco Networking Academy's Introduction to Routing Dynamically|url=http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2180210&seqNum=4|publisher=Cisco|accessdate=August 1, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027133937/http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2180210&seqNum=4|archivedate=October 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nA router has two types of network element components organized onto separate processing ''planes'':<ref>{{cite ietf |title=Requirements for Separation of IP Control and Forwarding |rfc=3654 |author=H. Khosravi & T.

It does this using internal preconfigured directives, called [[static route]]s, or by learning routes [[Dynamic routing|dynamically]] using a routing protocol. Static and dynamic routes are stored in the routing table. The control-plane logic then strips non-essential directives from the table and builds a [[forwarding information base]] (FIB) to be used by the forwarding plane.\n* [[Forwarding plane]]: The router forwards data packets between incoming and outgoing interface connections. It forwards them to the correct network type using information that the packet [[Header (computing)|header]] contains matched to entries in the FIB supplied by the control plane.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Adsl connections.jpg|thumb|right|A typical home or small office [[DSL router]] showing the [[telephone socket]] ''(left, white)'' to connect it to the internet using [[ADSL]], and [[Ethernet]] jacks ''(right, yellow)'' to connect it to home computers and printers.]]\n\nA router may have interfaces for different types of [[physical layer]] connections, such as copper cables, [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]], or [[wireless]] transmission. It can also support different [[network layer]] transmission standards. Each network interface is used to enable data packets to be forwarded from one transmission system to another. Routers may also be used to connect two or more logical groups of computer devices known as [[Subnetwork|subnets]], each with a different [[network prefix]].\n\nRouters may provide connectivity within enterprises, between enterprises and the Internet, or between [[internet service provider]]s' (ISPs') networks.

They may also provide connectivity to groups of file servers or other external networks.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn enterprises, a [[core router]] may provide a [[collapsed backbone]] interconnecting the distribution tier routers from multiple buildings of a campus, or large enterprise locations.

Set up in 1972 as an informal group to consider the technical issues involved in connecting different networks, it became a subcommittee of the [[International Federation for Information Processing]] later that year.<ref>Davies, Shanks, Heart, Barker, Despres, Detwiler and Riml, \"Report of Subgroup 1 on Communication System\", INWG Note No. 1.</ref> These gateway devices were different from most previous [[packet switching]] schemes in two ways.

They were important in the early stages of the growth of computer networking when protocols other than TCP/IP were in use. Modern Internet routers that handle both IPv4 and IPv6 are multiprotocol but are simpler devices than routers processing AppleTalk, DECnet, IP and Xerox protocols.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s and in the 1980s, general-purpose [[minicomputer]]s served as routers. Modern high-speed routers are highly specialized computers with extra [[Computer hardware|hardware]] added to speed both common routing functions, such as packet forwarding, and specialised functions such as [[IPsec]] encryption. There is substantial use of [[Linux]] and [[Unix]] software based machines, running [[Open-source software|open source]] routing code, for research and other applications. The [[Cisco IOS]] operating system was independently designed. Major router operating systems, such as [[Junos]] and [[NX-OS]], are extensively modified versions of Unix software.\n\n== Forwarding ==\n{{Further|Routing|IP routing}}\nThe main purpose of a router is to connect multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own networks or other networks. A router is considered a [[layer-3]] device because its primary forwarding decision is based on the information in the layer-3 IP packet, specifically the destination IP address. When a router receives a packet, it searches its routing table to find the best match between the destination IP address of the packet and one of the addresses in the routing table. Once a match is found, the packet is encapsulated in the [[Data link layer|layer-2]] data link frame for the outgoing interface indicated in the table entry. A router typically does not look into the packet payload,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} but only at the layer-3 addresses to make a forwarding decision, plus optionally other information in the header for hints on, for example, [[quality of service]] (QoS). For pure IP forwarding, a router is designed to minimize the [[State (computer science)|state]] information associated with individual packets.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Lawrence|title=The Next Generation of IP - Flow Routing|url=http://www.packet.cc/files/FlowPaper/NextGenerationofIP-FlowRouting.htm|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=22 July 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404030549/http://www.packet.cc/files/FlowPaper/NextGenerationofIP-FlowRouting.htm|archivedate=4 April 2015}}</ref> Once a packet is forwarded, the router does not retain any historical information about the packet.{{efn|The forwarding action can be collected into the statistical data, if so configured.}}\n\nThe routing table itself can contain information derived from a variety of sources, such as a [[default route|default]] or [[static route]]s that are configured manually, or [[routing protocol|dynamic routing protocols]] where the router learns routes from other routers.  A default route is one that is used to route all traffic whose destination does not otherwise appear in the routing table; this is common&nbsp;\u2013  even necessary&nbsp;\u2013  in small networks, such as a home or small business where the default route simply sends all non-local traffic to the [[Internet service provider]]. The default route can be manually configured (as a [[static route]]), or learned by dynamic routing protocols, or be obtained by [[DHCP]].{{efn|A router can serve as a DHCP client or as a DHCP server.}}<ref>{{cite web|author=David Davis|title=Cisco administration 101: What you need to know about default routes|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/cisco-administration-101-what-you-need-to-know-about-default-routes|date=April 19, 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131617133200/http://www.techrepublic.com/article/cisco-administration-101-what-you-need-to-know-about-default-routes/|archivedate=December 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA router can run more than one routing protocol at a time, particularly if it serves as an autonomous system border router between parts of a network that run different routing protocols; if it does so, then redistribution may be used (usually selectively) to share information between the different protocols running on the same router.<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane Teare|title=Implementing Cisco IP Routing (ROUTE): Foundation Learning Guide|pages=330\u2013334|publisher=[[Cisco Press]]|date=March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBesides making a decision as to which interface a packet is forwarded to, which is handled primarily via the routing table, a router also has to manage congestion when packets arrive at a rate higher than the router can process. Three policies commonly used in the Internet are [[tail drop]], [[random early detection]] (RED), and [[weighted random early detection]] (WRED). Tail drop is the simplest and most easily implemented; the router simply drops new incoming packets once the length of the queue exceeds the size of the buffers in the router. RED probabilistically drops datagrams early when the queue exceeds a pre-configured portion of the buffer, until a pre-determined max, when it becomes tail drop. WRED requires a weight on the average queue size to act upon when the traffic is about to exceed the pre-configured size, so that short bursts will not trigger random drops.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAnother function a router performs is to decide which packet should be processed first when multiple queues exist. This is managed through [[Quality of service|QoS]], which is critical when [[Voice over IP]] is deployed, so as not to introduce excessive [[Latency (audio)|latency]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nYet another function a router performs is called [[policy-based routing]] where special rules are constructed to override the rules derived from the routing table when a packet forwarding decision is made.<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane Teare|title=Implementing Cisco IP Routing (ROUTE): Foundation Learning Guide|pages=330\u2013334|publisher=[[Cisco Press]]|date=March 2013|chapter=Chapter 5: Implementing Path Control}}</ref>\n\nRouter functions may be performed through the same internal paths that the packets travel inside the router. Some of the functions may be performed through an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) to avoid overhead of scheduling CPU time to process the packets. Others may have to be performed through the CPU as these packets need special attention that cannot be handled by an ASIC.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[DECbit]]\n* [[Mobile broadband modem]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* [[Residential gateway]]\n* [[Switch virtual interface]]\n* [[Content-addressable memory#Ternary CAMs|TCAM]] Content addressable memory (hardware acceleration of route-search)\n* [[Wireless router]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Network routers}}\n{{Wikibooks|Communication Networks/Routing}}\n{{Wiktionary|router}}\n* [http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/wg-dir.html#Routing%20Area Internet Engineering Task Force, the Routing Area] last checked 21 January 2011.\n{{Routing software}}\n\n[[Category:Routers (computing)| ]]\n[[Category:Internet architecture]]\n[[Category:Hardware routers]]\n[[Category:Networking hardware]]\n[[Category:Server appliance]]\n[[Category:Computer networking]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the network device|the woodworking tool|Router (woodworking)}}\n{{short description|Device that forwards data packets between computer networks, creating an overlay internetwork}}\n\n[[File:Ciscosystemsrouteratcern.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] ASM/2-32EM router deployed at [[CERN]] in 1987]]\n\nA '''router'''{{efn|Router is pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|u\u02d0|t|\u0259r}} in [[British English]] and is pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|a\u028a|t|\u0259r}} in [[American English|American]] and [[Australian English]].<ref>{{OED|router}}</ref>}} is a [[networking device]] that forwards [[data packet]]s between [[computer network]]s.

The idea for a router (called \"[[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]]\" at the time) initially came about through an international group of computer networking researchers called the International Network Working Group (INWG). Set up in 1972 as an informal group to consider the technical issues involved in connecting different networks, it became a subcommittee of the [[International Federation for Information Processing]] later that year.<ref>Davies, Shanks, Heart, Barker, Despres, Detwiler and Riml, \"Report of Subgroup 1 on Communication System\", INWG Note No. 1.</ref> These gateway devices were different from most previous [[packet switching]] schemes in two ways. First, they connected dissimilar kinds of networks, such as [[serial line]]s and [[local area network]]s. Second, they were [[connectionless]] devices, which had no role in assuring that traffic was delivered reliably, leaving that entirely to the [[host (network)|hosts]].{{efn|This particular idea had been previously pioneered in the [[CYCLADES]] network.}}\n\nThe idea was explored in more detail, with the intention to produce a prototype system as part of two contemporaneous programs.

They were important in the early stages of the growth of computer networking when protocols other than TCP/IP were in use. Modern Internet routers that handle both IPv4 and IPv6 are multiprotocol but are simpler devices than routers processing AppleTalk, DECnet, IP and Xerox protocols.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s and in the 1980s, general-purpose [[minicomputer]]s served as routers. Modern high-speed routers are highly specialized computers with extra [[Computer hardware|hardware]] added to speed both common routing functions, such as packet forwarding, and specialised functions such as [[IPsec]] encryption. There is substantial use of [[Linux]] and [[Unix]] software based machines, running [[Open-source software|open source]] routing code, for research and other applications. The [[Cisco IOS]] operating system was independently designed. Major router operating systems, such as [[Junos]] and [[NX-OS]], are extensively modified versions of Unix software.\n\n== Forwarding ==\n{{Further|Routing|IP routing}}\nThe main purpose of a router is to connect multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own networks or other networks. A router is considered a [[layer-3]] device because its primary forwarding decision is based on the information in the layer-3 IP packet, specifically the destination IP address. When a router receives a packet, it searches its routing table to find the best match between the destination IP address of the packet and one of the addresses in the routing table. Once a match is found, the packet is encapsulated in the [[Data link layer|layer-2]] data link frame for the outgoing interface indicated in the table entry. A router typically does not look into the packet payload,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} but only at the layer-3 addresses to make a forwarding decision, plus optionally other information in the header for hints on, for example, [[quality of service]] (QoS). For pure IP forwarding, a router is designed to minimize the [[State (computer science)|state]] information associated with individual packets.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Lawrence|title=The Next Generation of IP - Flow Routing|url=http://www.packet.cc/files/FlowPaper/NextGenerationofIP-FlowRouting.htm|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=22 July 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404030549/http://www.packet.cc/files/FlowPaper/NextGenerationofIP-FlowRouting.htm|archivedate=4 April 2015}}</ref> Once a packet is forwarded, the router does not retain any historical information about the packet.{{efn|The forwarding action can be collected into the statistical data, if so configured.}}\n\nThe routing table itself can contain information derived from a variety of sources, such as a [[default route|default]] or [[static route]]s that are configured manually, or [[routing protocol|dynamic routing protocols]] where the router learns routes from other routers.  A default route is one that is used to route all traffic whose destination does not otherwise appear in the routing table; this is common&nbsp;\u2013  even necessary&nbsp;\u2013  in small networks, such as a home or small business where the default route simply sends all non-local traffic to the [[Internet service provider]]. The default route can be manually configured (as a [[static route]]), or learned by dynamic routing protocols, or be obtained by [[DHCP]].{{efn|A router can serve as a DHCP client or as a DHCP server.}}<ref>{{cite web|author=David Davis|title=Cisco administration 101: What you need to know about default routes|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/cisco-administration-101-what-you-need-to-know-about-default-routes|date=April 19, 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131617133200/http://www.techrepublic.com/article/cisco-administration-101-what-you-need-to-know-about-default-routes/|archivedate=December 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA router can run more than one routing protocol at a time, particularly if it serves as an autonomous system border router between parts of a network that run different routing protocols; if it does so, then redistribution may be used (usually selectively) to share information between the different protocols running on the same router.<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane Teare|title=Implementing Cisco IP Routing (ROUTE): Foundation Learning Guide|pages=330\u2013334|publisher=[[Cisco Press]]|date=March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBesides making a decision as to which interface a packet is forwarded to, which is handled primarily via the routing table, a router also has to manage congestion when packets arrive at a rate higher than the router can process. Three policies commonly used in the Internet are [[tail drop]], [[random early detection]] (RED), and [[weighted random early detection]] (WRED). Tail drop is the simplest and most easily implemented; the router simply drops new incoming packets once the length of the queue exceeds the size of the buffers in the router. RED probabilistically drops datagrams early when the queue exceeds a pre-configured portion of the buffer, until a pre-determined max, when it becomes tail drop. WRED requires a weight on the average queue size to act upon when the traffic is about to exceed the pre-configured size, so that short bursts will not trigger random drops.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAnother function a router performs is to decide which packet should be processed first when multiple queues exist. This is managed through [[Quality of service|QoS]], which is critical when [[Voice over IP]] is deployed, so as not to introduce excessive [[Latency (audio)|latency]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nYet another function a router performs is called [[policy-based routing]] where special rules are constructed to override the rules derived from the routing table when a packet forwarding decision is made.<ref>{{cite book|author=Diane Teare|title=Implementing Cisco IP Routing (ROUTE): Foundation Learning Guide|pages=330\u2013334|publisher=[[Cisco Press]]|date=March 2013|chapter=Chapter 5: Implementing Path Control}}</ref>\n\nRouter functions may be performed through the same internal paths that the packets travel inside the router. Some of the functions may be performed through an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) to avoid overhead of scheduling CPU time to process the packets. Others may have to be performed through the CPU as these packets need special attention that cannot be handled by an ASIC.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[DECbit]]\n* [[Mobile broadband modem]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* [[Residential gateway]]\n* [[Switch virtual interface]]\n* [[Content-addressable memory#Ternary CAMs|TCAM]] Content addressable memory (hardware acceleration of route-search)\n* [[Wireless router]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Network routers}}\n{{Wikibooks|Communication Networks/Routing}}\n{{Wiktionary|router}}\n* [http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/wg-dir.html#Routing%20Area Internet Engineering Task Force, the Routing Area] last checked 21 January 2011.\n{{Routing software}}\n\n[[Category:Routers (computing)| ]]\n[[Category:Internet architecture]]\n[[Category:Hardware routers]]\n[[Category:Networking hardware]]\n[[Category:Server appliance]]\n[[Category:Computer networking]]\n", "name_user": "Dhananjayprasad1342", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(function of a router (1) It forwards data packets towards their destination.

The central bodies are sixteen-sided prisms {{convert|1.75|m}} in diameter and {{convert|0.55|m}} high. Most of the equipment and instrumentation is mounted in this central body. The exceptions are the masts and antennae used during experiments and small telescopes that measure the [[zodiacal light]] and which emerge from the central body. Two conical solar panels extend above and below the central body, giving the assembly the appearance of a [[diabolo]] or spool of thread.\n\nAt launch, each probe was {{convert|2.12|m}} tall with a maximum diameter of {{convert|2.77|m}}. Once in orbit, telecommunications antennae unfolded on top of the probes and increased the heights to {{convert|4.2|m}}. Also deployed upon achieving orbit were two rigid booms carrying sensors and magnetometers, attached on both sides of the central bodies, and two flexible antennae used for the detection of radio waves, which extended perpendicular to the axes of the spacecraft for a design length of {{convert|16|m}} each.<ref>[http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/helios.shtml Helios].

To keep the solar panels at a temperature below {{convert|165|C}} when in proximity to the Sun, the solar cells are interspersed with mirrors, covering 50% of the surface and reflecting part of the incident sunlight while dissipating the excess heat. The power supplied by the solar panels is a minimum of 240{{nbsp}}[[watt]]s when the probe is at [[aphelion]]. Its voltage is regulated to 28{{nbsp}}[[volts]] [[Direct current|DC]], and the energy is stored on an 8{{nbsp}}[[Ampere-hour|Ah]] silver\u2013zinc battery. The batteries were only used during launch.{{contradict-inline|date=April 2020|reason=Is the energy from the solar cells stored in a battery, or were the batteries never used after launch?

At {{convert|0.3|AU}} from the Sun, approximate heat flow is 11 solar constants, (11 times the amount of received heat in Earth orbit), or 22.4&nbsp;[[Watt (unit)|kW]] per exposed square meter. Under these conditions, the temperature of the probe can then reach {{convert|370|C}}. The [[solar cells]], and the central compartment of instruments, had to be maintained at much lower temperatures. The temperature of the solar cells could not exceed {{convert|165|C}}, while the central compartment had to be maintained between {{convert|-10|and|20|C}}. These restrictions required the rejection of 96 percent of the heat received from the Sun. The conical shape of the solar panels is one of the measures that was taken to reduce the flow of heat. By tilting the solar panels with respect to sunlight arriving perpendicularly to the axis of the probe, a greater proportion of the [[solar radiation]] is reflected. Furthermore, \"second surface mirrors\" specially developed by [[NASA]] cover the entire central body and 50 percent of the solar generators. These are made of fused quartz, with a silver film on the inner face, which is itself covered with a dielectric material. For additional protection, [[multi-layer insulation]]{{snd}}consisting of 18 layers of {{convert|0.25|mm}} [[Mylar]] or [[Kapton]] (depending on location), held apart from each other by small plastic pins intended to prevent the formation of [[thermal bridge]]s{{snd}}was used to partially cover the core compartment. In addition to these passive devices, the probes used an active system of movable louvers arranged in a shutter-like pattern along the bottom and top side of the compartment. The opening thereof is controlled separately by a bimetal spring whose length varies with temperature and causes the opening or closing of the shutter. Resistors were also used to help maintain a temperature sufficient for certain equipment.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khzDRYfj97AC&pg=PA918 | title=The trip to hot space | journal=[[New Scientist]] | first=G\u00fcnter | last=Sandscheper | volume=64 | issue=929 | page=918 | date=December 26, 1974}}</ref>\n\n==Telecommunications system==\n\nThe telecommunication system uses a radio transceiver, whose power could be adjusted between 0.5 and 20&nbsp;watts.

The low-gain horn antenna{{Clarify|reason=What is the \"low-gain horn antenna\"? I thought the low-gain antenna was a dipole.|date=February 2020}} was located under the center of the probe to allow for an adapter that connected the probe to the launch vehicle. To be directed continuously toward [[Earth]], the high-gain antenna is kept in rotation by a motor at a speed that counterbalances exactly the body of the probe. Synchronizing the speed is performed using data supplied by a [[Sun sensor]]. The maximum data rate obtained with the large antenna gain was 4096 bits per second upstream. The reception and transmission of signals were supported by the [[Deep Space Network]] network antennas on Earth.\n\n==Attitude control==\n{{Rewrite section|date=February 2020}}\nTo maintain its orientation during the mission, the spacecraft rotated continuously at 60&nbsp;rpm around their main axes.

The axis of the probe was permanently maintained, both perpendicular to the direction of the Sun and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.\n\n==On-board computer and data storage==\nThe on-board controllers were capable of handling 256 commands. The mass memory could store 500&nbsp;[[kilobits|kb]], (this was a very large memory for space probes of the time), and was mainly used when the probes were in superior conjunction relative to the [[Earth]] (i.e. the Sun comes between the Earth and the spacecraft).

This was the first operational flight of the [[Titan IIIE]] rocket. The rocket's test flight had failed when the engine on the upper [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur stage]] did not light, but the launch of ''Helios-A'' was uneventful.\n\nThe probe was placed in a heliocentric orbit of 192 days with a perihelion of {{convert|46500000|km|mi AU|abbr=unit}} from the Sun. Several problems affected operations. One of the two antennas did not deploy correctly, reducing the sensitivity of the radio plasma apparatus to low-frequency waves. When the high-gain antenna was connected, the mission team realized that their emissions interfered with the analyzer particles and the radio receiver. To reduce the interference, communications were carried out using reduced power, but this required using the large diameter terrestrial receivers already in place thanks to other space missions in progress.\n\nDuring the first [[perihelion]] in late February 1975, the spacecraft came closer to the Sun than any previous spacecraft. The temperature of some components reached more than {{convert|100|C}}, while the solar panels reached {{convert|127|C}}, without affecting probe operations. During the second pass on September 21, however, temperatures reached {{convert|132|C}}, which affected the operation of certain instruments.\n\n===''Helios-B''===\nBefore ''Helios-B'' was launched, some modifications were made to the spacecraft based on lessons learned from the operations of ''Helios-A''. The small engines used for attitude control were improved. Changes were made to the implementation mechanism of the flexible antenna and high gain antenna emissions. The [[X-ray]] detectors were improved so that they could detect [[gamma ray burst]]s and allowing them to be used in conjunction with Earth-orbiting satellites to triangulate the location of the bursts. As temperatures on ''Helios-A'' were always greater than {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} below the design maximum at perihelion, it was decided that ''Helios-B'' would orbit even closer to the Sun, and the thermal insulation was enhanced to allow the satellite to resist 15 percent higher temperatures.\n\nTight schedule constraints pressed on the ''Helios-B'' launch in early 1976. Facilities damaged during the launch of the ''[[Viking 2]]'' spacecraft in September 1975 had to be repaired, while the [[Viking program|Viking]] landing on [[Mars]] in summer 1976 would make the  [[Deep Space Network]] antennas that ''Helios-B'' would need to conduct its perihelion science unavailable.\n\n''Helios-B'' was launched on January 10, 1976, using a Titan IIIE rocket. The probe was placed in an orbit with a 187-day period and a perihelion of {{convert|43500000|km|mi AU|abbr=unit}}. The orientation of ''Helios-B'' with respect to the ecliptic was reversed 180 degrees compared to ''Helios-A'' so that the micrometeorite detectors could have 360 degree coverage. On April 17, 1976, ''Helios-B'' made its closest pass of the Sun at a record heliocentric speed of {{convert|70|km/s|km/h mi/h}}. The maximum recorded temperature was {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} higher than measured by ''Helios-A''.\n\n===End of operations===\nThe primary mission of each probe spanned 18 months, but they operated much longer. On March{{nbsp}}3, 1980, four years after its launch, the radio transceiver on ''Helios-B'' failed. On January{{nbsp}}7, 1981, a stop command was sent to prevent possible radio interference during future missions. ''Helios-A'' continued to function normally, but with the large-diameter DSN antennae not available, data was collected by small diameter antennae at a lower rate. By its 14th orbit, ''Helios-A'''s degraded solar cells could no longer provide enough power for the simultaneous collection and transmission of data unless the probe was close to its perihelion. In 1984, the main and backup radio receivers failed, indicating that the high-gain antenna was no longer pointed towards Earth. The last [[telemetry]] data was received on February{{nbsp}}10, 1986.\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Helios spacecraft 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''Helios'' probe being encapsulated for launch]]{{Multiple issues|{{cleanup|section|reason=incomprehensible prose|date=June 2018}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}|section=yes}}\nBoth probes collected important data about the processes that cause [[solar wind]] and acceleration of the particles that make up the interplanetary medium and [[cosmic rays]]. These observations were made over a ten-year period from [[solar minimum]] in 1976 to a [[solar maximum]] in the early 1980s.\n\nThe observation of the [[zodiacal light]] has established some of the properties of [[interplanetary dust]] present between 0.1{{nbsp}}AU and 1{{nbsp}}AU from the Sun, such as their spatial distribution, color and [[polarization]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2020}}. It has been established that the powder was more sensitive <!-- more sensitive than what? --> to [[gravitational force]]s and [[electromagnetic force]]s. The amount of dust was observed up to 10 times around the Earth.<!-- was the dust observed 10 times, or was it observed to be a specific amount 10 times? or was the amount 10 times as large as some other amount? --> [[Heterogeneous]] distribution was generally expected due to the passage of comets, but observations have not confirmed this. The probe instruments detected dust near the Sun showing that, despite the sunshine is still present in distance 0.09 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].\n\n''Helios'' also allowed an increase in data to be collected on comets, observing the passage of [[C/1975 V1|C/1975 V1 (West)]] in 1976, [[C/1978 H1]] (Meir) in November 1978 and [[C/1979 Y1]] (Bradfield) in February 1980. During the last probe, instruments observed a disturbance wind solar which translated later by a break in the comet's tail. The plasma analyzer showed that the acceleration phenomena of the high-speed solar wind were associated with the presence of coronal holes. This instrument also detected, for the first time, the helium ions isolated in the solar wind. In 1981, during the peak of solar activity, the data collected by ''Helios-A'' at a short distance from the Sun helped complete visual observations of coronal mass ejections performed from the Earth's orbit. Data collected by magnetometers two probes ''Helios'' supplemented with interplanetary probes ''[[Pioneer program|Pioneer]]'' and ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' were used to determine the direction of the magnetic field at staggered distances from the Sun.\n\nThe radio and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] wave detectors were used to detect radio explosions and shock waves associated with solar flares, usually during solar maximum. The cosmic ray detectors studied how the Sun and interplanetary medium influenced the spread of the same rays, of solar or galactic origin. The gradient of cosmic rays, as a function of distance from the Sun, was measured. These observations, combined with those made by ''Pioneer{{nbsp}}11'' between 1977 and 1980 on the outside of the [[solar system]] (12\u201323{{nbsp}}AU from the Sun) produced good modelling of this [[gradient]]. The GRBs ''Helios-B'' detector identified 18 events during the first three years of operation of the instrument, whose source can, for some, be identified with the help of searches made by satellites orbiting the Earth. Some features of the inner solar corona were measured during occultations. For this purpose, either a radio signal was sent from the spacecraft to Earth or the ground station sent a signal that was returned by the probe. Changes in signal propagation resulting from the solar corona crossing provided information on density fluctuations.\n\n==Mission profile==\n[[Image:Titan 3E Centaur with Helios 1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A Titan 3E rocket sitting on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.|''Helios-A'' sitting atop the [[Titan IIIE]]/[[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] launch vehicle]]\n\n===Launch and trajectory===\n[[Image:Helios - Trajectory.png|thumb|left|200px|Trajectory of the ''Helios'' space probes]]\n{{clear-left}}\n\n===Timeline of travel===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100\" | Date\n!

As built by the main contractor, [[Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm]], they were the first space probes built outside the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] to leave Earth's orbit.\n\nThe probes set a maximum speed record for spacecraft of {{convert|252792|km/h|mph m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=wilkinson2012/> ''Helios-B'' flew {{convert|3000000|km}} closer to the Sun than ''Helios-A'', achieving [[perihelion]] on April{{nbsp}}17, 1976, at a record distance of {{convert|43.432|e6km|mi AU|abbr=unit}},<ref name='by target'>{{Cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Helios_02&Display=ReadMore|title=Solar System Exploration: Missions: By Target: Our Solar System: Past: Helios 2|access-date=November 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005103307/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Helios_02&Display=ReadMore|archive-date=October 5, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> closer than the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

''Helios-A'' has a mass of {{convert|370|kg}}, and ''Helios-B'' has a mass of {{convert|376.5|kg}}. Their scientific payloads have a mass of {{convert|73.2|kg}} on ''Helios-A'' and {{convert|76.5|kg}} on ''Helios-B''. The central bodies are sixteen-sided prisms {{convert|1.75|m}} in diameter and {{convert|0.55|m}} high. Most of the equipment and instrumentation is mounted in this central body. The exceptions are the masts and antennae used during experiments and small telescopes that measure the [[zodiacal light]] and which emerge from the central body. Two conical solar panels extend above and below the central body, giving the assembly the appearance of a [[diabolo]] or spool of thread.\n\nAt launch, each probe was {{convert|2.12|m}} tall with a maximum diameter of {{convert|2.77|m}}. Once in orbit, telecommunications antennae unfolded on top of the probes and increased the heights to {{convert|4.2|m}}. Also deployed upon achieving orbit were two rigid booms carrying sensors and magnetometers, attached on both sides of the central bodies, and two flexible antennae used for the detection of radio waves, which extended perpendicular to the axes of the spacecraft for a design length of {{convert|16|m}} each.<ref>[http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/helios.shtml Helios]. Bernd Leitenberger. Retrieved May 20, 2016.</ref>\n\nThe spacecraft spin around their axes, which are perpendicular to the [[ecliptic]], at 60{{nbsp}}[[rpm]].\n\n==Power==\n\n[[Electric energy|Electrical power]] is provided by [[solar cell]]s attached to the two truncated cones. To keep the solar panels at a temperature below {{convert|165|C}} when in proximity to the Sun, the solar cells are interspersed with mirrors, covering 50% of the surface and reflecting part of the incident sunlight while dissipating the excess heat. The power supplied by the solar panels is a minimum of 240{{nbsp}}[[watt]]s when the probe is at [[aphelion]]. Its voltage is regulated to 28{{nbsp}}[[volts]] [[Direct current|DC]], and the energy is stored on an 8{{nbsp}}[[Ampere-hour|Ah]] silver\u2013zinc battery. The batteries were only used during launch.{{contradict-inline|date=April 2020|reason=Is the energy from the solar cells stored in a battery, or were the batteries never used after launch? Both can't simultaneously be true. Are these different batteries?}}\n\n==Thermal control==\n[[File:Helios - launch configuration diagram.png|thumb|Launch configuration diagram]]\n[[File:Helios - testing.png|thumb|left|upright|A technician stands next to one of the twin ''Helios'' spacecraft]]\n\nThe biggest technical challenge faced by the designers was the heat that the probe was subject to when close to the Sun. At {{convert|0.3|AU}} from the Sun, approximate heat flow is 11 solar constants, (11 times the amount of received heat in Earth orbit), or 22.4&nbsp;[[Watt (unit)|kW]] per exposed square meter. Under these conditions, the temperature of the probe can then reach {{convert|370|C}}. The [[solar cells]], and the central compartment of instruments, had to be maintained at much lower temperatures. The temperature of the solar cells could not exceed {{convert|165|C}}, while the central compartment had to be maintained between {{convert|-10|and|20|C}}. These restrictions required the rejection of 96 percent of the heat received from the Sun. The conical shape of the solar panels is one of the measures that was taken to reduce the flow of heat. By tilting the solar panels with respect to sunlight arriving perpendicularly to the axis of the probe, a greater proportion of the [[solar radiation]] is reflected. Furthermore, \"second surface mirrors\" specially developed by [[NASA]] cover the entire central body and 50 percent of the solar generators. These are made of fused quartz, with a silver film on the inner face, which is itself covered with a dielectric material. For additional protection, [[multi-layer insulation]]{{snd}}consisting of 18 layers of {{convert|0.25|mm}} [[Mylar]] or [[Kapton]] (depending on location), held apart from each other by small plastic pins intended to prevent the formation of [[thermal bridge]]s{{snd}}was used to partially cover the core compartment. In addition to these passive devices, the probes used an active system of movable louvers arranged in a shutter-like pattern along the bottom and top side of the compartment. The opening thereof is controlled separately by a bimetal spring whose length varies with temperature and causes the opening or closing of the shutter. Resistors were also used to help maintain a temperature sufficient for certain equipment.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khzDRYfj97AC&pg=PA918 | title=The trip to hot space | journal=[[New Scientist]] | first=G\u00fcnter | last=Sandscheper | volume=64 | issue=929 | page=918 | date=December 26, 1974}}</ref>\n\n==Telecommunications system==\n\nThe telecommunication system uses a radio transceiver, whose power could be adjusted between 0.5 and 20&nbsp;watts. Three antennas were overlaid on top of each probe. A high-gain antenna (23&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]]), used to emit a top brush of 5.5\u00b0 on either side of elliptical{{Clarify|reason=What's a top brush?

If not, what does it mean?|date=February 2020}} and 14\u00b0 wide, a medium-gain antenna (3&nbsp;dB for transmission and 6.3&nbsp;dB for reception) emits a signal in all directions of the ecliptic plane at the height of 15\u00b0, and an omnidirectional dipole antenna (0.3&nbsp;dB transmission and 0.8&nbsp;dB for reception). The low-gain horn antenna{{Clarify|reason=What is the \"low-gain horn antenna\"? I thought the low-gain antenna was a dipole.|date=February 2020}} was located under the center of the probe to allow for an adapter that connected the probe to the launch vehicle. To be directed continuously toward [[Earth]], the high-gain antenna is kept in rotation by a motor at a speed that counterbalances exactly the body of the probe. Synchronizing the speed is performed using data supplied by a [[Sun sensor]]. The maximum data rate obtained with the large antenna gain was 4096 bits per second upstream. The reception and transmission of signals were supported by the [[Deep Space Network]] network antennas on Earth.\n\n==Attitude control==\n{{Rewrite section|date=February 2020}}\nTo maintain its orientation during the mission, the spacecraft rotated continuously at 60&nbsp;rpm around their main axes. The orientation control system making corrections to the speed and orientation of the probes shafts.

Guidance corrections were performed using cold gas thrusters 3 (7.7&nbsp;kg [[nitrogen]]) with a boost of 1{{nbsp}}[[Newton (unit)|Newton]]. The axis of the probe was permanently maintained, both perpendicular to the direction of the Sun and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.\n\n==On-board computer and data storage==\nThe on-board controllers were capable of handling 256 commands. The mass memory could store 500&nbsp;[[kilobits|kb]], (this was a very large memory for space probes of the time), and was mainly used when the probes were in superior conjunction relative to the [[Earth]] (i.e. the Sun comes between the Earth and the spacecraft). The conjunction could last up to 65 days.\n\n==Experiments and instruments==\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Copy edit section|for=grammar|date=February 2020}}\n{{confusing|section|date=March 2020|reason=the intended meanings of some sentences and phrases may not be understood by copy-editors due to poor grammar, making it difficult to correct ambiguous or nonsensical statements}}\n|section=yes}}\nBoth ''Helios'' probes had ten scientific instruments:<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760019169_1976019169.pdf |title=Tracking and Data Systems Support for the Helios Project|publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Experiments===\n* '''[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] Experiment Investigation''': developed by the [[Max Planck Institute]] for the study of low-energy particles.

This was the first operational flight of the [[Titan IIIE]] rocket. The rocket's test flight had failed when the engine on the upper [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur stage]] did not light, but the launch of ''Helios-A'' was uneventful.\n\nThe probe was placed in a heliocentric orbit of 192 days with a perihelion of {{convert|46500000|km|mi AU|abbr=unit}} from the Sun. Several problems affected operations. One of the two antennas did not deploy correctly, reducing the sensitivity of the radio plasma apparatus to low-frequency waves. When the high-gain antenna was connected, the mission team realized that their emissions interfered with the analyzer particles and the radio receiver. To reduce the interference, communications were carried out using reduced power, but this required using the large diameter terrestrial receivers already in place thanks to other space missions in progress.\n\nDuring the first [[perihelion]] in late February 1975, the spacecraft came closer to the Sun than any previous spacecraft. The temperature of some components reached more than {{convert|100|C}}, while the solar panels reached {{convert|127|C}}, without affecting probe operations. During the second pass on September 21, however, temperatures reached {{convert|132|C}}, which affected the operation of certain instruments.\n\n===''Helios-B''===\nBefore ''Helios-B'' was launched, some modifications were made to the spacecraft based on lessons learned from the operations of ''Helios-A''. The small engines used for attitude control were improved. Changes were made to the implementation mechanism of the flexible antenna and high gain antenna emissions. The [[X-ray]] detectors were improved so that they could detect [[gamma ray burst]]s and allowing them to be used in conjunction with Earth-orbiting satellites to triangulate the location of the bursts. As temperatures on ''Helios-A'' were always greater than {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} below the design maximum at perihelion, it was decided that ''Helios-B'' would orbit even closer to the Sun, and the thermal insulation was enhanced to allow the satellite to resist 15 percent higher temperatures.\n\nTight schedule constraints pressed on the ''Helios-B'' launch in early 1976. Facilities damaged during the launch of the ''[[Viking 2]]'' spacecraft in September 1975 had to be repaired, while the [[Viking program|Viking]] landing on [[Mars]] in summer 1976 would make the  [[Deep Space Network]] antennas that ''Helios-B'' would need to conduct its perihelion science unavailable.\n\n''Helios-B'' was launched on January 10, 1976, using a Titan IIIE rocket. The probe was placed in an orbit with a 187-day period and a perihelion of {{convert|43500000|km|mi AU|abbr=unit}}. The orientation of ''Helios-B'' with respect to the ecliptic was reversed 180 degrees compared to ''Helios-A'' so that the micrometeorite detectors could have 360 degree coverage. On April 17, 1976, ''Helios-B'' made its closest pass of the Sun at a record heliocentric speed of {{convert|70|km/s|km/h mi/h}}. The maximum recorded temperature was {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} higher than measured by ''Helios-A''.\n\n===End of operations===\nThe primary mission of each probe spanned 18 months, but they operated much longer. On March{{nbsp}}3, 1980, four years after its launch, the radio transceiver on ''Helios-B'' failed. On January{{nbsp}}7, 1981, a stop command was sent to prevent possible radio interference during future missions. ''Helios-A'' continued to function normally, but with the large-diameter DSN antennae not available, data was collected by small diameter antennae at a lower rate. By its 14th orbit, ''Helios-A'''s degraded solar cells could no longer provide enough power for the simultaneous collection and transmission of data unless the probe was close to its perihelion. In 1984, the main and backup radio receivers failed, indicating that the high-gain antenna was no longer pointed towards Earth. The last [[telemetry]] data was received on February{{nbsp}}10, 1986.\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Helios spacecraft 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A ''Helios'' probe being encapsulated for launch]]{{Multiple issues|{{cleanup|section|reason=incomprehensible prose|date=June 2018}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}|section=yes}}\nBoth probes collected important data about the processes that cause [[solar wind]] and acceleration of the particles that make up the interplanetary medium and [[cosmic rays]]. These observations were made over a ten-year period from [[solar minimum]] in 1976 to a [[solar maximum]] in the early 1980s.\n\nThe observation of the [[zodiacal light]] has established some of the properties of [[interplanetary dust]] present between 0.1{{nbsp}}AU and 1{{nbsp}}AU from the Sun, such as their spatial distribution, color and [[polarization]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2020}}. It has been established that the powder was more sensitive <!-- more sensitive than what? --> to [[gravitational force]]s and [[electromagnetic force]]s. The amount of dust was observed up to 10 times around the Earth.<!-- was the dust observed 10 times, or was it observed to be a specific amount 10 times? or was the amount 10 times as large as some other amount? --> [[Heterogeneous]] distribution was generally expected due to the passage of comets, but observations have not confirmed this. The probe instruments detected dust near the Sun showing that, despite the sunshine is still present in distance 0.09 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].\n\n''Helios'' also allowed an increase in data to be collected on comets, observing the passage of [[C/1975 V1|C/1975 V1 (West)]] in 1976, [[C/1978 H1]] (Meir) in November 1978 and [[C/1979 Y1]] (Bradfield) in February 1980. During the last probe, instruments observed a disturbance wind solar which translated later by a break in the comet's tail. The plasma analyzer showed that the acceleration phenomena of the high-speed solar wind were associated with the presence of coronal holes. This instrument also detected, for the first time, the helium ions isolated in the solar wind. In 1981, during the peak of solar activity, the data collected by ''Helios-A'' at a short distance from the Sun helped complete visual observations of coronal mass ejections performed from the Earth's orbit. Data collected by magnetometers two probes ''Helios'' supplemented with interplanetary probes ''[[Pioneer program|Pioneer]]'' and ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' were used to determine the direction of the magnetic field at staggered distances from the Sun.\n\nThe radio and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] wave detectors were used to detect radio explosions and shock waves associated with solar flares, usually during solar maximum. The cosmic ray detectors studied how the Sun and interplanetary medium influenced the spread of the same rays, of solar or galactic origin. The gradient of cosmic rays, as a function of distance from the Sun, was measured. These observations, combined with those made by ''Pioneer{{nbsp}}11'' between 1977 and 1980 on the outside of the [[solar system]] (12\u201323{{nbsp}}AU from the Sun) produced good modelling of this [[gradient]]. The GRBs ''Helios-B'' detector identified 18 events during the first three years of operation of the instrument, whose source can, for some, be identified with the help of searches made by satellites orbiting the Earth. Some features of the inner solar corona were measured during occultations.

Songwriting contributions were also made by [[Joan Jett]], [[Diane Warren]], [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Richie Sambora]], and [[John McCurry]].\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n|total_length=40:11\n|title1=[[Poison (Alice Cooper song)|Poison]]\n|writer1=[[Alice Cooper]] \u00b7 [[Desmond Child]] \u00b7 [[John McCurry]]\n|length1=4:29\n|title2=Spark in the Dark\n|writer2=Cooper \u00b7 Child\n|length2=3:52\n|title3=[[House of Fire]]\n|writer3=Cooper \u00b7 Child \u00b7 [[Joan Jett]]\n|length3=3:47\n|title4=Why Trust You\n|writer4=Cooper \u00b7 Child\n|length4=3:12\n|title5=[[Only My Heart Talkin']]\n|writer5=Cooper \u00b7 [[Bruce Roberts (singer)|Bruce Roberts]] \u00b7 Andy Goldmark\n|length5=4:47\n|title6=[[Bed of Nails (song)|Bed of Nails]]\n|writer6=Cooper \u00b7 Child \u00b7 [[Kane Roberts]] \u00b7 [[Diane Warren]]\n|length6=4:20\n|title7=This Maniac's in Love with You\n|writer7=Cooper \u00b7 Child \u00b7 Bob Held \u00b7 Tom Teeley\n|length7=3:48\n|title8=Trash\n|writer8=Cooper \u00b7 Child \u00b7 Mark Frazier \u00b7 Jamie Sever\n|length8=4:01\n|title9=Hell Is Living Without You\n|writer9=Cooper \u00b7 Child \u00b7 Jon Bon Jovi \u00b7 [[Richie Sambora]]\n|length9=4:11\n|title10=I'm Your Gun\n|writer10=Cooper \u00b7 Child \u00b7 McCurry \n|length10=3:47\n}}\n{{Track listing\n|collapsed=no\n|headline=Additional tracks on the Japanese release\n|title11=Cold Ethyl (live)\n|writer11=Cooper \u00b7 [[Bob Ezrin]]\n|title12=Ballad of Dwight Fry (live)\n|writer12=[[Michael Owen Bruce|Michael Bruce]] \u00b7 Cooper\n}}\n{{Track listing\n|collapsed=no\n|headline=Additional tracks on the 2014 Japanese LTD Blu-spec CD II Remastered Re-issue\n|title11=Only My Heart Talkin' (Radio Edit)\n|writer11=Cooper \u00b7 Roberts \u00b7 Goldmark\n|title12=[[I Got a Line on You]] \n|writer12=[[Randy California]]\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n;Main musicians\n*[[Alice Cooper]] \u2013 [[vocals]]\n*[[John McCurry]] \u2013 [[electric guitar|guitar]]\n*[[Hugh McDonald (American musician)|Hugh McDonald]] \u2013 [[bass guitar|bass]]\n*Bobby Chouinard \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n*Alan St. John \u2013 [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]\n\n;Additional personnel\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Steven Tyler]] \u2013 vocals (track 5)\n*[[Jon Bon Jovi]] \u2013 vocals (track 8)\n*[[Kip Winger]] \u2013 vocals (track 10)\n*[[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] \u2013 guitar (track 3)\n*[[Richie Sambora]] \u2013 guitar (track 9)\n{{col-3}}\n*[[Steve Lukather]] \u2013 guitar (track 9)\n*[[Kane Roberts]] \u2013 guitar (track 6)\n*[[Guy Mann-Dude]] \u2013 guitar (tracks 2, 4, 7)\n*[[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]] \u2013 bass (track 8)\n*[[Joey Kramer]] \u2013 drums (track 8)\n{{col-3}}\n*Mark Frazier \u2013 guitar (track 8)\n*Jack Johnson \u2013 guitar (track 8)\n*Paul Chiten \u2013 keyboards\n*Steve Deutsch \u2013 synth programming\n*Gregg Mangiafico \u2013 keyboards & special effects\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n*Produced by Desmond Child\n*Recorded by Sir Arthur Payson, Obie O'Brien and [[Nick DiDia]] (both at Sanctuary Studios), George Cowan (at Bearsville), Mark Tanzer (at Blue Jay), Lolly Grodner (at Mediasound), Ben Fowler (at Power Station), John Herman (at Right Track), Brian Peterofsky (at Sigma Sound).\n*Assistant Engineers: Duane Seykora (at The Complex) and Robert Hart (Village Recorders).\n*Mixed by Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero.\n*Mastered by George Marino.\n\n==Outtakes==\nThe following additional songs were written and recorded for the album but remain unreleased: \"Low Class Reunion\", \"The Ballad of Alice Cooper\", \"Bad Angel\", \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" as well as \"Aggrolat\".

The film stars an ensemble cast of [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Vidya Balan]], [[Taapsee Pannu]], [[Nithya Menen]], [[Kirti Kulhari]], [[Sharman Joshi]], [[H. G. Dattatreya]], [[Vikram Gokhale]], and [[Sonakshi Sinha]]. The film is loosely based on the life of scientists at the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] who contributed to the [[Mars Orbiter Mission]], India's first interplanetary expedition.\n\n''Mission Mangal'' was announced in November 2018. Shakti, who worked as associate director on ''[[Pad Man (film)|Pad Man]]'' (2018), [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the script to Kumar. Principal photography for the film began in November 2018. The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Amit Trivedi]] and [[Tanishk Bagchi]] with lyrics written by Baghchi along with [[Amitabh Bhattacharya]], and released under the banner [[Zee Music Company]]. ''Mission Mangal'' was theatrically released in India on 15 August 2019, India's [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]]. It received positive reviews from critics and earned {{INR}}200090.59 crore worldwide, becoming a commercial success.<!--Sourced in body, don't remove-->\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter the failed launch of GSLV-F06 on 25 December 2010, due to a small mistake by Project Director Tara Shinde, Rakesh Dhawan, a fellow scientist working with her, takes the blame for her. As a result, he is relocated to work on [[Mars Orbiter Mission|Mangalyaan]] as punishment. The new GSLV missions are given to Rupert Desai, a NASA scientist of Indian origin.  The MoM (Mars Orbiter Mission) is thought of as an impossible mission by his coworkers due its aim of reaching [[Mars]] with its tight budget.\n\nRakesh learns that MoM cannot take off on the [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle|PSLV]] since the available technology has a payload of only 1500&nbsp;kg and not enough fuel to fire the rocket to be carried to a distance of almost 5.5*10^7 [[kilometres]]. [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle|GSLV]], if it had succeeded, could have taken the satellite to Mars as it had a payload of 2300&nbsp;kg. However, recent significant failures of GSLV have jeopardised the planned future missions.\n\nBack at home, Tara is badly caught in between balancing her career and her family. One day at home, while frying 'Puris', Tara's maid informs of insufficient gas to cook all the 'Puris', to which Tara tells her to heat the oil and turn off the gas, and turn it back on if oil cools down, which sparks her an idea to launch the MoM using PSLV. They would use bursts of gas to push the MoM satellite further into Earth's outside orbit, and then slingshot it using Earth's gravitational sphere, successfully saving fuel. She approaches Rakesh with the idea, who is convinced. The duo tries to get the other team members on board, but instead are mocked, though they later are convinced too along with Director of ISRO. When Tara and Rakesh ask Rupert to lend them expert members of his team, Rupert instead gives them junior scientists and engineers, who have little to no experience in mission launches.\n\nFirst, there is Eka Gandhi, propulsion control expert, a youngster that hates most Indian things and looking for any chance to get away to [[NASA]]. Then there is the spacecraft autonomy designer Neha Siddiqui, who is struggling with rejection as a result of her intercommunal background. Navigation expert Krittika Agarwal is a devoted wife tending to her ex-serviceman husband Rishi Agarwal, who was severely wounded in action. Varsha Pillai, the satellite designer and payload expert, battles with her mother-in-law's taunts at home for not being able to bear a child. Parmeshwar Joshi, payload expert, relies more on the priest and his advice to and develops a romantic interest in Eka. Lastly, there is Ananth  Iyenger, the team's structural engineer.\n\nHowever, after the announcement of India's second Moon mission, [[Chandrayaan-2]], the mission's budget is cut by 50%. In between the tight schedule and minuscule budget, Tara and Rakesh continue to work on their MoM project by making several compromises. Tara and Rakesh realise that the junior scientists working on the project have low morale and motivation to make this mission happen, leading to the team slowing down. Tara soon realises that in order to meet their budget and schedule, she must make the team members change their attitudes, and motivate them to make their dream jobs into a reality. She is successful with this, and the team puts all their hardwork and energy into solving the issues with the mission, and making it happen.\n\nThe MoM satellite is finally launched on PSLV on 5 November 2013(after an 8-day delay due to weather), and is named Mangalyaan ([[Sanskrit]]: Mars-Craft) and is successfully inserted into Earth's orbit. Rakesh and his team celebrates the successful launch. However, while doing the sixth orbit-raising manoeuvre, the jets fail to launch, pushing the mission 6 days behind. Rupert mocks the team, while Tara continues to keep hope that something will happen. Couple months later, on the way to Mars, the satellite is hit by a solar radiation wave, heavily damaging the communication systems of the satellite. When the team manages to regain communications, they realise that the solar radiation had increased the speed of the satellite and pushed it further, making up the 6 day gap they had incurred while doing the orbital manoeuvres with Earth. After spending 298-day transit to Mars, MoM satellite is inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, making the country 4th in the world to do so and the first country to do it in the first attempt.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Colbegin}}\n*[[Akshay Kumar]] as Rakesh Dhawan : Mission Mangal director\n*[[Vidya Balan]] as Tara Shinde: Project director\n*[[Vikram Gokhale]] as Chandresh Singh: Director of [[ISRO]]\n*[[Sonakshi Sinha]] as Eka Gandhi: Propulsion Control Expert\n*[[Taapsee Pannu]] as Kritika Aggarwal: [[Navigation]] Expert\n*[[Nithya Menen]] as Varsha Pillai: [[Satellite]] Engineer\n*[[Kirti Kulhari]] as Neha Siddiqui: [[Spacecraft]] [[Autonomy]] Designer and [[Payload]] Expert\n*[[Sharman Joshi]] as Parmeshwar Joshi: [[Payload]] Expert\n*[[H.

The film stars an ensemble cast of [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Vidya Balan]], [[Taapsee Pannu]], [[Nithya Menen]], [[Kirti Kulhari]], [[Sharman Joshi]], [[H. G. Dattatreya]], [[Vikram Gokhale]], and [[Sonakshi Sinha]]. The film is loosely based on the life of scientists at the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] who contributed to the [[Mars Orbiter Mission]], India's first interplanetary expedition.\n\n''Mission Mangal'' was announced in November 2018. Shakti, who worked as associate director on ''[[Pad Man (film)|Pad Man]]'' (2018), [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the script to Kumar. Principal photography for the film began in November 2018. The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Amit Trivedi]] and [[Tanishk Bagchi]] with lyrics written by Baghchi along with [[Amitabh Bhattacharya]], and released under the banner [[Zee Music Company]]. ''Mission Mangal'' was theatrically released in India on 15 August 2019, India's [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]]. It received positive reviews from critics and earned {{INR}}290.59 crore worldwide, becoming a commercial success.<!--Sourced in body, don't remove-->\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter the failed launch of GSLV-F06 on 25 December 2010, due to a small mistake by Project Director Tara Shinde, Rakesh Dhawan, a fellow scientist working with her, takes the blame for her. As a result, he is relocated to work on [[Mars Orbiter Mission|Mangalyaan]] as punishment. The new GSLV missions are given to Rupert Desai, a NASA scientist of Indian origin.  The MoM (Mars Orbiter Mission) is thought of as an impossible mission by his coworkers due its aim of reaching [[Mars]] with its tight budget.\n\nRakesh learns that MoM cannot take off on the [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle|PSLV]] since the available technology has a payload of only 1500&nbsp;kg and not enough fuel to fire the rocket to be carried to a distance of almost 5.5*10^7 [[kilometres]]. [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle|GSLV]], if it had succeeded, could have taken the satellite to Mars as it had a payload of 2300&nbsp;kg. However, recent significant failures of GSLV have jeopardised the planned future missions.\n\nBack at home, Tara is badly caught in between balancing her career and her family. One day at home, while frying 'Puris', Tara's maid informs of insufficient gas to cook all the 'Puris', to which Tara tells her to heat the oil and turn off the gas, and turn it back on if oil cools down, which sparks her an idea to launch the MoM using PSLV. They would use bursts of gas to push the MoM satellite further into Earth's outside orbit, and then slingshot it using Earth's gravitational sphere, successfully saving fuel. She approaches Rakesh with the idea, who is convinced. The duo tries to get the other team members on board, but instead are mocked, though they later are convinced too along with Director of ISRO. When Tara and Rakesh ask Rupert to lend them expert members of his team, Rupert instead gives them junior scientists and engineers, who have little to no experience in mission launches.\n\nFirst, there is Eka Gandhi, propulsion control expert, a youngster that hates most Indian things and looking for any chance to get away to [[NASA]]. Then there is the spacecraft autonomy designer Neha Siddiqui, who is struggling with rejection as a result of her intercommunal background. Navigation expert Krittika Agarwal is a devoted wife tending to her ex-serviceman husband Rishi Agarwal, who was severely wounded in action. Varsha Pillai, the satellite designer and payload expert, battles with her mother-in-law's taunts at home for not being able to bear a child. Parmeshwar Joshi, payload expert, relies more on the priest and his advice to and develops a romantic interest in Eka. Lastly, there is Ananth  Iyenger, the team's structural engineer.\n\nHowever, after the announcement of India's second Moon mission, [[Chandrayaan-2]], the mission's budget is cut by 50%. In between the tight schedule and minuscule budget, Tara and Rakesh continue to work on their MoM project by making several compromises. Tara and Rakesh realise that the junior scientists working on the project have low morale and motivation to make this mission happen, leading to the team slowing down. Tara soon realises that in order to meet their budget and schedule, she must make the team members change their attitudes, and motivate them to make their dream jobs into a reality. She is successful with this, and the team puts all their hardwork and energy into solving the issues with the mission, and making it happen.\n\nThe MoM satellite is finally launched on PSLV on 5 November 2013(after an 8-day delay due to weather), and is named Mangalyaan ([[Sanskrit]]: Mars-Craft) and is successfully inserted into Earth's orbit. Rakesh and his team celebrates the successful launch. However, while doing the sixth orbit-raising manoeuvre, the jets fail to launch, pushing the mission 6 days behind. Rupert mocks the team, while Tara continues to keep hope that something will happen. Couple months later, on the way to Mars, the satellite is hit by a solar radiation wave, heavily damaging the communication systems of the satellite. When the team manages to regain communications, they realise that the solar radiation had increased the speed of the satellite and pushed it further, making up the 6 day gap they had incurred while doing the orbital manoeuvres with Earth. After spending 298-day transit to Mars, MoM satellite is inserted into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, making the country 4th in the world to do so and the first country to do it in the first attempt.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Colbegin}}\n*[[Akshay Kumar]] as Rakesh Dhawan : Mission Mangal director\n*[[Vidya Balan]] as Tara Shinde: Project director\n*[[Vikram Gokhale]] as Chandresh Singh: Director of [[ISRO]]\n*[[Sonakshi Sinha]] as Eka Gandhi: Propulsion Control Expert\n*[[Taapsee Pannu]] as Kritika Aggarwal: [[Navigation]] Expert\n*[[Nithya Menen]] as Varsha Pillai: [[Satellite]] Engineer\n*[[Kirti Kulhari]] as Neha Siddiqui: [[Spacecraft]] [[Autonomy]] Designer and [[Payload]] Expert\n*[[Sharman Joshi]] as Parmeshwar Joshi: [[Payload]] Expert\n*[[H.

It was written by [[Zeus Cervas]], [[Erik Wiese]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], and the animation was directed by supervising director, [[Alan Smart]] and [[Tom Yasumi]]. Cervas and Wiese also functioned as [[storyboard]] directors. The episode originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on February 20, 2006 as a [[television special|half-hour special]].\n\nThe series follows the adventures and endeavors of [[spongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob and Patrick go back in time. There, they find that Mr. Krabs' ancestor is the ruler of the kingdom, which is being attacked by Planktonimor, Plankton's ancestor and an evil wizard. SpongeBob and Patrick, assisted by Squidly, a [[jester]] and ancestor of [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]], and the Dark Knight, [[Sandy Cheeks|Sandy]]'s ancestor, have to rescue Princess Pearl, ancestor of [[Mr. Krabs#Pearl|Pearl]] and King Krabs' daughter, who has been captured by Planktonimor the wizard.\n\n[[Tie-in]] promotions were made with [[Burger King]], which released a series of toys based on the episode. \"Dunces and Dragons\" was the most successful of the season, drawing 8.6 million viewers, and was met with positive reviews. It was also elected as the third most-voted episode on the [[Best Day Ever|Best Day Ever Marathon]], just behind two other episodes from the same season, \"Karate Island\" and \"Wishing You Well\".\n\nThe title is an obvious parody of the extremely popular medieval fantasy role-playing game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] attend a [[jousting]] tournament at the Medieval Moments restaurant. Both accept an invitation for members of the audience to participate in the tournament. They are put on [[seahorse]]s and given [[lance]]s. The seahorses charge without warning and SpongeBob and Patrick are thrown out of the building into 11th-century Bikini Bottom.\n\nA group of [[knight]]s surround and imprison them, with [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]]'s ancestor, Squidly the jester, locked in the [[dungeon]] for telling a bad joke that causes the king to have a [[stroke]]. Eventually, the king, [[Mr. Krabs]]' ancestor, King Krabs, orders SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidly to the [[throne room]]. They are to be executed for insulting him with a song but Princess Pearl, the 11th-century ancestor of the present-day Pearl, reminds King Krabs of the prophecy that two brave knights, having fallen from the sky, will be sent by the king to defeat the evil wizard, Planktonimor, [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]]'s ancestor, who terrorizes the kingdom with his dragon jellyfish. During the princess' story, Planktonimor's dragon jellyfish kidnaps her. King Krabs then begs SpongeBob and Patrick to rescue her. The two gladly accept with Squidly in tow.\n\nAs SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidly near Planktonimor's tower, the guard, ancestor of [[Sandy Cheeks]], the Dark Knight, blocks them. SpongeBob outwits the knight in a [[karate|karate duel]] but spares her. In return the Dark Knight accompanies them on their quest. On reaching the top of the tower the dragon arrives. As the dragon is about to destroy him SpongeBob pulls out a Krabby Patty which the dragon eats, becoming subservient to SpongeBob. The dragon destroys Planktonimor and the heroes return to the kingdom to celebrate.\n\nThe seahorses again become aggressive, tossing SpongeBob and Patrick and they land on the ground. They find themselves waking back up in present-day Bikini Bottom at the joust. SpongeBob believes it was a crazy dream, but the fact that Patrick landed on Squidly suggests that they weren't entirely dreaming.\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tom Kenny]] - [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]], Electronic British Voice, King, Leech, Narrator, Man Peasant\n* [[Bill Fagerbakke]] - [[Patrick Star|Patrick]], Hunchback\n* [[Rodger Bumpass]] - Squidly, Man Peasant, SpongeBob Doppelganger\n* [[Clancy Brown]] - King Krabs, Dungeon Master\n* [[Carolyn Lawrence]] - [[Sandy Cheeks|Sandy]]\n* [[Lori Alan]] - [[Pearl Krabs|Pearl]]\n* [[Jill Talley]] - [[Karen|Plankton and Karen]], Queen, Audience Member, Woman Peasant\n* [[Mr. Lawrence]] (uncredited) - Planktonamor\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] - Seahorse, Attendant, Knight, Squire, Guard\n\n==Production==\n\"Dunces and Dragons\" was written by Zeus Cervas, [[Erik Wiese]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], with [[Alan Smart]] and [[Tom Yasumi]] serving as [[animation director]]s.

It was written by [[Zeus Cervas]], [[Erik Wiese]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], and the animation was directed by supervising director, [[Alan Smart]] and [[Tom Yasumi]]. Cervas and Wiese also functioned as [[storyboard]] directors. The episode originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on February 20, 2006 as a [[television special|half-hour special]].\n\nThe series follows the adventures and endeavors of [[spongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In this episode, SpongeBob and Patrick go back in time. There, they find that Mr. Krabs' ancestor is the ruler of the kingdom, which is being attacked by Planktonimor, Plankton's ancestor and an evil wizard. SpongeBob and Patrick, assisted by Squidly, a [[jester]] and ancestor of [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]], and the Dark Knight, [[Sandy Cheeks|Sandy]]'s ancestor, have to rescue Princess Pearl, ancestor of [[Mr. Krabs#Pearl|Pearl]] and King Krabs' daughter, who has been captured by Planktonimor the wizard.\n\n[[Tie-in]] promotions were made with [[Burger King]], which released a series of toys based on the episode. \"Dunces and Dragons\" was the most successful of the season, drawing 8.6 million viewers, and was met with positive reviews. It was also elected as the third most-voted episode on the [[Best Day Ever|Best Day Ever Marathon]], just behind two other episodes from the same season, \"Karate Island\" and \"Wishing You Well\".\n\nThe title is an obvious parody of the extremely popular medieval fantasy role-playing game ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] attend a [[jousting]] tournament at the Medieval Moments restaurant. Both accept an invitation for members of the audience to participate in the tournament. They are put on [[seahorse]]s and given [[lance]]s. The seahorses charge without warning and SpongeBob and Patrick are thrown out of the building into 11th-century Bikini Bottom.\n\nA group of [[knight]]s surround and imprison them, with [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]]'s ancestor, Squidly the jester, locked in the [[dungeon]] for telling a bad joke that causes the king to have a [[stroke]]. Eventually, the king, [[Mr. Krabs]]' ancestor, King Krabs, orders SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidly to the [[throne room]]. They are to be executed for insulting him with a song but Princess Pearl, the 11th-century ancestor of the present-day Pearl, reminds King Krabs of the prophecy that two brave knights, having fallen from the sky, will be sent by the king to defeat the evil wizard, Planktonimor, [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]]'s ancestor, who terrorizes the kingdom with his dragon jellyfish. During the princess' story, Planktonimor's dragon jellyfish kidnaps her. King Krabs then begs SpongeBob and Patrick to rescue her. The two gladly accept with Squidly in tow.\n\nAs SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidly near Planktonimor's tower, the guard, ancestor of [[Sandy Cheeks]], the Dark Knight, blocks them. SpongeBob outwits the knight in a [[karate|karate duel]] but spares her. In return the Dark Knight accompanies them on their quest. On reaching the top of the tower the dragon arrives. As the dragon is about to destroy him SpongeBob pulls out a Krabby Patty which the dragon eats, becoming subservient to SpongeBob. The dragon destroys Planktonimor and the heroes return to the kingdom to celebrate.\n\nThe seahorses again become aggressive, tossing SpongeBob and Patrick and they land on the ground. They find themselves waking back up in present-day Bikini Bottom at the joust. SpongeBob believes it was a crazy dream, but the fact that Patrick landed on Squidly suggests that they weren't entirely dreaming.\n== Cast ==\n* [[Tom Kenny]] - [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]], Electronic British Voice, King, Leech, Narrator, Man Peasant\n* [[Bill Fagerbakke]] - [[Patrick Star|Patrick]], Hunchback\n* [[Rodger Bumpass]] - Squidly, Man Peasant, SpongeBob Doppelganger\n* [[Clancy Brown]] - King Krabs, Dungeon Master\n* [[Carolyn Lawrence]] - [[Sandy Cheeks|Sandy]]\n* [[Lori Alan]] - [[Pearl Krabs|Pearl]]\n* [[Jill Talley]] - [[Karen|Plankton and Karen]], Queen, Audience Member, Woman Peasant\n* [[Mr. Lawrence]] (uncredited) - Planktonamor\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] - Seahorse, Attendant, Knight, Squire, Guard,\n\n== Portrayed By ==\n* [[Mike the Knight]]\n* [[American Dragon: Jake Long]]\n* [[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]\n\n==Production==\n\"Dunces and Dragons\" was written by Zeus Cervas, [[Erik Wiese]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], with [[Alan Smart]] and [[Tom Yasumi]] serving as [[animation director]]s.

{"title_page": "1919 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1919 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 11th. It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

the opponent. As a result, Newton players did not arrive at the ground. Eventually Newton found enough substitutes but they still began the game 2-3 players short. In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short. The chief issue was with the New Zealand team touring Australia at the time meaning many key players were absent from their club teams.\n\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Newton\n| score = 14-9\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore/Newton V North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = North Shore\n| try1 = A Isles, Keenan 2, [[George Isles]]\n| con1 =\n| pen1 = A Isles\n| try2 = Ernie Bailey\n| con2 = McAneny\n| pen2 = McAneny & 1 mark\n| stadium = Victoria Park 1\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = A Ball\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Grafton Outpointed by City/City V Grafton\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Grafton\n| try1 = Hogan, H Wynn, Cole, Asher, [[Jim Clark (rugby league)|Jim Clark]] 2, G Reed\n| con1 = Asher 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = W Ghent\n| stadium = Victoria Park 2\n| attendance = 2500\n| referee = [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 31 May\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = Postponed\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Defeats North Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17176\n| date = 1919-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190602.2.119.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n===Round 5===\nIn the match at Devonport the Marist team was led from the field by their captain with the score at 9-0 to North Shore in protest at a refereeing decision.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities. The Newton v North Shore match was played as a curtain-raiser to the Ponsonby v Maritime match on Auckland Domain 1. When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game.

As a result, some of the scoring lists are inaccurate. For example, George Isles was known to have scored 5 tries however 6 other tries were attributed to \"Isles\" which may have been him or his brother A Isles. Likewise City Rovers featured [[George Paki]] and his brother B Paki.

It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short.

When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand 12 times along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 3-3\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Maritime\n| try1 = A Cadman\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Bert Avery]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 1:30\n| home = Newton\n| score = 22-0\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = North Shore\n| try1 = Iles 3, McSweeney 2, Condon\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = Abandoned\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3/Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = F Thompson (did not arrive)\n}}\n\n===Round 4 Postponed Match===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 20 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 11-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Under League Rules/Ponsonby 11, Marist Old Boys 2/A Well Contested Game\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17218\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190722.2.26\n| accessdate = 2020-02-12}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 = E McGregor, A Cross, S Chatfield\n| con1 = Unknown x 1\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Unknown x 1\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Roope Rooster Knockout Competition==\nThe round 1 match between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[Newton Rangers]] was abandoned towards the end with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] leading by 12 points to 10 after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back.
