Specifically, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that Shiner and another city councillor (Councillor Giorgio Mamolotti) both received a \"hefty\" rent discounts at that address for their rental apartments compared to other tenants in the same building, from a real estate development and management company (Greenwin-Verdiroc Group) that did millions of dollars of business with the City of Toronto. The same article reported that neither Shiner, Mamolotti, or Greenwin-Verdiroc were willing to answer questions regarding the favorable rent discount.<ref>Zack Dubinsky.

These contractions will either pump blood throughout the body (cardiac muscle) or powers breathing, movement or posture (skeletal muscle).<ref name=\"striatedmusclefunction\" />\n\n===Contractions===\nContractions in cardiac muscle tissue are due to [[pacemaker cell]]s. These cells respond to signals from the autonomic nervous system to either increase or decrease the heart rate. Pacemaker cells have [[autorhythmicity]].

Because of the gap junctions, the pacemaker cells transfer the depolarization to other cardiac muscle fibers, in order to contract in unison.<ref name=\"cardiacmuscle\" />\n\nSignals from [[motor neuron]]s cause myofibers to depolarize and therefore release calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
