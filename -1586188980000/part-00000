It is characterized by a wealth derived from both land and sea products. Conquests or demographic movement towards the Algerian territory were two of the main factors of exchanges between the different peoples and cultures ([[Berbers]], Arabs, Turks, Andalusians, French and Spaniards). This cuisine is a Mediterranean and North African cuisine with [[Berbers|Berber]] roots.\n\nAlgerian cuisine offers a variety of dishes depending on the region and the season, but vegetables and cereals remain at its core. Most of the Algerian dishes are centered around bread, meats (lamb, beef or poultry), olive oil, vegetables and fresh herbs. Vegetables are often used for salads, soups, tajines, couscous and sauce-based dishes. Of all the Algerian traditional dishes available, the most famous one is couscous, recognized as a national dish.\n\nPork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Algeria, in accordance with [[Sharia]], the Islamic law.\n\n==Ingredients==\nAlgeria, like other [[Maghreb]] countries, produces a large range of Mediterranean fruits and vegetables and even some tropical ones.<ref>[http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Algeria.html \"Food in Algeria\"]. Food in Every Country (website). Accessed May 2010.</ref> [[Lamb and mutton|Lamb]] is commonly consumed. Mediterranean seafood and [[Fish as food|fish]] are also eaten and produced by the little inshore fishing.\n\nSpices used in Algerian cuisine are dried red chilli of different kinds, caraway, twenty-seven spices are combined for the famous Algerian spice mixture [[ras el hanout]], cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, paprika, coriander, saffron, mace, cloves, fennel, anise, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, fenugreek, black pepper.\n[[File:Spices in an Indian market.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | center]]\n\n==Meats==\nAlgerians consume a high amount of meat, as it is found in almost every dish.{{refnec|[[Mutton]] is the most eaten meat in the country|date=August 2017}}, [[Poultry]] and [[beef]] are also used, other uncommon types of meat such as game, birds and [[venison]] and they are considered a delicacy, [[wild boar]] is also hunted and eaten, but [[pork]] will not be available in stores, it can only be bought from hunters directly.\nIn the south, dromedary meat is also eaten.\n\n==Vegetables==\n[[Vegetables]] that are commonly used include [[potatoes]] (batata/betet\u00e8), [[carrots]] (zrodiya / sennariya), [[Turnip]] (left), [[onions]] (bsel/besla), [[tomatoes]] (tomatish/t\u00f8m\u00e8tish/t'matem), [[zucchini]] (corget / qar'a / khyar), [[garlic]] (ethoum), [[cabbages]] (cromb), [[eggplant]] (bidenjan), [[Olives]] (z\u00e9ton) , [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]] (fliou), [[Cardoon]] (korchef) , [[Vicia faba| broad bean]] (fool), [[Chickpea]] (homoss), and [[Chili pepper]] (felfel).\n\n[[Vegetables]] are often used in [[stews]] tagine or (jwaz/djwizza) and [[soups]] ([[chorba]] or [[harira]] or [[Jari (food)|jari]]) or simply fried or boiled.\n\n==Dishes==\n[[File:Bourak oranais.png | thumb | 220x124px | right]]\nA common and one of the most favorite dishes of Algerian cuisine is [[couscous]],<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8804/|title=Luce Ben Aben, Moorish Women Preparing Couscous, Algiers, Algeria|year=1899|website=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=2013-09-26}}</ref> with other favorites such as [[shakshouka]], Karantita, marqa bel a'assel, a speciality from [[Tlemcen]], and [[chakhchoukha]].

These traditional Algerian soups are served at the beginning of the meal as an entree and are mainly prepared from lamb, mutton or chicken, chickpeas, tomatoes, vermicelli, wheat, spices and different vegetables and legumes. These varied soups are the most popular during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThere are many different types of Algerian salads, including both raw and cooked vegetables, served either hot or cold. Hot salads include zaalouka, an aubergine and tomato mixture, and chakchouka, a mixture of tomatoes, smoked green peppers, garlic , eggs and spices. Influenced by both the Algerian and Mediterranean cuisines, chakchouka may include beetroot or anchovies. There are also dishes of Spanish origin in Algeria, like the [[Gaspacho Oranais]], an Algerian version of a [[Manchego cuisine|Manchego]] dish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coundris.chez-alice.fr/f_recettes_gp.htm|title=Gaspacho oranais ou manchego|date=|publisher=Coundris.chez-alice.fr|accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref>\n[[File:Traditional Algerian food.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | center | Rogag]]\nAlgerians commonly use tajines, a earthenware pot, to cook.

Griwech is a deep-fried pretzel-shaped dough, soaked in honey and sprinkled with sesame seeds; it is commonly eaten during the month of Ramadan.

Fruit juice and soft drinks, called ''gazouz'', are very common and are often drunk daily.\n\nAlgeria previously produced a large quantity of [[Algerian wine|wine]] during the [[French Algeria|French colonization]] but production has decreased since its independence; however, there are some secular activists that want to produce wine.\n\n==Bread==\nBetween 1976 and 1984, the average Algerian family spent around 56% of their income on food and drink, and more than 10% of that number was spent on [[bread]] and other cereal products. Bread is thought to contain God\u2019s blessing, baraka. It is traditionally seen as a symbol of life and functions in rituals symbolic of life, fertility and abundance.<ref name=Jansen>Jansen, Willy. \u201cFrench Bread and Algerian Wine: Conflicting Identities in French Algeria.\u201d In Food, Drink and Identity: Cooking, Eating and Drinking in Europe Since the Middle Ages, edited by Peter Scholliers, 195-218.

Traditionally flat and round, a few centimeters thick, made at home and commonly baked in a gas oven or communal oven.\n\n''Khubz at-taj\u00een or matl\u00fb'': wheat semolina, yeast, water and salt. Flattened pan-bread (French: [[galette]]), baked in a previously heated earthenware or cast-iron plate on a fire. Variations are made by the quality of the leavening agent, by adding barley or sorghum, bran, or by making it corn-based.\n\n''Khubz-ftir, raq\u00e2q, rf\u00ees\" or \"tar\u00eed'': well-kneaded, unleavened dough, baked for half a minute on a convex sheet of brass or iron, balanced on stones over a fire. This is a preferred method for those living nomadic lives due to easy transportation of pan and little amount of fuel necessary.\n\nFrench ''[[baguettes]]'': white, leavened wheat flour. Bought at bakery or street vendor, but never made at home due to access to mills powered by electricity. Power shortages prevent consumption of this bread, and often Algerians turn to home-made breads that are milled by women\u2019s hands.<ref name=Jansen />\n[[File:Baguette-246424.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Baguette]]\n=== Algerian bread ===\nFrench bread tends to be given more value in terms of taste and quality in that it was commonly associated to being more suitable to higher standards.

It is characterized by a wealth derived from both land and sea products. Conquests or demographic movement towards the Algerian territory were two of the main factors of exchanges between the different peoples and cultures ([[Berbers]], Arabs, Turks, Andalusians, French and Spaniards). This cuisine is a Mediterranean and North African cuisine with [[Berbers|Berber]] roots.\n\nAlgerian cuisine offers a variety of dishes depending on the region and the season, but vegetables and cereals remain at its core. Most of the Algerian dishes are centered around bread, meats (lamb, beef or poultry), olive oil, vegetables and fresh herbs. Vegetables are often used for salads, soups, tajines, couscous and sauce-based dishes. Of all the Algerian traditional dishes available, the most famous one is couscous, recognized as a national dish.\n\nPork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Algeria, in accordance with [[Sharia]], the Islamic law.\n\n==Ingredients==\nAlgeria, like other [[Maghreb]] countries, produces a large range of Mediterranean fruits and vegetables and even some tropical ones.<ref>[http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Algeria.html \"Food in Algeria\"]. Food in Every Country (website). Accessed May 2010.</ref> [[Lamb and mutton|Lamb]] is commonly consumed. Mediterranean seafood and [[Fish as food|fish]] are also eaten and produced by the little inshore fishing.\n\nSpices used in Algerian cuisine are dried red chilli of different kinds, caraway, twenty-seven spices are combined for the famous Algerian spice mixture [[ras el hanout]], cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, paprika, coriander, saffron, mace, cloves, fennel, anise, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, fenugreek, black pepper.\n[[File:Spices in an Indian market.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | center]]\n\n==Meats==\nAlgerians consume a high amount of meat, as it is found in almost every dish.{{refnec|[[Mutton]] is the most eaten meat in the country|date=August 2017}}, [[Poultry]] and [[beef]] are also used, other uncommon types of meat such as game, birds and [[venison]] and they are considered a delicacy, [[wild boar]] is also hunted and eaten, but [[pork]] will not be available in stores, it can only be bought from hunters directly.\nIn the south, dromedary meat is also eaten.\n\n==Vegetables==\n[[Vegetables]] that are commonly used include [[potatoes]] (batata/betet\u00e8), [[carrots]] (zrodiya / sennariya), [[Turnip]] (left), [[onions]] (bsel/besla), [[tomatoes]] (tomatish/t\u00f8m\u00e8tish/t'matem), [[zucchini]] (corget / qar'a / khyar), [[garlic]] (ethoum), [[cabbages]] (cromb), [[eggplant]] (bidenjan), [[Olives]] (z\u00e9ton) , [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]] (fliou), [[Cardoon]] (korchef) , [[Vicia faba| broad bean]] (fool), [[Chickpea]] (homoss), and [[Chili pepper]] (felfel).\n\n[[Vegetables]] are often used in [[stews]] tagine or (jwaz/djwizza) and [[soups]] ([[chorba]] or [[harira]] or [[Jari (food)|jari]]) or simply fried or boiled.\n\n==Dishes==\n[[File:Bourak oranais.png | thumb | 220x124px | right]]\nA common and one of the most favorite dishes of Algerian cuisine is [[couscous]],<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8804/|title=Luce Ben Aben, Moorish Women Preparing Couscous, Algiers, Algeria|year=1899|website=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=2013-09-26}}</ref> with other favorites such as [[shakshouka]], Karantita, marqa bel a'assel, a speciality from [[Tlemcen]], and [[chakhchoukha]].

These traditional Algerian soups are served at the beginning of the meal as an entree and are mainly prepared from lamb, mutton or chicken, chickpeas, tomatoes, vermicelli, wheat, spices and different vegetables and legumes. These varied soups are the most popular during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThere are many different types of Algerian salads, including both raw and cooked vegetables, served either hot or cold. Hot salads include zaalouka, an aubergine and tomato mixture, and chakchouka, a mixture of tomatoes, smoked green peppers, garlic , eggs and spices. Influenced by both the Algerian and Mediterranean cuisines, chakchouka may include beetroot or anchovies. There are also dishes of Spanish origin in Algeria, like the [[Gaspacho Oranais]], an Algerian version of a [[Manchego cuisine|Manchego]] dish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coundris.chez-alice.fr/f_recettes_gp.htm|title=Gaspacho oranais ou manchego|date=|publisher=Coundris.chez-alice.fr|accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref>\n[[File:Traditional Algerian food.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | center | Rogag]]\nAlgerians commonly use tajines, a earthenware pot, to cook.

Griwech is a deep-fried pretzel-shaped dough, soaked in honey and sprinkled with sesame seeds; it is commonly eaten during the month of Ramadan.

Algerians are heavy coffee consumers; thick espresso and black coffee are very popular. Fruit juice and soft drinks, called ''gazouz'', are very common and are often drunk daily.\n\nAlgeria previously produced a large quantity of [[Algerian wine|wine]] during the [[French Algeria|French colonization]] but production has decreased since its independence; however, there are some secular activists that want to produce wine.\n\n==Bread==\nBetween 1976 and 1984, the average Algerian family spent around 56% of their income on food and drink, and more than 10% of that number was spent on [[bread]] and other cereal products. Bread is thought to contain God\u2019s blessing, baraka. It is traditionally seen as a symbol of life and functions in rituals symbolic of life, fertility and abundance.<ref name=Jansen>Jansen, Willy. \u201cFrench Bread and Algerian Wine: Conflicting Identities in French Algeria.\u201d In Food, Drink and Identity: Cooking, Eating and Drinking in Europe Since the Middle Ages, edited by Peter Scholliers, 195-218.

Traditionally flat and round, a few centimeters thick, made at home and commonly baked in a gas oven or communal oven.\n\n''Khubz at-taj\u00een or matl\u00fb'': wheat semolina, yeast, water and salt. Flattened pan-bread (French: [[galette]]), baked in a previously heated earthenware or cast-iron plate on a fire. Variations are made by the quality of the leavening agent, by adding barley or sorghum, bran, or by making it corn-based.\n\n''Khubz-ftir, raq\u00e2q, rf\u00ees\" or \"tar\u00eed'': well-kneaded, unleavened dough, baked for half a minute on a convex sheet of brass or iron, balanced on stones over a fire. This is a preferred method for those living nomadic lives due to easy transportation of pan and little amount of fuel necessary.\n\nFrench ''[[baguettes]]'': white, leavened wheat flour. Bought at bakery or street vendor, but never made at home due to access to mills powered by electricity. Power shortages prevent consumption of this bread, and often Algerians turn to home-made breads that are milled by women\u2019s hands.<ref name=Jansen />\n[[File:Baguette-246424.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | Baguette]]\n=== Algerian Bread ===\nFrench bread tends to be given more value in terms of taste and quality in that it was commonly associated to being more suitable to higher standards. However, the white inner parts of a baguette are thought to be unhealthy and will regularly be thrown away, and the bread is frequently associated with constipation. Algerian breads, on the other hand, are considered more nutritive, rich and tasteful and seldom go to waste. Because French breads harden over night or become chewy when put away in plastic bags, it is hard to find usage for them, so they are thrown away with more frequency than Algerian breads that can be reheated or reutilized as edible food utensils or even bird feed. In the context of rituals, only Algerian bread is thought suitable. Breads offered to guests should be homemade, as it signifies the essence, intimacy, and qualities of the family. In daily practices, it is also a sign of wealth and affluence if one has extra bread at the table, and making bread at home can be considered a sign of familial economic independence.<ref name=Jansen />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arab cuisine]]\n* [[Berber cuisine]]\n* [[Mediterranean cuisine]]\n* [[North African cuisine]]\n* [[List of African cuisines]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Cuisine of Algeria}}\n* [http://globaltableadventure.com/category/countries/algeria/ Algerian Recipes and Culture on Global Table Adventure]\n\n{{Cuisine of Algeria}}\n{{Cuisine of Africa}}\n{{Cuisine of the Mediterranean}}\n{{cuisines}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Arab cuisine]]\n[[Category:Algerian culture]]\n[[Category:Algerian cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:African cuisine]]\n", "name_user": "Acalamari", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBread:Not proper nouns", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_cuisine"}

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> had first been discovered at Merck earlier that year. It had a structure at the time that was almost completely unknown, and when Hodgkin discovered it contained cobalt, she realized the structure actualization could be determined by x-ray crystallography analysis.

It began in 1934 when she was offered a small sample of crystalline insulin by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]]. The [[hormone]] captured her imagination because of the intricate and wide-ranging effect it has in the body. However, at this stage X-ray crystallography had not been developed far enough to cope with the complexity of the insulin molecule. She and others spent many years improving the technique.\n\nLarger and more complex molecules were tackled until in 1969\u201335 years later\u2014the structure of insulin was finally resolved.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/224491a0| title = Structure of Rhombohedral 2 Zinc Insulin Crystals| journal = Nature| volume = 224| issue = 5218| pages = 491| year = 1969| last1 = Adams | first1 = M. \"J.| last2 = Blundell | first2 = T.

Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> had first been discovered at Merck earlier that year. It had a structure at the time that was almost completely unknown, and when Hodgkin discovered it contained cobalt, she realized the structure actualization could be determined by x-ray crystallography analysis.

It began in 1934 when she was offered a small sample of crystalline insulin by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]]. The [[hormone]] captured her imagination because of the intricate and wide-ranging effect it has in the body. However, at this stage X-ray crystallography had not been developed far enough to cope with the complexity of the insulin molecule. She and others spent many years improving the technique.\n\nLarger and more complex molecules were tackled until in 1969\u201335 years later\u2014the structure of insulin was finally resolved.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/224491a0| title = Structure of Rhombohedral 2 Zinc Insulin Crystals| journal = Nature| volume = 224| issue = 5218| pages = 491| year = 1969| last1 = Adams | first1 = M. \"J.| last2 = Blundell | first2 = T.

During the subsequent three years, 1972\u20131975, when she was President of the [[International Union of Crystallography]] she was unable to persuade the Chinese authorities, however, to permit the country's scientists to become members of the Union and attend its meetings.\n\nHer relations with a supposed scientist in another \"People's Democracy\" had less happy results.

In 2011 the selection process was replaced by an internal BBC decision, but this process ended after 2015 with a revival of a national final for 2016 under a new name. The ''You Decide'' format was axed in September 2019 and an internal selection is to be used for the UK's 2020 participation.\n\nThis page lists the contestants for each year of the show; the winners of the contest are in '''''bold-italics'''''.\n\n==Competition==\nIn 1957, 1959 and 1960, there were a series of televised heats prior to the final.\n\nPostcard voting was used to choose the winner from 1965\u20131975. This had to be abandoned in 1971 due to a postal strike, with regional juries, made up of ordinary members of the public selecting the winner. Juries did the job from 1957\u20131964 and from 1976\u20131987. From 1988 onwards, with the exception of the internally selected entries (2011-2015 & 2020), televoting has been organized ostensibly to choose the winner, although this result wasn't always followed. Panels of judges have also played a part in selecting finalists and the winners in various years since 2008.\n\n===''Festival Of British Popular Songs'' (1957)===\n'''[[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957]]'''<br>\n'''Tuesday, 12 February.

Carlton Books 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref>\n* [[Lita Roza]], [[Anne Shelton (singer)|Anne Shelton]], [[Ronnie Hilton]], [[Craig Douglas]], [[Ricky Valance]], [[Sandie Shaw]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Mary Hopkin]], [[The New Seekers]]/[[Lyn Paul]], [[The Shadows]], [[Frank Ifield]], [[The Foundations]], [[Sweet Sensation (band)|Sweet Sensation]], [[Carl Wayne]] (of [[The Move]]), [[Alvin Stardust]], [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]], [[Anthony Costa]] (of [[Blue (English band)|Blue]]), [[Brian Harvey]] (of [[East 17]]), [[Liz McClarnon]] (of [[Atomic Kitten]]), [[Blue (English band)|Blue]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] and [[Bonnie Tyler]] had all enjoyed a number one UK single prior to putting themselves forward for Eurovision.\n* [[Sandie Shaw]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Brotherhood Of Man]], [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] and [[Gina G]] are the only acts to take their song from the UK final to number one in the UK singles chart. \n* Only [[Frank Ifield]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[The New Seekers]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Brotherhood Of Man]], [[Tony Christie]] and [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] have been able to reach the pinnacle of the top of the UK singles chart after appearing in the contest. \n* [[Polly Brown]] is the only artist in a multi-artist final to perform two songs. She appeared as a soloist and as one half of [[Sweet Dreams (1970s band)|Sweet Dreams]] in the 1976 competition, finishing 10th and 4th respectively. [[Catherine Porter]] had two songs in the 2000 competition, but only one reached the televised final. \n* The [[Sweet Dreams (1970s band)|Sweet Dreams]] who placed 4th in 1976 are no relation to the [[Sweet Dreams (band)|Sweet Dreams]] that won the contest in 1983. The first is a male/female duo, the second is a trio of two girls and one boy. [[Carrie Grant]] who works extensively on British TV as a voice coach was a member of the [[Sweet Dreams (band)|Sweet Dreams]] trio. \n* The Pearls, a female quartet formed specifically for the 1989 contest are no relation to [[The Pearls]], a female duo who had some minor chart hits in the early 1970s. Similarly, Joanne Castle, a female soloist who performed under the name 'Christie' in the 1991 contest, is no relation to the male group [[Christie (band)|Christie]] that topped the UK charts with the song '''''[[Yellow River (song)|Yellow River]]'''''. \n* [[Ronnie Carroll]], [[Cheryl Baker]] and [[Sally-Ann Triplett]] are the only singers to win the ''[[A Song For Europe]]'' contest twice. [[Cliff Richard]] represented the UK twice but was only subjected to a song selection process and was already assured of the place in Eurovision. Baker was a member of [[Co-Co (band)|Co-Co]] in 1978 and [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] in 1981. In addition, Baker was part of '''Co-Co''' in 1976 and '''The Main Event''' in 1980. Triplett was part of [[Prima Donna (band)|Prima Donna]] in 1980 and [[Bardo (group)|Bardo]] in 1982. \n* [[Sally-Ann Triplett]] is the only multiple contender to win the contest at all attempts. \n* Other singers who have won the ''[[A Song For Europe]]'' contest and yet came back another time were [[Pearl Carr & Teddy Johnson]], [[Bryan Johnson (singer)|Bryan Johnson]], [[Lyn Paul]] of [[The New Seekers]] and [[Gina G]]. [[Bobby McVay]], the lead singer of 1983 winning group [[Sweet Dreams (band)|Sweet Dreams]] had entered the contest in 1982 as the lead singer of '''Lovin' Feeling'''. \n* [[Terry Wogan]] has hosted the contest more times than any other presenter. Together with [[Katie Boyle]] and [[Ulrika Jonsson]], he also hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] itself. \n* [[Cilla Black]] hosted both the 1968 and 1973 contests when the show was a segment of her [[BBC1]] variety series. Black was the original choice to sing the UK entry in 1968, but turned it down as she felt it unlikely the UK could score back-to-back wins. She also turned down the chance in 1970 as she was expecting her first child. Other singers who were reported to have turned down the invitation include [[Slade]] and [[Peters and Lee]] in the 1970s, [[Bucks Fizz]] in 1986 and [[Bonnie Tyler]] and [[Elaine Paige]] in the 1990s. Tyler finally represented the UK in 2013.\n* When [[Belle & The Devotions]] were booed from the stage at Eurovision 1984, the [[BBC]] wanted to revert to inviting one singer to perform all the songs in the ''[[A Song For Europe]]'' contest for 1985. After [[Bonnie Tyler]] was unavailable, [[Lena Zavaroni]] was approached by the [[BBC]]. This move was blocked by the Music Publishers Association, who preferred to let the writers choose their own performers. In the end, for 1985, only soloists or duets were permitted to take part - no \"made for Eurovision\" acts - with songwriters limited to two entries each. This rule was only in place for one year. \n* [[Malcolm Roberts (singer)|Malcolm Roberts]] tried to represent the UK in 1991, having previously represented [[Luxembourg]] at Eurovision in 1985. [[Katrina Leskanich]] won Eurovision in 1997 for the UK and later attempted to represent Sweden. [[Nanne Gr\u00f6nvall]] represented Sweden in 1996 with the group [[One More Time (band)|One More Time]] before attempting to represent the UK in 2001. Simon Foster (aka '''Dan Duskey''') represented Ireland in the 1982 Eurovision final as part of [[Here Today Gone Tomorrow|The Duskeys]], before leading the group '''Palace''' (as Michael Palace) in the 1986 ''[[A Song For Europe]]'' contest. Ray Caruana, the lead singer of Live Report who represented the UK at Eurovision in 1989, later tried to represent Malta in the 1994 contest, but failed to win the Maltese heat. \n* Songs that failed to make the UK final but still went on to be hits include \"Even The Bad Times Are Good\". This was entered for [[Sandie Shaw]] in 1967 but went on to reach #4 for [[The Tremeloes]], as did 1968 reject \"Hello World\", which reached #14. \"Turn On The Sun\" was turned down for [[Mary Hopkin]] in 1970 but later became identified with [[Nana Mouskouri]]. Likewise in 1971, \"Something Old, Something New\" failed to make [[Clodagh Rodgers]]' final six but was released by The Fantastics, reaching #9. Jonathan King is reported by Eurovision fans to have claimed that 1984 chart-topper \"[[I Should Have Known Better]]\" by [[Jim Diamond (Scottish musician)|Jim Diamond]] had failed to be short-listed for ''[[A Song for Europe]]'', as had 1986 hit \"[[Touch Me (I Want Your Body)]]\" by [[Samantha Fox]] but no confirmation has ever been produced. Lord [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and Sir [[Tim Rice]] submitted a song for the 1969 contest, \"Try It And See\", which was rejected. It was later re-written and became \"King Herod's Song\" in the musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. Lloyd Webber returned to compose the 2009 UK entry in collaboration with [[Diane Warren]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[UK national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest]]\n*[[UK Eurovision Song Contest entries discography]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n===Notes===\n{{Notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{UK in Eurovision}}\n{{Eurovision Song Contest}}\n\n[[Category:United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest]]\n\n[[he:Making Your Mind Up]]\n[[nl:Making your Mind up]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2012}}\n'''''[[Eurovision: You Decide]]''''' was the most recent name of the [[BBC]] TV show broadcast to select the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom's entry]] into the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].\n\nShows of similar formats have previously gone under several other names, including ''Festival Of British Popular Songs'', ''Eurovision Song Contest British Final'', ''A Song For Europe'', ''The Great British Song Contest'', ''Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up'' and ''Eurovision: Your Decision''. In 2011 the selection process was replaced by an internal BBC decision, but this process ended after 2015 with a revival of a national final for 2016 under a new name. The ''You Decide'' format was axed in September 2019 and an internal selection is to be used for the UK's 2020 participation.\n\nThis page lists the contestants for each year of the show; the winners of the contest are in '''''bold-italics'''''.\n\n==Competition==\nIn 1957, 1959 and 1960, there were a series of televised heats prior to the final.\n\nPostcard voting was used to choose the winner from 1965\u20131975. This had to be abandoned in 1971 due to a postal strike, with regional juries, made up of ordinary members of the public selecting the winner. Juries did the job from 1957\u20131964 and from 1976\u20131987. From 1988 onwards, with the exception of the the internally selected entries (2011-2015 & 2020), televoting has been organized ostensibly to choose the winner, although this result wasn't always followed. Panels of judges have also played a part in selecting finalists and the winners in various years since 2008.\n\n===''Festival Of British Popular Songs'' (1957)===\n'''[[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1957|1957]]'''<br>\n'''Tuesday, 12 February.

O'Connor, John Kennedy. Carlton Books 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref>\n* [[Lita Roza]], [[Anne Shelton (singer)|Anne Shelton]], [[Ronnie Hilton]], [[Craig Douglas]], [[Ricky Valance]], [[Sandie Shaw]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Mary Hopkin]], [[The New Seekers]]/[[Lyn Paul]], [[The Shadows]], [[Frank Ifield]], [[The Foundations]], [[Sweet Sensation (band)|Sweet Sensation]], [[Carl Wayne]] (of [[The Move]]), [[Alvin Stardust]], [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]], [[Anthony Costa]] (of [[Blue (English band)|Blue]]), [[Brian Harvey]] (of [[East 17]]), [[Liz McClarnon]] (of [[Atomic Kitten]]), [[Blue (English band)|Blue]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]] and [[Bonnie Tyler]] had all enjoyed a number one UK single prior to putting themselves forward for Eurovision.\n* [[Sandie Shaw]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Brotherhood Of Man]], [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] and [[Gina G]] are the only acts to take their song from the UK final to number one in the UK singles chart. \n* Only [[Frank Ifield]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[The New Seekers]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Brotherhood Of Man]], [[Tony Christie]] and [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] have been able to reach the pinnacle of the top of the UK singles chart after appearing in the contest. \n* [[Polly Brown]] is the only artist in a multi-artist final to perform two songs. She appeared as a soloist and as one half of [[Sweet Dreams (1970s band)|Sweet Dreams]] in the 1976 competition, finishing 10th and 4th respectively. [[Catherine Porter]] had two songs in the 2000 competition, but only one reached the televised final. \n* The [[Sweet Dreams (1970s band)|Sweet Dreams]] who placed 4th in 1976 are no relation to the [[Sweet Dreams (band)|Sweet Dreams]] that won the contest in 1983. The first is a male/female duo, the second is a trio of two girls and one boy. [[Carrie Grant]] who works extensively on British TV as a voice coach was a member of the [[Sweet Dreams (band)|Sweet Dreams]] trio. \n* The Pearls, a female quartet formed specifically for the 1989 contest are no relation to [[The Pearls]], a female duo who had some minor chart hits in the early 1970s. Similarly, Joanne Castle, a female soloist who performed under the name 'Christie' in the 1991 contest, is no relation to the male group [[Christie (band)|Christie]] that topped the UK charts with the song '''''[[Yellow River (song)|Yellow River]]'''''. \n* [[Ronnie Carroll]], [[Cheryl Baker]] and [[Sally-Ann Triplett]] are the only singers to win the ''[[A Song For Europe]]'' contest twice. [[Cliff Richard]] represented the UK twice but was only subjected to a song selection process and was already assured of the place in Eurovision. Baker was a member of [[Co-Co (band)|Co-Co]] in 1978 and [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] in 1981. In addition, Baker was part of '''Co-Co''' in 1976 and '''The Main Event''' in 1980. Triplett was part of [[Prima Donna (band)|Prima Donna]] in 1980 and [[Bardo (group)|Bardo]] in 1982. \n* [[Sally-Ann Triplett]] is the only multiple contender to win the contest at all attempts. \n* Other singers who have won the ''[[A Song For Europe]]'' contest and yet came back another time were [[Pearl Carr & Teddy Johnson]], [[Bryan Johnson (singer)|Bryan Johnson]], [[Lyn Paul]] of [[The New Seekers]] and [[Gina G]]. [[Bobby McVay]], the lead singer of 1983 winning group [[Sweet Dreams (band)|Sweet Dreams]] had entered the contest in 1982 as the lead singer of '''Lovin' Feeling'''. \n* [[Terry Wogan]] has hosted the contest more times than any other presenter. Together with [[Katie Boyle]] and [[Ulrika Jonsson]], he also hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] itself. \n* [[Cilla Black]] hosted both the 1968 and 1973 contests when the show was a segment of her [[BBC1]] variety series. Black was the original choice to sing the UK entry in 1968, but turned it down as she felt it unlikely the UK could score back-to-back wins. She also turned down the chance in 1970 as she was expecting her first child. Other singers who were reported to have turned down the invitation include [[Slade]] and [[Peters and Lee]] in the 1970s, [[Bucks Fizz]] in 1986 and [[Bonnie Tyler]] and [[Elaine Paige]] in the 1990s. Tyler finally represented the UK in 2013.\n* When [[Belle & The Devotions]] were booed from the stage at Eurovision 1984, the [[BBC]] wanted to revert to inviting one singer to perform all the songs in the ''[[A Song For Europe]]'' contest for 1985. After [[Bonnie Tyler]] was unavailable, [[Lena Zavaroni]] was approached by the [[BBC]]. This move was blocked by the Music Publishers Association, who preferred to let the writers choose their own performers. In the end, for 1985, only soloists or duets were permitted to take part - no \"made for Eurovision\" acts - with songwriters limited to two entries each. This rule was only in place for one year. \n* [[Malcolm Roberts (singer)|Malcolm Roberts]] tried to represent the UK in 1991, having previously represented [[Luxembourg]] at Eurovision in 1985. [[Katrina Leskanich]] won Eurovision in 1997 for the UK and later attempted to represent Sweden. [[Nanne Gr\u00f6nvall]] represented Sweden in 1996 with the group [[One More Time (band)|One More Time]] before attempting to represent the UK in 2001. Simon Foster (aka '''Dan Duskey''') represented Ireland in the 1982 Eurovision final as part of [[Here Today Gone Tomorrow|The Duskeys]], before leading the group '''Palace''' (as Michael Palace) in the 1986 ''[[A Song For Europe]]'' contest. Ray Caruana, the lead singer of Live Report who represented the UK at Eurovision in 1989, later tried to represent Malta in the 1994 contest, but failed to win the Maltese heat. \n* Songs that failed to make the UK final but still went on to be hits include \"Even The Bad Times Are Good\". This was entered for [[Sandie Shaw]] in 1967 but went on to reach #4 for [[The Tremeloes]], as did 1968 reject \"Hello World\", which reached #14. \"Turn On The Sun\" was turned down for [[Mary Hopkin]] in 1970 but later became identified with [[Nana Mouskouri]]. Likewise in 1971, \"Something Old, Something New\" failed to make [[Clodagh Rodgers]]' final six but was released by The Fantastics, reaching #9. Jonathan King is reported by Eurovision fans to have claimed that 1984 chart-topper \"[[I Should Have Known Better]]\" by [[Jim Diamond (Scottish musician)|Jim Diamond]] had failed to be short-listed for ''[[A Song for Europe]]'', as had 1986 hit \"[[Touch Me (I Want Your Body)]]\" by [[Samantha Fox]] but no confirmation has ever been produced. Lord [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and Sir [[Tim Rice]] submitted a song for the 1969 contest, \"Try It And See\", which was rejected. It was later re-written and became \"King Herod's Song\" in the musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.

Kemp and Oscar P. Kemp, two of the city's founders. The town's name was originally planned to be named Kampeska.<ref name=Hasselstrom29/>\n\nDuring the 1880s, Watertown prospered as a transportation hub after the railroads had been extended farther west. Along with several other cities, Watertown had been a candidate as capital of the new state of South Dakota,<ref name=Hasselstrom29/> although it lost out to the more centrally located [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]]. The city's current newspaper, the ''[[Watertown Public Opinion]]'', began publishing in 1887.<ref name=Hasselstrom29/>\n\nIn the mid-20th century, [[Interstate 29]] was constructed through eastern South Dakota.<ref name=Schell333>Schell, p. 333.</ref> The route included a slight bend to bring the interstate closer to Watertown.<ref name=Schell333/> The interstate's construction has been a major economic benefit to the larger communities along its route, including Watertown.<ref name=Schell333/>\n\n==Climate==\nIn the last decades the climate is configured as hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Dfa''), although it had a warm-summer previously (''Dfb''). Although it is a humid city it is relatively dry for its climatic category, due to its position in the [[Great Plains]], which still provides an even greater thermal amplitude, especially in the higher values.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=21637&cityname=Watertown,+South+Dakota,+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Watertown, South Dakota K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>{{Weather box |width = 77%|Jan high F=21.0|Jan record high F=65|Jan low F=0.6|Jan record low F=-40|Jan precipitation inch=0.55|Feb record high F=66|Feb high F=25.5|Feb low F=4.8|Feb record low F=-38|Feb precipitation inch=0.59|Mar record high F=82|Mar high F=38.3|Mar low F=18.2|Mar record low F=-27|Mar precipitation inch=1.05|Apr record high F=95|Apr high F=55.3|Apr low F=31.8|Apr record low F=-10|Apr precipitation inch=2.09|May record high F=106|May high F=67.8|May low F=43.4|May record low F=16|May precipitation inch=2.86|Jun record high F=107|Jun high F=77.1|Jun low F=53.7|Jun record low F=25|Jun precipitation inch=3.69|Jul record high F=110|Jul high F=83.4|Jul low F=58.6|Jul record low F=35|Jul precipitation inch=2.88|Aug record high F=105|Aug high F=81.6|Aug low F=56.3|Aug record low F=32|Aug precipitation inch=2.28|Sep record high F=104|Sep high F=71.7|Sep low F=46.6|Sep record low F=9|Sep precipitation inch=2.05|Oct record low F=-2|Oct record high F=91|Oct high F=58.6|Oct low F=34.8|Oct precipitation inch=1.54|Nov high F=40.2|Nov record high F=77|Nov low F=20.4|Nov record low F=-20|Nov precipitation inch=0.78|Dec record high F=69|Dec high F=26.1|Dec low F=7.3|Dec record low F=-37|Dec precipitation inch=0.51|single line=Y|precipitation colour=green|source 1=[[Western Regional Climate Center|WRCC]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?sd8932|title=WATERTOWN RGNL AP, SOUTH DAKOTA -

Kemp and Oscar P. Kemp, two of the city's founders. The town's name was originally planned to be named Kampeska.<ref name=Hasselstrom29/>\n\nDuring the 1880s, Watertown prospered as a transportation hub after the railroads had been extended farther west. Along with several other cities, Watertown had been a candidate as capital of the new state of South Dakota,<ref name=Hasselstrom29/> although it lost out to the more centrally located [[Pierre, South Dakota|Pierre]]. The city's current newspaper, the ''[[Watertown Public Opinion]]'', began publishing in 1887.<ref name=Hasselstrom29/>\n\nIn the mid-20th century, [[Interstate 29]] was constructed through eastern South Dakota.<ref name=Schell333>Schell, p. 333.</ref> The route included a slight bend to bring the interstate closer to Watertown.<ref name=Schell333/> The interstate's construction has been a major economic benefit to the larger communities along its route, including Watertown.<ref name=Schell333/>\n\n==Climate==\nIn the last decades the climate is configured as hot-summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Dfa''), although it had a warm-summer previously (''Dfb''). Although it is a humid city it is relatively dry for its climatic category, due to its position in the [[Great Plains]], which still provides an even greater thermal amplitude, especially in the higher values.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=21637&cityname=Watertown,+South+Dakota,+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Watertown, South Dakota K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>{{Weather box |width = 77%|Jan high F=21.0|Jan record high F=65|Jan low F=0.6|Jan record low F=-40|Jan precipitation inch=0.55|Feb record high F=66|Feb high F=25.5|Feb low F=4.8|Feb record low F=-38|Feb precipitation inch=0.59|Mar record high F=82|Mar high F=38.3|Mar low F=18.2|Mar record low F=-27|Mar precipitation inch=1.05|Apr record high F=95|Apr high F=55.3|Apr low F=31.8|Apr record low F=-10|Apr precipitation inch=2.09|May record high F=106|May high F=67.8|May low F=43.4|May record low F=16|May precipitation inch=2.86|Jun record high F=107|Jun high F=77.1|Jun low F=53.7|Jun record low F=25|Jun precipitation inch=3.69|Jul record high F=110|Jul high F=83.4|Jul low F=58.6|Jul record low F=35|Jul precipitation inch=2.88|Aug record high F=105|Aug high F=81.6|Aug low F=56.3|Aug record low F=32|Aug precipitation inch=2.28|Sep record high F=104|Sep high F=71.7|Sep low F=46.6|Sep record low F=9|Sep precipitation inch=2.05|Oct record low F=-2|Oct record high F=91|Oct high F=58.6|Oct low F=34.8|Oct precipitation inch=1.54|Nov high F=40.2|Nov record high F=77|Nov low F=20.4|Nov record low F=-20|Nov precipitation inch=0.78|Dec record high F=69|Dec high F=26.1|Dec low F=7.3|Dec record low F=-37|Dec precipitation inch=0.51|single line=Y|precipitation colour=green|source 1=[[Western Regional Climate Center|WRCC]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?sd8932|title=WATERTOWN RGNL AP, SOUTH DAKOTA -

To this end, Smith and his fellow Agents possess a number of superhuman attributes from their ability to bend the rules of the Matrix. Smith manifests his physical form by [[spirit possession|inhabiting and overwriting]] the simulated [[Human body|body]] of a human wired into the Matrix; by moving from body to body, he can reform himself if he is \"killed\" (which only kills the host body) and appear virtually anywhere. He can overcome the limitations of gravity and the human body, giving him speed and strength sufficient to [[bullet time|dodge bullets flawlessly]], [[Punch (combat)|punch]] through concrete with his bare hands, and jump impossible distances. He and other Agents wear dark green business suits with matching neckties, white dress shirts, and sunglasses with rectangular lenses. They use earpiece radios that allow them to communicate with each other instantaneously and perceive the actions of other humans wired into the Matrix via a type of shared consciousness. When Smith removes his earpiece during the first film, he is left unaware of the attack on the building in which he is holding Morpheus. Smith is armed in the first film with the [[Desert Eagle]], chambered for high-caliber [[.50 Action Express|.50 AE]] ammunition, as is standard with all Agents within the Matrix.\n\nAt the end of the first film, Smith appears to have been deleted by Neo. However, in the sequels, Smith is revealed to have been linked to Neo, which enabled him to resist being sent to the Source - the Machines' mainframe, where obsolete or malfunctioning programs are deleted. No longer an Agent, Smith is liberated from the Machines' control and exists as a renegade program that manifests himself akin to a self-replicating [[computer virus]] compared to his original Agent-based ability to inhabit a single body wired into the Matrix. Smith gains the power to copy his physical form onto any entity in the Matrix by phasing his hand into their body and spreading a black liquid that transforms them into a copy of himself, resulting in an ever-growing army of Smiths [[group mind (science fiction)|connected by a single consciousness]]. By copying himself onto a human [[redpill]] in the process of disconnecting from the Matrix, Smith overwrites their consciousness and takes control of their body in the real world. This is seen when Smith takes over [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]]'s body in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''; however, he is repelled when he attempts to do the same to [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. Smith's real power comes from his ability to absorb memories and powers from his victims, human and program alike, culminating in him taking over the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] and fighting Neo in the final battle of the Matrix series. Neo allows himself to be overwritten during the battle, thus giving the Machines an opportunity to delete Smith and return the Matrix and its inhabitants to normal.\n\n==Character history==\n===''The Matrix''===\nIn the first film, Smith is one of the three Agents sent to deal with Morpheus. After Neo is successfully removed from the Matrix, Smith arranges Morpheus' capture by bribing [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disillusioned member of Morpheus' crew, with reintegration into The Matrix. When Neo manages to free Morpheus, Smith and his fellow Agents engage in a lengthy cross-town chase. He and Neo fight, with Smith dominating most of the fight. Shortly after Neo escapes the fight, Smith guns him down. Neo revives, realizes his power as the One, and enters Smith, to destroy him from within.\n\n===''The Matrix Reloaded''===\nAs a result of his contact with Neo from the first film, Smith is \"unplugged\" in the second film, no longer an Agent of the system but a \"free man\". This is signified by the lack of an earpiece, which he sends to Neo in an envelope as a message early in the film. His appearance has changed in the second film as well; his sunglasses now have an angular shape different from the Agents' oblong lenses, approximating the shape of the ones Neo wears. His suit and tie re now jet black, as opposed to the dark green tint from the first film. He still possesses the abilities of an Agent, but instead of being able to jump from one human to another, he is able to copy himself over any human or program in the Matrix through direct contact; this includes humans wired into the Matrix, non-Agent programs with human forms, [[redpill]]s, and other Agents. Smith retains the memories and abilities, if any, of the one over which he copies himself. This ability is much like how a virus replicates, creating an ironic contrast with the first film, where Smith likens humanity to a virus.\n\nHe makes the claim that Neo has set him free. However, he believes there is an unseen purpose that still binds him to Neo. He tries to copy his programming onto Neo, but when this fails, he and dozens of his clones attack him, forcing Neo to flee. Later, he and his clones try to stop Neo from reaching the machine mainframe, without success.\n\nSmith copies himself onto Bane ([[Ian Bliss]]), a crew member of the [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] hovercraft ''Caduceus''. While waiting to leave the Matrix with a message from [[Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]], Bane is attacked and overwritten by Smith, who then takes control of his body in the real world. Smith tests his control over the body by making Bane cut his own arm, in preparation for an assassination attempt on Neo that he quickly abandons. He later sabotages the Zion fleet's defense of the city by triggering one ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapon too early, knocking out the other ships and allowing the Sentinels to overrun them.\n\n===''The Matrix Revolutions''===\n[[File:Smithposter.jpg|thumb|upright|Movie poster for ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', featuring some of the numerous copies of Smith]]\n\nBy the start of the third film, Smith has managed to copy himself over nearly every humanoid in the Matrix, giving him complete control over the \"Core Network\" (the underlying foundation of the inner workings of the Matrix), thus rendering him immutable by even the Machines themselves. The Oracle explains to Neo that he and Smith have become equal in power and that Smith is Neo's negative, a result of the Matrix's equation trying to balance itself. She tells Neo that Smith will destroy both the Matrix and the real world unless he is stopped. Smith soon assimilates the Oracle, gaining her power of [[foresight (psychology)|foresight]], or [[omniscience]], and later manifests reality-bending powers equivalent to Neo's, such as the ability to fly. Meanwhile, in the real world, Bane (now under Smith's control) stows away on a ship being used by Neo and Trinity and tries to kill them both. Neo is blinded in the fight, but discovers that he can now sense Smith's essence acutely enough to land a blow that kills Bane.\n\nNear the climax of the film, Neo offers a deal with the Machines to get rid of Smith in exchange for Zion's safety, warning them that Smith is beyond their control and will eventually spread to the machine city, which will result in destruction of both mankind and machines. Knowing that Neo is right, the Machines agree to his terms and command all Sentinels attacking Zion to stand down and wait for orders. They later give Neo a connection to enter the Matrix to stop Smith on their behalf. Although the Matrix is now populated exclusively by Smith and his clones, the Smith that has obtained the Oracle's powers battles Neo alone; as he explains, he has foreseen his victory, and has no need for the help of his copies. The two are almost evenly matched as the fight begins, though Neo's combat abilities seem arguably superior to that of Smith, the latter attacking more out of brute force, rather than the technical skill he displayed in the first film. This lasts, until Neo is able to punch Smith strongly enough to slam him into the street at least 20&nbsp;ft away. As the fight continues, however, it becomes clear that Neo cannot win with his finite stamina against the tireless Smith, who begins to dominate Neo in the fight; by the end of the fight, he is able to brutally beat Neo into near defeat. In the midst of this battle, Smith explains to Neo his final [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] revelation: \"It was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end.\"\n\nWhen Neo is near defeat, Smith demands to know why he continues to fight despite knowing he cannot win. Neo calmly responds, \"Because I choose to\" and is savagely pummeled by the enraged Smith as a result. Suddenly recognizing the scene from his [[prophecy]], Smith is compelled to deliver the line he said in it: \"I say.... Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.\" His own words confuse and frighten him. Neo realizes that he cannot overpower Smith and allows himself to be assimilated. Because Agent Smith has deleted the anomaly (Neo), he no longer has a purpose and he must also be deleted. Smith is now directly connected to the Source, the machines are able to destroy all copies of his programming and reboot the Matrix without errors. The process does kill Neo, but does also destroy Smith. Neo's body is carried away by the machines, and an uncertain peace is established between Zion and the machine world.\n\n===''The Matrix Online''===\nDespite his destruction at the end of the film series, Agent Smith (or at least the remnants of his programming) managed to return and made several appearances inside the movie's official continuation, the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[The Matrix Online]]''.\n\nThe first infection was noted in Machine mission controller Agent Gray, whose background information confirms that he was overwritten by Smith at some point during the timeline of the second and third films. This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Morpheus. The Agent, in both a storyline related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Zionist redpills declaring 'their stench unbearable any longer'. As a result of his actions the agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a 'thorough code cleansing'. He has shown no signs of direct infection since.   \n    \nMachine liaison officer DifferenceEngine, following a similar scenario to that of the previous Agent Gray infection, also took on the dialect and emotional characteristics of the famous exile agent. Instead of attacking redpills, this instance insisted on finding 'Mr. Anderson'. In the end, the human/machine head relations liaison, Agent Pace, was made aware of the program's infection and subsequent crusade; she proceeded to lock down his RSI and return his program to the Source for analysis. His subsequent fate is unknown.\n\nThe third victim of infection was the notorious bluepill Shane Black. This man was an unfortunate victim of the Smith Virus who, once infected, gained the ability to spread the code to others. This quickly led to a small scale outbreak, with several more bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their bluepill lives. Shane Black's troubles continued, as he was one of the bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited redpills practising their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Smith infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterwards.\n\nThe most recent appearance of the Smith virus was during the third anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Smith). As redpills began to fight back using specialist code from the Oracle, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The nature of this form was never revealed. <!--The Matrix Online has closed, so all open storylines will indefinitely remain unresolved.-->\n\n===''The Matrix: Path of Neo''===\n''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'', a video game covering the events of the entire film trilogy, features a different ending than that shown in ''The Matrix Revolutions'', with a new final boss: the ''MegaSmith''. The MegaSmith was used for gameplay reasons, because though the Wachowskis thought the [[martyr]] approach suitable for film, they also believed that in an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals), this would not work. So, this character was created to be the more appropriate \"final boss\" of ''Path of Neo'', with the final battle described by the siblings as \"A little [[Hulk]] versus [[Galactus]] action\". The MegaSmith is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the \"spectator Smiths\" standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaSmith's muscles, resulting in Smith not only becoming the city's people, but the city itself.\n\nAfter Neo knocks Smith into the crater in the level \"Aerial Battle\", Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the surrounding Smiths walk away from the crater. Neo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car which flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Neo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile. A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Smiths can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Neo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Smith then pulls a pair of giant Smith Shades from a billboard and puts them on. As an interesting aside, the glasses on the billboard are the same ones Agent Smith wore in the first Matrix film, with the curved nose bar, but when the MegaSmith actually puts them on, they become the ones Agent Smith wears in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and in ''Revolutions''.\n\nAfter the fight\u2014consisting of Neo dodging blows and building up power to launch more powerful assaults at MegaSmith, damaging one arm and creating a large hole in his chest\u2014Neo flies straight into MegaSmith's mouth, causing the Smiths throughout the Matrix to overload and explode. The player is then shown a short scene from ''The Matrix: Revolutions'' of the streets shining with light emanating from the destroyed Smiths.\n\n===''The Lego Batman Movie''===\nAgent Smith briefly appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' as one of the captives of the [[Phantom Zone]]. He and his clones appear surveilling [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s vandalized Wayne Island, and later appear as one of the multiple enemies attacking the heroes. Smith's clones also appear as enemies in the ''Lego Batman Movie'' story pack for ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', adapting their role in the film.\n\nHis voice actor was uncredited.\n\n===''Space Jam 2''===\nAgent Smith will reportedly appear in the upcoming film ''[[Space Jam 2]]'', it is unknown if Hugo Weaving will reprise his role.<ref>https://cosmicbook.news/space-jam-2-leaks-joker-mask-pennywise</ref><ref>https://cosmicbook.news/space-jam-2-footage-leaks-harry-potter-wicked-witch-joker-mask</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nFrom the start it is evident that Agent Smith is significantly stronger, smarter, and more individualistic than other Agents. While other agents rarely act without consulting each other via their earpieces, to the point where they often finish each other's sentences, Smith is usually the one giving orders or using his earpiece to gather information for his own ends. Smith also appears to be the leader of other Agents in the first film, as he has the authority to launch Sentinel attacks in the real world. As with other Agents, Smith generally approaches problems through a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view but, if necessary, will also act with brute force and apparent rage, especially when provoked by Neo.\n\nThe earpieces represent some form of control mechanism by the machines. It is notable that when he is interrogating Morpheus, he sends the other agents from the room, then removes his earpiece, releasing himself from the link to the machines before expressing his opinion of humanity. Early in the second film, Smith's earpiece is sent to Neo in an envelope as a message from Smith, representing Smith's newfound freedom.\n\nAgent Smith complains to Morpheus that the Matrix and its inhabitants smell disgusting, \"if there is such a thing [as smell]\". Smith has an open hatred of humans and their weakness of the flesh. He compares humanity to a [[virus]]; a disease organism that uncontrollably replicates and would inevitably destroy their environment were it not for the machine intelligences keeping them in check. Ironically, Smith eventually becomes a computer virus, multiplying until he has overrun the entire Matrix.\n\nAt the same time, Smith develops an animosity towards the Matrix itself, feeling that he is as much a prisoner of it as the humans he is tasked with controlling. He later develops an immense and increasingly open desire for the destruction of both mankind and machines.\n\nHe was also shown to be a [[nihilism|nihilist]], which eventually culminates in his statement that the purpose of life is to end, and crediting Neo's life for his determining this.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' I must thank you [Neo]. After all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to ''end.''</ref> During his final showdown with Neo, Smith angrily dismisses causes such as freedom, truth, peace, and love as simply human attempts to justify a meaningless and purposeless existence, and is completely unable to comprehend why Neo continues to fight him despite the knowledge that he cannot win.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something, for more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is, do you even know? Is it freedom or truth, perhaps peace - could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself. Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now! You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting!

He went to develop a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither human nor robotic.

Agents wear rectangular sunglasses, dark green business suits and neckties, and earpiece radios; after Smith loses his status as an Agent, his suit and tie turn black, his sunglasses take on an angled contour that approximates the rounded shape of the ones Neo wears, and he removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo. In contrast to the other Agents who show apathy toward the human race, Smith harbors an acute disgust with humanity. In the first film, he expresses a desire to leave the Matrix to escape its repulsive taint, and reasons that with Zion destroyed, his services will no longer be required, allowing him in some sense to 'leave' the Matrix. This at least partially explains his extreme antagonism towards Neo, who fights relentlessly to save Zion.\n\nOther Agents have common [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] names like [[Brown (surname)|Brown]], [[Jones (surname)|Jones]], and [[Thompson (surname)|Thompson]]. It was mentioned in the Philosopher Commentary on the DVD collection that the names of [[Smith (surname)|Smith]], Brown, and Jones may be endemic to the system itself, demonstrating a very \"robotic\" mindset on the part of the Machines.\n\nNeo's solitary role as the One is contrasted by Smith, who, by replicating himself, becomes \"the many\". When Neo asks the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] about Smith, the Oracle explains that Smith is Neo's opposite and his negative, the result of the Matrix's governing equations trying to balance themselves.\n\nUnlike the other characters in ''The Matrix'', Smith almost always refers to Neo as \"Mr. Anderson\". He calls him \"Neo\" only once in each part of the trilogy: the first time when he is interviewing Neo about his double life, the second when he is dropping off his earpiece for Neo, and the third when he is repeating a line of his vision to Neo.\n\nWeaving said of the film series in 2003 that it was always going to be a trilogy, and that as Neo's nemesis, Smith was always going to be there, describing Smith as \"more of a free agent\" later on in the series.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title=Lord of the trilogies|work=Reading Eagle|date=7 June 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nChristopher Borrelli praised the writing of Smith, noting that the character \"had all the good lines\", and praising Weaving's portrayal of the character as showing \"refreshingly nihilistic wit\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Borrelli|first1=Christopher|title=Movie review: The Matrix Revolutions|date=4 November 2003|work=The Toledo Blade}}</ref>\n\nThe character has been described as a 1950s \"organization man\", like Sergeant [[Joe Friday]] from ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kapell|editor1-first=Matthew|editor2-last=Doty|editor2-first=William G.|title=Jacking in to the Matrix|date=2006|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=9780826419095|page=66}}</ref>\n\nAs a nod to the fact that both characters are portrayed by Hugo Weaving, a [[Lego]] incarnation of Smith appears as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] in a cutscene from ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego: The Lord of the Rings]]'' when [[Frodo Baggins]] is introduced to [[Elrond]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Men in black]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|The Matrix}}\n\n{{Matrix}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, Agent}}\n[[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional computer viruses]]\n[[Category:Fictional government agents]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional superorganisms]]\n[[Category:Fictional super soldiers]]\n[[Category:Martial artists characters in films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction film characters]]\n[[Category:The Matrix (franchise) characters]]\n[[Category:Advertising characters]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]] \n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=September 2015}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = black\n| name        = Agent Smith\n| series      = [[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]\n| image       = Agent Smith (The Matrix series character).jpg\n| image_size  = \n| caption     = Hugo Weaving portraying Agent Smith\n| first       = ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999)\n| last               = ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017)\n| creator     = [[The Wachowskis]]\n| portrayer   = [[Hugo Weaving]]<br>[[Ian Bliss]] {{small|(human form)}}\n| voice       = [[Christopher Corey Smith]]\n| nickname    = \n| alias       = \n| species     = Computer program (formerly), Virus, Human (while possessing Bane) \n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agent]], later [[computer virus|virus]]\n| title       = \n| family      = \n| spouse      = \n| children    = \n| relatives   = \n| religion    = \n| nationality = \n}}\n\n'''Agent Smith''' is a fictional character and the main [[antagonist]] of [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' trilogy]].

To this end, Smith and his fellow Agents possess a number of superhuman attributes from their ability to bend the rules of the Matrix. Smith manifests his physical form by [[spirit possession|inhabiting and overwriting]] the simulated [[Human body|body]] of a human wired into the Matrix; by moving from body to body, he can reform himself if he is \"killed\" (which only kills the host body) and appear virtually anywhere. He can overcome the limitations of gravity and the human body, giving him speed and strength sufficient to [[bullet time|dodge bullets flawlessly]], [[Punch (combat)|punch]] through concrete with his bare hands, and jump impossible distances. He and other Agents wear dark green business suits with matching neckties, white dress shirts, and sunglasses with rectangular lenses. They use earpiece radios that allow them to communicate with each other instantaneously and perceive the actions of other humans wired into the Matrix via a type of shared consciousness. When Smith removes his earpiece during the first film, he is left unaware of the attack on the building in which he is holding Morpheus. Smith is armed in the first film with the [[Desert Eagle]], chambered for high-caliber [[.50 Action Express|.50 AE]] ammunition, as is standard with all Agents within the Matrix.\n\nAt the end of the first film, Smith appears to have been deleted by Neo. However, in the sequels, Smith is revealed to have been linked to Neo, which enabled him to resist being sent to the Source - the Machines' mainframe, where obsolete or malfunctioning programs are deleted. No longer an Agent, Smith is liberated from the Machines' control and exists as a renegade program that manifests himself akin to a self-replicating [[computer virus]] compared to his original Agent-based ability to inhabit a single body wired into the Matrix. Smith gains the power to copy his physical form onto any entity in the Matrix by phasing his hand into their body and spreading a black liquid that transforms them into a copy of himself, resulting in an ever-growing army of Smiths [[group mind (science fiction)|connected by a single consciousness]]. By copying himself onto a human [[redpill]] in the process of disconnecting from the Matrix, Smith overwrites their consciousness and takes control of their body in the real world. This is seen when Smith takes over [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]]'s body in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''; however, he is repelled when he attempts to do the same to [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. Smith's real power comes from his ability to absorb memories and powers from his victims, human and program alike, culminating in him taking over the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] and fighting Neo in the final battle of the Matrix series. Neo allows himself to be overwritten during the battle, thus giving the Machines an opportunity to delete Smith and return the Matrix and its inhabitants to normal.\n\n==Character history==\n===''The Matrix''===\nIn the first film, Smith is one of the three Agents sent to deal with Morpheus. After Neo is successfully removed from the Matrix, Smith arranges Morpheus' capture by bribing [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disillusioned member of Morpheus' crew, with reintegration into The Matrix. When Neo manages to free Morpheus, Smith and his fellow Agents engage in a lengthy cross-town chase. He and Neo fight, with Smith dominating most of the fight. Shortly after Neo escapes the fight, Smith guns him down. Neo revives, realizes his power as the One, and enters Smith, to destroy him from within.\n\n===''The Matrix Reloaded''===\nAs a result of his contact with Neo from the first film, Smith is \"unplugged\" in the second film, no longer an Agent of the system but a \"free man\". This is signified by the lack of an earpiece, which he sends to Neo in an envelope as a message early in the film. His appearance has changed in the second film as well; his sunglasses now have an angular shape different from the Agents' oblong lenses, approximating the shape of the ones Neo wears. His suit and tie re now jet black, as opposed to the dark green tint from the first film. He still possesses the abilities of an Agent, but instead of being able to jump from one human to another, he is able to copy himself over any human or program in the Matrix through direct contact; this includes humans wired into the Matrix, non-Agent programs with human forms, [[redpill]]s, and other Agents. Smith retains the memories and abilities, if any, of the one over which he copies himself. This ability is much like how a virus replicates, creating an ironic contrast with the first film, where Smith likens humanity to a virus.\n\nHe makes the claim that Neo has set him free. However, he believes there is an unseen purpose that still binds him to Neo. He tries to copy his programming onto Neo, but when this fails, he and dozens of his clones attack him, forcing Neo to flee. Later, he and his clones try to stop Neo from reaching the machine mainframe, without success.\n\nSmith copies himself onto Bane ([[Ian Bliss]]), a crew member of the [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] hovercraft ''Caduceus''. While waiting to leave the Matrix with a message from [[Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]], Bane is attacked and overwritten by Smith, who then takes control of his body in the real world. Smith tests his control over the body by making Bane cut his own arm, in preparation for an assassination attempt on Neo that he quickly abandons. He later sabotages the Zion fleet's defense of the city by triggering one ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapon too early, knocking out the other ships and allowing the Sentinels to overrun them.\n\n===''The Matrix Revolutions''===\n[[File:Smithposter.jpg|thumb|upright|Movie poster for ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', featuring some of the numerous copies of Smith]]\n\nBy the start of the third film, Smith has managed to copy himself over nearly every humanoid in the Matrix, giving him complete control over the \"Core Network\" (the underlying foundation of the inner workings of the Matrix), thus rendering him immutable by even the Machines themselves. The Oracle explains to Neo that he and Smith have become equal in power and that Smith is Neo's negative, a result of the Matrix's equation trying to balance itself. She tells Neo that Smith will destroy both the Matrix and the real world unless he is stopped. Smith soon assimilates the Oracle, gaining her power of [[foresight (psychology)|foresight]], or [[omniscience]], and later manifests reality-bending powers equivalent to Neo's, such as the ability to fly. Meanwhile, in the real world, Bane (now under Smith's control) stows away on a ship being used by Neo and Trinity and tries to kill them both. Neo is blinded in the fight, but discovers that he can now sense Smith's essence acutely enough to land a blow that kills Bane.\n\nNear the climax of the film, Neo offers a deal with the Machines to get rid of Smith in exchange for Zion's safety, warning them that Smith is beyond their control and will eventually spread to the machine city, which will result in destruction of both mankind and machines. Knowing that Neo is right, the Machines agree to his terms and command all Sentinels attacking Zion to stand down and wait for orders. They later give Neo a connection to enter the Matrix to stop Smith on their behalf. Although the Matrix is now populated exclusively by Smith and his clones, the Smith that has obtained the Oracle's powers battles Neo alone; as he explains, he has foreseen his victory, and has no need for the help of his copies. The two are almost evenly matched as the fight begins, though Neo's combat abilities seem arguably superior to that of Smith, the latter attacking more out of brute force, rather than the technical skill he displayed in the first film. This lasts, until Neo is able to punch Smith strongly enough to slam him into the street at least 20&nbsp;ft away. As the fight continues, however, it becomes clear that Neo cannot win with his finite stamina against the tireless Smith, who begins to dominate Neo in the fight; by the end of the fight, he is able to brutally beat Neo into near defeat. In the midst of this battle, Smith explains to Neo his final [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] revelation: \"It was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end.\"\n\nWhen Neo is near defeat, Smith demands to know why he continues to fight despite knowing he cannot win. Neo calmly responds, \"Because I choose to\" and is savagely pummeled by the enraged Smith as a result. Suddenly recognizing the scene from his [[prophecy]], Smith is compelled to deliver the line he said in it: \"I say.... Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.\" His own words confuse and frighten him. Neo realizes that he cannot overpower Smith and allows himself to be assimilated. Because Agent Smith has deleted the anomaly (Neo), he no longer has a purpose and he must also be deleted. Smith is now directly connected to the Source, the machines are able to destroy all copies of his programming and reboot the Matrix without errors. The process does kill Neo, but does also destroy Smith. Neo's body is carried away by the machines, and an uncertain peace is established between Zion and the machine world.\n\n===''The Matrix Online''===\nDespite his destruction at the end of the film series, Agent Smith (or at least the remnants of his programming) managed to return and made several appearances inside the movie's official continuation, the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[The Matrix Online]]''.\n\nThe first infection was noted in Machine mission controller Agent Gray, whose background information confirms that he was overwritten by Smith at some point during the timeline of the second and third films. This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Morpheus. The Agent, in both a storyline related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Zionist redpills declaring 'their stench unbearable any longer'. As a result of his actions the agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a 'thorough code cleansing'. He has shown no signs of direct infection since.   \n    \nMachine liaison officer DifferenceEngine, following a similar scenario to that of the previous Agent Gray infection, also took on the dialect and emotional characteristics of the famous exile agent. Instead of attacking redpills, this instance insisted on finding 'Mr. Anderson'. In the end, the human/machine head relations liaison, Agent Pace, was made aware of the program's infection and subsequent crusade; she proceeded to lock down his RSI and return his program to the Source for analysis. His subsequent fate is unknown.\n\nThe third victim of infection was the notorious bluepill Shane Black. This man was an unfortunate victim of the Smith Virus who, once infected, gained the ability to spread the code to others. This quickly led to a small scale outbreak, with several more bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their bluepill lives. Shane Black's troubles continued, as he was one of the bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited redpills practising their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Smith infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterwards.\n\nThe most recent appearance of the Smith virus was during the third anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Smith). As redpills began to fight back using specialist code from the Oracle, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The nature of this form was never revealed. <!--The Matrix Online has closed, so all open storylines will indefinitely remain unresolved.-->\n\n===''The Matrix: Path of Neo''===\n''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'', a video game covering the events of the entire film trilogy, features a different ending than that shown in ''The Matrix Revolutions'', with a new final boss: the ''MegaSmith''. The MegaSmith was used for gameplay reasons, because though the Wachowskis thought the [[martyr]] approach suitable for film, they also believed that in an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals), this would not work. So, this character was created to be the more appropriate \"final boss\" of ''Path of Neo'', with the final battle described by the siblings as \"A little [[Hulk]] versus [[Galactus]] action\". The MegaSmith is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the \"spectator Smiths\" standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaSmith's muscles, resulting in Smith not only becoming the city's people, but the city itself.\n\nAfter Neo knocks Smith into the crater in the level \"Aerial Battle\", Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the surrounding Smiths walk away from the crater. Neo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car which flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Neo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile. A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Smiths can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Neo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Smith then pulls a pair of giant Smith Shades from a billboard and puts them on. As an interesting aside, the glasses on the billboard are the same ones Agent Smith wore in the first Matrix film, with the curved nose bar, but when the MegaSmith actually puts them on, they become the ones Agent Smith wears in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and in ''Revolutions''.\n\nAfter the fight\u2014consisting of Neo dodging blows and building up power to launch more powerful assaults at MegaSmith, damaging one arm and creating a large hole in his chest\u2014Neo flies straight into MegaSmith's mouth, causing the Smiths throughout the Matrix to overload and explode. The player is then shown a short scene from ''The Matrix: Revolutions'' of the streets shining with light emanating from the destroyed Smiths.\n\n===''The Lego Batman Movie'' (2017)===\nAgent Smith briefly appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' as one of the captives of the [[Phantom Zone]]. He and his clones appear surveilling [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s vandalized Wayne Island, and later appear as one of the multiple enemies attacking the heroes. Smith's clones also appear as enemies in the ''Lego Batman Movie'' story pack for ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', adapting their role in the film.\n\nHis voice actor was uncredited.\n\n==Personality==\nFrom the start it is evident that Agent Smith is significantly stronger, smarter, and more individualistic than other Agents. While other agents rarely act without consulting each other via their earpieces, to the point where they often finish each other's sentences, Smith is usually the one giving orders or using his earpiece to gather information for his own ends. Smith also appears to be the leader of other Agents in the first film, as he has the authority to launch Sentinel attacks in the real world. As with other Agents, Smith generally approaches problems through a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view but, if necessary, will also act with brute force and apparent rage, especially when provoked by Neo.\n\nThe earpieces represent some form of control mechanism by the machines. It is notable that when he is interrogating Morpheus, he sends the other agents from the room, then removes his earpiece, releasing himself from the link to the machines before expressing his opinion of humanity. Early in the second film, Smith's earpiece is sent to Neo in an envelope as a message from Smith, representing Smith's newfound freedom.\n\nAgent Smith complains to Morpheus that the Matrix and its inhabitants smell disgusting, \"if there is such a thing [as smell]\". Smith has an open hatred of humans and their weakness of the flesh. He compares humanity to a [[virus]]; a disease organism that uncontrollably replicates and would inevitably destroy their environment were it not for the machine intelligences keeping them in check. Ironically, Smith eventually becomes a computer virus, multiplying until he has overrun the entire Matrix.\n\nAt the same time, Smith develops an animosity towards the Matrix itself, feeling that he is as much a prisoner of it as the humans he is tasked with controlling. He later develops an immense and increasingly open desire for the destruction of both mankind and machines.\n\nHe was also shown to be a [[nihilism|nihilist]], which eventually culminates in his statement that the purpose of life is to end, and crediting Neo's life for his determining this.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' I must thank you [Neo]. After all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to ''end.''</ref> During his final showdown with Neo, Smith angrily dismisses causes such as freedom, truth, peace, and love as simply human attempts to justify a meaningless and purposeless existence, and is completely unable to comprehend why Neo continues to fight him despite the knowledge that he cannot win.<ref>''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''<br>'''Agent Smith:''' Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something, for more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is, do you even know? Is it freedom or truth, perhaps peace - could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself. Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now! You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson, why?! why do you persist?! / '''Neo:''' Because I choose to.</ref>\n\nThe [[Wachowskis]] have commented that Smith's gradual humanization throughout ''The Matrix'' is a process intended to mirror and balance Neo's own increasing power and understanding of the machine world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nA writer at ''The Guardian'' commented that Smith seems to enjoy his job too much.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/09/hugo-weaving-the-matrix-agent-smith-why-id-like-to-be</ref>\n\n==Portrayal==\nFrench actor [[Jean Reno]] was originally offered the role of Agent Smith in ''The Matrix'', but he declined as he was at one point of his career in which he didn't want to leave his native [[France]], unwilling to move to [[Australia]] for a four-and-a-half months shooting.

He went to develop a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither human nor robotic. He also said that [[The Wachowskis]]' voices influenced his voice in the film. When filming for ''The Matrix'' began, Weaving mentioned that he was excited to be a part of something that would extend him.<ref name = \"Interrogation Room\">{{cite AV media| people =Oreck, Josh (Director); Wachowski, Larry; Matthies, Eric (Producers) | title =[[The Matrix Revisited]] | section = Interrogation Room | url = | medium =DVD | publisher = [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.

Agents wear rectangular sunglasses, dark green business suits and neckties, and earpiece radios; after Smith loses his status as an Agent, his suit and tie turn black, his sunglasses take on an angled contour that approximates the rounded shape of the ones Neo wears, and he removes his earpiece and sends it to Neo. In contrast to the other Agents who show apathy toward the human race, Smith harbors an acute disgust with humanity. In the first film, he expresses a desire to leave the Matrix to escape its repulsive taint, and reasons that with Zion destroyed, his services will no longer be required, allowing him in some sense to 'leave' the Matrix. This at least partially explains his extreme antagonism towards Neo, who fights relentlessly to save Zion.\n\nOther Agents have common [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] names like [[Brown (surname)|Brown]], [[Jones (surname)|Jones]], and [[Thompson (surname)|Thompson]]. It was mentioned in the Philosopher Commentary on the DVD collection that the names of [[Smith (surname)|Smith]], Brown, and Jones may be endemic to the system itself, demonstrating a very \"robotic\" mindset on the part of the Machines.\n\nNeo's solitary role as the One is contrasted by Smith, who, by replicating himself, becomes \"the many\". When Neo asks the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] about Smith, the Oracle explains that Smith is Neo's opposite and his negative, the result of the Matrix's governing equations trying to balance themselves.\n\nUnlike the other characters in ''The Matrix'', Smith almost always refers to Neo as \"Mr. Anderson\". He calls him \"Neo\" only once in each part of the trilogy: the first time when he is interviewing Neo about his double life, the second when he is dropping off his earpiece for Neo, and the third when he is repeating a line of his vision to Neo.\n\nWeaving said of the film series in 2003 that it was always going to be a trilogy, and that as Neo's nemesis, Smith was always going to be there, describing Smith as \"more of a free agent\" later on in the series.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title=Lord of the trilogies|work=Reading Eagle|date=7 June 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nChristopher Borrelli praised the writing of Smith, noting that the character \"had all the good lines\", and praising Weaving's portrayal of the character as showing \"refreshingly nihilistic wit\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Borrelli|first1=Christopher|title=Movie review: The Matrix Revolutions|date=4 November 2003|work=The Toledo Blade}}</ref>\n\nThe character has been described as a 1950s \"organization man\", like Sergeant [[Joe Friday]] from ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]''.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kapell|editor1-first=Matthew|editor2-last=Doty|editor2-first=William G.|title=Jacking in to the Matrix|date=2006|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=9780826419095|page=66}}</ref>\n\nAs a nod to the fact that both characters are portrayed by Hugo Weaving, a [[Lego]] incarnation of Smith appears as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] in a cutscene from ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego: The Lord of the Rings]]'' when [[Frodo Baggins]] is introduced to [[Elrond]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Men in black]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote|The Matrix}}\n\n{{Matrix}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Smith, Agent}}\n[[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with spirit possession or body swapping abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional computer viruses]]\n[[Category:Fictional government agents]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional superorganisms]]\n[[Category:Fictional super soldiers]]\n[[Category:Martial artists characters in films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction film characters]]\n[[Category:The Matrix (franchise) characters]]\n[[Category:Advertising characters]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]] \n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n", "name_user": "74.108.145.224", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 949441675 byGgctuk(talk))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Smith"}

Despite being a race-winner in [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]], he often struggled with the unfamiliar car, and was occasionally outpaced by his much-maligned teammate, [[Taki Inoue]]. He also proved to be an unlucky driver, suffering a spectacular puncture and suspension failure on his d\u00e9but race at [[1995 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]] due to clipping the pit lane wall after a tire change, being left on the grid at [[1995 German Grand Prix|Hockenheim]] due to a transmission failure, and spinning on dust and oil kicked up by [[David Coulthard]] at the Ascari Chicane on the first lap of the [[1995 Italian Grand Prix|Italian GP]], causing a pile-up and a restart. However, he only missed out on a point in the restarted race when he was overtaken by [[Jean-Christophe Boullion]]'s [[Sauber]] on the last lap. When Morbidelli returned, Papis was out of a drive and headed to America for 1996.\n\n==Champ Car==\n\nHe moved to [[Champ Car|CART]] Champ Car racing in 1996 as a replacement for [[Jeff Krosnoff]] who was killed in the previous race in Toronto. In 1999 he joined the more competitive [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal]] team, almost winning the [[US 500]] before running out of fuel, and finishing 5th in the series. He started the next year by winning the 2000 season-opener, but failed to finish in the championship top 10. In 2001 he won twice and finished 6th overall, but was dropped by the team, mainly due to two collisions with teammate [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]]. In 2002 he competed with [[Sigma Autosport]], scoring two third places finishes at Long Beach and Milwaukee, before the team folded due to financial problems. The Italian did a partial season with [[PK Racing]] in 2003, with a best result of fourth at Road America. Papis also raced in the [[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002]] and [[2006 Indianapolis 500|2006]] [[Indianapolis 500]] races for [[Cheever Racing]], claiming a 14th place finish in his second appearance. He mostly concentrated on sportscars since 2001, remarking that \"Champ Car needs me more than I need it\" as the series struggled to fill its grid for 2003 after many teams defected to the [[Indy Racing League|IRL]].\n\n==IndyCar==\n\nPapis raced in the IRL early in his career. He has raced for Roger Penske, Andretti-Green Racing and Panther Racing from 2001\u20132009. Papis is a long-time friend of drivers [[Tony Kanaan]] and [[Alex Zanardi]]. In 2013 at the Indianapolis 500, Papis and Zanardi were present in the victory celebration when Kanaan won his first Indy 500.\n\nIn 2016, Papis was hired by the IndyCar Series as a race steward along with [[Arie Luyendyk]] and [[Dan Davis (racing)|Dan Davis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indycar.com/News/2016/02/02-24-Race-stewards-named|title=INDYCAR NAMES VETERAN MOTORSPORTS TRIO AS RACE STEWARDS FOR 2016 SEASON|work=[[IndyCar Series]]|date=February 24, 2016|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==NASCAR==\n[[File:Nationwide 33 Max Papis 2011 Road America Bucyrus 200.jpg|thumb|left|2011 Nationwide car at [[Road America]]]]\nHe made his [[NASCAR]] debut in August 2006, competing in the [[Busch Series]] race at [[Watkins Glen International Raceway]] for [[McGill Motorsports]]<ref>[http://www.racing-reference.info/driver?id=papisma01 Max Papis Career Statistics]</ref> following the release of [[Tim Sauter]] from the ride. He attempted to qualify for the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] race but failed to qualify.\n\nPapis also announced that he would run 2 races in 2007 for James Finch's [[Phoenix Racing (NASCAR team)|Phoenix Racing]] No. 01 Chevy. In his first race, at Montreal in the inaugural NAPA 200, Papis avoided [[Marcos Ambrose]]' crash (caused by a disqualified [[Robby Gordon]]), with 2 laps left, to finish in third place. At Watkins Glen the next week, his engine failed on lap 2.\n\nPapis made his Cup Series debut at [[Infineon Raceway]] in 2008, piloting the No. 66 [[Haas CNC Racing]] Chevrolet in place of regular driver [[Scott Riggs]]. He was also scheduled to drive the No. 64 car for [[Rusty Wallace, Inc.]] on three road course races in the 2008 Nationwide Series. Haas CNC Racing hired Papis to drive the No. 70 Chevrolet Monte Carlo at the course at Watkins Glen in the Sprint Cup Series in August 2008. He was announced as the driver of the No. 13 GEICO Toyota in 18 races in the 2009 and a full-time ride in the 2010 Sprint Cup.\n\nIn his first Cup season with a dedicated ride, Papis recorded a career best 8th-place finish at Watkins Glen and 15th starting position at Fontana. He also recorded 12th-place finish at Infineon Raceway. In February at Daytona in 2010, Papis had the fastest truck in the truck series event, nearly winning his first Truck series event after leading for some laps. Papis was collected in an accident with 15 laps left in the race, while going towards the lead.\n\nAfter Watkins Glen in 2010 the team announced that Papis would be replaced by [[Casey Mears]] for 2011 and Papis would race in the Truck Series for the team.\n\nAlso in 2010, Papis recorded a top-30 finish in the [[2010 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], but failed to qualify at Bristol. He nearly had a top ten running at Talladega but was caught up in an accident. At Montreal in the Nationwide Series, Papis drove for [[Richard Childress Racing]] and while leading on the final lap, took too much of a last-turn curb, got passed by [[Boris Said]], and recorded a second-place finish.\n\nIn 2011, Papis raced in the Truck Series partly for KHI and Germain, resulting in an 18th-place finish in the standings.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, Papis had good runs on the road-course races but did not win any of them. In 2011 at Road America he had a good car, but he was spun out by [[Jacques Villeneuve]] with two laps left. When the race ended, Papis blocked Villeneuve's car on pit road and they argued. In 2012, Papis finished in fourth-place at Road America.

Although his second-place [[Ferrari 333SP]] had been battered due to collisions, some of its bodywork held together by tape, Papis unlapped himself by passing the race leader (the Doyle Racing [[Riley Technologies|Riley & Scott]]-[[Oldsmobile]] driven by [[Wayne Taylor]]) and proceeded to set some of the fastest laps of the entire race. Taylor was nursing his car around the track due to an overheating problem and otherwise would have been able to cruise to a win, but Papis' pace and the slowing Oldsmobile suggested that Papis could theoretically take the win from him. Papis' speed was achieved at the cost of maximum fuel consumption and although he drove down the pit lane at full speed to re-fuel (pit lane speed limits were imposed the next year), Taylor was still ahead by 64 seconds at the end of the race.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===Complete International Formula 3000 results===\n([[:Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position) (Races\nin ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=45| [[International Formula 3000]] results\n|-\n!

Despite being a race-winner in [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]], he often struggled with the unfamiliar car, and was occasionally outpaced by his much-maligned teammate, [[Taki Inoue]]. He also proved to be an unlucky driver, suffering a spectacular puncture and suspension failure on his d\u00e9but race at [[1995 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]] due to clipping the pit lane wall after a tire change, being left on the grid at [[1995 German Grand Prix|Hockenheim]] due to a transmission failure, and spinning on dust and oil kicked up by [[David Coulthard]] at the Ascari Chicane on the first lap of the [[1995 Italian Grand Prix|Italian GP]], causing a pile-up and a restart. However, he only missed out on a point in the restarted race when he was overtaken by [[Jean-Christophe Boullion]]'s [[Sauber]] on the last lap. When Morbidelli returned, Papis was out of a drive and headed to America for 1996.\n\n==Champ Car==\n\nHe moved to [[Champ Car|CART]] Champ Car racing in 1996 as a replacement for [[Jeff Krosnoff]] who was killed in the previous race in Toronto. In 1999 he joined the more competitive [[Rahal Letterman Racing|Rahal]] team, almost winning the [[US 500]] before running out of fuel, and finishing 5th in the series. He started the next year by winning the 2000 season-opener, but failed to finish in the championship top 10. In 2001 he won twice and finished 6th overall, but was dropped by the team, mainly due to two collisions with teammate [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]]. In 2002 he competed with [[Sigma Autosport]], scoring two third places finishes at Long Beach and Milwaukee, before the team folded due to financial problems. The Italian did a partial season with [[PK Racing]] in 2003, with a best result of fourth at Road America. Papis also raced in the [[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002]] and [[2006 Indianapolis 500|2006]] [[Indianapolis 500]] races for [[Cheever Racing]], claiming a 14th place finish in his second appearance. He mostly concentrated on sportscars since 2001, remarking that \"Champ Car needs me more than I need it\" as the series struggled to fill its grid for 2003 after many teams defected to the [[Indy Racing League|IRL]].\n\n==IndyCar==\n\nPapis raced in the IRL early in his career. He has raced for Roger Penske, Andretti-Green Racing and Panther Racing from 2001\u20132009. Papis is a long-time friend of drivers [[Tony Kanaan]] and [[Alex Zanardi]]. In 2013 at the Indianapolis 500, Papis and Zanardi were present in the victory celebration when Kanaan won his first Indy 500.\n\nIn 2016, Papis was hired by the IndyCar Series as a race steward along with [[Arie Luyendyk]] and [[Dan Davis (racing)|Dan Davis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indycar.com/News/2016/02/02-24-Race-stewards-named|title=INDYCAR NAMES VETERAN MOTORSPORTS TRIO AS RACE STEWARDS FOR 2016 SEASON|work=[[IndyCar Series]]|date=February 24, 2016|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==NASCAR==\n[[File:Nationwide 33 Max Papis 2011 Road America Bucyrus 200.jpg|thumb|left|2011 Nationwide car at [[Road America]]]]\nHe made his [[NASCAR]] debut in August 2006, competing in the [[Busch Series]] race at [[Watkins Glen International Raceway]] for [[McGill Motorsports]]<ref>[http://www.racing-reference.info/driver?id=papisma01 Max Papis Career Statistics]</ref> following the release of [[Tim Sauter]] from the ride. He attempted to qualify for the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] race but failed to qualify.\n\nPapis also announced that he would run 2 races in 2007 for James Finch's [[Phoenix Racing (NASCAR team)|Phoenix Racing]] No. 01 Chevy. In his first race, at Montreal in the inaugural NAPA 200, Papis avoided [[Marcos Ambrose]]' crash (caused by a disqualified [[Robby Gordon]]), with 2 laps left, to finish in third place. At Watkins Glen the next week, his engine failed on lap 2.\n\nPapis made his Cup Series debut at [[Infineon Raceway]] in 2008, piloting the No. 66 [[Haas CNC Racing]] Chevrolet in place of regular driver [[Scott Riggs]]. He was also scheduled to drive the No. 64 car for [[Rusty Wallace, Inc.]] on three road course races in the 2008 Nationwide Series. Haas CNC Racing hired Papis to drive the No. 70 Chevrolet Monte Carlo at the course at Watkins Glen in the Sprint Cup Series in August 2008. He was announced as the driver of the No. 13 GEICO Toyota in 18 races in the 2009 and a full-time ride in the 2010 Sprint Cup.\n\nIn his first Cup season with a dedicated ride, Papis recorded a career best 8th-place finish at Watkins Glen and 15th starting position at Fontana. He also recorded 12th-place finish at Infineon Raceway. In February at Daytona in 2010, Papis had the fastest truck in the truck series event, nearly winning his first Truck series event after leading for some laps. Papis was collected in an accident with 15 laps left in the race, while going towards the lead.\n\nAfter Watkins Glen in 2010 the team announced that Papis would be replaced by [[Casey Mears]] for 2011 and Papis would race in the Truck Series for the team.\n\nAlso in 2010, Papis recorded a top-30 finish in the [[2010 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], but failed to qualify at Bristol. He nearly had a top ten running at Talladega but was caught up in an accident. At Montreal in the Nationwide Series, Papis drove for [[Richard Childress Racing]] and while leading on the final lap, took too much of a last-turn curb, got passed by [[Boris Said]], and recorded a second-place finish.\n\nIn 2011, Papis raced in the Truck Series partly for KHI and Germain, resulting in an 18th-place finish in the standings.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2013, Papis had good runs on the road-course races but did not win any of them. In 2011 at Road America he had a good car, but he was spun out by [[Jacques Villeneuve]] with two laps left. When the race ended, Papis blocked Villeneuve's car on pit road and they argued. In 2012, Papis finished in fourth-place at Road America. Also in 2012, Papis ran one race in [[2012 NASCAR Canadian Tire Series|NASCAR Canadian Tire Series]] at [[Kawartha Speedway]] driving No. 24 [[Dodge]] for [[Scott Steckly]], he started 16th and finished 21st.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racing-reference.info/drivdet/papisma01/2012/T|title=Max Papis \u2013 2012 NASCAR Canadian Tire Series Results|work=Racing-Reference|publisher=NASCAR Digital Media, LLC|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 at [[Road America]], Papis, who spent nearly the entire race in the top five, found himself being spun out twice in the waning laps. When the race was over, a furious Papis went up to [[Billy Johnson (racing driver)|Billy Johnson]] (who spun him out one of the times) and slapped him.<ref name=\"Slap\">{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/topics/device/mob/m/video/76895125/nns-max-papis-slaps-billy-johnson-road-america-2013.htm|title=NNS: Max Papis Slaps Billy Johnson&nbsp;\u2014 Road America 2013|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]|date=2013-06-22|accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref> After being separated by officials Papis and Johnson exchanged shouts ending with Papis walking off.

Although his second-place [[Ferrari 333SP]] had been battered due to collisions, some of its bodywork held together by tape, Papis unlapped himself by passing the race leader (the Doyle Racing [[Riley Technologies|Riley & Scott]]-[[Oldsmobile]] driven by [[Wayne Taylor]]) and proceeded to set some of the fastest laps of the entire race. Taylor was nursing his car around the track due to an overheating problem and otherwise would have been able to cruise to a win, but Papis' pace and the slowing Oldsmobile suggested that Papis could theoretically take the win from him. Papis' speed was achieved at the cost of maximum fuel consumption and although he drove down the pit lane at full speed to re-fuel (pit lane speed limits were imposed the next year), Taylor was still ahead by 64 seconds at the end of the race.\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===Complete International Formula 3000 results===\n([[:Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position) (Races\nin ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!colspan=45| [[International Formula 3000]] results\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Einstein tensor", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}{{Short description|Tensor used in general relativity\n}}\n{{General relativity sidebar}}\n\nIn [[differential geometry]], the '''Einstein tensor''' (named after [[Albert Einstein]]; also known as the '''trace-reversed [[Ricci curvature|Ricci tensor]]''') is used to express the [[curvature]] of a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. In [[general relativity]], it occurs in the [[Einstein field equations]] for [[gravitation]] that describe [[spacetime]] curvature in a manner consistent with energy and momentum conservation.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe Einstein tensor <math>\\mathbf{G}</math> is a [[tensor]] of order 2 defined over [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  In [[index-free notation]] it is defined as\n\n::<math>\\mathbf{G}=\\mathbf{R}-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{g}R,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{R}</math> is the Ricci tensor, <math>\\mathbf{g}</math> is the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] and <math>R</math> is the [[scalar curvature]]. In component form, the previous equation reads as\n\n::<math>G_{\\mu\\nu} = R_{\\mu\\nu} - {1\\over2} g_{\\mu\\nu}R .</math>\n\nThe Einstein tensor is symmetric\n::<math>G_{\\mu\\nu} = G_{\\nu\\mu}</math>\n\nand, like the [[on shell and off shell|on shell]] [[stress\u2013energy tensor]], divergenceless\n::<math>\\nabla_\\mu G^{\\mu\\nu} = 0\\,.</math>\n\n== Explicit form ==\nThe Ricci tensor depends only on the metric tensor, so the Einstein tensor can be defined directly with just the metric tensor. However, this  expression is complex and rarely quoted in textbooks.  The complexity of this expression can be shown using the formula for the Ricci tensor in terms of [[Christoffel symbols]]:\n\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\nG_{\\alpha\\beta} &= R_{\\alpha\\beta} - \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\alpha\\beta} R \\\\\n&= R_{\\alpha\\beta} - \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\alpha\\beta} g^{\\gamma\\zeta} R_{\\gamma\\zeta} \\\\\n&= (\\delta^\\gamma_\\alpha \\delta^\\zeta_\\beta - \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\alpha\\beta}g^{\\gamma\\zeta}) R_{\\gamma\\zeta} \\\\\n&= (\\delta^\\gamma_\\alpha \\delta^\\zeta_\\beta - \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\alpha\\beta}g^{\\gamma\\zeta})(\\Gamma^\\epsilon{}_{\\gamma\\zeta,\\epsilon} - \\Gamma^\\epsilon{}_{\\gamma\\epsilon,\\zeta} + \\Gamma^\\epsilon{}_{\\epsilon\\sigma} \\Gamma^\\sigma{}_{\\gamma\\zeta} - \\Gamma^\\epsilon{}_{\\zeta\\sigma} \\Gamma^\\sigma{}_{\\epsilon\\gamma}),  \\\\\nG^{\\alpha\\beta} &= (g^{\\alpha\\gamma} g^{\\beta\\zeta} - \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\alpha\\beta}g^{\\gamma\\zeta})(\\Gamma^\\epsilon{}_{\\gamma\\zeta,\\epsilon} - \\Gamma^\\epsilon{}_{\\gamma\\epsilon,\\zeta} + \\Gamma^\\epsilon{}_{\\epsilon\\sigma} \\Gamma^\\sigma{}_{\\gamma\\zeta} - \\Gamma^\\epsilon{}_{\\zeta\\sigma} \\Gamma^\\sigma{}_{\\epsilon\\gamma}),\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\delta^\\alpha_\\beta</math> is the [[Kronecker tensor]] and the Christoffel symbol <math>\\Gamma^\\alpha{}_{\\beta\\gamma}</math> is defined as\n\n::<math>\\Gamma^\\alpha{}_{\\beta\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\alpha\\epsilon}(g_{\\beta\\epsilon,\\gamma} + g_{\\gamma\\epsilon,\\beta} - g_{\\beta\\gamma,\\epsilon}).</math>\n\nBefore cancellations, this formula results in <math>2 \\times (6+6+9+9) = 60</math> individual terms. Cancellations bring this number down somewhat. <!-- exactly how much? -->\n\nIn the special case of a locally [[inertial reference frame]] near a point, the first derivatives of the metric tensor vanish and the component form of the Einstein tensor is considerably simplified:\n\n:: <math>\\begin{align}G_{\\alpha\\beta} & = g^{\\gamma\\mu}\\bigl[ g_{\\gamma[\\beta,\\mu]\\alpha} + g_{\\alpha[\\mu,\\beta]\\gamma} - \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\alpha\\beta} g^{\\epsilon\\sigma} (g_{\\epsilon[\\mu,\\sigma]\\gamma} + g_{\\gamma[\\sigma,\\mu]\\epsilon})\\bigr] \\\\ & = g^{\\gamma\\mu} (\\delta^\\epsilon_\\alpha \\delta^\\sigma_\\beta - \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\epsilon\\sigma}g_{\\alpha\\beta})(g_{\\epsilon[\\mu,\\sigma]\\gamma} + g_{\\gamma[\\sigma,\\mu]\\epsilon}),\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere square brackets conventionally denote [[Antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetrization]] over bracketed indices, i.e.\n\n:: <math>g_{\\alpha[\\beta,\\gamma]\\epsilon} \\, = \\frac{1}{2} (g_{\\alpha\\beta,\\gamma\\epsilon} - g_{\\alpha\\gamma,\\beta\\epsilon}).</math>\n\n== Trace ==\nThe [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the Einstein tensor can be computed by [[Tensor contraction|contract]]ing the equation in the [[#Definition|definition]] with the [[metric tensor]] <math>g^{\\mu\\nu}</math>. In <math>n</math> dimensions (of arbitrary signature):\n\n::<math>\\begin{align}g^{\\mu\\nu}G_{\\mu\\nu} &= g^{\\mu\\nu}R_{\\mu\\nu} - {1\\over2} g^{\\mu\\nu}g_{\\mu\\nu}R \\\\ G &= R - {1\\over2} (nR) \\\\ G &= {{2-n}\\over2}R\\end{align}</math>\n\nTherefore, in the special case of {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}} dimensions,  <math>G\\ = -R</math>. That is, the trace of the Einstein tensor is the negative of the [[Ricci tensor]]'s trace. Thus, another name for the Einstein tensor is the ''trace-reversed Ricci tensor''. This <math>n=4</math> case is especially relevant in the [[theory of general relativity]].\n\n== Use in general relativity ==\n\nThe Einstein tensor allows the [[Einstein field equations]] (without a [[cosmological constant]]) to be written in the concise form:\n::<math>G_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}.</math>\n\nwhich becomes in [[geometrized units]] (i.e. ''c'' = [[Gravitational constant|''G'']] (i.e. the Newton's gravitational constant and not the trace of the Einstein tensor) = 1),\n::<math>G_{\\mu\\nu} = 8 \\pi \\, T_{\\mu\\nu}.</math>\n\nFrom the [[#Explicit form|explicit form of the Einstein tensor]], the Einstein tensor is a [[nonlinear]] function of the metric tensor, but is linear in the second [[partial derivative]]s of the metric. As a symmetric order-2 tensor, the Einstein tensor has 10 independent components in a 4-dimensional space. It follows that the Einstein field equations are a set of 10 [[Types of differential equations|quasilinear]] second-order partial differential equations for the metric tensor.\n\nThe [[contracted Bianchi identities]] can also be easily expressed with the aid of the Einstein tensor:\n::<math> \\nabla_{\\mu} G^{\\mu\\nu} = 0.</math>\n\nThe (contracted) Bianchi identities automatically ensure the covariant conservation of the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] in curved spacetimes:\n::<math>\\nabla_{\\mu} T^{\\mu\\nu} = 0.</math>\n\nThe physical significance of the Einstein tensor is highlighted by this identity. In terms of the densitized stress tensor contracted on a [[Killing vector]] <math>\\xi^\\mu</math>, an ordinary conservation law holds:\n::<math>\\partial_{\\mu}(\\sqrt{-g} T^\\mu{}_\\nu \\xi^\\nu) = 0</math>.\n\n==Uniqueness==\n[[David Lovelock]] has shown that, in a four-dimensional [[differentiable manifold]], the Einstein tensor is the only [[tensor]]ial and [[divergence]]-free function of the <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}</math> and at most their first and second partial derivatives.<ref>{{Cite journal\n |last    = Lovelock\n |first   = D.\n |title   = The Einstein Tensor and Its Generalizations\n |journal = Journal of Mathematical Physics\n |year    = 1971\n |volume  = 12\n |issue   = 3\n |pages   = 498\u2013502\n |url     = http://jmp.aip.org/resource/1/jmapaq/v12/i3/p498_s1?isAuthorized=nof\n |archive-url = https://archive.is/20130224020351/http://jmp.aip.org/resource/1/jmapaq/v12/i3/p498_s1?isAuthorized=nof\n |url-status = dead\n |archive-date = 2013-02-24\n |bibcode = 1971JMP....12..498L\n |doi     = 10.1063/1.1665613\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Lovelock |first=D.\n |title=The Four\u2010Dimensionality of Space and the Einstein Tensor\n |journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics\n |year=1972 |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=874-876\n |url = https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1666069\n |doi = 10.1063/1.1666069\n |ref=\n|bibcode =  1972JMP....13..874L\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Lovelock |first=D.\n |title=The uniqueness of the Einstein field equations in a four-dimensional space\n |journal=Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis\n |year=1969 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=54\u201370\n |ref=\n|bibcode = 1969ArRMA..33...54L |doi = 10.1007/BF00248156 }}</ref><ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Farhoudi |first=M. \n |title=Lovelock Tensor as Generalized Einstein Tensor\n |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation\n |year=2009 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201329\n |arxiv=gr-qc/9510060\n |doi=10.1007/s10714-008-0658-9\n |ref=\n|bibcode = 2009GReGr..41..117F }}</ref><ref>\n{{Cite book\n | author=[[Wolfgang Rindler|Rindler, Wolfgang]] \n | title=Relativity: Special, General, and Cosmological\n | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n | year=2001 \n | isbn=978-0-19-850836-6\n | page = 299\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the [[Einstein field equation]] is not the only equation which satisfies the three conditions:<ref>{{Cite book\n | author=[[Bernard Schutz|Schutz, Bernard]]\n | title=A First Course in General Relativity\n | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n | edition=2\n | date=May 31, 2009\n | isbn=978-0-521-88705-2\n | page=[https://archive.org/details/firstcourseingen00bern_0/page/185 185]\n | url-access=registration\n | url=https://archive.org/details/firstcourseingen00bern_0/page/185\n }}</ref> \n# Resemble but generalize [[Gauss's law for gravity|Newton\u2013Poisson gravitational equation]]\n# Apply to all coordinate systems, and\n# Guarantee local covariant conservation of energy\u2013momentum for any metric tensor.\n\nMany alternative theories have been proposed, such as the [[Einstein\u2013Cartan theory]], that also satisfy the above conditions.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n* [[Contracted Bianchi identities]]\n* [[Vermeil's theorem]]\n* [[Mathematics of general relativity]]\n* [[General relativity resources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Ohanian\n  | first = Hans C.\n  |author2=Remo Ruffini\n  | title = Gravitation and Spacetime\n  | edition = Second\n  | publisher = [[W.

This set of small tools would then be used by the small hands to build and operate ten sets of one-sixteenth-scale hands and tools, and so forth, culminating in perhaps a billion tiny factories to achieve [[massively parallel]] operations. He uses the analogy of a [[pantograph]] as a way of scaling down items. This idea was anticipated in part, down to the microscale, by science fiction author [[Robert A.

[[Gravity]] would become less important, and [[Van der Waals force]]s such as surface tension would become more important. Feynman mentioned these scaling issues during his talk. Nobody has yet attempted to implement this thought experiment; some types of biological [[enzymes]] and enzyme complexes (especially [[ribosomes]]) function chemically in a way close to Feynman's vision.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11283358 |doi=10.1126/science.1060089 | volume=292 | issue=5518 | title=Crystal structure of the ribosome at 5.5 A resolution |date=May 2001 | journal=Science | pages=883\u201396  |vauthors=Yusupov MM, Yusupova GZ, Baucom A, etal |bibcode=2001Sci...292..883Y |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/de448d80f1020bd553aba6659215caa10254c101 }}</ref><ref>Xu, Q, et al, ''Statistical Analysis of Interface Similarity in Crystals of Homologous Proteins'', J.

The second challenge involved the possibility of scaling down letters small enough so as to be able to fit the entire ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' on the head of a pin, by writing the information from a book page on a surface 1/25,000 smaller in linear scale.

Eric Drexler]] later took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves, via computer control instead of control by a human operator, in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation|Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology]]''.\n\nAfter Feynman's death, scholars studying the historical development of [[nanotechnology]] have concluded that his role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was not highly rated by many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. Chris Toumey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of South Carolina, has reconstructed the history of the publication and republication of Feynman's talk, along with the record of citations to \"Plenty of Room\" in the scientific literature.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toumey |first1=Chris |title=Apostolic Succession |journal=Engineering & Science |volume=1 |issue=2005 |pages=16\u201323 |url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/706/2/Succession.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301163143/http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/706/2/Succession.pdf |archivedate=2019-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn Toumey's 2008 article, \"Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology\",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toumey |first1=Chris |title=Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology: A Text for a New Science |journal=Techn\u00e9 |date=2008 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=133\u2013168 |url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/pdf/toumey.pdf |accessdate=1 March 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522094726/https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/pdf/toumey.pdf |archivedate=2018-05-22}}</ref> he found 11 versions of the publication of \"Plenty of Room\", plus two instances of a closely related talk by Feynman, \"Infinitesimal Machinery\",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Feynman |first1=R. |title=Infinitesimal machinery |journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems |date=March 1993 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=4\u201314 |doi=10.1109/84.232589 |url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pister/290G/Papers/Feynman83.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127162657/https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pister/290G/Papers/Feynman83.pdf |archivedate=2019-01-27}}</ref> which Feynman called \"Plenty of Room, Revisited\" (published under the name \"Infinitesimal Machinery\").  Also in Toumey's references are videotapes of that second talk.  The journal ''[[Nature Nanotechnology]]'' dedicated an issue in 2009 to the subject.<ref>{{cite journal |title='Plenty of room' revisited |journal=[[Nature Nanotechnology]] |date=December 2009 |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=781 |doi=10.1038/nnano.2009.356 |pmid=19966817 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2009.356.pdf |accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Plenty of room revisited - Focus Issue |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |date=December 2009 |volume=4 |issue=12 |url=https://www.nature.com/collections/btvngkffdj |accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nToumey found that the published versions of Feynman's talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the Scanning Tunneling Microscope was invented in 1981.  Interest in \"Plenty of Room\" in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s.  This is probably because the term \"nanotechnology\" gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by Drexler in his 1986 book, [[Engines of Creation|''Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology'']], which cited Feynman, and in a cover article headlined \"Nanotechnology\", published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, [[Omni (magazine)|''OMNI'']].<ref>{{cite journal |first= Fred |last=Hapgood |date=November 1986|title= \"Nanotechnology\" / \"Tinytech\" | page=56 |journal=Omni}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=The promise that launched the field of nanotechnology|url=http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|publisher=Metamodern: The Trajectory of Technology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=15 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714075738/http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|archivedate=14 July 2011}}</ref>  The journal [[Nanotechnology (journal)|''Nanotechnology'']] was launched in 1989; the famous [[IBM (atoms)|Eigler-Schweizer experiment]], precisely manipulating 35 xenon atoms, was published in ''Nature'' in April 1990; and ''Science'' had a special issue on nanotechnology in November 1991.  These and other developments hint that the retroactive rediscovery of \"Plenty of Room\" gave nanotechnology a packaged history that provided an early date of December 1959, plus a connection to Richard Feynman.\n\nToumey's analysis also includes comments from scientists in nanotechnology who say that \"Plenty of Room\" did not influence their early work, and most of them had not read it until a later date.\n\nFeynman's stature as a Nobel laureate and as an important figure in 20th century science helped advocates of nanotechnology and provided a valuable intellectual link to the past.<ref name=Milburn/> More concretely, his stature and concept of atomically precise fabrication played a role in securing funding for nanotechnology research, illustrated by President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]'s January 2000 speech calling for a Federal program:\n\n{{quote|My budget supports a major new [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]], worth $500 million.

[[Gravity]] would become less important, and [[Van der Waals force]]s such as surface tension would become more important. Feynman mentioned these scaling issues during his talk. Nobody has yet attempted to implement this thought experiment; some types of biological [[enzymes]] and enzyme complexes (especially [[ribosomes]]) function chemically in a way close to Feynman's vision.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11283358 |doi=10.1126/science.1060089 | volume=292 | issue=5518 | title=Crystal structure of the ribosome at 5.5 A resolution |date=May 2001 | journal=Science | pages=883\u201396  |vauthors=Yusupov MM, Yusupova GZ, Baucom A, etal |bibcode=2001Sci...292..883Y |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/de448d80f1020bd553aba6659215caa10254c101 }}</ref><ref>Xu, Q, et al, ''Statistical Analysis of Interface Similarity in Crystals of Homologous Proteins'', J.

The first challenge involved the construction of a [[nanomotor|tiny motor]], which, to Feynman's surprise, was achieved by November 1960 by Caltech graduate, [[William McLellan (American electrical engineer)|William McLellan]], a meticulous craftsman, using conventional tools.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/207/1/themonth.pdf|title=The World's Smallest Motor|last=|first=|date=December 1960|work=Engineering and Science|access-date=2018-07-22|page=19}}</ref> The motor met the conditions, but did not advance the art. The second challenge involved the possibility of scaling down letters small enough so as to be able to fit the entire ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' on the head of a pin, by writing the information from a book page on a surface 1/25,000 smaller in linear scale.

Eric Drexler]] later took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves, via computer control instead of control by a human operator, in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation|Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology]]''.\n\nAfter Feynman's death, scholars studying the historical development of [[nanotechnology]] have concluded that his role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was not highly rated by many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. Chris Toumey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of South Carolina, has reconstructed the history of the publication and republication of Feynman's talk, along with the record of citations to \"Plenty of Room\" in the scientific literature.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toumey |first1=Chris |title=Apostolic Succession |journal=Engineering & Science |volume=1 |issue=2005 |pages=16\u201323 |url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/706/2/Succession.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301163143/http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/706/2/Succession.pdf |archivedate=2019-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn Toumey's 2008 article, \"Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology\",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toumey |first1=Chris |title=Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology: A Text for a New Science |journal=Techn\u00e9 |date=2008 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=133\u2013168 |url=https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/pdf/toumey.pdf |accessdate=1 March 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522094726/https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/SPT/v12n3/pdf/toumey.pdf |archivedate=2018-05-22}}</ref> he found 11 versions of the publication of \"Plenty of Room\", plus two instances of a closely related talk by Feynman, \"Infinitesimal Machinery\",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Feynman |first1=R. |title=Infinitesimal machinery |journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems |date=March 1993 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=4\u201314 |doi=10.1109/84.232589 |url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pister/290G/Papers/Feynman83.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127162657/https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pister/290G/Papers/Feynman83.pdf |archivedate=2019-01-27}}</ref> which Feynman called \"Plenty of Room, Revisited\" (published under the name \"Infinitesimal Machinery\").  Also in Toumey's references are videotapes of that second talk.  The journal ''[[Nature Nanotechnology]]'' dedicated an issue in 2009 to the subject.<ref>{{cite journal |title='Plenty of room' revisited |journal=[[Nature Nanotechnology]] |date=December 2009 |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=781 |doi=10.1038/nnano.2009.356 |pmid=19966817 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2009.356.pdf |accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Plenty of room revisited - Focus Issue |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |date=December 2009 |volume=4 |issue=12 |url=https://www.nature.com/collections/btvngkffdj |accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nToumey found that the published versions of Feynman's talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the Scanning Tunneling Microscope was invented in 1981.  Interest in \"Plenty of Room\" in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s.  This is probably because the term \"nanotechnology\" gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by Drexler in his 1986 book, [[Engines of Creation|''Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology'']], which cited Feynman, and in a cover article headlined \"Nanotechnology\", published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, [[Omni (magazine)|''OMNI'']].<ref>{{cite journal |first= Fred |last=Hapgood |date=November 1986|title= \"Nanotechnology\" / \"Tinytech\" | page=56 |journal=Omni}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=The promise that launched the field of nanotechnology|url=http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|publisher=Metamodern: The Trajectory of Technology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=15 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714075738/http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|archivedate=14 July 2011}}</ref>  The journal [[Nanotechnology (journal)|''Nanotechnology'']] was launched in 1989; the famous [[IBM (atoms)|Eigler-Schweizer experiment]], precisely manipulating 35 xenon atoms, was published in ''Nature'' in April 1990; and ''Science'' had a special issue on nanotechnology in November 1991.  These and other developments hint that the retroactive rediscovery of \"Plenty of Room\" gave nanotechnology a packaged history that provided an early date of December 1959, plus a connection to Richard Feynman.\n\nToumey's analysis also includes comments from scientists in nanotechnology who say that \"Plenty of Room\" did not influence their early work, and most of them had not read it until a later date.\n\nFeynman's stature as a Nobel laureate and as an important figure in 20th century science helped advocates of nanotechnology and provided a valuable intellectual link to the past.<ref name=Milburn/> More concretely, his stature and concept of atomically precise fabrication played a role in securing funding for nanotechnology research, illustrated by President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]'s January 2000 speech calling for a Federal program:\n\n{{quote|My budget supports a major new [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]], worth $500 million.

the [[Western Area]] of [[Sierra Leone]] and the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[Western Area Rural District]], which is one of the sixteen districts of Sierra Leone. Waterloo is located about twenty miles east of [[Freetown]]. Waterloo is the second largest city in the Western Area \nregion of Sierra Leone, after Freetown.<ref>[http://www.thepoint.gm/art%20&%20C,%20TT,%20E%20&%20W97.htm The Point \u2013 Waterloo]</ref> The city had a population of 34,079 in the 2004 census, and 45,000 as per a 2015 estimate.<ref>[http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/Wavescan/wavescan130428.html Wavescan \u2013 Waterloo]</ref><ref>[http://www.apctimes.com/archives/newsitem.php?id=2261 apctimes.com].</ref>Waterloo is part of [[Freetown]] [[metropolitan area]].\n\nWaterloo is a major urban [[transport hub]] and lies on the main highway linking Freetown to the country's [[Provinces of Sierra Leone|provinces]]. Waterloo is an entirely [[urban area]],  and lies 25 miles to [[Port Loko District]] entrance border line in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Province]].\n\nWaterloo is one of Sierra Leone's most ethnically diverse cities, as it is home to many of Sierra Leone's ethnic groups, with no single [[ethnic group]] forming  even 30% of the population .\n\nAlthough Waterloo is part of the larger Western Area Rural district council, the city has its own [[directly elected]] [[city council]] headed by a mayor. The current mayor of Waterloo is Dennis omojowo Browne of the [[All People's Congress]] who was elected in the 2018 Sierra Leone local elections.\n\n==History==\nWaterloo was founded in 1819 as a settlement for [[Sierra Leone Liberated African|liberated Africans]]. Incorporated into the parish system under the tutelage of the [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS), Waterloo was settled by soldiers from the second and fourth [[West India Regiment]] from [[Jamaica]] and [[Barbados]]. The town was named after the Anglo-Allied army victory over Napoleon Bonaparte in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in present-day [[Belgium]].\n\nThe ex-military men settled in \"Soja Town\" bordering King Street, an artery leading to King Yard which housed the police station, courthouse, and jailhouse. The settlers were later joined by several groups of Recaptives, whose integration into the village community was facilitated by Governor MacCarthy's insistence on education and religion via schools, personages and churches. Several Christian denominations, primarily of [[Anglican]], [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion|Countess of Huntingdon]], and [[Wesleyan]] persuasions established churches and schools throughout the fast-growing populace.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Mixed Commissions in [[Freetown]] in 1819 (primarily to set recaptured slaves free), the number of Recaptives in Freetown grew. This growth resulted in a corresponding increase in the Recaptives population in Waterloo. Unlike the original settlers from Jamaica and Barbados, the Recaptives had made minimal sustained contact with Western languages and cultures. In efforts to restore some lifestyle stability in their new environment, the Recaptives settled along ethnic or tribal lines. Thus, the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] settled in Aku Town, the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] in Ibo Town, the ex-military Recaptives in Soja Town, etc.\n\nThe community which emerged established social welfare institutions and secret societies such as [[Osusu]], Ojeh, Hunting, Geledeh, and Akanja as measures to perpetuate their culture, provide a framework for social stability, and increase their independence. With the inculcation of Christian values and Western education, and under the supervision of the village headman (who enforced the rule of law), Waterloo evolved as a stable economic, cultural, and socio-political centre.\n\nIn less than half a century since its inception, Waterloo emerged as an important economic hub buffering Sierra Leone's provincial capitals and the nation's capital. Throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries, the city continued to serve as a gateway to and from the hinterland and blossomed as a trading centre into which goods and services from Freetown and the Sierra Leone peninsula converged. Its economic prosperity coupled with its proximity to the city brought together diverse people from different parts of the nation.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town of Waterloo is located some 20 miles from [[Freetown]] at 8.33833 degree latitude, -13.0719 degree longitude at an elevation of 40 meters. With a population estimated at approximately 40,000. It is the second largest city in the [[Western Area]] and an important crossroad where roads connecting provincial capitals and the Sierra Leone peninsula to the nation's capital meet. The prosperity which reigned in Waterloo throughout the 19th and 20th centuries was shattered by the outbreak of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] in the 1990s, during which rebel soldiers pillaged and ravaged homes, schools, churches, offices, and government buildings, with many inhabitants fleeing the town.\n\n==People==\nIntermarriages between the newly arrived ex-servicemen from [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]] and the Africans liberated from slavery generously enriched elements of culture in the town. The language that resulted from the fusion of these cultures evolved into [[Krio language]], which retained its English base while absorbing other linguistic elements from a variety of African and European languages and dialects which is evident in words such as boku (beaucoup), encore (French); otutu, alakpa, joko (Yoruba); sabi, pikin (Jamaican Maroon Creole and Portuguese); kapu (Mende), etc.\n\nThe descendants of these repatriated soldiers and the liberated Africans formed a nucleus of the Krio society in Waterloo. In addition, the skills, knowledge and attitudes that the new settlers acquired facilitated their integration into the new settlement and provided the foundation for cultural adaptation and socio-economic reconstruction.\n\nProminent people from Waterloo include: Justice [[Christopher Okoro Cole|C.O. E. Cole]] (the first president of the Republic of Sierra Leone), [[Christian Cole (barrister)|Christian Cole]] (lawyer, the first black student at Oxford University), Bishop T. S. Johnson, (religion), Rev. Dr. David A. Shodeke (religion), Edward P. Nicol (education, organ music & religion), S.B.

The settlers were later joined by several groups of Recaptives, whose integration into the village community was facilitated by Governor MacCarthy's insistence on education and religion via schools, personages and churches. Several Christian denominations, primarily of [[Anglican]], [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion|Countess of Huntingdon]], and [[Wesleyan]] persuasions established churches and schools throughout the fast-growing populace.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Mixed Commissions in [[Freetown]] in 1819 (primarily to set recaptured slaves free), the number of Recaptives in Freetown grew. This growth resulted in a corresponding increase in the Recaptives population in Waterloo. Unlike the original settlers from Jamaica and Barbados, the Recaptives had made minimal sustained contact with Western languages and cultures. In efforts to restore some lifestyle stability in their new environment, the Recaptives settled along ethnic or tribal lines. Thus, the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] settled in Aku Town, the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] in Ibo Town, the ex-military Recaptives in Soja Town, etc.\n\nThe community which emerged established social welfare institutions and secret societies such as [[Osusu]], Ojeh, Hunting, Geledeh, and Akanja as measures to perpetuate their culture, provide a framework for social stability, and increase their independence. With the inculcation of Christian values and Western education, and under the supervision of the village headman (who enforced the rule of law), Waterloo evolved as a stable economic, cultural, and socio-political centre.\n\nIn less than half a century since its inception, Waterloo emerged as an important economic hub buffering Sierra Leone\u2019s provincial capitals and the nation\u2019s capital. Throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries, the city continued to serve as a gateway to and from the hinterland and blossomed as a trading centre into which goods and services from Freetown and the Sierra Leone peninsula converged. Its economic prosperity coupled with its proximity to the city brought together diverse people from different parts of the nation.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town of Waterloo is located some 20 miles from [[Freetown]] at 8.33833 degree latitude, -13.0719 degree longitude at an elevation of 40 meters. With a population estimated at approximately 40,000. It is the second largest city in the [[Western Area]] and an important crossroad where roads connecting provincial capitals and the Sierra Leone peninsula to the nation\u2019s capital meet. The prosperity which reigned in Waterloo throughout the 19th and 20th centuries was shattered by the outbreak of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] in the 1990s, during which rebel soldiers pillaged and ravaged homes, schools, churches, offices, and government buildings, with many inhabitants fleeing the town.\n\n==People==\nIntermarriages between the newly arrived ex-servicemen from [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]] and the Africans liberated from slavery generously enriched elements of culture in the town. The language that resulted from the fusion of these cultures evolved into [[Krio language]], which retained its English base while absorbing other linguistic elements from a variety of African and European languages and dialects which is evident in words such as boku (beaucoup), encore (French); otutu, alakpa, joko (Yoruba); sabi, pikin (Jamaican Maroon Creole and Portuguese); kapu (Mende), etc.\n\nThe descendants of these repatriated soldiers and the liberated Africans formed a nucleus of the Krio society in Waterloo. In addition, the skills, knowledge and attitudes that the new settlers acquired facilitated their integration into the new settlement and provided the foundation for cultural adaptation and socio-economic reconstruction.\n\nProminent people from Waterloo include: Justice [[Christopher Okoro Cole|C.O.
