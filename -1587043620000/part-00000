The book introduced the now-universal practice of listing ingredients and giving suggested cooking times for each recipe. It included the first recipes in English for [[Brussels sprout]]s and for [[spaghetti]]. It also contains the first recipe for what Acton called \"[[Christmas pudding]]\"; the dish was normally called plum pudding, recipes for which had appeared previously, although Acton was the first to put the name and recipe together.\n\nActon was born in 1799 in [[Sussex]]. She was raised in [[Suffolk]] where she ran a girls' [[boarding school]] before spending time in France. On her return to England in 1826 she published a collection of poetry and released her cookery book in 1845, aimed at [[middle class]] families. Written in an engaging prose, the book was well received by reviewers. It was reprinted within the year and several editions followed until 1918, when [[Longman]], the book's publisher, took the decision not to reprint. In 1857 Acton published ''[[The English Bread-Book for Domestic Use]]'', a more academic and studious work than ''Modern Cookery''. The work consisted of a history of bread-making in England, a study of European methods of baking and numerous recipes.\n\nIn the later years of its publication, ''Modern Cookery'' was eclipsed by the success of [[Isabella Beeton]]'s bestselling ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' (1861), which included several recipes [[plagiarised]] from Acton's work. Although ''Modern Cookery'' was not reprinted in full until 1994, the book has been admired by English cooks in the second part of the 20th century, and influenced many of them, including [[Elizabeth David]], [[Jane Grigson]], [[Delia Smith]] and [[Rick Stein]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Eliza Acton - advertisement for girls school.jpg|thumb|Advertisement placed by Acton in ''The Ipswich Journal'' for her [[boarding school]]]]\nEliza Acton was born on 17 April 1799 in [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]], [[Sussex]], and was [[baptised]] at her local [[parish church]] on 5 June. She was the eldest of six sisters and three brothers born to John Acton, a [[brewer]], and his wife Elizabeth, ''{{nee}}'' Mercer.{{sfn|Ray|2008}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=17}}{{efn|Although Acton had eight siblings, one died when only a few weeks old, probably of [[Baby colic|colic]].{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=31}}}} By 1800 the family had moved to [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], where they lived in a house adjoining the St. Peter's Brewery, where John took employment running Trotman, Halliday & Studd, the company that owned the brewery.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=19 and 21}}{{efn|Trotman, Halliday and Studd the three eponymous owners of the company were involved in other lines of business, and the brewery was an investment for their spare capital, which accounts for John's employment to run the business.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=26}}}} In 1811 Trotman died, and John was offered the opportunity to become the junior partner in the firm; he accepted and the business was renamed Studd, Halliday and Acton. Sheila Hardy, in her biography of Eliza, considers it likely that John would have borrowed heavily to buy himself into the business.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=32\u201334}}\n\nIn 1817 Acton, with a Miss Nicolson\u2014about whom no further information is known\u2014opened a \"[[boarding school]] for young ladies\" in [[Claydon, Suffolk|Claydon]], just outside Ipswich.{{sfn|Ray|2008}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=40\u201341}} In 1819 Acton left the school and opened another in September with her sisters, this time at nearby [[Great Bealings]]; the school moved {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} to [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]] in 1822 and had probably closed by 1825.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=45}}\n\nEarly in her life Acton spent some time in France\u2014either in Paris or the south of the country\u2014but it is not known when she left England; Hardy considers it likely that she travelled in 1823.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=16}} The food historian Elizabeth Ray, writing in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', states that Acton travelled abroad for the good of her health, because she had a weak constitution.{{sfn|Ray|2008}} It is possible that she was pregnant when she left for Paris and that she went abroad to give birth to an [[illegitimate]] daughter.{{sfn|Quayle|1978|p=165}}{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=159}}{{efn|Because of the stigma surrounding [[unintended pregnancies]] out of wedlock, it was common for middle-class women to move away from home to a relative's house, or abroad, to have the child, which was then adopted by a married relative.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=72\u201373}}}} The food writers Mary Aylett and Olive Ordish theorise that Acton's child was raised by Sarah, Eliza's sister. The two observe that \"there is no evidence for this, other than family tradition\".{{sfn|Aylett|Ordish|1965|pp=180\u2013181}} Hardy dismisses the theory, stating that Acton did not have a sister called Sarah, let alone one who was married (none of Acton's sisters were married); she also observes that she has found no baptismal or census record that would account for a child of the right age.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=72}} While in France Acton had an unhappy relationship with a French army officer;{{sfn|Ray|2008}} it is possible there was an engagement, but if so it was broken off. She returned to England, probably in 1826.{{sfn|Aylett|Ordish|1965|p=181}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=63}}\n\n===Poet===\n[[File:The Red House, Bordyke - geograph.org.uk - 2342303.jpg|thumb|Bordyke House (now Red House), near Tonbridge]]\nActon had been writing poetry since at least 1822, as she wrote that year on the bottom of one of her poems.{{efn|Only five of her existing poems are dated, the first in 1822, the last in May 1826.

The [[Commissioner of Bankruptcy]] ordered John to surrender himself to the Office of the Commissioners to disclose his wealth, but he fled to France.{{efn|The practice of bankrupts evading their creditors by going into exile in France was not uncommon; Nelson's mistress, [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], had done so in 1814.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=78}}}} In his absence his family moved into Bordyke House, near [[Tonbridge]], [[Kent]], where Elizabeth Acton, Eliza's mother, turned the large building into a boarding house for [[upper class]] guests, particularly for those who wanted to visit [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]] and enjoy the [[spa]] facilities there.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=77\u201382}} It is likely that Elizabeth left Bordyke House around 1841, although her daughter remained in residence.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=86 and 89}}\n\n===Cookery writer===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align    = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header = Illustrations from the 1845 edition of ''[[Modern Cookery for Private Families]]''\n| width    =\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Beef cuts - Acton, Modern Cookery, page 169.jpg\n| width1    = 170\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Information on ingredients, including cuts of beef\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Copper Fish or Ham Kettle Eliza Acton.jpg\n| width2    = 170\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Details of cooking equipment, including a copper kettle for ham or fish\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = Eliza Acton Orange Jellies 1845.jpg\n| width3    = 170\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Examples of presentation, including Oranges filled with Jelly\n}}\n{{further|Modern Cookery for Private Families}}\n\nAt some point\u2014Hardy considers 1835; Aylett and Ordish consider 1837\u2014Acton sent a further set of poems to Longman for publishing.

A chapter covers [[curries]] (and [[potted meat]]s), and gives recipes for Eastern \"[[chutney|chatneys]]\" (chutney), treating them as a naturalised Anglo-Indian dish, rather than of solely Indian origin, according to the professor of English literature Susan Zlotnick.{{sfn|Zlotnick|1996|pp=59\u201360}} The book contains the first recipe for [[brussels sprout]]s,{{sfn|Snodgrass|2004}} and the first use in an English cookery book of the word ''spaghetti''\u2014which she spelled ''sparghetti''.{{sfn|Walker|2013|p=57}}{{sfn|\"Spaghetti\".

With the inclusion of timings and ingredients, ''Modern Cookery'' differed from other cookery books, and was a development of Acton's own.{{sfn|Ray|2008}} Acton wrote that each recipe had been cooked and \"proved beneath our own roof and under our own personal inspection\".{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=x}} The food historian Sarah Freeman describes the cooking instructions Acton produced as being written \"so conscientiously, and with such gastronomic sensitivity, that&nbsp;... [''Modern Cookery''] was as much a work of art on food as it was functional\".{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=160}}\n\nThe reviews for ''Modern Cookery'' were positive,{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=100\u2013101}} and the critic from ''[[The Morning Post]]'' considered it \"unquestionably the most valuable compendium of the art that has yet been published\".{{sfn|\"Literature\", ''The Morning Post''}} The review in ''[[The Spectator]]'' stated that the order of the book was \"very natural\", while \"the methods are clearly described, and seem founded on chemical principles\";{{sfn|\"Literature Received\", ''The Spectator''}} the reviewer for the ''[[Kentish Gazette]]'' also commended the clarity of the instructions, and the inclusion of ingredients and timings.{{sfn|\"Modern Cookery\", ''Kentish Gazette''}} The unnamed critic for ''[[The Atlas (newspaper)|The Atlas]]'' described the layout for the recipes to be \"excellent\"{{sfn|\"Literary Memoranda\", ''The Atlas''}} and, in a positive review in ''The Exeter and Plymouth Gazette'', praise was given to \"the intelligibility of the instructions which are given\", which contrasted with other cookery books.{{sfn|\"Literature\", ''Woolmer's Exeter and Plymouth Gazette''}}\n\nA second edition of ''Modern Cookery'' was released in May 1845, containing corrections and updates; Longmans also released this version in the US, through the Philadelphia company of Lea & Blanchard.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=133}} The book sold well, and in June 1845 Longmans sent Acton \u00a367 11[[shilling|s]] 2d as her share of the profits.{{efn|\u00a367 11s 2d refers to the [[\u00a3sd|pre-decimal system]] used in Britain prior to February 1971.{{sfn|Freeman|2011}}}} In subsequent years she earned \u00a3162 in 1846 and \u00a3189 in 1847, when she was being paid half the profits; in 1849 she dropped to quarter of the profits and received \u00a383.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=137}}{{efn|\u00a367 in 1845 equates to approximately \u00a36,000 in 2018; \u00a3162 in 1846 equates to approximately \u00a314,400; \u00a3189 in 1847 equates to approximately \u00a315,850 and \u00a383 in 1849 equates to approximately \u00a37,650, according to calculations based on [[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|Consumer Price Index]] measure of inflation.{{inflation-fn|UK|df=yes}}}}\n\nSome time after ''Modern Cookery'' was published, Acton moved from Tonbridge to [[Hampstead]], north west London.

Hardy also sees in the poems an \"almost masculine intensity and depth of feeling\".{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=61\u201364}} O'Brien sees humour in some of Acton's poetry, and cites \"Come To My Grave\"\u2014a work about \"a mildly acerbic and witty potential revenant, musing on revenge\"\u2014as a parody of a love lyric with [[Gothic fiction|Gothic romantic]] overtones.{{sfn|O'Brien|2012|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nCome to my grave when I am gone,\nAnd bend a moment there alone;\nIt will not cost thee much of pain\nTo trample on my heart again\u2013\nOr, if it would, for ever stay\nFar distant from my mouldering clay:\nI would not wound thy breast to prove\nE'en its most deep, 'remorse of love.'\nThe grave should be a shrine of peace\nWhere all unkindly feelings cease;\u2013\nThough thou wilt calmly gaze on mine\nI would not live the hour to see,\nWhich doom'd my glance to rest on thine:\u2013\nThat moment's bitter agony\nWould bid the very life-blood start\nBack, and congeal around my heart!\u2013{{sfn|Acton|1826|pp=89\u201390}}\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Cookery===\n[[File:English Bread frontispiece 2.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''The English Bread Book'', 1857]]\nO'Brien sees that, through the high quality of Acton's prose, ''Modern Cookery'' is a unique cultural document.{{sfn|O'Brien|2012|p=45}} As the food writer [[Elizabeth David]] writes,\n\n<blockquote>[Acton's]&nbsp;... book was the final expression&nbsp;... of pre-Industrial England's taste in food and attitude to cookery. The dishes she describes and the ingredients which went into them would have been familiar to [[Jane Austen]] and [[Lord Byron]], to [[Fanny Burnley]] and [[Tobias Smollett]].{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxix}}</blockquote>\n\nMany of the dishes Acton describes belong, according to David, to the 18th century and, with increasing industrialisation and urbanisation of the 19th century, the staple foods described were already being replaced. David cites the example of [[Bird's Custard Powder]], launched in 1840, as an example of the radical changes being introduced to cooking.{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxix}} Acton adopted some of the changes in food science into the 1855 re-write of the book, including the developments of [[Justus von Liebig]]\u2014the developer of the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] brand beef [[stock cube]]\u2014and [[William Gregory (chemist)|William Gregory]], Liebig's pupil and translator.{{sfn|Lieffers|2012|p=946}}\n\nActon, in her preface to ''Modern Cookery'', writes that her \"first and best attention has been bestowed on&nbsp;... what are usually termed plain English dishes\" for her recipes,{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=31}} and Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, considers the book \"as English as&nbsp;... [its] eighteenth-century predecessors\".{{sfn|Driver|1983|p=6}} Elizabeth Ray observes that while Acton \"is basically a very English cook\", many of the recipes are labelled as French dishes, and foreign food is given its own chapter.{{sfn|Ray|1974|p=xix}} These are recipes from the cuisines of Indian, Syria, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Mauritius, Switzerland and the West Indies.{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=162}}{{sfn|Acton|1855|pp=605\u2013622}} Acton was willing to learn from foreign food cultures, and wrote \"Without adopting blindly foreign modes in anything merely because they ''are'' foreign, surely we should be wise to learn from other nations\".{{sfn|Acton|1855|p=xi}} Similarly, ''The English Bread Book'' was focused on British bread and, in her preface, Acton wrote \"Bread is a first necessity of life to the great mass of the English people; being in part the food of all\u2014the chief food of many\u2014and almost the sole food of many more.\"{{sfn|Acton|1857|p=v}} She devotes a whole chapter to the approach to bread and bread-making in France, Germany and Belgium, and the book contains recipes for German [[pumpernickel]], French [[baguette]]s, Italian [[polenta]] bread, Turkish rolls and Indian breads.{{sfn|Acton|1857|pp=29, 141, 161, 166, 168 and 177}}\n\nThe food historian Bob Ashley identifies that the strongest theme in ''Modern Cookery'' is economy in food, although this is also tempered by Acton's advice to reject dubious ingredients.{{sfn|Ashley|2004|p=158}}{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxviii}} In her preface to the book, Acton writes that \"It may be safely averred that good cookery is the best and truest economy, turning to full account every wholesome article of food, and converting into palatable meals what the ignorant either render uneatable or throw away in disdain\".{{sfn|Acton1855|p=viii}} She provides a recipe for \"Elegant Economist's Pudding\", which uses left-over Christmas pudding;{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=380}} when giving a recipe for \"Superlative Hare Soup\", she also provides one for \"A Less Expensive Hare Soup\".{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=31\u201332}}{{efn|The superlative soup includes a hare, ham, [[Mace (spice)|mace]] and half a [[imperial pint|pint]] (280 ml) of [[Port wine|port]]; ingredients for the less expensive version include beef, hare and a bunch of savoury herbs.{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=31\u201332}}}} The social historian [[John Burnett (historian)|John Burnet]] observes that although the dishes were supposedly aimed at middle-class families of modest income, the book contains recipes that include truffles in champagne, soles in cream and a pie of venison and hare.{{sfn|Burnett|1964}}{{efn|The recipes are, respectively: \"Truffles with Champagne, A La Serviette\" which, Acton writes, is so expensive as to only be served by the wealthy;{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=322}} \"Soles Stewed in Cream\"\u2014the recipe uses half to a pint (280\u2013570 ml) of \"as much sweet rich cream as will cover&nbsp;...

Examining a 100-word paragraph in ''Modern Cookery'' for instructions on beating egg whites for a sponge cake, David considers it superior to an eight-page piece on the same topic in the 1927 work ''[[La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange]]''.{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxviii}}\n\nThere is humour in Acton's work, particularly when reporting on a recipe going wrong.{{sfn|O'Brien|2012|pp=45\u201346}}{{sfn|Colquhoun|2008|p=281}}{{sfn|Hughes|2006|p=212}} Her recipe for Publisher's Pudding, which contains [[cognac]], [[macaroon]]s, cream and almonds, \"can scarcely be made ''too rich''\",{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=374}} while the Poor Author's Pudding is made with milk, bread, eggs and sugar, and is a more simple dish.{{sfn|Acton|1845|pp=407\u2013408}} Similarly, in her recipe for Superior Pine-Apple Marmalade, she writes that if the mixture is placed onto a direct heat it \"will often convert what would otherwise be excellent preserve, into a strange sort of compound, for which it is difficult to find a name\".{{sfn|Acton|1855|pp=513\u2013514}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Game cuts - Acton, Modern Cookery, page 271.jpg|thumb|Cuts of [[Game (hunting)|game]], from ''Modern Cookery'']]\n''Modern Cookery'' remained in print until 1918, when its popularity waned in the face of competition from other books and Longmans took the decision not to republish.{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxx}} Acton's works remained out of print until 1968 when a selection of her recipes was collected into ''The Best of Eliza Acton'', edited by Elizabeth Ray and including an introduction by Elizabeth David.

The book introduced the now-universal practice of listing ingredients and giving suggested cooking times for each recipe. It included the first recipes in English for [[Brussels sprout]]s and for [[spaghetti]]. It also contains the first recipe for what Acton called \"[[Christmas pudding]]\"; the dish was normally called plum pudding, recipes for which had appeared previously, although Acton was the first to put the name and recipe together.\n\nActon was born in 1799 in [[Sussex]]. She was raised in [[Suffolk]] where she ran a girls' [[boarding school]] before spending time in France. On her return to England in 1826 she published a collection of poetry and released her cookery book in 1845, aimed at [[middle class]] families. Written in an engaging prose, the book was well received by reviewers. It was reprinted within the year and several editions followed until 1918, when [[Longman]], the book's publisher, took the decision not to reprint. In 1857 Acton published ''[[The English Bread-Book for Domestic Use]]'', a more academic and studious work than ''Modern Cookery''. The work consisted of a history of bread-making in England, a study of European methods of baking and numerous recipes.\n\nIn the later years of its publication, ''Modern Cookery'' was eclipsed by the success of [[Isabella Beeton]]'s bestselling ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' (1861), which included several recipes [[plagiarised]] from Acton's work. Although ''Modern Cookery'' was not reprinted in full until 1994, the book has been admired by English cooks in the second part of the 20th century, and influenced many of them, including [[Elizabeth David]], [[Jane Grigson]], [[Delia Smith]] and [[Rick Stein]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Eliza Acton - advertisement for girls school.jpg|thumb|Advertisement placed by Acton in ''The Ipswich Journal'' for her [[boarding school]]]]\nEliza Acton was born on 17 April 1799 in [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]], [[Sussex]], and was [[baptised]] at her local [[parish church]] on 5 June. She was the eldest of six sisters and three brothers born to John Acton, a [[brewer]], and his wife Elizabeth, ''{{nee}}'' Mercer.{{sfn|Ray|2008}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=17}}{{efn|Although Acton had eight siblings, one died when only a few weeks old, probably of [[Baby colic|colic]].{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=31}}}} By 1800 the family had moved to [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], where they lived in a house adjoining the St. Peter's Brewery, where John took employment running Trotman, Halliday & Studd, the company that owned the brewery.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=19 and 21}}{{efn|Trotman, Halliday and Studd the three eponymous owners of the company were involved in other lines of business, and the brewery was an investment for their spare capital, which accounts for John's employment to run the business.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=26}}}} In 1811 Trotman died, and John was offered the opportunity to become the junior partner in the firm; he accepted and the business was renamed Studd, Halliday and Acton. Sheila Hardy, in her biography of Eliza, considers it likely that John would have borrowed heavily to buy himself into the business.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=32\u201334}}\n\nIn 1817 Acton, with a Miss Nicolson\u2014about whom no further information is known\u2014opened a \"[[boarding school]] for young ladies\" in [[Claydon, Suffolk|Claydon]], just outside Ipswich.{{sfn|Ray|2008}}{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=40\u201341}} In 1819 Acton left the school and opened another in September with her sisters, this time at nearby [[Great Bealings]]; the school moved {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} to [[Woodbridge, Suffolk|Woodbridge]] in 1822 and had probably closed by 1825.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=45}}\n\nEarly in her life Acton spent some time in France\u2014either in Paris or the south of the country\u2014but it is not known when she left England; Hardy considers it likely that she travelled in 1823.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|p=16}} The food historian Elizabeth Ray, writing in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', states that Acton travelled abroad for the good of her health, because she had a weak constitution.{{sfn|Ray|2008}} It is possible that she was pregnant when she left for Paris and that she went abroad to give birth to an [[illegitimate]] daughter.{{sfn|Quayle|1978|p=165}}{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=159}}{{efn|Because of the stigma surrounding [[unintended pregnancies]] out of wedlock, it was common for middle-class women to move away from home to a relative's house, or abroad, to have the child, which was then adopted by a married relative.{{sfn|Hardy|2011|pp=72\u201373}}}} The food writers Mary Aylett and Olive Ordish theorise that Acton's child was raised by Sarah, Eliza's sister.

David cites the example of [[Bird's Custard Powder]], launched in 1840, as an example of the radical changes being introduced to cooking.{{sfn|David|1974|p=xxix}} Acton adopted some of the changes in food science into the 1855 re-write of the book, including the developments of [[Justus von Liebig]]\u2014the developer of the [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]] brand beef [[stock cube]]\u2014and [[William Gregory (chemist)|William Gregory]], Liebig's pupil and translator.{{sfn|Lieffers|2012|p=946}}\n\nActon, in her preface to ''Modern Cookery'', writes that her \"first and best attention has been bestowed on&nbsp;... what are usually termed plain English dishes\" for her recipes,{{sfn|Acton|1845|p=31}} and Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, considers the book \"as English as&nbsp;...

Legislative authority is held by the [[Parliament of South Africa]]. Executive authority is vested in the [[President of South Africa]] who is head of state and head of government, and his Cabinet. The President is elected by the Parliament to serve a fixed term. South Africa's government differs greatly from those of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations. The national, provincial and local levels of government all have [[legislature|legislative]] and executive authority in their own spheres, and are defined in the South African [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] as \"distinctive, interdependent and interrelated\".\n\nOperating at both national and provincial levels (\"spheres\") are advisory bodies drawn from South Africa's traditional leaders. It is a stated intention in the Constitution that the country be run on a system of co-operative governance.\n\nThe national [[government]] is composed of three inter-connected branches:\n*Legislative: Parliament, consisting of the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] and the [[National Council of Provinces]]\n*Executive: The [[President of South Africa|President]], who is both [[Head of State]] and [[Head of Government]]\n*Judicial: The [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]], and the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]]\n\nAll body\u2019s of the South African government are subject to the rule of the Constitution, which is the Supreme law in South Africa.\n\n==Legislative==\n[[File:Houses of Parliament (Cape Town).jpg|thumb|The Houses of Parliament in Cape Town.]]\n{{main|Parliament of South Africa}}\nThe bicameral [[Parliament of South Africa]] makes up the [[legislative branch]] of the national government.  It consists of the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] (the [[lower house]]) and the [[National Council of Provinces]] (the [[upper house]]). The National Assembly consists of 400 members elected by popular vote using a system of [[party-list proportional representation]]. Half of the members are elected from parties' provincial lists and the other half from national lists.{{Vague|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe [[President of South Africa|President]] is elected by the members of the General Assembly. Upon election the President resigns as an MP and appoints a Cabinet of Ministers from among the members. Ministers however retain their parliamentary seats.\n\n== Executive==\n[[File:Uniegebou.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Union Buildings]], the seat of the national executive]]\n[[File:SA government income & expenses 2019.png|thumb|360x360px|South African national government budget for 2019/20.]]\nThe [[President of South Africa|President]], [[Deputy President of South Africa|Deputy President]] and the [[Ministers of the South African Government|Ministers]] make up the [[executive branch]] of the national government. Ministers are Members of Parliament who are appointed by the President to head the various departments of the national government. The president is elected by parliament from its members.\n\n== Judicial==\n{{main|Judiciary of South Africa}}\n\nThe third branch of the national government is an independent judiciary. The judicial branch interprets the laws, using as a basis the laws as enacted and explanatory statements made in the Legislature during the enactment. The legal system is based on [[Roman-Dutch law]] and [[English common law]] and accepts compulsory [[International Court of Justice|ICJ]] jurisdiction, with reservations. The constitution's bill of rights provides for due process including the right to a [[fair trial|fair]], [[public trial]] within a reasonable time.\n\n* [[Magistrates' Courts of South Africa|Magistrates' Courts]] \u2013 The court where civil cases involving less than R100 000,  cases.\n\n==Provincial government==\n{{main|Provincial governments of South Africa}}\nThe provincial governments of the nine [[provinces of South Africa]] have their own executive and legislative branches, but not separate judicial systems. In each province the legislative branch consists of a [[Provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislature]], varying in size from 30 to 80 members, which is elected through [[party-list proportional representation]]. The legislature elects one of its members as [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] to lead the executive branch, and the Premier appoints between five and ten members of the legislature as an [[Executive Council (South Africa)|executive council]] (a cabinet) to lead the various departments of the provincial government.\n\n==Local government==\n{{main|Municipalities of South Africa}}\n[[Local government]] in South Africa consists of '''municipalities''' of various types. The largest [[metropolitan area]]s are governed by [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan municipalities]], while the rest of the country<ref>With the exception of the [[Prince Edward Islands]], although they are for certain legal purposes deemed to fall within the [[City of Cape Town]].</ref> is divided into [[district municipality (South Africa)|district municipalities]], each of which consists of several [[local municipality (South Africa)|local municipalities]].

The national, provincial and local levels of government all have [[legislature|legislative]] and executive authority in their own spheres, and are defined in the South African [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] as \"distinctive, interdependent and interrelated\".\n\nOperating at both national and provincial levels (\"spheres\") are advisory bodies drawn from South Africa's traditional leaders. It is a stated intention in the Constitution that the country be run on a system of co-operative governance.\n\nThe national [[government]] is composed of three inter-connected branches:\n*Legislative: Parliament, consisting of the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] and the [[National Council of Provinces]]\n*Executive: The [[President of South Africa|President]], who is both [[Head of State]] and [[Head of Government]]\n*Judicial: The [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]], and the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]]\n\nAll bodies of the South African government are subject to the rule of the Constitution, which is the Supreme law in South Africa.\n\n==Legislative==\n[[File:Houses of Parliament (Cape Town).jpg|thumb|The Houses of Parliament in Cape Town.]]\n{{main|Parliament of South Africa}}\nThe bicameral [[Parliament of South Africa]] makes up the [[legislative branch]] of the national government.  It consists of the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] (the [[lower house]]) and the [[National Council of Provinces]] (the [[upper house]]). The National Assembly consists of 400 members elected by popular vote using a system of [[party-list proportional representation]]. Half of the members are elected from parties' provincial lists and the other half from national lists.{{Vague|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe [[President of South Africa|President]] is elected by the members of the General Assembly. Upon election the President resigns as an MP and appoints a Cabinet of Ministers from among the members. Ministers however retain their parliamentary seats.\n\n== Executive==\n[[File:Uniegebou.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Union Buildings]], the seat of the national executive]]\n[[File:SA government income & expenses 2019.png|thumb|360x360px|South African national government budget for 2019/20.]]\nThe [[President of South Africa|President]], [[Deputy President of South Africa|Deputy President]] and the [[Ministers of the South African Government|Ministers]] make up the [[executive branch]] of the national government. Ministers are Members of Parliament who are appointed by the President to head the various departments of the national government. The president is elected by parliament from its members.\n\n== Judicial==\n{{main|Judiciary of South Africa}}\n\nThe third branch of the national government is an independent judiciary. The judicial branch interprets the laws, using as a basis the laws as enacted and explanatory statements made in the Legislature during the enactment. The legal system is based on [[Roman-Dutch law]] and [[English common law]] and accepts compulsory [[International Court of Justice|ICJ]] jurisdiction, with reservations. The constitution's bill of rights provides for due process including the right to a [[fair trial|fair]], [[public trial]] within a reasonable time.\n\n* [[Magistrates' Courts of South Africa|Magistrates' Courts]] \u2013 The court where civil cases involving less than R100 000,  cases.\n\n==Provincial government==\n{{main|Provincial governments of South Africa}}\nThe provincial governments of the nine [[provinces of South Africa]] have their own executive and legislative branches, but not separate judicial systems. In each province the legislative branch consists of a [[Provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislature]], varying in size from 30 to 80 members, which is elected through [[party-list proportional representation]]. The legislature elects one of its members as [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] to lead the executive branch, and the Premier appoints between five and ten members of the legislature as an [[Executive Council (South Africa)|executive council]] (a cabinet) to lead the various departments of the provincial government.\n\n==Local government==\n{{main|Municipalities of South Africa}}\n[[Local government]] in South Africa consists of '''municipalities''' of various types. The largest [[metropolitan area]]s are governed by [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan municipalities]], while the rest of the country<ref>With the exception of the [[Prince Edward Islands]], although they are for certain legal purposes deemed to fall within the [[City of Cape Town]].</ref> is divided into [[district municipality (South Africa)|district municipalities]], each of which consists of several [[local municipality (South Africa)|local municipalities]]. After the [[South African municipal election, 2011|municipal election of 18 May 2011]] there were eight metropolitan municipalities, 44 district municipalities and 226 local municipalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaclubsouthafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2346:elections-110511&catid=44:developmentnews&Itemid=111 |title=Municipal elections: fact file |publisher=Media Club South Africa |date=11 May 2011 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nMunicipalities are governed by [[municipal council]]s which are elected every five years. The councils of metropolitan and local municipalities are elected by a system of [[mixed-member proportional representation]], while the councils of district municipalities are partly elected by proportional representation and partly appointed by the councils of the constituent local municipalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etu.org.za/toolbox/docs/localgov/webundrstdlocgov.html |title=Understanding Local Government |work=Community Organisers Toolbox |publisher=Education and Training Unit |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Opposition==\nIn each legislative body, the party or coalition of parties holding a majority of seats forms the government.

He and his family were imprisoned as part of the United States government's [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during [[World War II]], during which time he wrote editorials on his experiences of internment for his [[high school newspaper]]. Saijo went on to serve in the [[U.S. Army]] and study at the [[University of Southern California]]. Later he became associated with Beat Generation figures including [[Jack Kerouac]], with whom he wrote, traveled and became friends.\n\nSaijo's first solo collection of poetry, ''Outspeaks: A Rhapsody'', was published in 1997. A second collection, ''Woodrat Flat'', was published posthumously in 2015. Saijo was also the author of ''The Backpacker'' (1972), a short book on [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], and coauthor of ''Trip Trap'' (1972), a collection of [[haiku]] written with [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Lew Welch]]. Saijo died in 2011 in [[Hawaii]], where he had lived since the 1990s.\n\n==Early life and family==\nSaijo was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on February 4, 1926, to Satoru and Asano Miyata Saijo.<ref name=densho>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Albert%20Saijo/|title=Albert Saijo|first=Patricia|last=Wakida|work=[[Densho Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> His parents were ''[[Issei]]'', first-generation immigrants to the United States.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}}\n\nHis father, Satoru, was born in 1878 in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]], and immigrated to the U.S. in 1900.<ref name=densho/> Satoru was [[bilingual]] and had been educated in Japan and the United States; in the U.S. he worked as a domestic servant before attending Kenyon Theological Seminary at [[Kenyon College]] and Drew Theological Seminary at [[Drew University]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}} He was employed in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] by Albert Fairchild Holden, after whom he later named his second son, Albert Fairchild.<ref name=densho/> Satoru was active in the [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel]], and later started his own congregation, but left the church in the 1930s to become a poultry farmer.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}}\n\nSaijo's mother, Asano, was born in 1893 and arrived in the U.S. as a [[picture bride]] in 1921.<ref name=densho/> She was raised as a [[Buddhist]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}} In Los Angeles she taught Japanese, worked as a columnist for the Japanese newspapers ''[[Rafu Shimpo]]'' and ''Kashu Mainichi'', and participated in [[haiku]] poetry groups.<ref name=densho/>{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}} Saijo had an older brother, Gompers, born 1922, and a younger sister, Hisayo, born 1928.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}} The three children were raised bilingual.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}}\n\n==Internment and early writing==\n[[File:Heart Mountain Relocation Center, Heart Mountain, Wyoming. Albert Saijo, second semester editor of . . . - NARA - 537163.tif|thumb|Saijo (left) at [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center]] in 1943]]\nIn 1942, when Saijo was 15 years old, he and his family were removed from their California home and imprisoned at [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] Assembly Center, then transferred to [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center]], as part of the U.S. government's program of [[Japanese American internment]].<ref name=densho/><ref name=kam/> While at Heart Mountain Saijo attended high school and worked as a janitor.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=64}} In 1942, Saijo began to write for his [[high school newspaper]], the ''Heart Mountain Echoes''.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|pp=64\u201365}} His first feature article, entitled \"Me and December 7\", was published on the first anniversary of the 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], and addressed his memories of shock and disorientation surrounding the attack, and his fears that he would be treated differently by non-Japanese friends and teachers as a result.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=65}} The article also argued against the significance of race and expressed opposition to the [[Nazi]] theory of the [[master race]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|pp=65\u201366}} In his writing of this period, Saijo expressed a commitment to the United States as a [[melting pot]] and support for those who volunteered for the [[U.S. Armed Forces]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=66}} The historian Michael Masatsugu has argued that while Saijo did challenge the [[racial essentialist]] construction of Japanese Americans that was used to justify their internment, his arguments regarding the irrelevance of race and his call for Japanese Americans to [[cultural assimilation|assimilate]] were consistent with the approach of the [[War Relocation Authority]] (WRA).{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=66}} Masatsugu observes that this was not a coincidence: Saijo and other writers were supervised by WRA officials, and Masatsugu argues that this supervision was a form of surveillance and censorship.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=66}}\n\nSaijo's later editorials and features criticized the injustice of internment. These included \"Christmas, 1942\", which recounted his experience of his first Christmas at Heart Mountain.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|pp=67\u20138}} He was more explicit in a March 1943 editorial, in which he associated internment with imprisonment and suggested that it was driven by discrimination.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=68}} Later in 1943 the ''Echoes'', under Saijo's editorship, called on Japanese Americans to give their backing to [[Gordon Hirabayashi]]'s legal challenge to internment (see ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'').{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=68}}\n\nHe later remembered internment as an \"adventure\", but also as causing the break-up of his immediate family as he and his siblings began to spend more time with their peers.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=64}} Saijo was part of an early-leave program that commenced before the camps were closed; through a War Relocation Authority program he moved to [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], where he hoped to attend the [[University of Michigan]] but instead took a job in a cafeteria.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=69}}\n\nHe was eventually [[conscription in the United States|drafted]],{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=69}} and served in the [[100th Infantry Battalion (United States)|100th Battalion]] of the [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]].<ref name=advertiser>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Obituary: Albert Fairchild Saijo |url=http://obits.staradvertiser.com/2011/06/17/albert-fairchild-saijo/|work=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |publisher=|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}</ref> He trained in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]], [[Mississippi]], and served in Italy during the post-war occupation.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=69}} While serving he contracted [[tuberculosis]], which continued to trouble him for the following 20 years.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=69}}\n\nFunded by the [[G.I.

In his reading the poem concerns U.S. [[Orientalism]] and the burden imposed on people associated with \"a racialized Oriental [[spirituality]]\", but also points to the agency and complicity of the Asian-American subject.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|pp=59\u201360}} In Masatsugu's reading the poem represents the [[Bodhisattva]] \"as a spiritual laborer with obligations devoid of the sentimental attachments often associated with more exoticized representations of Buddhism or Asian spirituality.\"{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=59}} Masatsugu describes the poem as ironic and humorous; he reads it as an expression of disdain and resignation at the Bodhisattva's role. He observes that the poem's short sentences, separated by [[dash]]es, \"convey a sense of the accumulation of obligation in carrying out the vow\", and its rendering of the text in [[all caps]] \"both amplifies and flattens the prose, rendering the narrator's voice clear yet removed.\"{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=59}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nSaijo died in Volcano, Hawaii on June 2, 2011.

He and his family were imprisoned as part of the United States government's [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during [[World War II]], during which time he wrote editorials on his experiences of internment for his [[high school newspaper]]. Saijo went on to serve in the [[U.S. Army]] and study at the [[University of Southern California]]. Later he became associated with Beat Generation figures including [[Jack Kerouac]], with whom he wrote, traveled and became friends.\n\nSaijo's first solo collection of poetry, ''Outspeaks: A Rhapsody'', was published in 1997. A second collection, ''Woodrat Flat'', was published posthumously in 2015. Saijo was also the author of ''The Backpacker'' (1972), a short book on [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], and coauthor of ''Trip Trap'' (1972), a collection of [[haiku]] written with [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Lew Welch]]. Saijo died in 2011 in [[Hawaii]], where he had lived since the 1990s.\n\n==Early life and family==\nSaijo was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on February 4, 1926, to Satoru and Asano Miyata Saijo.<ref name=densho>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Albert%20Saijo/|title=Albert Saijo|first=Patricia|last=Wakida|work=[[Densho Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> His parents were ''[[Issei]]'', first-generation immigrants to the United States.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}}\n\nHis father, Satoru, was born in 1878 in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]], and immigrated to the U.S. in 1900.<ref name=densho/> Satoru was [[bilingual]] and had been educated in Japan and the United States; in the U.S. he worked as a domestic servant before attending Kenyon Theological Seminary at [[Kenyon College]] and Drew Theological Seminary at [[Drew University]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}} He was employed in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] by Albert Fairchild Holden, after whom he later named his second son, Albert Fairchild.<ref name=densho/> Satoru was active in the [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel]], and later started his own congregation, but left the church in the 1930s to become a poultry farmer.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}}\n\nSaijo's mother, Asano, was born in 1893 and arrived in the U.S. as a [[picture bride]] in 1921.<ref name=densho/> She was raised as a [[Buddhist]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}} In Los Angeles she taught Japanese, worked as a columnist for the Japanese newspapers ''[[Rafu Shimpo]]'' and ''Kashu Mainichi'', and participated in [[haiku]] poetry groups.<ref name=densho/>{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}} Saijo had an older brother, Gompers, born 1922, and a younger sister, Hisayo, born 1928.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}} The three children were raised bilingual.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=63}}\n\n==Internment and early writing==\n[[File:Heart Mountain Relocation Center, Heart Mountain, Wyoming. Albert Saijo, second semester editor of . . . - NARA - 537163.tif|thumb|Saijo (left) at [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center]] in 1943]]\nIn 1942, when Saijo was 15 years old, he and his family were removed from their California home and imprisoned at [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] Assembly Center, then transferred to [[Heart Mountain Relocation Center]], as part of the U.S. government's program of [[Japanese American internment]].<ref name=densho/><ref name=kam/> While at Heart Mountain Saijo attended high school and worked as a janitor.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=64}} In 1942, Saijo began to write for his [[high school newspaper]], the ''Heart Mountain Echoes''.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|pp=64\u201365}} His first feature article, entitled \"Me and December 7\", was published on the first anniversary of the 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], and addressed his memories of shock and disorientation surrounding the attack, and his fears that he would be treated differently by non-Japanese friends and teachers as a result.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=65}} The article also argued against the significance of race and expressed opposition to the [[Nazi]] theory of the [[master race]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|pp=65\u201366}} In his writing of this period, Saijo expressed a commitment to the United States as a [[melting pot]] and support for those who volunteered for the [[U.S. Armed Forces]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=66}} The historian Michael Masatsugu has argued that while Saijo did challenge the [[racial essentialist]] construction of Japanese Americans that was used to justify their internment, his arguments regarding the irrelevance of race and his call for Japanese Americans to [[cultural assimilation|assimilate]] were consistent with the approach of the [[War Relocation Authority]] (WRA).{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=66}} Masatsugu observes that this was not a coincidence: Saijo and other writers were supervised by WRA officials, and Masatsugu argues that this supervision was a form of surveillance and censorship.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=66}}\n\nSaijo's later editorials and features criticized the injustice of internment. These included \"Christmas, 1942\", which recounted his experience of his first Christmas at Heart Mountain.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|pp=67\u20138}} He was more explicit in a March 1943 editorial, in which he associated internment with imprisonment and suggested that it was driven by discrimination.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=68}} Later in 1943 the ''Echoes'', under Saijo's editorship, called on Japanese Americans to give their backing to [[Gordon Hirabayashi]]'s legal challenge to internment (see ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'').{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=68}}\n\nHe later remembered internment as an \"adventure\", but also as causing the break-up of his immediate family as he and his siblings began to spend more time with their peers.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=64}} Saijo was part of an early-leave program that commenced before the camps were closed; through a War Relocation Authority program he moved to [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], where he hoped to attend the [[University of Michigan]] but instead took a job in a cafeteria.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=69}}\n\nHe was eventually [[conscription in the United States|drafted]],{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=69}} and served in the [[100th Infantry Battalion (United States)|100th Battalion]] of the [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]].<ref name=advertiser>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Obituary: Albert Fairchild Saijo |url=http://obits.staradvertiser.com/2011/06/17/albert-fairchild-saijo/|work=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |publisher=|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}</ref> He trained in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]], [[Mississippi]], and served in Italy during the post-war occupation.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=69}} While serving he contracted [[tuberculosis]], which continued to trouble him for the following 20 years.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=69}}\n\nFunded by the [[G.I. Bill]], Saijo attended the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) and earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[International Relations]] with a [[minor (academic)|minor]] in Chinese.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=70}} He entered USC's [[graduate school|graduate program]] and began work on a thesis on the 1954 [[partition of Vietnam]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=70}} Throughout his life Saijo remained in contact with those he had met at Heart Mountain, and relied on these connections for employment, housing, and religious instruction.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=70}}\n\n==Relationship with the Beat Generation==\nIn around 1954 Saijo began to develop an interest in [[Zen Buddhism]], and in 1957 he left USC and moved to [[San Francisco]], where his interest in Zen and haiku brought him into contact with members of the [[Beat Generation]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|pp=70\u201371}} He worked at the [[YMCA]] in San Francisco's [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], and attended courses delivered there by David Hunter of the [[Human Potential Movement]], where he met [[Lew Welch]]; and through Welch he met [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Joanne Kyger]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Philip Whalen]] and others.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=71}} Saijo eventually moved in with Welch, Whalen, and others, and in 1959 led meditation at Snyder's [[zendo]] in [[Marin, California]].{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=71}} Masatsugu argues that Saijo's emergent interest in his Japanese heritage, including haiku and Zen, and his involvement in the Beat Generation, \"were enabled in part by the shift in racial discourse and the re-presentation of things Japanese in American society\",{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=70}} as fears of a \"[[Yellow Peril]]\" receded and Japan became a [[Cold War]] ally to the U.S.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=69}} At around this time Saijo also met [[Jack Kerouac]], who was already an established writer.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=71}}\n\nThe three men took a road trip together from San Francisco to New York, during which they bonded over haiku and Buddhism, and composed poems as they went.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=72}} On arriving in New York, they visited the apartment Ginsberg shared with [[Peter Orlovsky]], where they presented Ginsberg with a wooden cross stolen from a [[roadside memorial]] in Arizona. The three men then spent the night at Kerouac's mother's house in Northport, where Kerouac remained as Saijo and Welch returned west.<ref name=maher>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7PK83dQy9MC|title=Kerouac: His Life and Work|date=2007|accessdate=August 29, 2012|publisher=[[Taylor Trade Publications]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|first=Paul Jr.|last=Maher|authorlink=Paul Maher Jr.|pages=397\u2013398|isbn=158979690X}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|pages=[https://archive.org/details/icelebratemyself00morg/page/305 305\u2013306]|title=I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg|first=Bill|last=Morgan|authorlink=Bill Morgan (archivist)|date=2006|publisher=[[Viking Press]]|location=New York|isbn=0670037966|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/icelebratemyself00morg/page/305}}</ref> ''Trip Trap'' (1972){{sfn|Leong|2002|p=273}} is a collection of haiku by Saijo, Kerouac and Welch,{{sfn|Park|2008|p=103}} which describe their road trip, and invoke [[Gary Snyder]], who was then in Japan, as a kind of guiding spirit.<ref name=maher/> The collection was published after Kerouac and Welch's deaths, and included an introductory essay by Saijo, in which he recalled their trip as involving shared conversations and shared periods of quiet contemplation.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|pp=76\u201377}}\n\nSaijo and Kerouac became friends, bound by a shared [[wanderlust]] and appreciation of [[Zen Buddhism]], [[cool jazz]] and alcohol.<ref name=kam/> Saijo later was a minor character in Kerouac's ''[[Big Sur (novel)|Big Sur]]'', in which he takes the name \"George Baso\" and in Kerouac's depiction of the 1959 drive is described as \"the little Japanese [[Zen master]] [[wikt:hepcat|hepcat]] sitting crosslegged in the back of Dave's [Lew's] jeepster\".{{sfn|Park|2008|p=103}} Rob Wilson has argued that the character of Baso functions as a \"link to Zen Buddhism and the Orient for Kerouac, who found the West Coast U.S.A. closer in expansive sentiment and lyrical existence to Asia than to Europe\".{{sfn|Wilson|2001|p=135}} A photograph of Saijo, Kerouac and Welch composing a poem together in New York was featured in [[Fred McDarrah]]'s book ''The Beat Scene''.<ref>{{cite book|page=301|first=Ann|last=Charters|authorlink=Ann Charters|title=Kerouac: A Biography|date=1978|origyear=1974|publisher=[[Pan Books]]|location=London|isbn=0330253905}}</ref> Along with [[Shig Murao]], Saijo is one of only two Asian-American writers usually considered part of the Beat Generation.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1208725|title=Semiotic Shepherds: Gary Snyder, Frank O'Hara, and the Embodiment of an Urban Pastoral|date=Winter 1998|journal=[[Contemporary Literature (journal)|Contemporary Literature]]|volume=39|issue=4|page=541|first=Timothy C.|last=Gray|issn=0010-7484}}</ref>\n\n==''The Backpacker''==\nSaijo's ''The Backpacker'' (1972){{sfn|Leong|2002|p=273}} is a short book offering guidance on how [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]] can enter a spiritual [[psychedelic experience]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOEDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA39#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Can backpacking be a mystical trip?|first=William Jr.|last=Kemsley|journal=[[Backpacker (magazine)|Backpacker]]|page=43|date=1974|accessdate=August 29, 2012|issue=6}}</ref> A new edition featuring an expanded section on food was published in 1977.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kQQqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UCkEAAAAIBAJ&dq=albert-saijo&pg=6793%2C1032704|title=Why Not Tuck a Cookbook in Your Backpack?|date=July 13, 1977|accessdate=August 29, 2012|page=2|first=Joy|last=Krause|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]}}</ref> Reviewing ''The Backpacker'' in the hiking magazine ''[[Backpacker (magazine)|Backpacker]]'' in 1973, Denise Van Lear wrote that \"no other book so graciously portrays nature's lure as it relates to hikers.

In his reading the poem concerns U.S. [[Orientalism]] and the burden imposed on people associated with \"a racialized Oriental [[spirituality]]\", but also points to the agency and complicity of the Asian-American subject.{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|pp=59\u201360}} In Masatsugu's reading the poem represents the [[Bodhisattva]] \"as a spiritual laborer with obligations devoid of the sentimental attachments often associated with more exoticized representations of Buddhism or Asian spirituality.\"{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=59}} Masatsugu describes the poem as ironic and humorous; he reads it as an expression of disdain and resignation at the Bodhisattva's role. He observes that the poem's short sentences, separated by [[dash]]es, \"convey a sense of the accumulation of obligation in carrying out the vow\", and its rendering of the text in [[all caps]] \"both amplifies and flattens the prose, rendering the narrator's voice clear yet removed.\"{{sfn|Masatsugu|2013|p=59}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nSaijo died in Volcano, Hawaii on June 2, 2011.
