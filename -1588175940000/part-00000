The case was eventually dropped, as the search lacked a proper [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] by the police, and Charles soon returned to music.<ref name=cooper20/>\n\nIn the early 1960s, on the way from Louisiana to [[Oklahoma City]], Charles faced a near-death experience when the pilot of his plane lost visibility, as snow and his failure to use the defroster caused the windshield of the plane to become completely covered in ice. The pilot made a few circles in the air before he was finally able to see through a small part of the windshield and land the plane. Charles placed a spiritual interpretation on the event, claiming that \"something or someone which instruments cannot detect\" was responsible for creating the small opening in the ice on the windshield which enabled the pilot to land the plane safely.<ref name=Autobio/>\n\nThe 1962 album ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music Volume Two|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2]]'', helped to bring [[country music]] into the musical mainstream. Charles's version of the [[Don Gibson]] song \"[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]\" topped the Pop chart for five weeks, stayed at No. 1 on the R&B chart for ten weeks, and gave him his only number-one record in the UK. In 1962, he founded his record label, [[Tangerine Records (1963)|Tangerine]], which ABC-Paramount promoted and distributed.<ref name=Autobio/>{{rp|248}} <ref name=\"Lydon Riverhead\"/>{{rp|213\u201316}} He had major pop hits in 1963 with \"[[Busted (Harlan Howard song)|Busted]]\" (US No. 4) and ''[[Take These Chains from My Heart]]'' (US No. 8).<ref>{{cite web|title=Ray Charles Chart History|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/ray-charles/chart-history|website=Billboard|access-date=March 16, 2018 }}</ref> In 1964 Margie Hendricks was kicked out of The Raelettes after a big argument.\n\nIn 1964, Charles's career was halted once more after he was arrested for a third time for possession of heroin.<ref name=\":8\" /> He agreed to go to rehab to avoid jail time and eventually kicked his habit at a clinic in Los Angeles. After spending a year on parole, Charles reappeared in the charts in 1966 with a series of hits composed with [[Ashford & Simpson]] and [[Jo Armstead]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/the-brill-building-broadway-and-beyond-r-b-and-soul-singer-songwriter-joshie-armstead-2495380930.html|title=The Brill Building, Broadway, and Beyond: R&B and Soul Singer-songwriter Joshie Armstead|last=Wikane|first=Christian John|date=September 11, 2017|website=PopMatters|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> including the dance number \"[[I Don't Need No Doctor]]\" and \"[[Let's Go Get Stoned (R&B song)|Let's Go Get Stoned]]\", which became his first number-one R&B hit in several years. His cover version of \"[[Crying Time]]\", originally recorded by country singer Buck Owens, reached No. 6 on the pop chart and helped Charles win a Grammy Award the following March. In 1967, he had a top-twenty hit with another ballad, \"[[Here We Go Again (Ray Charles song)|Here We Go Again]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pianofiles.com/browse/artist/ray+charles|title=Ray Charles Profile |publisher=PianoFiles.com |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504021948/http://www.pianofiles.com/browse/artist/ray+charles|archivedate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1971\u20131983: Commercial decline===\n[[File:Nixon meeting with Ray Charles in the oval office - NARA - 194452.tif|thumb|right|250px|alt=Color photo of Nixon and Ray Charles|Charles meeting with President Richard Nixon, 1972 (photo by [[Oliver F. Atkins]])]]\n\nCharles's renewed chart success, however, proved to be short lived, and by the 1970s his music was rarely played on radio stations. The rise of [[psychedelic rock]] and harder forms of rock and R&B music had reduced Charles' radio appeal, as did his choosing to record pop standards and covers of contemporary rock and soul hits, since his earnings from owning his masters had taken away the motivation to write new material. Charles nonetheless continued to have an active recording career. Most of his recordings between 1968 and 1973 evoked strong reactions: people either liked them a lot or strongly disliked them.<ref name=\"boheme\"/> His 1972 album ''A Message from the People'' included his unique gospel-influenced version of \"[[America the Beautiful]]\" and a number of protest songs about poverty and civil rights. Charles was often criticized for his version of \"America the Beautiful\" because it was very drastically changed from the song's original version. On July 14, 1973, Margie Hendricks died at 38 years old from a heroin overdose, which meant that her son Charles Wayne Hendrix had to be raised by his sister.\n\nIn 1974, Charles left ABC Records and recorded several albums on his own label, Crossover Records. A 1975 recording of Stevie Wonder's hit \"[[Living for the City]]\" later helped Charles win another Grammy. In 1977, he reunited with Ahmet Ertegun and re-signed to Atlantic Records, for which he recorded the album ''[[True to Life (Ray Charles album)|True to Life]]'', remaining with his old label until 1980. However, the label had now begun to focus on rock acts, and some of their prominent soul artists, such as [[Aretha Franklin]], were starting to be neglected. In November 1977 he appeared as the host of the NBC television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77e.phtml|title=Ray Charles|publisher=SnlTranscripts.jt.org|date=November 12, 1977 |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1979, his version of \"Georgia on My Mind\" was proclaimed the [[state song]] of Georgia, and an emotional Charles performed the song on the floor of the state legislature.<ref name=\"boheme\"/> Although he had notably supported the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in the 1960s, Charles was criticized for performing at the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort in South Africa in 1981, during an international boycott protesting that country's [[apartheid]] policy. He later defended his choice of performing there after insisting that the audience of black and white fans would integrate while he was there.<ref name=\"boheme\"/>\n\n===1983\u20132004: Later years===\nIn 1983, Charles signed a contract with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. He recorded a string of country albums and had hit singles in duets with singers such as [[George Jones]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[Mickey Gilley]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]] (\"Precious Thing\") and his longtime friend [[Willie Nelson]], with whom he recorded \"[[Seven Spanish Angels]]\".\n\nIn 1985, Charles participated in the famous musical recording and video \"[[We Are the World]]\", a charity single recorded by the supergroup United Support of Artists (USA) for Africa.[[File:Ray Charles FIJM 2003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Charles at the 2003 [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], one of his last public performances]]\n\nBefore the release of his first album for Warner, ''Would You Believe'', Charles made a return to the R&B charts with a cover of the [[The Brothers Johnson|Brothers Johnson]]'s \"[[I'll Be Good to You]]\", a duet with his lifelong friend Quincy Jones and the singer [[Chaka Khan]], which hit No. one on the R&B chart in 1990 and won Charles and Khan a Grammy for their duet. Prior to this, Charles returned to the pop charts with \"[[Baby Grand]]\", a duet with the singer [[Billy Joel]]. In 1989, he recorded a cover of the [[Southern All Stars]]' \"Itoshi no Ellie\" for a Japanese TV advertisement for the [[Suntory]] brand, releasing it in Japan as \"Ellie My Love\", where it reached No.{{nbsp}}3 on its [[Oricon]] chart.<ref name=\"oricon89\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.wbs.ne.jp/~ms-db/oricon/oricon_single_89.htm |title=List of Best-Selling International Singles in Japan of 1989 |publisher=Oricon.

In 2003, Charles performed \"Georgia on My Mind\" and \"America the Beautiful\" at a televised annual banquet of electronic media journalists held in Washington, D.C. His final public appearance was on April 30, 2004, at the dedication of his music studio as a historic landmark in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"boheme\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Influence on music industry===\nCharles possessed one of the most recognizable voices in American music. In the words of musicologist [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]]:\n\n{{quote|Sinatra, and Bing Crosby before him, had been masters of words. Ray Charles is a master of sounds. His records disclose an extraordinary assortment of slurs, glides, turns, shrieks, wails, breaks, shouts, screams and hollers, all wonderfully controlled, disciplined by inspired musicianship, and harnessed to ingenious subtleties of harmony, dynamics and rhythm... It is either the singing of a man whose vocabulary is inadequate to express what is in his heart and mind or of one whose feelings are too intense for satisfactory verbal or conventionally melodic articulation. He can't tell it to you. He can't even sing it to you. He has to cry out to you, or shout to you, in tones eloquent of despair\u2014or exaltation. The voice alone, with little assistance from the text or the notated music, conveys the message.<ref>{{cite book|first= Henry|last= Pleasants|authorlink= Henry Pleasants (music critic)|date= 1974|title= The Great American Popular Singers|publisher= Simon and Schuster|location= New York City|isbn= 9780671216818|url= https://archive.org/details/greatamericanpop00pleas}}</ref>}}[[File:Nancy Reagan, Ray Charles, Ronald Reagan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Charles with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]], 1984]]\n\nPleasants continues, \"Ray Charles is usually described as a baritone, and his speaking voice would suggest as much, as would the difficulty he experiences in reaching and sustaining the baritone's high E and F in a popular ballad. But the voice undergoes some sort of transfiguration under stress, and in music of gospel or blues character he can and does sing for measures on end in the high tenor range of A, B flat, B, C and even C sharp and D, sometimes in full voice, sometimes in an ecstatic head voice, sometimes in falsetto. In falsetto he continues up to E and F above high C.

The Robinson family had informally adopted Aretha, and she took the surname Robinson. When she became pregnant by Bailey, incurring scandal, she left Greenville late in the summer of 1930 to be with family members in [[Albany, Georgia]] for the baby's birth, after which mother and child returned to Greenville. She and Mary Jane then shared in Ray's upbringing. He was deeply devoted to his mother and later recalled her perseverance, self-sufficiency, and pride as guiding lights in his life.

The pilot made a few circles in the air before he was finally able to see through a small part of the windshield and land the plane. Charles placed a spiritual interpretation on the event, claiming that \"something or someone which instruments cannot detect\" was responsible for creating the small opening in the ice on the windshield which enabled the pilot to land the plane safely.<ref name=Autobio/>\n\nThe 1962 album ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music Volume Two|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2]]'', helped to bring [[country music]] into the musical mainstream. Charles's version of the [[Don Gibson]] song \"[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]\" topped the Pop chart for five weeks, stayed at No. 1 on the R&B chart for ten weeks, and gave him his only number-one record in the UK.

The rise of [[psychedelic rock]] and harder forms of rock and R&B music had reduced Charles' radio appeal, as did his choosing to record pop standards and covers of contemporary rock and soul hits, since his earnings from owning his masters had taken away the motivation to write new material. Charles nonetheless continued to have an active recording career. Most of his recordings between 1968 and 1973 evoked strong reactions: people either liked them a lot or strongly disliked them.<ref name=\"boheme\"/> His 1972 album ''A Message from the People'' included his unique gospel-influenced version of \"[[America the Beautiful]]\" and a number of protest songs about poverty and civil rights. Charles was often criticized for his version of \"America the Beautiful\" because it was very drastically changed from the song's original version. On July 14, 1973, Margie Hendricks died at 38 years old from a heroin overdose, which meant that her son Charles Wayne Hendrix had to be raised by his sister.\n\nIn 1974, Charles left ABC Records and recorded several albums on his own label, Crossover Records. A 1975 recording of Stevie Wonder's hit \"[[Living for the City]]\" later helped Charles win another Grammy. In 1977, he reunited with Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn and re-signed to Atlantic Records, for which he recorded the album ''[[True to Life (Ray Charles album)|True to Life]]'', remaining with his old label until 1980. However, the label had now begun to focus on rock acts, and some of their prominent soul artists, such as [[Aretha Franklin]], were starting to be neglected. In November 1977 he appeared as the host of the NBC television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77e.phtml|title=Ray Charles|publisher=SnlTranscripts.jt.org|date=November 12, 1977 |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1979, his version of \"Georgia on My Mind\" was proclaimed the [[state song]] of Georgia, and an emotional Charles performed the song on the floor of the state legislature.<ref name=\"boheme\"/> Although he had notably supported the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in the 1960s, Charles was criticized for performing at the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort in South Africa in 1981, during an international boycott protesting that country's [[apartheid]] policy.

Prior to this, Charles returned to the pop charts with \"[[Baby Grand]]\", a duet with the singer [[Billy Joel]]. In 1989, he recorded a cover of the [[Southern All Stars]]' \"Itoshi no Ellie\" for a Japanese TV advertisement for the [[Suntory]] brand, releasing it in Japan as \"Ellie My Love\", where it reached No.{{nbsp}}3 on its [[Oricon]] chart.<ref name=\"oricon89\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.wbs.ne.jp/~ms-db/oricon/oricon_single_89.htm |title=List of Best-Selling International Singles in Japan of 1989 |publisher=Oricon.

His records disclose an extraordinary assortment of slurs, glides, turns, shrieks, wails, breaks, shouts, screams and hollers, all wonderfully controlled, disciplined by inspired musicianship, and harnessed to ingenious subtleties of harmony, dynamics and rhythm... It is either the singing of a man whose vocabulary is inadequate to express what is in his heart and mind or of one whose feelings are too intense for satisfactory verbal or conventionally melodic articulation. He can't tell it to you. He can't even sing it to you. He has to cry out to you, or shout to you, in tones eloquent of despair\u2014or exaltation.

But the voice undergoes some sort of transfiguration under stress, and in music of gospel or blues character he can and does sing for measures on end in the high tenor range of A, B flat, B, C and even C sharp and D, sometimes in full voice, sometimes in an ecstatic head voice, sometimes in falsetto.

The first members of staff, Irish Marists who came principally from the Marist College at [[Dundalk]], established a number of Marist colleges such as [[St Bede's College, Christchurch]] and [[St John's College, Hastings]] in New Zealand.\n\nPlans in 1931 envisaged the College moving to a more suitable site at [[Silverstream]] in the [[Hutt Valley, New Zealand|Hutt Valley]], but a high demand for education eventually led to a split: the original establishment continued and the boarding section moved to become [[St Patrick's College, Silverstream]], thus allowing room for the expansion of day-student numbers on the Cambridge Terrace site in central Wellington city.\n\nFrom that time the city college has borne the nickname \"St Pat's Town\". The two separate Colleges bearing the same name have developed a shared history, and a healthy rivalry; they share the St Patrick's College Old Boy's Association also. In 1979, St Patrick's College shifted from its Cambridge Terrace site to a new facility near [[Kilbirnie, New Zealand|Kilbirnie]] Green in Evans Bay.\n\n=== Sexual abuse of children ===\nIn 2018, the school stated to Radio New Zealand that it had \u201cno records of sex abuse committed by a priest against boys.\u201d<ref name=\"no records\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/375653/wellington-catholic-school-has-no-records-of-sex-abuse|title=Wellington Catholic school has no records of sex abuse|date=11 November 2018|website=RNZ|language=en-nz|access-date=23 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128082612/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/375653/wellington-catholic-school-has-no-records-of-sex-abuse|archive-date=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The same article mentions that \u201csome old boys of St Patrick's College Wellington have spoken of being molested by Father Fred (ed: Francis) Durning, who had top positions at the school in the 1940s, 1950s\" and in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"no records\"/> Father Durning left St Patrick's Silverstream in 1955 to become vice-rector at St Patrick's in Wellington.

The school fosters growth within a nurturing and sustaining environment in six facets: spiritual, academic, cultural, emotional, physical and social.\n\nDay by day this means involving all students in religious-education classes, retreats, liturgies and masses designed as participative opportunities for a lively [[faith]] suited to the young and involving them at all stages from preparation to celebration.\n\nThe Church establishes the resources of the College to assist parents as the \"first educators\" of their children. The Marist approach to education sees this partnership between the College and parents as fundamental.\n\nFoundational to this philosophy is the Catholic belief that God has created each person as a unique individual with a range of talents. Developing these gifts in the College community means that the school encourages each boy to do his best in every endeavour. The synthesis of this idea with the New Zealand and [[ANZAC spirit]] of attempting to achieve the best that can be in all circumstances is shared by many schools.\n\n== Sport==\n\nAside from the winter and summer tournament weeks, major events on the calendar include:\n\n* '''Old Boys' Cup''' \u2013 Annual Athletics competition against brother college St Patrick's Silverstream. St Pat's Town has won 6 of the last 7 years, including 2013.\n* '''1st XV Rugby Union season''' \u2013 Involving Rongotai College, Wellington College, Hato Paora College, St John's College, St Patrick's College Silverstream, Francis Douglas Memorial College and St Bedes College (2014 will be the first time the traditional has been played since the 1970s). The Traditional Rugby match between St Pat's Town and Wellington College is recognised as one of the great rivalries in New Zealand secondary school rugby, due to the fact that the two schools were, for nearly a century, in close proximity to each other by the Basin Reserve and also that it is one of the longest standing traditional fixtures in the country, having been played since 1885. As of 2010, Wellington College have won 75 matches, St Pat's have won 43 matches, with 8 matches being drawn. The first rugby game televised live in New Zealand was this traditional fixture, at Athletic Park on 27 June 1967, with St Pat's winning 9\u20138. The 100th match was drawn 3\u20133 in 1984.\n* '''St John's College Sports Exchange''' \u2013 Annual winter sports exchange between the two schools in rugby, basketball, soccer, hockey and badminton. The venue of this event alternates each year, i.e. In 2005 it was held at St Pat's and in 2006 it was held at St John's.\n* '''St Pat's Silverstream Sports Exchange''' \u2013 Annual winter sports exchange between the two schools in rugby, basketball, soccer, badminton, hockey and cross country running.

The first members of staff, Irish Marists who came principally from the Marist College at [[Dundalk]], established a number of Marist colleges such as [[St Bede's College, Christchurch]] and [[St John's College, Hastings]] in New Zealand.\n\nPlans in 1931 envisaged the College moving to a more suitable site at [[Silverstream]] in the [[Hutt Valley, New Zealand|Hutt Valley]], but a high demand for education eventually led to a split: the original establishment continued and the boarding section moved to become [[St Patrick's College, Silverstream]], thus allowing room for the expansion of day-student numbers on the Cambridge Terrace site in central Wellington city.\n\nFrom that time the city college has borne the nickname \"St Pat's Town\". The two separate Colleges bearing the same name have developed a shared history, and a healthy rivalry; they share the St Patrick's College Old Boy's Association also. In 1979, St Patrick's College shifted from its Cambridge Terrace site to a new facility near [[Kilbirnie, New Zealand|Kilbirnie]] Green in Evans Bay.\n\n=== Sexual abuse of children ===\nIn 2018, the school stated to Radio New Zealand that it had \u201cno records of sex abuse committed by a priest against boys.\u201d<ref name=\"no records\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/375653/wellington-catholic-school-has-no-records-of-sex-abuse|title=Wellington Catholic school has no records of sex abuse|date=11 November 2018|website=RNZ|language=en-nz|access-date=23 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128082612/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/375653/wellington-catholic-school-has-no-records-of-sex-abuse|archive-date=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The same article mentions that \u201csome old boys of St Patrick's College Wellington have spoken of being molested by Father Fred (ed: Francis) Durning, who had top positions at the school in the 1940s, 1950s\" and in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"no records\"/> Father Durning left St Patrick's Silverstream in 1955 to become vice-rector at St Patrick's in Wellington.

The school fosters growth within a nurturing and sustaining environment in six facets: spiritual, academic, cultural, emotional, physical and social.\n\nDay by day this means involving all students in religious-education classes, retreats, liturgies and masses designed as participative opportunities for a lively [[faith]] suited to the young and involving them at all stages from preparation to celebration.\n\nThe Church establishes the resources of the College to assist parents as the \"first educators\" of their children. The Marist approach to education sees this partnership between the College and parents as fundamental.\n\nFoundational to this philosophy is the Catholic belief that God has created each person as a unique individual with a range of talents. Developing these gifts in the College community means that the school encourages each boy to do his best in every endeavour. The synthesis of this idea with the New Zealand and [[ANZAC spirit]] of attempting to achieve the best that can be in all circumstances is shared by many schools.\n\n== Sport==\n\nAside from the winter and summer tournament weeks, major events on the calendar include:\n\n* '''Old Boys' Cup''' \u2013 Annual Athletics competition against brother college St Patrick's Silverstream. St Pat's Town has won 6 of the last 7 years, including 2013.\n* '''1st XV Rugby Union season''' \u2013 Involving Rongotai College, Wellington College, Hato Paora College, St John's College, St Patrick's College Silverstream, Francis Douglas Memorial College and St Bedes College (2014 will be the first time the traditional has been played since the 1970s). The Traditional Rugby match between St Pat's Town and Wellington College is recognised as one of the great rivalries in New Zealand secondary school rugby, due to the fact that the two schools were, for nearly a century, in close proximity to each other by the Basin Reserve and also that it is one of the longest standing traditional fixtures in the country, having been played since 1885. As of 2010, Wellington College have won 75 matches, St Pat's have won 43 matches, with 8 matches being drawn. The first rugby game televised live in New Zealand was this traditional fixture, at Athletic Park on 27 June 1967, with St Pat's winning 9\u20138. The 100th match was drawn 3\u20133 in 1984.\n* '''St John's College Sports Exchange''' \u2013 Annual winter sports exchange between the two schools in rugby, basketball, soccer, hockey and badminton. The venue of this event alternates each year, i.e. In 2005 it was held at St Pat's and in 2006 it was held at St John's.\n* '''St Pat's Silverstream Sports Exchange''' \u2013 Annual winter sports exchange between the two schools in rugby, basketball, soccer, badminton, hockey and cross country running.

The pitch measures 115 x 73 yards, and is aligned from east to west, which is considered unusual in English football, as most other pitches are orientated north to south to maximise natural sunlight.\n\nThe stadium has a current (reduced) capacity for 19,669 supporters,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2017/december/fratton-park-receives-capacity-boost/|title=Fratton Park Receives Capacity Boost - News - Portsmouth|publisher=}}</ref> although it has had a much larger maximum capacity for 58,000 supporters after the construction of the North Stand in 1935. Fratton Park's record attendance is 51,385, reached in an FA Cup quarter-final match vs Derby County, on 26 February 1949, in which Portsmouth won 2-1.\n\nThe four stands in Fratton Park are named '''The North Stand''' (north), '''The South Stand''' (south), '''The Milton End''' (east) and '''The Fratton End''' (west). Before the reconstruction of the 4,500 seat Fratton End in 1997, the previously unseated terraced stands of the old Fratton End, Lower North Terrace and Milton End were conjoined as one contiguous terrace for much of Fratton Park's twentieth century history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyNewsNow/status/1143111653493547008|title=Fratton Park June 1992 #Pompey #PompeyHistorypic.twitter.com/RnaLkps22l|last=PompeyNewsNow|date=2019-06-24|website=@PompeyNewsNow|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D90l_aGXUAEHdY3.jpg|title= Photo |website=pbs.twimg.com |format=PDF|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>\n\nAlong the northern touchline of the pitch is the two-tier North Stand, the largest stand in Fratton Park. The North Stand (including Lower North Terrace) was rebuilt and reopened as a full standing stand on 7 September 1935, increasing Fratton Park's maximum capacity to 58,000 supporters. However, the stadium capacity was reduced when 4,226 seats were fitted to the upper North Stand terrace in 1951. The lower North Terrace was also fitted with seats in 1996.  A new roof extension, supported by steel columns, was added from the front of the North Stand in 1997 and extended over the North Terrace (previously uncovered) to the pitch touchline. The North Stand turnstiles are accessed from Milton Lane. A gravel surfaced car park is a recent addition to the rear of the North Stand. The current 'Pompey Shop' merchandise shop and ticket office are located directly behind the North Stand car park in Anson Road.\n\nThe current South Stand has two tiers and was opened on 29 August 1925 and is currently the oldest stand in Fratton Park. It replaced an earlier and smaller South Stand (known as The Grand Stand) that existed on the site between 1899-1925.  The current 1925 South Stand was designed by the famed Scottish architect [[Archibald Leitch]]. The entrance to the South Stand is in Frogmore Road and is notable for its [[mock Tudor]] fa\u00e7ade, which is a remnant of a grand mock Tudor pavilion structure - with a clock tower - that previously occupied the site from 1905 before the current South Stand was built in 1925.\n\nAt the eastern end of Fratton Park is the Milton End, the smallest stand. The original Milton End was built in 1905 and was known as the Spion Kop, and was enlarged to its current size in 1949. Infamously, the Milton End was the only roofless stand in the [[Premier League]], before a roof was added before the 2007-08 season. The Milton End is used by visiting 'away' supporters, with turnstiles in an alleyway named Specks Lane, directly behind the Milton End.\n\nAt the western end of Fratton Park is the single tier 4,500 seat Fratton End, which first opened on 31 October 1997 and is the newest and tallest stand in Fratton Park. The Fratton End also had an official opening ceremony on 4 April 1998, timed to coincide with a home match that was one day before the centennial anniversary of Portsmouth F.C. on 5 April 1998.  The current Fratton End replaced an earlier two-tier Fratton End built in 1956, which had its upper tier demolished in 1986 for structural reasons. The remaining lower tier of the Fratton End was demolished eleven seasons later in 1997 to clear the land for the building of the current Fratton End stand in 1997. The Fratton End turnstiles are accessed from Frogmore Road.\n\n==Fratton Park name==\nContrary to popular belief, Fratton Park is actually named after '''[[Fratton railway station]]''' and not the geographic area of '''[[Fratton]]''' of Portsmouth.  Despite its Fratton Park name, Portsmouth's football ground is not located in the Fratton area of Portsmouth, instead it was built in '''[[Milton, Portsmouth|Milton]]''' in 1899. This peculiar misnaming has caused many of Portsmouth's residents and football fans to incorrectly assume that Fratton Park is located in Fratton, and not in Milton.\n\nFratton Park was built in 1899 on a plot of land in Milton, which at the time was a small rural village on the east side of [[Portsea Island]]. The land was originally a potato field near to Goldsmith Avenue and was purchased by Portsmouth FC from the Goldsmith farming family in the autumn of 1898. At the time, the late nineteenth century village of Milton still retained a remote, rural and isolated feeling from the busy town of Portsmouth, and had no railway station of its own, the nearest being located one mile to the west in Fratton, in the centre of [[Portsea Island]].\n\nFratton railway station - in a nineteenth century Victorian era before mass car ownership - was seen as key to attracting supporters to the early Portsmouth FC football ground in rural Milton. It was decided by the club that the \"Fratton\" part of the Fratton railway station name was to be \"borrowed\" for the naming of the football ground, to deliberately understate the actual one mile travel distance from Fratton railway station to the newly built \"Fratton Park\" football ground - in Milton.\n\nIronically, on 28 May 1912, Portsmouth town council bought the remaining Milton Farm land from the Goldsmith farming family, and on 11 July 1923 opened a public recreation park named ''Milton Park'' in Milton, only 127 metres to the east of Fratton Park on Priory Crescent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welcometoportsmouth.co.uk/milton%20park%20portsmouth.html|title=Milton Park, Portsmouth|website=welcometoportsmouth.co.uk|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref><ref>https://www.welcometoportsmouth.co.uk/milton%20park%20portsmouth.html</ref>\n\nThe east stand of Fratton Park is named the Milton End, a nod to the actual village of Milton that the football ground was built in.\n\nThe former nineteenth century villages of Milton and Fratton are now areas of the present-day city of Portsmouth, with their clear past boundaries now blurred by the modern-day urban sprawl of Portsmouth. However, Milton and Fratton still have defined boundaries, separated by the Portsmouth direct line railway and political voting ward boundaries.\n\nFratton Park  also retains a [[PO postcode area|PO4 8RA Milton postcode]] and not the PO1 area postcode of the neighbouring Fratton area and Portsmouth city centre.  If Fratton Park was located in the actual Fratton area of Portsmouth, its theoretical postcode would begin with PO1 5**.<ref>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUsESqiXgAI2UGc.jpg</ref> By coincidence, Fratton Park's PO4 8RA postcode contains the RA abbreviation of the late nineteenth century prescursor [[History of Portsmouth F.C.#Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Football Club (1894\u20131899, 1900\u20131901)|Royal Artillery Portsmouth FC]], sometimes known as RA Portsmouth.\n\n==Transport Links==\nFratton Park is closest to [[Fratton railway station]], roughly one mile to the west of the ground (about 10 minutes' walk away). Fratton railway station is located on the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] branch, which links to both [[London Waterloo station]] and [[London Victoria station]]<nowiki/>services from [[Southampton]], [[Bournemouth]], [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]] and [[Brighton]] also stop at Fratton railway station.\n\nBy road, Fratton Park is close to the [[A2030 road|A2030]] on the east coast of Portsea Island, and is named ''Velder Avenue'' at its southern end, and ''Eastern Road'' to its north. At the north ''Eastern Road'' end of the A2030, it intersects with the main [[A27 road|A27]] south coast trunk road at Farlington, Portsmouth. This A27 intersection has the [[M27 motorway]] to its west, and A27 to the east. Further to the east, the A27 links to the [[A3(M)]] to London and the [[M25 motorway]] which orbits London.\n\nBy sea, [[Portsmouth International Port]] has passenger ferry routes to the [[Channel Islands]], northern France, and northern Spain. From [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], there are foot passenger ferries to [[Gosport]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. A car ferry service to the Isle of Wight also operates from nearby [[Gunwharf Quays|Gunwharf]].\n\n== Fratton Park History ==\nOn 5 April 1898, Portsmouth Football Club was founded by a group of six local businessmen and sports enthusiasts at the office of [[Alderman]] John Edward Pink (a law solicitor) at number 12 High Street, Old Portsmouth. The men formed a syndicate to share their resources to form a professional football club and to buy a plot of land near Goldsmith Avenue, Milton to build a football ground. \"''The Portsmouth Football and Athletic Company''\" as it was originally known, had a capital of \u00a38,000 amongst its chairman and five directors.:\n\n* John Brickwood - the owner of Portsmouth-based 'Brickwoods Brewery' and first chairman of Portsmouth F.C. (John Brickwood was knighted in 1904, became [[Brickwood baronets|First Baronet Brickwood of Portsmouth]] in 1927)\n* Major Alfred H. Bone - a surveyor and architect.\n* John Peters  - a wine importer.\n* William Wiggington - a government contractor and former Royal Engineers Warrant Officer.\n* George Lewin Oliver - founder and headmaster of 'Oliver's [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|Preparatory School]]', 384-388 (Old) Commercial Road, Mile End, Portsmouth, which locally became known as 'Mile End School'.\n* Alderman John Edward Pink - a solicitor, based at 12 High Street, Old Portsmouth, employed by John Brickwood.\n\nA [[Blue Plaque|blue plaque]] on the wall of 12 High Street, Old Portsmouth (Alderman John E. Pink's office building) commemorates the founding on 5 April 1898.\n\nTheir prospectus, dated 14 May 1898, revealed that they proposed to \"''acquire a piece of land in Goldsmith Avenue up to \u00a31100 an acre''\" in Milton, to be used primarily for football and \"''for such outdoor games and exercises that were approved by the directors.''\" These were to include cycling, athletics and cricket matches. It was noted that the ground was to be built within convenient reach of Fratton railway station, and that it \"''was intended to drain and turf the land and erect the necessary buildings''\" for a further \u00a32,000, which would leave working capital of about \u00a31,000. It was hoped that football in Portsmouth would become as popular as it had become in northern England towns, where attendances were between 20,000 and 30,000. The existing team at Southampton was mentioned as well as an embryonic club at Brighton and it was hoped that \"''a healthy rivalry would spring up that would increase the popularity and income of the company''\".\n\n[[File:Fratton park porthsmouth ryde.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portsmouth v Ryde match at Fratton Park, 1899. North Terrace and Milton End]] \nWith the successful acquisition of four-and-a-half acres of land, bought from the Goldsmith family who owned Milton Farm (and from whom which 'Goldsmith Avenue' is named after), a general meeting of shareholders was then held on 2 September 1898 at the Sussex Hotel in Landport, Portsmouth. The Sussex Hotel was actually a large Brickwoods Brewery hostelry which stood directly opposite the Portsmouth Town Hall ''(it was demolished in 1972 when the present Guildhall Square was built)''.\n\nWeeks later, prominent [[Football Association]] representative [[William Pickford]] met with Portsmouth director [[George Lewin Oliver]] and inspected the land which would soon become a new football ground. The site was shortly to be turfed and fenced and it was hoped that football matches could be played there after Christmas of 1898. However, the land was still covered with a crop of potatoes which the directors were \"''anxious to sell''\", which they eventually did, further contributing to the funds of the newly formed company.\n \nOn 19 December 1898, the \"''Hampshire Telegraph''\" newspaper ran an advertisement inviting tenders \"''for the building of two stands: the first, 100 feet long with seven rows of seats on the south side and the second, terracing which stretched for 240 feet on the opposite, north side''\". The south side \"Grand Stand\" would be built in 1899 by local architect [[A. E. Cogswell|Arthur Cogswell]].<ref name=\"pompeyvoices.co.uk1\"/>\n\nEight months later, on 15 August 1899, more than 1,000 people, including some of the first Pompey players, attended the official opening day to see how the former Milton Farm potato field had been transformed into a modest football ground. The name of the new ground was revealed to be \"Fratton Park\", and was named after [[Fratton railway station]]. It is almost certain that the naming of Fratton Park, which is actually located in Milton, not [[Fratton]], was a slightly dishonest tactic of the early football club, to persuade potential new supporters that the new football ground was within an easy walking distance of an established railway station and tram connections. Fratton Park is actually a one-mile walk east of Fratton railway station and Fratton itself.\n\n[[Frank Brettell]] was the club's first team manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/LatestNews/news/Happy-Birthday-Pompey-4279.aspx|title=Happy Birthday Pompey|accessdate=5 April 2013|publisher=Portsmouth FC|date=5 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407180946/http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/LatestNews/news/Happy-Birthday-Pompey-4279.aspx|archivedate=7 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The club was successfully elected directly into the First Division  of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] in 1899, with their first league match being played away at [[Chatham Town F.C.|Chatham Town]] on 2 September 1899 (a 1\u20130 victory),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/footballclubs/history_of_portsmouth.html|title=Portsmouth FC History|accessdate=4 July 2008|publisher=Talk Football|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531064149/http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/footballclubs/history_of_portsmouth.html|archivedate=31 May 2010}}</ref> followed three days later by the first match at Fratton Park.\n\nThe first ever match at Fratton Park was a \"friendly\" against Southampton FC, and was played on the late afternoon of Wednesday 6 September 1899,<ref name=\"pompeyvoices.co.uk\"/> with goals from [[Dan Cunliffe]] (formerly with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]) and [[Harold Clarke (footballer)|Harold Clarke]] (formerly with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]).<ref>{{cite book |   author=Dave Juson & others |   title=Saints v Pompey \u2013 A history of unrelenting rivalry|   publisher=Hagiology Publishing|   year=2004|   isbn=0-9534474-5-6 |page=9}}</ref> The game was won by Portsmouth 2-0 and the first Fratton Park attendance was 4,141 with gate receipts of 141 pounds, 14 shillings and 9 pence<ref name=\"pompeyvoices.co.uk\"/> (approximately \u00a317,000 when adjusted to 2018 inflation).\n\nToday, some Portsmouth fans erroneously believe that Fratton Park is in Portsmouth's Fratton area, literally because of the stadium's name and also lacking the correct facts of Milton's long history. A political map of Portsmouth clearly defines the border between the Fratton and Milton areas with a line drawn from Fratton Bridge, along the [[Portsmouth Direct line]] railway up to St. Mary's Bridge. Fratton is located north of the line with Milton to the south. Fratton Park is south of the railway line, and thus is in Milton. This fact can also be proven further as Fratton Park has a Milton-based PO4 8RA postal code address (''Fratton and Portsmouth city centre has a \"PO1\" postal code''). A further fact is that Fratton Park lies within the Milton Ward electoral district for Portsmouth City Council and national level parliamentary elections.\n\n==Fratton Park Stands==\n===The South Stand===\n[[File:Fratton Park - South Stand.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Archibald Leitch's 1925 South Stand in February 2008]]\n'''Current capacity: 5,210''' (all seated, and excluding corporate seats)\n\nFratton Park's first South Stand, called The Grand Stand, was built in 1899 by Portsmouth-based architect [[A. E. Cogswell|Arthur Cogswell]]<ref name=\"pompeyvoices.co.uk1\"/> measuring \"''100 feet long with seven rows of seats on the south side''\" and was built on the southern side of the pitch. The Fratton Park pitch was surrounded by hooped metal fence railings.\n\nA strong wind blew off the roof of the South Stand in 1901. The roof was rebuilt for a then \u00a3120 (approx \u00a314,000 in 2018), but the new roof would only last until March 1916 - when it was blown off again!\n\nOn the early evening of 16 March 1916, the entire roof of the South Stand was blown off again by \"a great hurricane\". Houses surrounding Fratton Park in Carisbrooke Road and Ruskin Avenue were hit by the South Stand roof and suffered extensive damage.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/505c9a7487 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102072902/http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/505c9a7487 |archive-date=2 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1925, because of overcrowding of the original \"''one-thousand''\" seat Grand Stand and revenue lost to \"''better class supporters unable to obtain a seat''\", work on a new and larger South Stand began on 17 June 1925 and was completed just ten weeks later at a cost of \u00a320,000 (approximately \u00a31.1 million in 2018). The new South Stand was designed by renowned football architect Archibald Leitch. and was opened by the then Football League President, [[John McKenna#Other Historical Information|John McKenna]] on 29 August 1925, just before the kickoff before a home match against Middlesbrough.<ref name=\"pompeyvoices.co.uk1\"/> Leitch's South Stand was built with an all wooden upper section with flip-turn seats in the central section, with wooden benches at the west and eastern ends. A lower terrace 'paddock' standing section below pitch level was also built. The South Stand also featured new players dressing rooms previously located in the Fratton Park pavilion. A \"tunnel\" built directly from within the South Stand dressing rooms lead to the pitch at the halfway line point. As the new South Stand was much larger than the original, the Fratton Park pitch was reduced in width from 77 yards to 73 yards.\n\nBecause of the new South Stand, sadly most of the eastern side of Arthur Cogwell's original mock Tudor pavilion, including its clock tower and spectator gallery were removed or absorbed into the new South Stand's footprint.  The now famous mock Tudor \"Main Entrance\" to Fratton Park in Frogmore Road is now all that remains visible of the exterior of the original pavilion today.\n\nFloodlights were fitted to the roof ends of both the South Stand and North Stand in 1956.  On 22 February 1956, Fratton Park played host to the very first Football League First Division match under floodlights, in which Newcastle United defeated Portsmouth 0-2.<ref name=\"football league official site\">{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10794,00.html|title=The History Of The Football League|publisher=The Football League|accessdate=2007-02-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211234251/http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10794%2C00.html|archivedate=2007-02-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> These floodlights became obsolete by the 1960s and were replaced by four pylon tower floodlights built in the four corners of Fratton Park in 1962.\n\nDuring 1983, when pitch invasions by supporters were commonplace, perimeter fences were built around the entire Fratton Park pitch.\n\nIn the summer of 1988, new Portsmouth F.C. chairman Jim Gregory invested new money into the club, the South and North stands were both refurbished with new white exterior walls and azure blue metal roofs.  The condemned upper tier of the Fratton End was also demolished.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEI23wYBssQ|title=A Decade of Pompey 1982 1992|last=Warren Moyle|date=27 December 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 [[Hillsborough Disaster]], Portsmouth F.C. removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the [[1989\u201390 Football League Second Division|1989\u201390 season]], except at the Milton End to separate away supporters,<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> although these too were removed for the following 1990-91 season after the [[Taylor Report]] was published in January 1990.\n\nDuring the summer of 1996, the South Stand (and all other stands) became all seated, with new plastic seats replacing older wooden ones in the upper section. The South Stand's lower paddock terraces were reprofiled and seats were installed.\n\nIn 2007, under the new ownership of Russian-French-Israeli businessman [[Alexandre Gaydamak]], the South Stand was controversially retrofitted with three additional rows of seats built immediately in front of the upper section of the stand, building over - and concealing - the original and distinctive Archibald Leitch 'X' trusses that were an eye-catching feature of the South Stand's original design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=JGN6B1MOT2000|title=07/00690/FUL {{!}} Construction of extension to upper tier of south stand to form additional 370 seats and TV gantry {{!}} Fratton Park Frogmore Road Southsea Hampshire PO4 8RA|website=publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> The additional 370 seats also narrowed the field of vision for supporters who sat beneath them in the lower South Stand.\n\nGaydamak also completely 'modernised' the Portsmouth FC boardroom within the South Stand. A set of fourteen antique oak chairs and a five-leaf table were literally thrown out into a rubbish skip during the renovations.  The chairs have the design of a ship's wheel on their backs and had dark navy-blue velvet upholstery. The chairs had originally been made for a wardroom on the Royal Navy's first iron-clad warship {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}, which was built in the 1860s. They had been gifted by the [[Royal Navy]] to Portsmouth FC for more than 70 years. During the Second World War, the chairs were moved to a Solent fort, where [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Field Marshal Montgomery]] are said to have sat on them to plot the downfall of the Germans. An anonymous builder who had been working at Fratton Park for the 2006 renovations decided to 'rescue' them and stored them for safe keeping. The builder says he plans to give the chairs and table back to Portsmouth FC when the current owners had 'changed their taste'.\n\nThe South Stand also contains the player's dressing rooms which are accessed via a pitchside 'tunnel' midway along the South Stand at the 'halfway line' point of the pitch. At pitch level, the South Stand also has dedicated seating areas for both 'Home' and 'Away' football teams and their associated staff.

The stand was similar in appearance to the Grand Stand on the opposite south side of the pitch. The stand was widened during the next two decades and with the addition of an enlarged column-supported canopy covering the North Terrace by around 1930-31.\n\nUsing money from the June 1934 sale of defender [[Jimmy Allen (footballer, born 1909)|Jimmy Allen]] and money from the 1934 FA Cup Final, Portsmouth F.C. announced at Christmas 1934 that the North Terrace was to be rebuilt with a much larger stand, increasing the ground capacity to more than 58,000, with 30,000 under roof.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/d77e243589 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102072840/http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/d77e243589 |archive-date=2 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:2017-01-16_Portsmouth_FC,_Visiting_supporters_gate,_Milton_End,_Fratton_Park,_Portsmouth_(2).JPG|thumb|right|250px|The North Stand and the original Milton Lane. January 2017]] \nOn 7 September 1935 the new North Stand was opened by John McKenna, who had also opened Fratton Park's new South Stand ten years earlier.  The official opening ceremony took place over loudspeakers from the directors box of the South Stand just before kickoff of the game against visitors [[Aston Villa]], ironically captained by former Portsmouth defender Jimmy Allen!<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The new \"Jimmy Allen Stand\" as it was unofficially nicknamed, contained a new upper tier standing terrace under its roof.  The whole stand then became known as 'The North Stand'.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe North Stand is an irregular shaped stand at its western end because the North Stand, if built \"straight\" would have overlapped Milton Lane (nicknamed \"Dogshit Alley\"), a public footpath which linked the village of Milton, to the neighbouring districts of Fratton and Kingston. Instead of purchasing additional land to 'straighten' Milton Lane and to build a uniformly straight North Stand, Portsmouth FC instead chose to build the new North Stand within the existing Fratton Park footprint. This has resulted in the North Stand looking oddly angled and crooked at its western end since 1935.\n\nIn 1951, 4,226 seats were fitted onto the upper tier standing terrace of the North Stand. The Lower North Terrace was kept for standing, until 1996.\n\nDuring 1983, when pitch invasions by supporters were commonplace, perimeter fences were built around the entire Fratton Park pitch.\n\nIn the summer of 1988, new Portsmouth F.C. chairman Jim Gregory invested new money into the club, the South and North stands were both refurbished with new white exterior walls and azure blue metal roofs.  The condemned upper tier of the Fratton End was also demolished.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 Hillsborough Disaster, Portsmouth F.C. removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the 1989\u201390 season, except at the Milton End to separate away supporters,<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> although these too were removed for the following 1990-91 season after the Taylor Report was published in January 1990.\n\nDuring the summer of 1996, the North Stand (and all other stands) became all seated with modern blue plastic seats replacing the old wooden ones in the upper tier of North Stand. The Lower North Terrace of the North Stand was fitted with seats too, as part of the Taylor Report recommendations.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, a new North Stand roof extension was built to shelter the exposed lower North supporters from rain. At the same time, a new Fratton End stand was built, which first opened on 31 October 1997.\n\n[[File:2017-01-16_Portsmouth_FC,_North_Stand,_Fratton_Park,_Portsmouth_(1).JPG|thumb|right|250px|The North Stand and car park. January 2017]]\nIn 2015, a new shingle surfaced main car park for Portsmouth FC was laid and opened behind the North Stand. This additional land, formerly part of a neighbouring industrial estate, had been purchased by Portsmouth FC during the early 2000s. Most of the original 'Milton Lane' footpath has now been absorbed into the new car park, meaning that a newer 'Milton Lane' footpath has been built along the new car park's northern boundary.\n\nOn Saturday 17 December 2016, [[Pompey Supporters Trust|The Pompey Supporters Trust]] unveiled the 'Wall Of Fame' plaques to the rear wall of the North Stand,<ref>{{cite web|title=Shareholder Wall Of Fame Unveiling - 17th December 12pm|url=http://www.pompeytrust.com/news/shareholder-wall-of-fame-unveiling--17th-december-12pm|publisher=pompeytrust.com|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref> featuring the names of all the 2300 PST shareholders who helped save Portsmouth FC from liquidation by the [[High Court of Justice|High Court Of Justice]] on 10 April 2013.\n\nOn Monday 6 April 2020 - during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 coronavirus]] lockdown - Portsmouth FC announced that 'substantial' and 'essential works' to the North Stand had begun, which would involve the replacement of the roof, external cladding and beams.

When Fratton Park first opened on 15 August 1899, no stands or terracing existed yet at the Milton and Fratton ends. Instead, a thousand supporters could sit in relative comfort in the roofed Grand Stand on the south side of the pitch, or stand on the banked open air North Terrace on the north side. Alternatively, supporters could also stand on flat open ground behind the two opposite goal lines at each 'end'.\n\nIn 1905, the sight lines for supporters at the east end of Fratton Park were improved by the construction of an open air solid earthbank terrace, covered with wooden plank steps over layers of cinders and compacted top soil.  The new east end terrace initially became known as the [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Spion Kop]], a colloquial British nickname for an open air earthbank terrace that resembled [[Spion Kop (mountain)|Spion Kop hill]] near Ladysmith, South Africa, a 1900 battle location during the [[Second Boer War]].  The Spion Kop was joined to the North Terrace's eastern end with a connecting corner terrace, known as 'The Milton Corner' which later also became known as 'The Boilermakers Hump'.\n\nIn 1928 the Spion Kop (Milton End) was reprofiled with concrete terracing, bringing the capacity of Fratton Park up to 40,000.\n\nDuring October 1948, repairs to the uneven broken rear gangway of the Spion Kop took place to make it safe, using brick rubble surfaced with a top layer of ashes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyHistory/status/1048938671427211264|title=#OTD1948 The lateral gangway across the top of the Milton end terrace is to be built up so that it is level with the top step of the terracing. This will involve filling in the gangway with several tons of brick rubble and levelling it off with ashes. #PompeyChampsOfEngland|date=7 October 2018}}</ref>  A new perimeter wall with a handrail was also built at the top of the stand to stop supporters falling from the top into the Specks Lane alleyway below.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyHistory/status/1048939159858110465|title=#OTD1948 The eastern edge of the Milton end's lateral gangway will be protected by a small wall, mounted with a handrail to prevent people being pushed down the bank towards Fratton Park's boundary with Specks Lane. #PompeyChampsOfEngland|date=7 October 2018}}</ref> A new stairwell leading up from the northeast corner turnstiles behind the Boilermakers Hump, was built, with a shallower incline than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyHistory/status/1048938226734518272|title=#OTD1948 The stairway leading from the turnstiles in the north-east corner of Fratton Park up to Spion Kop are being rebuilt to provide steps that have less of an incline than has previously been the case. #PompeyChampsOfEngland|date=7 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949 the height of the Spion Kop was raised to the same level as the north-east corner (Milton Corner or Boilermakers Hump), with its terraces fully resurfaced with concrete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyHistory/status/1154677819823284229|title=#OTD1949 Major improvements to Fratton Park will be completed before the start of the new season.

The \"moats\" were a recommendation by the then Minister of Sport and Recreation, [[Denis Howell]].  The \"moats\" were deep trenches with thick concrete walls, dug behind both goals at the Milton End and Fratton End stands. The term \"moat\" is a little misleading, as they were not designed to be filled with water.\n\nDuring 1983, when pitch invasions by supporters were commonplace, perimeter fences were built around the entire Fratton Park pitch.\n\nOn 12 March 1983, during Portsmouth's promotion chase to Division One, visiting rival Cardiff City fans - also chasing promotion - climbed the large scoreboard at the back of the Milton End terrace and stole the hands from the Milton End clock.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-fans-great-time-pompey-2175570|title=City fans had great time at Pompey|first=Terry|last=Phillips|date=9 May 2008|publisher=}}</ref> Portsmouth eventually won the Division Two championship, with Cardiff City finishing as runners-up.\n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 Hillsborough Disaster, Portsmouth F.C. removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the 1989\u201390 season, except at the Milton End to separate away supporters,<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> although these too were removed for the following 1990-91 season after the Taylor Report was published in January 1990. However. the Milton End moat and wall have been retained to present day, with additional emergency exits retrofitted in.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Fratton Park became an all-seater stadium. The Milton End terrace was reprofiled and blue plastic seats were installed.\n\nDuring the late 20th and early 21st centuries, various television companies erected a series of temporary elevated miniature television studio boxes on scaffold pylons at the centre rear section of the Milton End where the scoreboard and stadium clock had previously been. This continued up until 2007 when the Milton End received a roof for the first time, which also prevented the continued use of temporary studio boxes on the Milton End.\n\nIn 2007, a roof was added over the Milton End following complaints to the Premier League by 'Away' supporters not accustomed to being exposed to rain. The Milton End, between the 2003-2004 and 2006-2007 seasons, was the Premier League's only unroofed stand. This unofficially earned the Milton End the nickname of \"The [[Gene Kelly]] Stand\" by soaked visitors, a reference to the 1952 \"[[Singing In The Rain]]\" musical and song.\n\nDuring the summer break of 2018, a large video screen was installed to the roof line of the Milton End.<ref name=\"twitter.com\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyNewsNow/status/1023271393218183169|title=PompeyNewsNow on Twitter|author=|date=|website=twitter.com}}</ref> The new screen was first used on Saturday 28 July 2018 in a pre-season friendly against Dutch team [[FC Utrecht]], which resulted in a 1-1 draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2018/july/match-report-for-portsmouth-vs-fc-utrecht-on-28-jul-18/|title=Pompey 1 Utrecht 1|author=|date=|website=portsmouthfc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nBehind the stand is a public alleyway known as 'Specks Lane', which gives rear access to terraced houses in Alverstone Road, Milton.

This new upper extension and the original lower terrace then collectively became known as The Fratton End. The new Fratton End stand was one of the first in England to be built from prefabricated concrete and steel. The upper and lower tiers of the Fratton End were bisected by a concrete wall which ran across the full width of the new stand, with two large vomitories permitting access to the exterior ground level at the rear of the stand. After its opening, the new Fratton End stand extension was found and blamed for the poor quality of the Fratton Park pitch, as the new stand blocked the usual westerly winds that dried the pitch after rain. A solution was found by installing wind shutters onto the back of the Fratton End's back wall, which were left open on non-match days to allow the drying wind to pass through.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyHistory/status/1044556274669694976|title=#Pompey built their long-awaited new Fratton End in 1956.

The \"moats\" were a recommendation by the then Minister of Sport and Recreation, Denis Howell.  The \"moats\" were deep trenches with thick concrete walls, dug behind both goals at the Fratton End and Milton End stands. The term \"moat\" is a little misleading, as they were not designed to be filled with water.\n\nDuring 1983, when pitch invasions by supporters were commonplace, perimeter fences were built around the entire Fratton Park pitch.\n\nOnly three decades after it opened, the upper tier of Fratton End was structurally condemned in 1986 and partially closed for the Division Two season of 1986-87<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvlHkrXngAI|title=YouTube|website=youtube.com}}</ref> and also for the club's return to [[Football League Division One]] (now 'Premier League') in the 1987-88 season, for the first time since their relegation in the 1958-59 season. This meant only the original 1905 earthbank lower terrace section could be used for the Fratton End fans, many of whom were displaced to other areas of Fratton Park. The upper half and roof of the Fratton End were subsequently demolished at the end of the 1987-88 season, with Portsmouth being relegated to [[Football League Division Two]] (now 'The Championship'). It had been found that the aggregate obtained from [[The Solent]] used in the 1956 concrete mix contained high levels of sea salt and had caused the upper Fratton End's steel structure to corrode and weaken.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theblizzard.co.uk/article/fratton-park|title=Subscriptions - theBlizzard.co.uk|first=Daykin &|last=Storey|website=theblizzard.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Portsmouth FC were granted planning permission by Portsmouth City Council on 6 October 1988 to build a replacement all-standing Fratton End with a capacity of 4500, designed by architect Michael Newberry.<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWD1MOXD701&activeTab=summary</ref> Plans and drawings indicated that the replacement stand would have closely resembled the size and design of the demolished 1956 stand, and retained Fratton Park's north-west corner terrace.  However, this 1988 stand design was not built as Portsmouth were relegated to Division Two.\n\nMany fans theorise Portsmouth's 1988 relegation from the top flight was in part attributed to the partial closure of the Fratton End, in terms of decreased crowd atmosphere, lower attendances which affected financial earnings. The remaining lower terrace of the Fratton End continued to be used onwards from 1988 for a further nine years up intil 1997, giving the Fratton End a much less impressive appearance and crowd volume than before.  \n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 Hillsborough Disaster, Portsmouth F.C. removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the 1989\u201390 season, except at the Milton End to separate away supporters,<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> although these too were removed for the following 1990-91 season after the Taylor Report was published in January 1990.\n\nOn 14 January 1991, a second new design for a replacement Fratton End was granted a conditional five-year planning permission, which also required the removal of both floodlight towers at the Fratton End.<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWCYMOXD020&activeTab=summary</ref> Architect and planning drawings of the 1991 design showed a tall, all-seated, three-tier stand, with a glass-enclosed middle tier reserved for corporate hospitality boxes. This new Fratton End design with its extended corner wings, would have been the first of a four-phase stand replacement plan which would have completely rebuilt Fratton Park into a modern all-seated enclosed bowl shaped stadium. This 1991 design and its further three phases were not built.\n\nOn 5 May 1995, a third new plan for a replacement Fratton End was granted permission.<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWCSMOXD917&activeTab=summary</ref> The [[Mowlem]] design would have been more modest than its ambitious 1991 predecessor, with a single-tier all-seated stand, with a row of eighteen corporate hospitality boxes situated along the top and back, each holding up to ten people. Plans  showed that the Fratton End's two existing corner floodlight towers would have been removed and replaced with two large lighting towers built directly onto the top of a cantilever-truss Fratton End roof. The plan was not built.\n\nOn 4 April 1996, a fourth plan designed by architects KSS Sports & Leisure Design Ltd for a new Fratton End replacement was granted planning permission by Portsmouth City Council.<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWCRMOXD648&activeTab=summary</ref> Similar to the previous design, the 1996 design would have been a single tier all-seated stand with sixteen corporate hospitality boxes at the top. Again, both of the Fratton End's floodlight towers would have been removed, but replaced with free-standing modern replacements at either side. This 1996 design - yet again - was not built.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, the lower terrace remnant of the Fratton End (and all other stands) was fitted with modern blue plastic seats, making Fratton Park an all seated stadium.\n\nOn 8 July 1997, planning permission was granted for the fifth time in nine years for a Fratton End replacement plan.<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWCQMOXD134&activeTab=summary</ref> However this time, work ''actually began'' on constructing a new Fratton End replacement stand, under the new ownership of club chairman [[Terry Venables]]. The architects of the new Fratton End were KSS Sports & Leisure Design Ltd (the same architects as the 1996 design), along with builders,  TRY Build Limited.\n\nThe summer of 1997 saw the full demolition of the remaining Railway End earthbank - ironically including newly fitted blue seats that had only been installed in 1996. After the site was cleared, TRY Build Ltd began immediate construction on the new single-tier, 4,500 seat, all-seated Fratton End stand - a simpler (and cheaper) design without any corporate boxes and no replacement of the existing floodlight towers. The new Fratton End was much larger than the previous 1956 stand and claimed 6 yards of land previously occupied by the Fratton End \"moat\", which was filled in.  At the same time as the Fratton End was constructed, a new roof extension was built over the uncovered lower tier of the North Stand.  The low and early autumn and winter sunsets behind the new larger, taller Fratton End stand at the western end of the stadium caused a long dark shadow to be cast across the Fratton Park pitch. Additional floodlights had been designed into the rooftop of the new Fratton End stand to counteract negative effects of dark shadows.\n\nWith the Fratton End construction complete, the new \u00a32.2 million Fratton End was cleared for its first \"official\" opening - without ceremony - on Friday 31 October 1997 at 4.59pm - with one minute to spare before a 5pm opening clearance deadline. Problems with some misoriented Fratton End rooftop floodlights had caused the Fratton End of the pitch to be ''\"shrouded in gloom on Hallowe'en\"'', according to the Sky Sports 3 TV commentator, causing some doubt that the live evening televised Division One game against [[Swindon Town]] would take place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeXaJYiBL7o|title=1997-10-31 Portsmouth vs Swindon Town [full match]|last=Swindon-Town-FC.co.uk|date=5 December 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Fortunately, the match referee, [[Paul Danson]] gave the go-ahead for the evening fixture. Unfortunately, the game was won 0-1 by Swindon Town with an official Fratton Park attendance of only 8,707.\n\nInitially, the new Fratton End was officially known as 'The KJC Stand' under a sponsorship agreement with the mobile telephone retailer [[KJC Mobile Phones Limited]] (now dissolved<ref>{{cite web |url=https://companycheck.co.uk/company/03953004/KJC-MOBILE-PHONES-LIMITED/companies-house-data| title=KJC Mobile Phones Limited - Free business summary |author=Company Check Ltd |website=Company Check}}</ref>). As a mark of respect to the club's most famous former player and manager, a large portrait of [[Jimmy Dickinson]] was designed into the seating plan of the new Fratton End stand on its southern wing, with the club's famous crest on the northern wing. The Fratton End is the tallest stand in Fratton Park and has a maximum capacity of 4,500 seats. During construction of the new Fratton End, the connecting north-west corner quadrant stand (similar to 'The Boilermakers Hump') which connected the old Fratton End to the lower terrace of North Stand was also demolished. This provided a new large open space \"gap\" for vehicles to access the Fratton Park pitch as well as a wider exit route for fans.\n\nThe Fratton End later received a formal opening ceremony in Portsmouth F.C.'s 100th Anniversary Year celebrations in a League Division One match against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on Saturday 4 April 1998 - one day before the official 100 year club anniversary on Sunday 5 April 1998.  The match ended 1-1 with an attendance of 14,591 supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/portsmouth-v-birmingham-city-04-april-1998-183023/|title=Portsmouth v Birmingham City, 04 April 1998|publisher=}}</ref> The Fratton End stand had actually already been opened - without ceremony - on 31 October 1997 earlier in that 1997-98 season.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2005, the Fratton End was commercially branded as \"The Ty Europe Stand\" under a shirt sponsorship agreement with the Ty Europe division of [[Ty Inc.]], the manufacturer of \"Beanie Babies\" soft toys.\n \nStrangely, a large analogue clock which was originally installed and hung beneath the Fratton End roof in 1997, broke during the mid 2000s and was removed 'for repair'. The clock has never been seen since. Rumours persist that a [[Havant]] based clock repair company was not paid and have kept the clock until payment is received.\n\nOn the rear of the Fratton End hangs a pub sign which reads 'The Pompey', and depicts an imagine of football player wearing blue and white Portsmouth home kit from the 1972-73 season.<ref name=\"portsmouthpubs.org.uk\"/><ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\"/> This pub sign originally hung from the former Brickwood Brewery public house called 'The Pompey', designed by Arthur Edward Cogswell in 1900. The former pub on the corner of Frogmore Road and Carisbrooke Road was closed on 19 August 1988 and purchased by Portsmouth F.C. to be used as premises for a club shop, a ticket office and a media centre.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The pub sign was removed and fitted to the rear of the Fratton End stand above the entrance to the Fratton End's own bar.\n\nThe Fratton End is known today for housing the most vocal of Portsmouth FC's home supporters and are arguably, 'the loudest in the land' according to some television commentators. However, this was not always so as before the 1960s, the loudest supporters were to be found at the centreline areas of the North Stand's lower terrace and eastwards along to the Boilermaker's Hump. During the 1960s, a new wave of younger [[Baby boomers|\"baby boomer\"]] Pompey supporters claimed the Fratton End as their own area, which with decades and later generations has since became the loudest area of Fratton Park.\n\n==='The Boilermakers Hump' (or 'Milton Corner')===\n'The Boilermakers Hump' was the twentieth century nickname given to the north-east corner terrace of Fratton Park, located between the North Terrace and Milton End. It is likely that the corner terrace was built as part of upgrades to Fratton Park in 1905, which joined the North Terrace to the newly built Milton End terrace. The corner was also known as the 'Milton Corner'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pompeypress.co.uk/p599463735/h354D330B#h2ac70ba1|title=Vintage - The Pavilion, Fratton Park 1905(Portsmouth FC)|author=|date=|website=pompeypress.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe 'Boilermakers Hump' name originates from men who worked in Portsmouth dockyard who specialised in building and maintaining the steam boilers for the Royal Navy fleet. The Boilermakers met at the north-east corner of Fratton Park on match days, the corner became nicknamed 'The Boilermakers Hump', because the tall curved corner terrace was taller than the Milton End and North Terrace stands and had a hump-like appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7o9cuxFJdw|title=Bravo Pompey (1929)|last=British Path\u00e9|date=13 April 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe Boilermakers had a rowdy reputation. They worked hard and played hard. In an era before floodlit evening matches, the Boilermakers would often sneak out of work early for midweek afternoon matches, leaving work unwashed, dirty and drunk. Because of this reputation, people would steer clear of them, allowing the Boilermakers to claim their own area in Fratton Park for themselves - on the Hump.\n\nIn 1962, floodlight pylon towers were constructed in the four corners of Fratton Park, replacing the original roof-top sets installed in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2015/september/let-there-be-light/|title=LET THERE BE LIGHT|author=|date=|website=portsmouthfc.co.uk}}</ref> The north-east tower was built in the north-east corner of Fratton Park at top of the Boilermakers Hump.\n\nIn 1996, blue plastic seats were fixed onto the remaining Boilermakers Hump terrace, as part of the overall plan to make Fratton Park an all-seater stadium to meet Taylor Report standards.\n\nPresently, the Boilermakers Hump is the closest point in Fratton Park between home fans in the North Stand and the visiting 'away' fans in the Milton End stand. Sadly, the 'Hump' has long lost its distinctive height difference since the North Stand was rebuilt in 1935. 'The Boilermakers Hump' is now mostly occupied by a police and security control room box, scoreboard and the north-east floodlight pylon tower. Seats installed in 1996 were removed from the north-east corner area between 2016 and 2017 to provide a separation zone between the opposing sets of supporters.\n\n==Other structures==\n===\"''The Pompey''\"===\n[[File:2017-01-16_Portsmouth_FC,_Fratton_Park,_Portsmouth.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Fratton Park's Pavilion and the former ''The Pompey'' pub ''(right)'' at 44 Frogmore Road]]\nIn 1900, a year after his earlier work in constructing the early Fratton Park, Portsmouth architect Arthur Cogswell returned and built a Brickwoods Brewery pub for Portsmouth's first chairman, John Brickwood, at 44 Frogmore Road - literally \"next-door\" to Fratton Park stadium. The new pub was named ''The Pompey''. Arthur Cogswell was well known to John Brickwood, as Cogswell had built many other Brickwoods Brewery pubs around the Portsmouth area.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/d6771640d3 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102072851/http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/d6771640d3 |archive-date=2 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Arthur Cogswell was also an enthusiast of association football, having formed an earlier amateur level [[Portsmouth Association Football Club]] (1884 to 1896).\n\nSadly, ''The Pompey'' was closed down in 1988, but the premises were purchased by Portsmouth F.C., who then converted the building into a club souvenir and merchandise shop. Since 1988, the former pub has had various roles, as the club's media centre, for hospitality and most recently as the club's ticket office.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> ''The Pompey'''s hanging pub sign, which displays an image of a Portsmouth footballer in 1972-73 season kit,<ref name=\"portsmouthpubs.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://portsmouthpubs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ThePompeyMarch1991.jpg|title=THE POMPEY|date=March 1991|website=portsmouthpubs.org|access-date=2019-08-14}}</ref><ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|author=|date=|website=historicalkits.co.uk}}</ref> was later relocated and is currently hung on the rear wall of The Fratton End stand.\n\n''The Pompey '', built in 1900, is currently the oldest surviving building at Fratton Park, although was not built as part of the original 1899 era stadium.\n\n===The Fratton Park Pavilion===\nIn 1905, a club pavilion was donated to the club by its first chairman John Brickwood and built at the south-west corner of Fratton Park in Frogmore Road by Arthur Cogswell, who had also designed the Brickwoods Brewery public house ''The Pompey'' five years earlier. The Fratton Park pavilion was built in the same [[Tudor Revival architecture|mock Tudor]] style as those found in other late 19th century football grounds, such as Fulham F.C.'s Craven Cottage.<ref name=\"h2g2.com\">{{cite web |url=https://h2g2.com/entry/A1139050|title=h2g2 - Portsmouth FC - A History |first=Not Panicking |last=Ltd |website=h2g2.com}}</ref> Fratton Park's pavilion was built immediately to the north of ''The Pompey'' pub which Cogswell had built in 1900.  The north-eastern side of the pavilion featured a tall octagonal clock tower spire featuring a covered spectator gallery beneath it and around the northern side of the pavilion. The pavilion also housed the players dressing rooms and the club offices.<ref name=\"pastscape.org.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1301627 |title=Pastscape - Detailed Result: Fratton Park |website=pastscape.org.uk}}</ref> However, the pavilion's clock tower spire was removed in 1925 to allow space for the construction of the current South Stand, which was designed by the acclaimed Scottish architect, Archibald Leitch. The mock Tudor pavilion facade has for several decades been painted white with black timber frames, but older monochrome photographs clearly show that the pavilion originally had darker walls (possibly beige or cream?) and much lighter coloured (white?) timber frames, as recently as the 1970s, but was later repainted to match the black and white paintwork scheme of ''The Pompey'' pub.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CM8O_LtWwAAoYgh.jpg:large |title=Photo |website=pbs.twimg.com |format=JPG |access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/99/ba/69/99ba69ca77d0068a7da070430f133d53.jpg |title=Photo |website=i.pinimg.com |format=JPG |access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\n===Floodlights===\n[[File:Floodlights_at_Milton_End_of_Fratton_Park_-_geograph.org.uk_-_804206.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The south-east (near) and north-east (far) floodlights at the Milton End and Specks Lane.]]\nPortsmouth FC was the first English football club to stage a Football League match under floodlights, in a 22 February 1956 game against Newcastle United.<ref name=\"football league official site\"/> These original floodlights were positioned at opposite ends on top of the South Stand and North Stand roofs.\n\nOn 5 October 1961, planning permission was granted to Portsmouth FC to construct four new floodlight tower pylons in the four corners of Fratton Park<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWDYMOXD798&activeTab=summary</ref>, replacing the original 1956 roof-top sets which were removed after the four new towers were constucted in 1962. The Portsmouth Supporters Club contributed \u00a312,000 (approx \u00a3254,000 in 2018) to the new pylon towers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2015/september/let-there-be-light/|title=1962 Floodlight pylon towers|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, a five-year planning permission was granted to Portsmouth FC by the city council's planning department to remove and replace Fratton Park's four 1962 era corner floodlight lamp towers with a set of modern replacements, to be supplied by Abacus Lighting Limited,<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=ZZZWCPMOXD334</ref> although this work was not undertaken following the late-nineties ownership of Terry Venables and Martin Gregory and the subsequent financial crisis that saw the club go into administration in 1999.\n\nIn July 2015, work began by [[Musco Lighting]] to bring pitch illumination up to Championship standards for evening games at Fratton Park. The work was completed in September 2015. The new lamps were installed along the roof edges of the Fratton End, North Stand and Milton End stands of Fratton Park. This new lighting rendered the two northern corner floodlight towers obsolete and they were permanently switched off, with the illumination lamps removed from the north-east tower. At the time, there were no plans to remove the iconic 1962 pylon towers. During initial surveying work, it was discovered that the South Stand roof was not capable of supporting the new lighting equipment, so the decision was taken to keep the two southern corner floodlight towers operational.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/football/pompey/pompey-s-shining-lights-have-given-bright-new-future-1-6986060|title=Pompey's shining lights have given bright new future|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe pylons on the northern side of the ground were deactivated and removed during 2019. In April 2019, the club released a statement seeking planning permission to relocate the inactive north-west pylon to the north east perimeter of the car park behind the North Stand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2019/april/portsmouth-football-club-statement/|title=Portsmouth Football Club Statement|website=portsmouthfc.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref>\n\nOn the evening of Thursday 16 May 2019, after the second leg of the EFL League One playoff semi final vs Sunderland, Fratton Park's two southern side floodlight pylons were permanently switched off. New roof top floodlight lamps were proposed to replace them, to be fitted along the top of a newly refurbished South Stand in time for 2019-20 season. The relocated north-west pylon was planned to have its lamps removed and serve as a historic local landmark and as a telecommunications tower.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/football/portsmouth-fc/planning-chiefs-to-decide-future-of-portsmouth-s-iconic-fratton-park-floodlights-1-8935965|title=Planning chiefs to decide future of Pompey's iconic Fratton Park floodlights|website=portsmouth.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn Tuesday 17 June 2019, the first of Fratton Park's four floodlight pylons was removed with a hydraulic crane, which lifted the north-west pylon down in four sections to the ground.

The old stadium has been refurbished and repaired, but the current facilities are showing signs of age. By the time Portsmouth reached the FA Premier League in 2003, other clubs at this level had either built new stadiums or significantly redeveloped existing facilities along modern, less working-class lines, abolishing traditional features which have so far been preserved at Fratton Park, despite relocation being suggested as long ago as the early 1990s. When the Taylor Report of January 1990 required all clubs in the top two divisions to have all-seater stadiums by the [[1994-95 in English football|1994-95 season]], relocation was soon being considered by the Portsmouth board, although Fratton Park was still converted into an all-seater stadium over the next few years, giving it a capacity of over 19,000.\n\nAt the end of the [[2003\u201304 Portsmouth F.C. season|2003&ndash;04 season]], the club having survived its first season in the Premier League, plans were developed to build a new stadium on the site of an adjacent disused rail-freight depot. These plans, which were supported by the city council, would also have allowed a much needed increase in ground capacity, but it was claimed that it would be impossible to achieve on the current footprint because of the close proximity of residential housing.\n\nBefore work could begin, however, the plans were superseded by a new proposal to redevelop more or less on the existing site, but realigning the pitch 90 degrees to accommodate a larger capacity stadium, funded in part by a \"Pompey Village\" residential, hotel and retail project on the adjacent site. Work on the stadium was due to commence in the summer of 2006, and the first phase of the redevelopment completed a year later.\n\nAgain, before work could begin, the plans were dropped, with yet another proposal announced on 25 April 2007 that would see a 36,000-seat stadium on reclaimed mudflats close to [[Portsmouth Naval Base]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Pompey announce new stadium plan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/6591049.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date= 25 April 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2007}}</ref> These plans were ambitious and included creating a leisure village around the stadium, complete with 1,500 waterfront apartments as well as restaurants and other facilities.\n\nThe proposal for a new stadium was widely supported, although cautiously by many that were conscious that the waterfront location proposed in the outline plans would be surrounded on three sides, by the naval base, harbour itself and railway, thus leaving only one end for access by residents and supporters. Critics also pointed out that the mudflats the stadium was proposed to sit on was close to an area of Site of Special Scientific Interest, would be difficult to get to by road and had nowhere near the amount of car parking facilities needed for such an enterprise (Portsmouth is an island, with road access by only three routes from the north, and the waterfront site was close to the south-west extremity of the island).\n\nThese plans were also dropped before work could begin. The club had undertaken consultation and there were a number of objectors to the proposal, no least about the problems that 36,000 fans would cause to the local travel infrastructure. The Royal Navy also said that the proposal would cause problems with the proposed introduction of its new [[Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier|aircraft carriers]].\n\nIn 2008, a fourth set of plans were approved, to build a new 35,000 capacity stadium and leisure/residential complex on [[Horsea Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/east-hampshire/fratton_park_comes_first_as_masterplan_for_stadium_unveiled_1_1304528|title=Fratton Park comes first as masterplan for stadium unveiled |date=26 November 2008|publisher=[[The News (Portsmouth)]]|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref> In 2009 the Horsea Island development was put on hold due to financial issues.<ref name=2009plan>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/east-hampshire/pompey_announce_new_stadium_plan_at_fratton_park_1_1228882|title=Pompey announce new stadium plan at Fratton Park |date=19 March 2009|publisher=[[The News (Portsmouth)]]|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref> The previous proposal to rotate the existing pitch at Fratton Park by 90 degrees was re-instated.<ref name=2009plan/> Work was due to begin late 2009, with a gradual increase in capacity until completion in 2010 ending with a capacity of 30,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/newshome/Fratton-Park-is-set-to.5317962.jp|title=Fratton Park is set to hold 30,000 fans|date=30 May 2009|publisher=[[The News (Portsmouth)]]|accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, plans to spend money redeveloping Fratton Park were announced, with improvements to changing rooms and toilets. By 2015, however, with Portsmouth in [[Football League Two|League Two]] (fourth tier of English football), no redevelopment or expansion work had yet taken place.

The pitch measures 115 x 73 yards, and is aligned from east to west, which is considered unusual in English football, as most other pitches are orientated north to south to maximise natural sunlight.\n\nThe stadium has a current (reduced) capacity for 19,669 supporters,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2017/december/fratton-park-receives-capacity-boost/|title=Fratton Park Receives Capacity Boost - News - Portsmouth|publisher=}}</ref> although it has had a much larger maximum capacity for 58,000 supporters after the construction of the North Stand in 1935. Fratton Park's record attendance is 51,385, reached in an FA Cup quarter-final match vs Derby County, on 26 February 1949, in which Portsmouth won 2-1.\n\nThe four stands in Fratton Park are named '''The North Stand''' (north), '''The South Stand''' (south), '''The Milton End''' (east) and '''The Fratton End''' (west). Before the reconstruction of the 4,500 seat Fratton End in 1997, the previously unseated terraced stands of the old Fratton End, Lower North Terrace and Milton End were conjoined as one contiguous terrace for much of Fratton Park's twentieth century history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyNewsNow/status/1143111653493547008|title=Fratton Park June 1992 #Pompey #PompeyHistorypic.twitter.com/RnaLkps22l|last=PompeyNewsNow|date=2019-06-24|website=@PompeyNewsNow|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D90l_aGXUAEHdY3.jpg|title= Photo |website=pbs.twimg.com |format=PDF|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>\n\nAlong the northern touchline of the pitch is the two-tier North Stand, the largest stand in Fratton Park. The North Stand (including Lower North Terrace) was rebuilt and reopened as a full standing stand on 7 September 1935, increasing Fratton Park's maximum capacity to 58,000 supporters. However, the stadium capacity was reduced when 4,226 seats were fitted to the upper North Stand terrace in 1951. The lower North Terrace was also fitted with seats in 1996.  A new roof extension, supported by steel columns, was added from the front of the North Stand in 1997 and extended over the North Terrace (previously uncovered) to the pitch touchline. The North Stand turnstiles are accessed from Milton Lane. A gravel surfaced car park is a recent addition to the rear of the North Stand. The current 'Pompey Shop' merchandise shop and ticket office are located directly behind the North Stand car park in Anson Road.\n\nThe current South Stand has two tiers and was opened on 29 August 1925 and is currently the oldest stand in Fratton Park. It replaced an earlier and smaller South Stand (known as The Grand Stand) that existed on the site between 1899-1925.  The current 1925 South Stand was designed by the famed Scottish architect [[Archibald Leitch]]. The entrance to the South Stand is in Frogmore Road and is notable for its [[mock Tudor]] fa\u00e7ade, which is a remnant of a grand mock Tudor pavilion structure - with a clock tower - that previously occupied the site from 1905 before the current South Stand was built in 1925.\n\nAt the eastern end of Fratton Park is the Milton End, the smallest stand. The original Milton End was built in 1905 and was known as the Spion Kop, and was enlarged to its current size in 1949. Infamously, the Milton End was the only roofless stand in the [[Premier League]], before a roof was added before the 2007-08 season. The Milton End is used by visiting 'away' supporters, with turnstiles in an alleyway named Specks Lane, directly behind the Milton End.\n\nAt the western end of Fratton Park is the single tier 4,500 seat Fratton End, which first opened on 31 October 1997 and is the newest and tallest stand in Fratton Park. The Fratton End also had an official opening ceremony on 4 April 1998, timed to coincide with a home match that was one day before the centennial anniversary of Portsmouth F.C. on 5 April 1998.  The current Fratton End replaced an earlier two-tier Fratton End built in 1956, which had its upper tier demolished in 1986 for structural reasons. The remaining lower tier of the Fratton End was demolished eleven seasons later in 1997 to clear the land for the building of the current Fratton End stand in 1997. The Fratton End turnstiles are accessed from Frogmore Road.\n\n==Fratton Park name==\nContrary to popular belief, Fratton Park is actually named after '''[[Fratton railway station]]''' and not the geographic area of '''[[Fratton]]''' of Portsmouth.  Despite its Fratton Park name, Portsmouth's football ground is not located in the Fratton area of Portsmouth, instead it was built in '''[[Milton, Portsmouth|Milton]]''' in 1899. This peculiar misnaming has caused many of Portsmouth's residents and football fans to incorrectly assume that Fratton Park is located in Fratton, and not in Milton.\n\nFratton Park was built in 1899 on a plot of land in Milton, which at the time was a small rural village on the east side of [[Portsea Island]]. The land was originally a potato field near to Goldsmith Avenue and was purchased by Portsmouth FC from the Goldsmith farming family in the autumn of 1898. At the time, the late nineteenth century village of Milton still retained a remote, rural and isolated feeling from the busy town of Portsmouth, and had no railway station of its own, the nearest being located one mile to the west in Fratton, in the centre of [[Portsea Island]].\n\nFratton railway station - in a nineteenth century Victorian era before mass car ownership - was seen as key to attracting supporters to the early Portsmouth FC football ground in rural Milton. It was decided by the club that the \"Fratton\" part of the Fratton railway station name was to be \"borrowed\" for the naming of the football ground, to deliberately understate the actual one mile travel distance from Fratton railway station to the newly built \"Fratton Park\" football ground - in Milton.\n\nIronically, on 28 May 1912, Portsmouth town council bought the remaining Milton Farm land from the Goldsmith farming family, and on 11 July 1923 opened a public recreation park named ''Milton Park'' in Milton, only 127 metres to the east of Fratton Park on Priory Crescent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welcometoportsmouth.co.uk/milton%20park%20portsmouth.html|title=Milton Park, Portsmouth|website=welcometoportsmouth.co.uk|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref><ref>https://www.welcometoportsmouth.co.uk/milton%20park%20portsmouth.html</ref>\n\nThe east stand of Fratton Park is named the Milton End, a nod to the actual village of Milton that the football ground was built in.\n\nThe former nineteenth century villages of Milton and Fratton are now areas of the present-day city of Portsmouth, with their clear past boundaries now blurred by the modern-day urban sprawl of Portsmouth. However, Milton and Fratton still have defined boundaries, separated by the Portsmouth direct line railway and political voting ward boundaries.\n\nFratton Park  also retains a [[PO postcode area|PO4 8RA Milton postcode]] and not the PO1 area postcode of the neighbouring Fratton area and Portsmouth city centre.  If Fratton Park was located in the actual Fratton area of Portsmouth, its theoretical postcode would begin with PO1 5**.<ref>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EUsESqiXgAI2UGc.jpg</ref> By coincidence, Fratton Park's PO4 8RA postcode contains the RA abbreviation of the late nineteenth century prescursor [[History of Portsmouth F.C.#Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Football Club (1894\u20131899, 1900\u20131901)|Royal Artillery Portsmouth FC]], sometimes known as RA Portsmouth.\n\n==Transport Links==\nFratton Park is closest to [[Fratton railway station]], roughly one mile to the west of the ground (about 10 minutes' walk away). Fratton railway station is located on the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] branch, which links to both [[London Waterloo station]] and [[London Victoria station]]<nowiki/>services from [[Southampton]], [[Bournemouth]], [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]] and [[Brighton]] also stop at Fratton railway station.\n\nBy road, Fratton Park is close to the [[A2030 road|A2030]] on the east coast of Portsea Island, and is named ''Velder Avenue'' at its southern end, and ''Eastern Road'' to its north. At the north ''Eastern Road'' end of the A2030, it intersects with the main [[A27 road|A27]] south coast trunk road at Farlington, Portsmouth. This A27 intersection has the [[M27 motorway]] to its west, and A27 to the east. Further to the east, the A27 links to the [[A3(M)]] to London and the [[M25 motorway]] which orbits London.\n\nBy sea, [[Portsmouth International Port]] has passenger ferry routes to the [[Channel Islands]], northern France, and northern Spain. From [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], there are foot passenger ferries to [[Gosport]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. A car ferry service to the Isle of Wight also operates from nearby [[Gunwharf Quays|Gunwharf]].\n\n== Fratton Park History ==\nOn 5 April 1898, Portsmouth Football Club was founded by a group of six local businessmen and sports enthusiasts at the office of [[Alderman]] John Edward Pink (a law solicitor) at number 12 High Street, Old Portsmouth. The men formed a syndicate to share their resources to form a professional football club and to buy a plot of land near Goldsmith Avenue, Milton to build a football ground. \"''The Portsmouth Football and Athletic Company''\" as it was originally known, had a capital of \u00a38,000 amongst its chairman and five directors.:\n\n* John Brickwood - the owner of Portsmouth-based 'Brickwoods Brewery' and first chairman of Portsmouth F.C. (John Brickwood was knighted in 1904, became [[Brickwood baronets|First Baronet Brickwood of Portsmouth]] in 1927)\n* Major Alfred H. Bone - a surveyor and architect.\n* John Peters  - a wine importer.\n* William Wiggington - a government contractor and former Royal Engineers Warrant Officer.\n* George Lewin Oliver - founder and headmaster of 'Oliver's [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|Preparatory School]]', 384-388 (Old) Commercial Road, Mile End, Portsmouth, which locally became known as 'Mile End School'.\n* Alderman John Edward Pink - a solicitor, based at 12 High Street, Old Portsmouth, employed by John Brickwood.\n\nA [[Blue Plaque|blue plaque]] on the wall of 12 High Street, Old Portsmouth (Alderman John E. Pink's office building) commemorates the founding on 5 April 1898.\n\nTheir prospectus, dated 14 May 1898, revealed that they proposed to \"''acquire a piece of land in Goldsmith Avenue up to \u00a31100 an acre''\" in Milton, to be used primarily for football and \"''for such outdoor games and exercises that were approved by the directors.''\" These were to include cycling, athletics and cricket matches. It was noted that the ground was to be built within convenient reach of Fratton railway station, and that it \"''was intended to drain and turf the land and erect the necessary buildings''\" for a further \u00a32,000, which would leave working capital of about \u00a31,000. It was hoped that football in Portsmouth would become as popular as it had become in northern England towns, where attendances were between 20,000 and 30,000. The existing team at Southampton was mentioned as well as an embryonic club at Brighton and it was hoped that \"''a healthy rivalry would spring up that would increase the popularity and income of the company''\".\n\n[[File:Fratton park porthsmouth ryde.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portsmouth v Ryde match at Fratton Park, 1899. North Terrace and Milton End]] \nWith the successful acquisition of four-and-a-half acres of land, bought from the Goldsmith family who owned Milton Farm (and from whom which 'Goldsmith Avenue' is named after), a general meeting of shareholders was then held on 2 September 1898 at the Sussex Hotel in Landport, Portsmouth. The Sussex Hotel was actually a large Brickwoods Brewery hostelry which stood directly opposite the Portsmouth Town Hall ''(it was demolished in 1972 when the present Guildhall Square was built)''.\n\nWeeks later, prominent [[Football Association]] representative [[William Pickford]] met with Portsmouth director [[George Lewin Oliver]] and inspected the land which would soon become a new football ground. The site was shortly to be turfed and fenced and it was hoped that football matches could be played there after Christmas of 1898. However, the land was still covered with a crop of potatoes which the directors were \"''anxious to sell''\", which they eventually did, further contributing to the funds of the newly formed company.\n \nOn 19 December 1898, the \"''Hampshire Telegraph''\" newspaper ran an advertisement inviting tenders \"''for the building of two stands: the first, 100 feet long with seven rows of seats on the south side and the second, terracing which stretched for 240 feet on the opposite, north side''\". The south side \"Grand Stand\" would be built in 1899 by local architect [[A. E. Cogswell|Arthur Cogswell]].<ref name=\"pompeyvoices.co.uk1\"/>\n\nEight months later, on 15 August 1899, more than 1,000 people, including some of the first Pompey players, attended the official opening day to see how the former Milton Farm potato field had been transformed into a modest football ground. The name of the new ground was revealed to be \"Fratton Park\", and was named after [[Fratton railway station]]. It is almost certain that the naming of Fratton Park, which is actually located in Milton, not [[Fratton]], was a slightly dishonest tactic of the early football club, to persuade potential new supporters that the new football ground was within an easy walking distance of an established railway station and tram connections. Fratton Park is actually a one-mile walk east of Fratton railway station and Fratton itself.\n\n[[Frank Brettell]] was the club's first team manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/LatestNews/news/Happy-Birthday-Pompey-4279.aspx|title=Happy Birthday Pompey|accessdate=5 April 2013|publisher=Portsmouth FC|date=5 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407180946/http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/LatestNews/news/Happy-Birthday-Pompey-4279.aspx|archivedate=7 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The club was successfully elected directly into the First Division  of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] in 1899, with their first league match being played away at [[Chatham Town F.C.|Chatham Town]] on 2 September 1899 (a 1\u20130 victory),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/footballclubs/history_of_portsmouth.html|title=Portsmouth FC History|accessdate=4 July 2008|publisher=Talk Football|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531064149/http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/footballclubs/history_of_portsmouth.html|archivedate=31 May 2010}}</ref> followed three days later by the first match at Fratton Park.\n\nThe first ever match at Fratton Park was a \"friendly\" against Southampton FC, and was played on the late afternoon of Wednesday 6 September 1899,<ref name=\"pompeyvoices.co.uk\"/> with goals from [[Dan Cunliffe]] (formerly with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]) and [[Harold Clarke (footballer)|Harold Clarke]] (formerly with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]).<ref>{{cite book |   author=Dave Juson & others |   title=Saints v Pompey \u2013 A history of unrelenting rivalry|   publisher=Hagiology Publishing|   year=2004|   isbn=0-9534474-5-6 |page=9}}</ref> The game was won by Portsmouth 2-0 and the first Fratton Park attendance was 4,141 with gate receipts of 141 pounds, 14 shillings and 9 pence<ref name=\"pompeyvoices.co.uk\"/> (approximately \u00a317,000 when adjusted to 2018 inflation).\n\nToday, some Portsmouth fans erroneously believe that Fratton Park is in Portsmouth's Fratton area, literally because of the stadium's name and also lacking the correct facts of Milton's long history. A political map of Portsmouth clearly defines the border between the Fratton and Milton areas with a line drawn from Fratton Bridge, along the [[Portsmouth Direct line]] railway up to St. Mary's Bridge. Fratton is located north of the line with Milton to the south. Fratton Park is south of the railway line, and thus is in Milton. This fact can also be proven further as Fratton Park has a Milton-based PO4 8RA postal code address (''Fratton and Portsmouth city centre has a \"PO1\" postal code''). A further fact is that Fratton Park lies within the Milton Ward electoral district for Portsmouth City Council and national level parliamentary elections.\n\n==Fratton Park Stands==\n===The South Stand===\n[[File:Fratton Park - South Stand.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Archibald Leitch's 1925 South Stand in February 2008]]\n'''Current capacity: 5,210''' (all seated, and excluding corporate seats)\n\nFratton Park's first South Stand, called The Grand Stand, was built in 1899 by Portsmouth-based architect [[A. E. Cogswell|Arthur Cogswell]]<ref name=\"pompeyvoices.co.uk1\"/> measuring \"''100 feet long with seven rows of seats on the south side''\" and was built on the southern side of the pitch. The Fratton Park pitch was surrounded by hooped metal fence railings.\n\nA strong wind blew off the roof of the South Stand in 1901. The roof was rebuilt for a then \u00a3120 (approx \u00a314,000 in 2018), but the new roof would only last until March 1916 - when it was blown off again!\n\nOn the early evening of 16 March 1916, the entire roof of the South Stand was blown off again by \"a great hurricane\". Houses surrounding Fratton Park in Carisbrooke Road and Ruskin Avenue were hit by the South Stand roof and suffered extensive damage.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/505c9a7487 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102072902/http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/505c9a7487 |archive-date=2 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1925, because of overcrowding of the original \"''one-thousand''\" seat Grand Stand and revenue lost to \"''better class supporters unable to obtain a seat''\", work on a new and larger South Stand began on 17 June 1925 and was completed just ten weeks later at a cost of \u00a320,000 (approximately \u00a31.1 million in 2018). The new South Stand was designed by renowned football architect Archibald Leitch. and was opened by the then Football League President, [[John McKenna#Other Historical Information|John McKenna]] on 29 August 1925, just before the kickoff before a home match against Middlesbrough.<ref name=\"pompeyvoices.co.uk1\"/> Leitch's South Stand was built with an all wooden upper section with flip-turn seats in the central section, with wooden benches at the west and eastern ends. A lower terrace 'paddock' standing section below pitch level was also built. The South Stand also featured new players dressing rooms previously located in the Fratton Park pavilion. A \"tunnel\" built directly from within the South Stand dressing rooms lead to the pitch at the halfway line point. As the new South Stand was much larger than the original, the Fratton Park pitch was reduced in width from 77 yards to 73 yards.\n\nBecause of the new South Stand, sadly most of the eastern side of Arthur Cogwell's original mock Tudor pavilion, including its clock tower and spectator gallery were removed or absorbed into the new South Stand's footprint.  The now famous mock Tudor \"Main Entrance\" to Fratton Park in Frogmore Road is now all that remains visible of the exterior of the original pavilion today.\n\nFloodlights were fitted to the roof ends of both the South Stand and North Stand in 1956.

The condemned upper tier of the Fratton End was also demolished.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEI23wYBssQ|title=A Decade of Pompey 1982 1992|last=Warren Moyle|date=27 December 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 [[Hillsborough Disaster]], Portsmouth F.C. removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the [[1989\u201390 Football League Second Division|1989\u201390 season]], except at the Milton End to separate away supporters,<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> although these too were removed for the following 1990-91 season after the [[Taylor Report]] was published in January 1990.\n\nDuring the summer of 1996, the South Stand (and all other stands) became all seated, with new plastic seats replacing older wooden ones in the upper section. The South Stand's lower paddock terraces were reprofiled and seats were installed.\n\nIn 2007, under the new ownership of Russian-French-Israeli businessman [[Alexandre Gaydamak]], the South Stand was controversially retrofitted with three additional rows of seats built immediately in front of the upper section of the stand, building over - and concealing - the original and distinctive Archibald Leitch 'X' trusses that were an eye-catching feature of the South Stand's original design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=JGN6B1MOT2000|title=07/00690/FUL {{!}} Construction of extension to upper tier of south stand to form additional 370 seats and TV gantry {{!}} Fratton Park Frogmore Road Southsea Hampshire PO4 8RA|website=publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> The additional 370 seats also narrowed the field of vision for supporters who sat beneath them in the lower South Stand.\n\nGaydamak also completely 'modernised' the Portsmouth FC boardroom within the South Stand. A set of fourteen antique oak chairs and a five-leaf table were literally thrown out into a rubbish skip during the renovations.  The chairs have the design of a ship's wheel on their backs and had dark navy-blue velvet upholstery. The chairs had originally been made for a wardroom on the Royal Navy's first iron-clad warship {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}, which was built in the 1860s. They had been gifted by the [[Royal Navy]] to Portsmouth FC for more than 70 years. During the Second World War, the chairs were moved to a Solent fort, where [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Field Marshal Montgomery]] are said to have sat on them to plot the downfall of the Germans. An anonymous builder who had been working at Fratton Park for the 2006 renovations decided to 'rescue' them and stored them for safe keeping. The builder says he plans to give the chairs and table back to Portsmouth FC when the current owners had 'changed their taste'.\n\nThe South Stand also contains the player's dressing rooms which are accessed via a pitchside 'tunnel' midway along the South Stand at the 'halfway line' point of the pitch. At pitch level, the South Stand also has dedicated seating areas for both 'Home' and 'Away' football teams and their associated staff. Directly above in the upper South Stand is a 'directors box' area of seating specifically for  Portsmouth FC officials and visiting guests.\n\nAt the rear of the upper South Stand seating area, behind the directors box, is an area reserved for journalists. Above, perched on top of the South Stand roof, is a small television camera gantry, only accessible via an 'exciting' sheer vertical ladder climb from within the upper South Stand seating area.\n\nOn 6 March 2019, Portsmouth Football Club revealed that improvements to the South Stand had begun with an estimated completion date scheduled before the start of the 2019-2020 season. The work on the South Stand included new exterior cladding, a new roof, new guttering, new lighting (including emergency lighting) and replacing structural steelwork within the South Stand's structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2019/march/work-begins-on-south-stand-improvements/|title=Work Begins On South Stand Improvements|website=portsmouthfc.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 May 2019, Portsmouth applied for planning permission to construct a new, larger camera gantry to the roof of the South Stand, along with eight sets of roof-mounted floodlight clusters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=PRTATMMOGIB00|title=19/00809/FUL {{!}} Construction of replacement television camera gantry and installation of floodlighting to the South Stand {{!}} Fratton Park Frogmore Road Southsea PO4 8RA|website=publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> The new gantry is hoped to be in place for the 2020-21 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/football/portsmouth-fc/new-television-gantry-for-portsmouth-s-fratton-park-earmarked-for-start-of-2020-21-season-1-8955791|title=New television gantry for Pompey's Fratton Park earmarked for start of 2020-21 season|website=portsmouth.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 July 2019, a video released by Portsmouth's media department showed the first of ten sets of rooftop mounted floodlights being fitted to the new roof of the South Stand.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Pompey/status/1148318311916216320|title=Work continues at Fratton Park, with ten sets of floodlights going up on the South Stand roof Previously, most of the lights were part of the historic Floodlight in between the Fratton End and South Stand #Pompeypic.twitter.com/uknK96aSGx|first=Portsmouth|last=FC|date=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nBy Tuesday 6 August 2019, the work to improve the South Stand roof, cladding and rooftop floodlights were completed in time for Fratton Park's first competitive match for the 2019-20 season, the First Round of the League Cup against Birmingham City, an evening fixture in which Portsmouth won 3-0.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web |url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBTl9lDX4AEhfA9.jpg|title= Photo |website=pbs.twimg.com |format=PDF|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49160095|title=Carabao Cup: Portsmouth 3-0 Birmingham City - Ellis Harrison heads double on home debut|date=6 August 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> This was the first evening game played without any light from Fratton Park's iconic four corner floodlight pylon towers since their erection in 1962.\n\n===The North Stand===\n[[File:Fratton Park - North Stand.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The North Stand as seen in a match v [[Chelsea FC|Chelsea]], February 2008]]\n'''Current capacity: 7,159''' (all seated, reduced from 7,500)\n\nOriginally opening to the south of Milton Lane on 15 August 1899, the North Terrace (as it was then called) had 'terracing which stretched for 240 feet' on the northern side of Fratton Park.\n\nA small roofed North Stand was built around 1905 on the halfway line on the northern touchline, flanked on either side by the remaining North Terrace. The stand was similar in appearance to the Grand Stand on the opposite south side of the pitch. The stand was widened during the next two decades and with the addition of an enlarged column-supported canopy covering the North Terrace by around 1930-31.\n\nUsing money from the June 1934 sale of defender [[Jimmy Allen (footballer, born 1909)|Jimmy Allen]] and money from the 1934 FA Cup Final, Portsmouth F.C. announced at Christmas 1934 that the North Terrace was to be rebuilt with a much larger stand, increasing the ground capacity to more than 58,000, with 30,000 under roof.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/d77e243589 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102072840/http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/d77e243589 |archive-date=2 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:2017-01-16_Portsmouth_FC,_Visiting_supporters_gate,_Milton_End,_Fratton_Park,_Portsmouth_(2).JPG|thumb|right|250px|The North Stand and the original Milton Lane. January 2017]] \nOn 7 September 1935 the new North Stand was opened by John McKenna, who had also opened Fratton Park's new South Stand ten years earlier.  The official opening ceremony took place over loudspeakers from the directors box of the South Stand just before kickoff of the game against visitors [[Aston Villa]], ironically captained by former Portsmouth defender Jimmy Allen!<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The new \"Jimmy Allen Stand\" as it was unofficially nicknamed, contained a new upper tier standing terrace under its roof.  The whole stand then became known as 'The North Stand'.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe North Stand is an irregular shaped stand at its western end because the North Stand, if built \"straight\" would have overlapped Milton Lane (nicknamed \"Dogshit Alley\"), a public footpath which linked the village of Milton, to the neighbouring districts of Fratton and Kingston. Instead of purchasing additional land to 'straighten' Milton Lane and to build a uniformly straight North Stand, Portsmouth FC instead chose to build the new North Stand within the existing Fratton Park footprint. This has resulted in the North Stand looking oddly angled and crooked at its western end since 1935.\n\nIn 1951, 4,226 seats were fitted onto the upper tier standing terrace of the North Stand. The Lower North Terrace was kept for standing, until 1996.\n\nDuring 1983, when pitch invasions by supporters were commonplace, perimeter fences were built around the entire Fratton Park pitch.\n\nIn the summer of 1988, new Portsmouth F.C. chairman Jim Gregory invested new money into the club, the South and North stands were both refurbished with new white exterior walls and azure blue metal roofs.  The condemned upper tier of the Fratton End was also demolished.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 Hillsborough Disaster, Portsmouth F.C. removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the 1989\u201390 season, except at the Milton End to separate away supporters,<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> although these too were removed for the following 1990-91 season after the Taylor Report was published in January 1990.\n\nDuring the summer of 1996, the North Stand (and all other stands) became all seated with modern blue plastic seats replacing the old wooden ones in the upper tier of North Stand. The Lower North Terrace of the North Stand was fitted with seats too, as part of the Taylor Report recommendations.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, a new North Stand roof extension was built to shelter the exposed lower North supporters from rain. At the same time, a new Fratton End stand was built, which first opened on 31 October 1997.\n\n[[File:2017-01-16_Portsmouth_FC,_North_Stand,_Fratton_Park,_Portsmouth_(1).JPG|thumb|right|250px|The North Stand and car park. January 2017]]\nIn 2015, a new shingle surfaced main car park for Portsmouth FC was laid and opened behind the North Stand. This additional land, formerly part of a neighbouring industrial estate, had been purchased by Portsmouth FC during the early 2000s. Most of the original 'Milton Lane' footpath has now been absorbed into the new car park, meaning that a newer 'Milton Lane' footpath has been built along the new car park's northern boundary.\n\nOn Saturday 17 December 2016, [[Pompey Supporters Trust|The Pompey Supporters Trust]] unveiled the 'Wall Of Fame' plaques to the rear wall of the North Stand,<ref>{{cite web|title=Shareholder Wall Of Fame Unveiling - 17th December 12pm|url=http://www.pompeytrust.com/news/shareholder-wall-of-fame-unveiling--17th-december-12pm|publisher=pompeytrust.com|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref> featuring the names of all the 2300 PST shareholders who helped save Portsmouth FC from liquidation by the [[High Court of Justice|High Court Of Justice]] on 10 April 2013.\n\nOn Monday 6 April 2020 - during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 coronavirus]] lockdown - Portsmouth FC announced that 'substantial' and 'essential works' to the North Stand had begun, which would involve the replacement of the roof, external cladding and beams.

When Fratton Park first opened on 15 August 1899, no stands or terracing existed yet at the Milton and Fratton ends. Instead, a thousand supporters could sit in relative comfort in the roofed Grand Stand on the south side of the pitch, or stand on the banked open air North Terrace on the north side. Alternatively, supporters could also stand on flat open ground behind the two opposite goal lines at each 'end'.\n\nIn 1905, the sight lines for supporters at the east end of Fratton Park were improved by the construction of an open air solid earthbank terrace, covered with wooden plank steps over layers of cinders and compacted top soil.  The new east end terrace initially became known as the [[Spion Kop (stadiums)|Spion Kop]], a colloquial British nickname for an open air earthbank terrace that resembled [[Spion Kop (mountain)|Spion Kop hill]] near Ladysmith, South Africa, a 1900 battle location during the [[Second Boer War]].  The Spion Kop was joined to the North Terrace's eastern end with a connecting corner terrace, known as 'The Milton Corner' which later also became known as 'The Boilermakers Hump'.\n\nIn 1928 the Spion Kop (Milton End) was reprofiled with concrete terracing, bringing the capacity of Fratton Park up to 40,000.\n\nDuring October 1948, repairs to the uneven broken rear gangway of the Spion Kop took place to make it safe, using brick rubble surfaced with a top layer of ashes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyHistory/status/1048938671427211264|title=#OTD1948 The lateral gangway across the top of the Milton end terrace is to be built up so that it is level with the top step of the terracing. This will involve filling in the gangway with several tons of brick rubble and levelling it off with ashes. #PompeyChampsOfEngland|date=7 October 2018}}</ref>  A new perimeter wall with a handrail was also built at the top of the stand to stop supporters falling from the top into the Specks Lane alleyway below.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyHistory/status/1048939159858110465|title=#OTD1948 The eastern edge of the Milton end's lateral gangway will be protected by a small wall, mounted with a handrail to prevent people being pushed down the bank towards Fratton Park's boundary with Specks Lane. #PompeyChampsOfEngland|date=7 October 2018}}</ref> A new stairwell leading up from the northeast corner turnstiles behind the Boilermakers Hump, was built, with a shallower incline than its predecessor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyHistory/status/1048938226734518272|title=#OTD1948 The stairway leading from the turnstiles in the north-east corner of Fratton Park up to Spion Kop are being rebuilt to provide steps that have less of an incline than has previously been the case. #PompeyChampsOfEngland|date=7 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949 the height of the Spion Kop was raised to the same level as the north-east corner (Milton Corner or Boilermakers Hump), with its terraces fully resurfaced with concrete.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyHistory/status/1154677819823284229|title=#OTD1949 Major improvements to Fratton Park will be completed before the start of the new season.

The \"moats\" were a recommendation by the then Minister of Sport and Recreation, [[Denis Howell]].  The \"moats\" were deep trenches with thick concrete walls, dug behind both goals at the Milton End and Fratton End stands. The term \"moat\" is a little misleading, as they were not designed to be filled with water.\n\nDuring 1983, when pitch invasions by supporters were commonplace, perimeter fences were built around the entire Fratton Park pitch.\n\nOn 12 March 1983, during Portsmouth's promotion chase to Division One, visiting rival Cardiff City fans - also chasing promotion - climbed the large scoreboard at the back of the Milton End terrace and stole the hands from the Milton End clock.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-fans-great-time-pompey-2175570|title=City fans had great time at Pompey|first=Terry|last=Phillips|date=9 May 2008|publisher=}}</ref> Portsmouth eventually won the Division Two championship, with Cardiff City finishing as runners-up.\n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 Hillsborough Disaster, Portsmouth F.C. removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the 1989\u201390 season, except at the Milton End to separate away supporters,<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> although these too were removed for the following 1990-91 season after the Taylor Report was published in January 1990. However. the Milton End moat and wall have been retained to present day, with additional emergency exits retrofitted in.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Fratton Park became an all-seater stadium. The Milton End terrace was reprofiled and blue plastic seats were installed.\n\nDuring the late 20th and early 21st centuries, various television companies erected a series of temporary elevated miniature television studio boxes on scaffold pylons at the centre rear section of the Milton End where the scoreboard and stadium clock had previously been. This continued up until 2007 when the Milton End received a roof for the first time, which also prevented the continued use of temporary studio boxes on the Milton End.\n\nIn 2007, a roof was added over the Milton End following complaints to the Premier League by 'Away' supporters not accustomed to being exposed to rain. The Milton End, between the 2003-2004 and 2006-2007 seasons, was the Premier League's only unroofed stand. This unofficially earned the Milton End the nickname of \"The [[Gene Kelly]] Stand\" by soaked visitors, a reference to the 1952 \"[[Singing In The Rain]]\" musical and song.\n\nDuring the summer break of 2018, a large video screen was installed to the roof line of the Milton End.<ref name=\"twitter.com\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyNewsNow/status/1023271393218183169|title=PompeyNewsNow on Twitter|author=|date=|website=twitter.com}}</ref> The new screen was first used on Saturday 28 July 2018 in a pre-season friendly against Dutch team [[FC Utrecht]], which resulted in a 1-1 draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2018/july/match-report-for-portsmouth-vs-fc-utrecht-on-28-jul-18/|title=Pompey 1 Utrecht 1|author=|date=|website=portsmouthfc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nBehind the stand is a public alleyway known as 'Specks Lane', which gives rear access to terraced houses in Alverstone Road, Milton. As the Milton End is a solid earth bank, there are no concourse facilities beneath the stand.\n\nThe club announced plans on Tuesday 14 January 2020 to submit a planning application to [[Portsmouth City Council]] for approval on a redevelopment of the Milton End stand and surrounding areas,<ref name=\"pfc-phase1-announcement\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2020/january/phase-1-fratton-park-proposed-milton-end-redevelopment/ |title=Phase 1: Fratton Park Proposed (Milton End) Redevelopment |date=2020-01-14 |website=portsmouthfc.co.uk |language=en-gb |access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> referred to as \"phase 1\" of the Fratton Park Stadium Regeneration & Development Plan.

This new upper extension and the original lower terrace then collectively became known as The Fratton End. The new Fratton End stand was one of the first in England to be built from prefabricated concrete and steel. The upper and lower tiers of the Fratton End were bisected by a concrete wall which ran across the full width of the new stand, with two large vomitories permitting access to the exterior ground level at the rear of the stand. After its opening, the new Fratton End stand extension was found and blamed for the poor quality of the Fratton Park pitch, as the new stand blocked the usual westerly winds that dried the pitch after rain. A solution was found by installing wind shutters onto the back of the Fratton End's back wall, which were left open on non-match days to allow the drying wind to pass through.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/PompeyHistory/status/1044556274669694976|title=#Pompey built their long-awaited new Fratton End in 1956.

This meant only the original 1905 earthbank lower terrace section could be used for the Fratton End fans, many of whom were displaced to other areas of Fratton Park. The upper half and roof of the Fratton End were subsequently demolished at the end of the 1987-88 season, with Portsmouth being relegated to [[Football League Division Two]] (now 'The Championship'). It had been found that the aggregate obtained from [[The Solent]] used in the 1956 concrete mix contained high levels of sea salt and had caused the upper Fratton End's steel structure to corrode and weaken.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theblizzard.co.uk/article/fratton-park|title=Subscriptions - theBlizzard.co.uk|first=Daykin &|last=Storey|website=theblizzard.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Portsmouth FC were granted planning permission by Portsmouth City Council on 6 October 1988 to build a replacement all-standing Fratton End with a capacity of 4500, designed by architect Michael Newberry.<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWD1MOXD701&activeTab=summary</ref> Plans and drawings indicated that the replacement stand would have closely resembled the size and design of the demolished 1956 stand, and retained Fratton Park's north-west corner terrace.  However, this 1988 stand design was not built as Portsmouth were relegated to Division Two.\n\nMany fans theorise Portsmouth's 1988 relegation from the top flight was in part attributed to the partial closure of the Fratton End, in terms of decreased crowd atmosphere, lower attendances which affected financial earnings. The remaining lower terrace of the Fratton End continued to be used onwards from 1988 for a further nine years up intil 1997, giving the Fratton End a much less impressive appearance and crowd volume than before.  \n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 Hillsborough Disaster, Portsmouth F.C. removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the 1989\u201390 season, except at the Milton End to separate away supporters,<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> although these too were removed for the following 1990-91 season after the Taylor Report was published in January 1990.\n\nOn 14 January 1991, a second new design for a replacement Fratton End was granted a conditional five-year planning permission, which also required the removal of both floodlight towers at the Fratton End.<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWCYMOXD020&activeTab=summary</ref> Architect and planning drawings of the 1991 design showed a tall, all-seated, three-tier stand, with a glass-enclosed middle tier reserved for corporate hospitality boxes. This new Fratton End design with its extended corner wings, would have been the first of a four-phase stand replacement plan which would have completely rebuilt Fratton Park into a modern all-seated enclosed bowl shaped stadium. This 1991 design and its further three phases were not built.\n\nOn 5 May 1995, a third new plan for a replacement Fratton End was granted permission.<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWCSMOXD917&activeTab=summary</ref> The [[Mowlem]] design would have been more modest than its ambitious 1991 predecessor, with a single-tier all-seated stand, with a row of eighteen corporate hospitality boxes situated along the top and back, each holding up to ten people. Plans  showed that the Fratton End's two existing corner floodlight towers would have been removed and replaced with two large lighting towers built directly onto the top of a cantilever-truss Fratton End roof. The plan was not built.\n\nOn 4 April 1996, a fourth plan designed by architects KSS Sports & Leisure Design Ltd for a new Fratton End replacement was granted planning permission by Portsmouth City Council.<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWCRMOXD648&activeTab=summary</ref> Similar to the previous design, the 1996 design would have been a single tier all-seated stand with sixteen corporate hospitality boxes at the top. Again, both of the Fratton End's floodlight towers would have been removed, but replaced with free-standing modern replacements at either side. This 1996 design - yet again - was not built.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, the lower terrace remnant of the Fratton End (and all other stands) was fitted with modern blue plastic seats, making Fratton Park an all seated stadium.\n\nOn 8 July 1997, planning permission was granted for the fifth time in nine years for a Fratton End replacement plan.<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWCQMOXD134&activeTab=summary</ref> However this time, work ''actually began'' on constructing a new Fratton End replacement stand, under the new ownership of club chairman [[Terry Venables]]. The architects of the new Fratton End were KSS Sports & Leisure Design Ltd (the same architects as the 1996 design), along with builders,  TRY Build Limited.\n\nThe summer of 1997 saw the full demolition of the remaining Railway End earthbank - ironically including newly fitted blue seats that had only been installed in 1996. After the site was cleared, TRY Build Ltd began immediate construction on the new single-tier, 4,500 seat, all-seated Fratton End stand - a simpler (and cheaper) design without any corporate boxes and no replacement of the existing floodlight towers. The new Fratton End was much larger than the previous 1956 stand and claimed 6 yards of land previously occupied by the Fratton End \"moat\", which was filled in.  At the same time as the Fratton End was constructed, a new roof extension was built over the uncovered lower tier of the North Stand.  The low and early autumn and winter sunsets behind the new larger, taller Fratton End stand at the western end of the stadium caused a long dark shadow to be cast across the Fratton Park pitch. Additional floodlights had been designed into the rooftop of the new Fratton End stand to counteract negative effects of dark shadows.\n\nWith the Fratton End construction complete, the new \u00a32.2 million Fratton End was cleared for its first \"official\" opening - without ceremony - on Friday 31 October 1997 at 4.59pm - with one minute to spare before a 5pm opening clearance deadline. Problems with some misoriented Fratton End rooftop floodlights had caused the Fratton End of the pitch to be ''\"shrouded in gloom on Hallowe'en\"'', according to the Sky Sports 3 TV commentator, causing some doubt that the live evening televised Division One game against [[Swindon Town]] would take place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeXaJYiBL7o|title=1997-10-31 Portsmouth vs Swindon Town [full match]|last=Swindon-Town-FC.co.uk|date=5 December 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Fortunately, the match referee, [[Paul Danson]] gave the go-ahead for the evening fixture. Unfortunately, the game was won 0-1 by Swindon Town with an official Fratton Park attendance of only 8,707.\n\nInitially, the new Fratton End was officially known as 'The KJC Stand' under a sponsorship agreement with the mobile telephone retailer [[KJC Mobile Phones Limited]] (now dissolved<ref>{{cite web |url=https://companycheck.co.uk/company/03953004/KJC-MOBILE-PHONES-LIMITED/companies-house-data| title=KJC Mobile Phones Limited - Free business summary |author=Company Check Ltd |website=Company Check}}</ref>). As a mark of respect to the club's most famous former player and manager, a large portrait of [[Jimmy Dickinson]] was designed into the seating plan of the new Fratton End stand on its southern wing, with the club's famous crest on the northern wing. The Fratton End is the tallest stand in Fratton Park and has a maximum capacity of 4,500 seats. During construction of the new Fratton End, the connecting north-west corner quadrant stand (similar to 'The Boilermakers Hump') which connected the old Fratton End to the lower terrace of North Stand was also demolished. This provided a new large open space \"gap\" for vehicles to access the Fratton Park pitch as well as a wider exit route for fans.\n\nThe Fratton End later received a formal opening ceremony in Portsmouth F.C.'s 100th Anniversary Year celebrations in a League Division One match against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on Saturday 4 April 1998 - one day before the official 100 year club anniversary on Sunday 5 April 1998.  The match ended 1-1 with an attendance of 14,591 supporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/portsmouth-v-birmingham-city-04-april-1998-183023/|title=Portsmouth v Birmingham City, 04 April 1998|publisher=}}</ref> The Fratton End stand had actually already been opened - without ceremony - on 31 October 1997 earlier in that 1997-98 season.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2005, the Fratton End was commercially branded as \"The Ty Europe Stand\" under a shirt sponsorship agreement with the Ty Europe division of [[Ty Inc.]], the manufacturer of \"Beanie Babies\" soft toys.\n \nStrangely, a large analogue clock which was originally installed and hung beneath the Fratton End roof in 1997, broke during the mid 2000s and was removed 'for repair'. The clock has never been seen since. Rumours persist that a [[Havant]] based clock repair company was not paid and have kept the clock until payment is received.\n\nOn the rear of the Fratton End hangs a pub sign which reads 'The Pompey', and depicts an imagine of football player wearing blue and white Portsmouth home kit from the 1972-73 season.<ref name=\"portsmouthpubs.org.uk\"/><ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\"/> This pub sign originally hung from the former Brickwood Brewery public house called 'The Pompey', designed by Arthur Edward Cogswell in 1900. The former pub on the corner of Frogmore Road and Carisbrooke Road was closed on 19 August 1988 and purchased by Portsmouth F.C. to be used as premises for a club shop, a ticket office and a media centre.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The pub sign was removed and fitted to the rear of the Fratton End stand above the entrance to the Fratton End's own bar.\n\nThe Fratton End is known today for housing the most vocal of Portsmouth FC's home supporters and are arguably, 'the loudest in the land' according to some television commentators. However, this was not always so as before the 1960s, the loudest supporters were to be found at the centreline areas of the North Stand's lower terrace and eastwards along to the Boilermaker's Hump. During the 1960s, a new wave of younger [[Baby boomers|\"baby boomer\"]] Pompey supporters claimed the Fratton End as their own area, which with decades and later generations has since became the loudest area of Fratton Park.\n\n==='The Boilermakers Hump' (or 'Milton Corner')===\n'The Boilermakers Hump' was the twentieth century nickname given to the north-east corner terrace of Fratton Park, located between the North Terrace and Milton End. It is likely that the corner terrace was built as part of upgrades to Fratton Park in 1905, which joined the North Terrace to the newly built Milton End terrace. The corner was also known as the 'Milton Corner'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pompeypress.co.uk/p599463735/h354D330B#h2ac70ba1|title=Vintage - The Pavilion, Fratton Park 1905(Portsmouth FC)|author=|date=|website=pompeypress.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe 'Boilermakers Hump' name originates from men who worked in Portsmouth dockyard who specialised in building and maintaining the steam boilers for the Royal Navy fleet. The Boilermakers met at the north-east corner of Fratton Park on match days, the corner became nicknamed 'The Boilermakers Hump', because the tall curved corner terrace was taller than the Milton End and North Terrace stands and had a hump-like appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7o9cuxFJdw|title=Bravo Pompey (1929)|last=British Path\u00e9|date=13 April 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe Boilermakers had a rowdy reputation. They worked hard and played hard. In an era before floodlit evening matches, the Boilermakers would often sneak out of work early for midweek afternoon matches, leaving work unwashed, dirty and drunk. Because of this reputation, people would steer clear of them, allowing the Boilermakers to claim their own area in Fratton Park for themselves - on the Hump.\n\nIn 1962, floodlight pylon towers were constructed in the four corners of Fratton Park, replacing the original roof-top sets installed in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2015/september/let-there-be-light/|title=LET THERE BE LIGHT|author=|date=|website=portsmouthfc.co.uk}}</ref> The north-east tower was built in the north-east corner of Fratton Park at top of the Boilermakers Hump.\n\nIn 1996, blue plastic seats were fixed onto the remaining Boilermakers Hump terrace, as part of the overall plan to make Fratton Park an all-seater stadium to meet Taylor Report standards.\n\nPresently, the Boilermakers Hump is the closest point in Fratton Park between home fans in the North Stand and the visiting 'away' fans in the Milton End stand. Sadly, the 'Hump' has long lost its distinctive height difference since the North Stand was rebuilt in 1935. 'The Boilermakers Hump' is now mostly occupied by a police and security control room box, scoreboard and the north-east floodlight pylon tower. Seats installed in 1996 were removed from the north-east corner area between 2016 and 2017 to provide a separation zone between the opposing sets of supporters.\n\n==Other structures==\n===\"''The Pompey''\"===\n[[File:2017-01-16_Portsmouth_FC,_Fratton_Park,_Portsmouth.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Fratton Park's Pavilion and the former ''The Pompey'' pub ''(right)'' at 44 Frogmore Road]]\nIn 1900, a year after his earlier work in constructing the early Fratton Park, Portsmouth architect Arthur Cogswell returned and built a Brickwoods Brewery pub for Portsmouth's first chairman, John Brickwood, at 44 Frogmore Road - literally \"next-door\" to Fratton Park stadium. The new pub was named ''The Pompey''. Arthur Cogswell was well known to John Brickwood, as Cogswell had built many other Brickwoods Brewery pubs around the Portsmouth area.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/d6771640d3 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102072851/http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/d6771640d3 |archive-date=2 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Arthur Cogswell was also an enthusiast of association football, having formed an earlier amateur level [[Portsmouth Association Football Club]] (1884 to 1896).\n\nSadly, ''The Pompey'' was closed down in 1988, but the premises were purchased by Portsmouth F.C., who then converted the building into a club souvenir and merchandise shop.

The Fratton Park pavilion was built in the same [[Tudor Revival architecture|mock Tudor]] style as those found in other late 19th century football grounds, such as Fulham F.C.'s Craven Cottage.<ref name=\"h2g2.com\">{{cite web |url=https://h2g2.com/entry/A1139050|title=h2g2 - Portsmouth FC - A History |first=Not Panicking |last=Ltd |website=h2g2.com}}</ref> Fratton Park's pavilion was built immediately to the north of ''The Pompey'' pub which Cogswell had built in 1900.  The north-eastern side of the pavilion featured a tall octagonal clock tower spire featuring a covered spectator gallery beneath it and around the northern side of the pavilion. The pavilion also housed the players dressing rooms and the club offices.<ref name=\"pastscape.org.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1301627 |title=Pastscape - Detailed Result: Fratton Park |website=pastscape.org.uk}}</ref> However, the pavilion's clock tower spire was removed in 1925 to allow space for the construction of the current South Stand, which was designed by the acclaimed Scottish architect, Archibald Leitch. The mock Tudor pavilion facade has for several decades been painted white with black timber frames, but older monochrome photographs clearly show that the pavilion originally had darker walls (possibly beige or cream?) and much lighter coloured (white?) timber frames, as recently as the 1970s, but was later repainted to match the black and white paintwork scheme of ''The Pompey'' pub.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CM8O_LtWwAAoYgh.jpg:large |title=Photo |website=pbs.twimg.com |format=JPG |access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/99/ba/69/99ba69ca77d0068a7da070430f133d53.jpg |title=Photo |website=i.pinimg.com |format=JPG |access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\n===Floodlights===\n[[File:Floodlights_at_Milton_End_of_Fratton_Park_-_geograph.org.uk_-_804206.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The south-east (near) and north-east (far) floodlights at the Milton End and Specks Lane.]]\nPortsmouth FC was the first English football club to stage a Football League match under floodlights, in a 22 February 1956 game against Newcastle United.<ref name=\"football league official site\"/> These original floodlights were positioned at opposite ends on top of the South Stand and North Stand roofs.\n\nOn 5 October 1961, planning permission was granted to Portsmouth FC to construct four new floodlight tower pylons in the four corners of Fratton Park<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=ZZZWDYMOXD798&activeTab=summary</ref>, replacing the original 1956 roof-top sets which were removed after the four new towers were constucted in 1962. The Portsmouth Supporters Club contributed \u00a312,000 (approx \u00a3254,000 in 2018) to the new pylon towers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2015/september/let-there-be-light/|title=1962 Floodlight pylon towers|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, a five-year planning permission was granted to Portsmouth FC by the city council's planning department to remove and replace Fratton Park's four 1962 era corner floodlight lamp towers with a set of modern replacements, to be supplied by Abacus Lighting Limited,<ref>http://publicaccess.portsmouth.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=ZZZWCPMOXD334</ref> although this work was not undertaken following the late-nineties ownership of Terry Venables and Martin Gregory and the subsequent financial crisis that saw the club go into administration in 1999.\n\nIn July 2015, work began by [[Musco Lighting]] to bring pitch illumination up to Championship standards for evening games at Fratton Park. The work was completed in September 2015. The new lamps were installed along the roof edges of the Fratton End, North Stand and Milton End stands of Fratton Park. This new lighting rendered the two northern corner floodlight towers obsolete and they were permanently switched off, with the illumination lamps removed from the north-east tower. At the time, there were no plans to remove the iconic 1962 pylon towers. During initial surveying work, it was discovered that the South Stand roof was not capable of supporting the new lighting equipment, so the decision was taken to keep the two southern corner floodlight towers operational.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/football/pompey/pompey-s-shining-lights-have-given-bright-new-future-1-6986060|title=Pompey's shining lights have given bright new future|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe pylons on the northern side of the ground were deactivated and removed during 2019.

New roof top floodlight lamps were proposed to replace them, to be fitted along the top of a newly refurbished South Stand in time for 2019-20 season. The relocated north-west pylon was planned to have its lamps removed and serve as a historic local landmark and as a telecommunications tower.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/football/portsmouth-fc/planning-chiefs-to-decide-future-of-portsmouth-s-iconic-fratton-park-floodlights-1-8935965|title=Planning chiefs to decide future of Pompey's iconic Fratton Park floodlights|website=portsmouth.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn Tuesday 17 June 2019, the first of Fratton Park's four floodlight pylons was removed with a hydraulic crane, which lifted the north-west pylon down in four sections to the ground.

The gymnasium's former location on Milton Lane is now occupied by the north side of a large Tesco Extra superstore, which was opened in November 2015.

The old stadium has been refurbished and repaired, but the current facilities are showing signs of age. By the time Portsmouth reached the FA Premier League in 2003, other clubs at this level had either built new stadiums or significantly redeveloped existing facilities along modern, less working-class lines, abolishing traditional features which have so far been preserved at Fratton Park, despite relocation being suggested as long ago as the early 1990s. When the Taylor Report of January 1990 required all clubs in the top two divisions to have all-seater stadiums by the [[1994-95 in English football|1994-95 season]], relocation was soon being considered by the Portsmouth board, although Fratton Park was still converted into an all-seater stadium over the next few years, giving it a capacity of over 19,000.\n\nAt the end of the [[2003\u201304 Portsmouth F.C. season|2003&ndash;04 season]], the club having survived its first season in the Premier League, plans were developed to build a new stadium on the site of an adjacent disused rail-freight depot. These plans, which were supported by the city council, would also have allowed a much needed increase in ground capacity, but it was claimed that it would be impossible to achieve on the current footprint because of the close proximity of residential housing.\n\nBefore work could begin, however, the plans were superseded by a new proposal to redevelop more or less on the existing site, but realigning the pitch 90 degrees to accommodate a larger capacity stadium, funded in part by a \"Pompey Village\" residential, hotel and retail project on the adjacent site. Work on the stadium was due to commence in the summer of 2006, and the first phase of the redevelopment completed a year later.\n\nAgain, before work could begin, the plans were dropped, with yet another proposal announced on 25 April 2007 that would see a 36,000-seat stadium on reclaimed mudflats close to [[Portsmouth Naval Base]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Pompey announce new stadium plan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/6591049.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date= 25 April 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2007}}</ref> These plans were ambitious and included creating a leisure village around the stadium, complete with 1,500 waterfront apartments as well as restaurants and other facilities.\n\nThe proposal for a new stadium was widely supported, although cautiously by many that were conscious that the waterfront location proposed in the outline plans would be surrounded on three sides, by the naval base, harbour itself and railway, thus leaving only one end for access by residents and supporters. Critics also pointed out that the mudflats the stadium was proposed to sit on was close to an area of Site of Special Scientific Interest, would be difficult to get to by road and had nowhere near the amount of car parking facilities needed for such an enterprise (Portsmouth is an island, with road access by only three routes from the north, and the waterfront site was close to the south-west extremity of the island).\n\nThese plans were also dropped before work could begin. The club had undertaken consultation and there were a number of objectors to the proposal, no least about the problems that 36,000 fans would cause to the local travel infrastructure. The Royal Navy also said that the proposal would cause problems with the proposed introduction of its new [[Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier|aircraft carriers]].\n\nIn 2008, a fourth set of plans were approved, to build a new 35,000 capacity stadium and leisure/residential complex on [[Horsea Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/east-hampshire/fratton_park_comes_first_as_masterplan_for_stadium_unveiled_1_1304528|title=Fratton Park comes first as masterplan for stadium unveiled |date=26 November 2008|publisher=[[The News (Portsmouth)]]|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref> In 2009 the Horsea Island development was put on hold due to financial issues.<ref name=2009plan>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/east-hampshire/pompey_announce_new_stadium_plan_at_fratton_park_1_1228882|title=Pompey announce new stadium plan at Fratton Park |date=19 March 2009|publisher=[[The News (Portsmouth)]]|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref> The previous proposal to rotate the existing pitch at Fratton Park by 90 degrees was re-instated.<ref name=2009plan/> Work was due to begin late 2009, with a gradual increase in capacity until completion in 2010 ending with a capacity of 30,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/newshome/Fratton-Park-is-set-to.5317962.jp|title=Fratton Park is set to hold 30,000 fans|date=30 May 2009|publisher=[[The News (Portsmouth)]]|accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, plans to spend money redeveloping Fratton Park were announced, with improvements to changing rooms and toilets.

{"title_page": "Game controller", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=May 2019}}\n{{short description|Device used with games or entertainment systems}}\nA '''gaming controller''', or simply '''controller''', is a [[input device]] used with [[Video game|video games]] or entertainment systems to provide input to a video game, typically to control an object or character in the game. Before the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]], plugging in a controller into one of a console's controller ports were the primary means of using a game controller, although since then they have been replaced by wireless controllers, which do not require controller ports on the console but are [[Electric battery|battery]]-powered. [[USB]] game controllers could also be connected to a [[computer]] with a USB port. [[Input devices]] that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as [[steering wheels]] for [[Racing video game|driving games]] and light guns for [[Shooter games|shooting games]], are also game controllers.\n\nGame controllers have been designed and improved over the years to be as user friendly as possible. The [[Xbox (console)|Microsoft Xbox]] controller, with its ''shoulder triggers'' that mimic actual triggers such as those found on guns, has become popular for [[Shooter game|shooting games]].<ref name = \"stanford\">{{cite web|title = Evolution of Video Game Controllers| url = http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/wlu_2003_1.pdf| first = William| last = Lu|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Some controllers are designed to be best for one type of game, such as steering wheels for [[Racing video game|driving games]], or [[dance pad]]s for dancing games.\n\nOne of the first video game controllers was a simple dial and single button, used to control the game ''[[Tennis for Two]]''. Controllers have since evolved to include [[D-pad|directional pads]], multiple buttons, [[analog stick]]s, [[joystick]]s, [[motion detection]], [[touch screen]]s and a plethora of other features.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Gamepad ===\n[[File:Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-FL.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A [[ Nintendo Switch Pro Controller]]]]\n{{Main article|Gamepad}}\n:A [[gamepad]], also known as a joypad, is held in both hands with thumbs and fingers used to provide input. Gamepads can have a number of [[Gamepad|action button]]s combined with one or more omnidirectional control sticks or buttons. Action buttons are generally handled with the digits on the right hand, and the directional input handled with the left. Gamepads are the primary means of input on most modern [[video game console]]s. Due to the ease of use and user-friendly nature of gamepads, they have spread from their origin on traditional consoles to [[computer]]s, where a variety of games and emulators support their input as a replacement for [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] input.<ref name=\"PCGamepad\">{{cite web| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/187658/how_to_use_your_console_gamepad_with_your_PC.html| title = How to use your console gamepad with your PC| accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Most modern game controllers are a variation of a standard gamepad. Common additions include shoulder buttons placed along the edges of the pad, centrally placed buttons labeled ''start'', ''select'', and ''mode'', and an internal motor to provide [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]]. \n:As modern game controllers advance, so too do their user ability qualities. Typically, the controllers become smaller and more compact to more easily, and comfortably, fit within the user's hand. Modern examples can be drawn from systems such as Xbox, whose controller has transformed subtly, yet dramatically, from the original [[Xbox 360 controller]] to the Xbox One controller introduced in 2013.\n:\n\n=== Paddle ===\n[[File:Atari-2600-Paddle-Controller-FR.jpg|thumb|Paddle controllers were popular early in the 2nd console generation for Pong games.]]\n{{Main article|Paddle (game controller)}}\n: A [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] is a controller that features a round wheel and one or more fire buttons. The wheel is typically used to control movement of the player or of an object along one axis of the video screen. As the user turns the wheel further from the default position, the speed of control in the game become more intensive. Paddle controllers were the first analog controllers and they lost popularity when \"paddle and ball\" type games fell out of favor. A variation, the Atari driving controller, appeared on the [[Atari 2600]]. Designed specifically for the game ''[[Indy 500 (1977 video game)|Indy 500]]'', it functioned almost identically in operation and design to the regular paddle controller. The exceptions were that its wheel could be continuously rotated in either direction, and that it was missing the extra paddle included on the previous model. Unlike a spinner, friction prevented the wheel from gaining momentum.\n\n=== Joystick ===\n[[File:PlayStation-Analog-Joystick.jpg|thumb|A dual-joystick controller for the original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]]][[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Arcade-Stick.jpg|thumb|An [[Arcade controller|arcade style controller]] for the Sega [[Dreamcast]].]]\n{{Main article|Joystick}}\n:A [[joystick]] is a [[peripheral]] that consists of a handheld stick that can be tilted around either of two axes and (sometimes) twisted around a third. The joystick is often used for [[flight simulator]]s. [[HOTAS]] (hands on throttle and stick) controllers, composed of a joystick and throttle quadrant (see below) are a popular combination for flight simulation among its most fanatic devotees. Most joysticks are designed to be operated with the user's primary hand (e.g. with the right hand of a right-handed person), with the base either held in the opposite hand or mounted on a desk. [[Arcade controller]]s are typically joysticks featuring a shaft that has a ball or drop-shaped handle, and one or more buttons for in game actions. Generally the layout has the joystick on the left, and the buttons on the right, although there are instances when this is reversed.\n\n=== Trackball ===\n{{Main article|Trackball}}\n: A [[trackball]] is a smooth sphere that is manipulated with the palm of one's hand. The user can roll the ball in any direction to control the cursor. It has the advantage that it can be faster than a mouse depending on the speed of rotation of the physical ball. Another advantage is that it requires less space than a [[Computer mouse|mouse]], which the trackball was a precursor of. Notable uses of a Trackball as a gaming controller would be games such as ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Marble Madness]]'', ''[[Golden Tee Golf]]'' and ''[[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]''.\n\n=== Throttle quadrant ===\n: A throttle quadrant is a set of one or more levers that are most often used to simulate throttles or other similar controls in a real vehicle, particularly an aircraft. Throttle quadrants are most popular in conjunction with joysticks or yokes used in flight simulation.\n\n=== Steering wheel ===\n[[File:Logitech-Driving-Force-PS3.jpg|thumb|A [[Logitech]] steering wheel for the [[PlayStation 3]]]]\n{{Main article|Racing wheel}}\n:A [[Racing wheel]], essentially a larger version of a paddle, is used in most [[racing video game|racing]] [[arcade game]]s as well as more recent [[Sim racing|racing simulators]] such as ''[[Live for Speed]]'', ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'', ''[[GTR 2 \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR2]]'', and ''[[Richard Burns Rally]]''. While most [[Arcade racer|arcade racing]] games have been using steering wheels since ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' in 1974,<ref name=\"Kohler-16\">{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-up: how Japanese video games gave the world an extra life|page=16|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> the first steering wheels for home systems appeared on [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth-generation consoles]] such as the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Nintendo 64]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Many are [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] (see [[Haptic technology|Force Feedback Wheel]]), designed to give the same feedback as would be experienced when driving a real car, but the realism of this depends on the game. They usually come with pedals to control the gas and brake. Shifting is taken care of in various ways including paddle shifting systems, simple stick shifters which are moved forward or back to change gears or more complex shifters which mimic those of real vehicles, which may also use a clutch. Most wheels turn only 200 to 270 degrees lock-to-lock but some models, such as the [[Logitech]] [[Driving Force Pro]], [[Logitech G25]] and [[Logitech G27]] can turn 900 degrees, or 2.5 turns, lock-to-lock. The [[Namco]] [[Jogcon]] paddle was available for the PlayStation game ''[[R4: Ridge Racer Type 4]]''. Unlike \"real\" video game steering wheels, the Jogcon was designed to fit in the player's hand. Its much smaller wheel (diameter roughly similar to a [[aluminum can|soda can]]'s) resembles the jog-and-shuttle control wheel used on some [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s. The [[Nintendo Wii]] game ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' is bundled with the [[Wii Wheel]]: a steering wheel-shaped shell that the [[Wii Remote]] is placed inside thus using the Wii Remote's motion sensing capabilities to control the [[Go-kart|kart]] during the game. Hori also has a steering wheel that is made for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''. When the steering wheel is placed on the back of the console, then it will have the same ability as in ''Mario Kart Wii'' by using the [[gyroscope]] in [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] mode.\n\n=== Yoke ===\n: A yoke is very similar to a steering wheel except that it resembles the control yoke found on many aircraft and has two axes of movement: not only rotational movement about the shaft of the yoke, but also a forward-and-backward axis equivalent to that of pitch control on the yoke of an aircraft. Some yokes have additional controls attached directly to the yoke for simulation of aircraft functions such as radio push-to-talk buttons. Some flight simulator sets that include yokes also come with various other aircraft controls such as throttle quadrants and pedals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.logitechg.com/en-roeu/products/flight/flight-simulator-yoke-system.html|title=Logitech G Flight Simulator Yoke System with Throttle Quadrant|website=www.logitechg.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref> These sets, including the yoke, are intended to be used in a [[flight simulator]].\n\n=== Pedals ===\n:[[File:LDFGT.JPG|thumb|Logitech Driving Force GT]]Pedals may be used for driving simulations or flight simulations and often ships with a steering-wheel-type input device.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Shelly|first=Gary|last2=Vermaat|first2=Misty|publisher=Course Technology Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=9781423927020|location=Boston, MA|pages=172}}</ref> In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates rudder controls and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals. There are also variations of the pedal controller such as the proposed rotating pedal device for a cycling game, which relies on an ergometer to generate user inputs such as pedal rpm and pedal resistance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Chorianopoulos|first=Konstantinos|last2=Divitini|first2=Monica|last3=Hauge|first3=Jannicke|last4=Jaccheri|first4=Letizia|last5=Malaka|first5=Rainer|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319245881|location=Heidelberg|pages=158}}</ref> A variation of this concept surfaced in 2016 when a startup called VirZoom debuted a set of sensors that can be installed in the pedal and handlebars, turning a physical bike into one controller for games on the [[HTC Vive]] and [[Oculus Rift]] [[Virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]] platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/virzoom-vr-game-controller,news-22601.html|title=This Bike Lets You Pedal Through Virtual Reality|last=Michaels|first=Philip|date=2016-04-28|work=Tom's Guide|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}</ref> The same concept is behind a product called Cyber ExerCycle,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyberbiking.com/|title=Cyber ExerCycle: Interactive Exercise Bike Kit|last=Ltd.|first=Universal Timer|website=www.cyberbiking.com|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> which is a set of sensors attached to the pedal and connected to the PC via [[USB]] for bicycle simulation games such as NetAthlon and [[Fuel (video game)|Fuel]].\n\n[[File:W-A-S-D.jpg|thumb|The [[Arrow keys#WASD keys|WASD]] KEYBOARD setup is used widely, but by no means universally.]]\n\n=== Mouse and keyboard ===\n: A [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] and [[computer keyboard]] are typical [[input device]]s for a [[personal computer]] and are currently the main game controllers for [[Video game|computer game]]s. The mouse is often used with a [[mousepad]] to achieve greater speed, comfort, accuracy and smoother movement for the gamer. Some video game consoles also have the ability to function with a keyboard and a mouse. The computer keyboard is modelled after the [[typewriter keyboard]] and was designed for the input of written text. A mouse is a handheld [[pointing device]] used in addition to the keyboard. For games, the keyboard typically controls movement of the character while the mouse is used to control the game camera or used for aiming. While originally designed for general computer input, there are several keyboard and mouse peripherals available which are designed specifically for gaming, often with gaming-specific functions built-in. Examples include peripherals by [[Razer USA|Razer]], the \"Zboard\" range of keyboards and [[Logitech]]'s 'G' series. The numeric [[Keyboard technology|keypad]] found on the keyboard is also used as a game controller and can be found on a number of separate devices, most notably early consoles, usually attached to a joystick or a paddle. The keypad is a small grid of keys with at least the digits 0-9. A [[Gaming keypad]] is a specialized controller used for [[first-person shooter|FPSs]], [[Real-time strategy|RTSs]] and some arcade type games. These controllers can be programmed to allow the emulation of keys, and macros in some cases. These generally resemble a small part of a keyboard but may also feature other inputs such as [[analog stick]]s. They were developed because some of these games require a keyboard to play, and some players find this to be awkward for such a task.\n\n=== Touchscreen ===\n:[[File:Nintendo-DS-Lite-w-stylus.png|thumb|240px|Nintendo DS touchscreen (bottom) with [[stylus]].]]A [[touchscreen]] is an input device that allows the user to interact with the computer by touching the display screen. The first attempt at a [[handheld game console]] with touchscreen controls was Sega's intended successor to the [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the high cost of touchscreen technology in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p7.html|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|page=7|website=IGN|first=Travis|last=Fahs|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref> The first released console to use a touchscreen was the [[Tiger Electronics|Tiger]] [[game.com]] in 1997. Nintendo popularized it for use in video games with the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]]; other systems including the [[Tapwave Zodiac]] as well as [[Smartphone]]s and the vast majority of [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] have also included this feature. The primary controller for Nintendo's [[Wii U]] console, the [[Wii U GamePad]], features an embedded touchscreen. Modern touch screens use a thin, durable, transparent plastic sheet overlaid onto a glass screen. The location of a touch is calculated from the [[capacitance]] for the X and Y [[Coordinate system|axes]], which varies based upon where the sheet is touched. One console that is touchscreen, but is not manufactured by Nintendo is Sony's PlayStation Vita which has a 5 inch OLED touchscreen. The [[Nintendo Switch]] features a 6.2 inch touchscreen.\n\n=== Breathing controllers ===\n: Breathing controllers help their users improve breathing through video games. All controllers have sensors that sense users breath, with which user controls video game on computer, tablet or on smartphone. Alvio is a breathing trainer, symptom tracker and mobile game controller.<ref name=\"Crain's\">{{cite web |title=Gadget gurus proliferate in NY's tech scene |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20141021/SMALLBIZ/310199994/gadget-gurus-proliferate-in-nys-tech-scene# |work=Crain's New York Business |accessdate=2015-05-21 |last=Field |first=Anne |date=2014-04-21}}</ref> Zenytime promotes deep, rhythmic breathing to trigger short-term rewards of controlled breathing (relaxation, improved oxygenation...).<ref name=\"Gizmag\">{{cite web |title=Zenytime games are controlled by your breathing to improve wellbeing |url=http://www.gizmag.com/zenytime/33802/ |work=Gizmag |accessdate=2015-05-21 |last=Roberts |first=Stu |date=2014-09-15}}</ref> Breathing games by Breathing Labs are based on [[Pursed lip breathing]] and are used on [[iPhone]] / [[iPad]], [[Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"MEi\">{{cite web |title=Breathing through pursed lips aids in reducing stress anxiety |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/meicogsci/php/ocs/index.php/meicog/meicog2012/paper/view/366 |work= MEi |accessdate=2015-05-21 |last=Miku\u0161 |first=Nace |last2=Leskov\u0161ek |first2=Matev\u017e |date=2012-06-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Motion sensing ===\n[[File:Wii Remote Image.jpg|thumb|Wii Remote.]]\n: [[Motion controller]]s include the [[Sega Activator]], released in 1993 for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] (Genesis).

The [[Sixaxis]], [[DualShock 3]], and [[PlayStation Move]] controllers for Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] system have similar motion sensing capabilities. In 2010, Microsoft released the [[Kinect]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. This motion sensing controller uses cameras to track a players movement. Microsoft released a revised version of the Kinect with the launch of the [[Xbox One]]. This controller was bundled with the console on launch, and was removed from the default bundle in June 2014. Sony's [[EyeToy]] similarly uses cameras to detect the player's motions and translate them into inputs for the game.\n\n=== Light gun ===\n[[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Lightgun-FL.jpg|thumb|The Dreamcast light gun]]\n{{Main article|Light gun}}\n: A [[light gun]] is a peripheral used to \"shoot\" targets on a screen. They usually roughly resemble firearms or ray guns. Their use is normally limited to [[rail shooter]]s, or [[Shooter game#Shooting gallery|shooting gallery]] games like [[Duck Hunt]] and those which came with the ''[[Shooting Gallery (game accessory)|Shooting Gallery]]'' light gun. A rare example of a non-rail first person shooter game is [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s 1992 [[video game]] ''Gun Buster'', a [[first-person shooter]] that used a [[joystick]] to move and a light gun to [[Free look|aim]].<ref>{{KLOV game|8036|Gun Buster}}</ref> Though light guns have been used in earlier [[arcade game]]s such as [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sega Periscope|Periscope]]'' in 1966<ref>Ashcraft, Brian (2008), ''Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers'', p. 133, Kodansha International</ref> and ''Missile'' in 1969,<ref>{{KLOV game|10600|Missile}}</ref> the first home console light gun was released for the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] in 1972; later on, [[Nintendo]] would include one standard on their Famicom and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], called the [[NES Zapper]]. Nintendo has also released a \"shell\" in the style of a light gun for the more recent [[Wii Remote]] called the [[Wii Zapper]] which comes bundled with the game ''[[Link's Crossbow Training]]''.\n\n=== Rhythm game controllers ===\n\n[[File:Guitar Hero series controllers.jpg|thumb|Guitar controllers.]]\n: A [[Rhythm game accessories]] used for [[rhythm games]] can resemble musical instruments, such as [[guitar]]s (from 5-button guitars in ''[[Guitar Freaks]]'', the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' series, the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series to real guitars in ''[[Rock Band 3]]'' and ''[[Rocksmith]]''), [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s (''Rock Band 3''), [[drum]]s (''[[Donkey Konga]]'', ''[[Drum Mania]]'', the ''Rock Band'' series and the ''Guitar Hero'' series), or [[maraca]]s (''[[Samba de Amigo]]'') have also seen some success in arcades and home consoles. Other rhythm games are based around the art of Djing or [[turntablism]] (''[[DJ Hero]]''), or playing a [[synthesizer]] (''[[IIDX]]'')  using a [[Turntablism|turntable]] shaped peripheral with buttons.\n\n=== Wireless ===\n: [[Wireless]] versions of many popular controller types (joypads, mice, keyboards) exist, and wireless motion controls are an emerging class for virtual reality.\n\n=== Others ===\n* Pinball controllers and multi-button consoles for strategy games were released in the past, but their popularity was limited to hardcore fans of the genre.\n* [[Dance pad]]s, essentially a grid of flat pressure-sensitive gamepad buttons set on a mat meant to be stepped on, have seen niche success with the popularity of rhythm games like ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' and ''[[Pump It Up (video game)|Pump It Up]]''. The dance pad was first introduced by Bandai on the Famicom in 1986 as a part of their \"Family Fun Fitness\" set, then Exus released the \"Foot Craz\" pad for the Atari 2600 in 1987. Nintendo purchased the technology from Bandai in 1988 and used it on their \"Power Pad\", for the Famicom and NES.\n* [[Balance board]]: The [[Wii Balance Board]] comes with the game ''[[Wii Fit]]''. Several other game are in development which will be compatible with the balance board. This was preceded by decades by the ''[[Joyboard]]'', made to plug into an Atari 2600, to play skiing and surfing games.\n* Buzzers: A recent example of specialized, while very simple, game controllers, is the four large \"buzzers\" (round buttons) supplied with the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 [[Game show|quiz show]] game series ''[[Buzz!]]'' (2005\u2013present); both game and controllers clearly being inspired by the television show genre.\n* [[NeGcon]]: is a unique controller for racing games on the PlayStation. Physically it resembles a gamepad, but its left and right halves twist relative to each other, making it a variation of the paddle controller.\n* [[Microphone]]: A few games have made successes in using a headset or microphone as a secondary controller, such as ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'', the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series, the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], the ''[[SingStar]]'' series, ''[[Tom Clancy's Endwar]]'', the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, and the ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' series. The use of these microphones allowed players to issue commands to the game, controlling teammates (as in ''SOCOM'') and other AI characters (e.g., Pikachu). The [[Nintendo DS]] features a microphone that is built into the system. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including [[speech recognition]] (''[[Nintendogs]]'', ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]''), chatting online between and during gameplay sessions ([[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]), and minigames that require the player to blow or shout into the microphone (''[[Feel the Magic: XY/XX]]'', ''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'', ''[[Mario Party DS]]'').\n* ''[[Steel Battalion]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] was bundled with a full dashboard, with 2 joysticks and over 30 buttons, in an attempt to make it feel like an actual mecha simulator.\n* [[Fishing rod]]: the first fishing rod controller appeared as an accessory for the [[Dreamcast]] video console for playing ''[[Sega Marine Fishing]]''. Later other games for PlayStation console use also a similar controllers.\n* [[Fog display|Floating Interactive Display]]: at least two commercial systems ([[Heliodisplay]] and [http://fogscreen.com/ FogScreen]) offer interactive \"floating interfaces\" which display an image projected in mid-air but can be interacted with by finger similar to a touch screen.\n* [[Brain\u2013computer interface|Mind-controlled]] headset: As of March 24, 2007 a United States/Australian company called [[Emotiv Systems]] began launching a mind-controlled device for [[video game]]s based on [[electroencephalography]]. It was reported by [[The Wall Street Journal]]'s Don Clark on [[MSNBC]].<ref name=\"MSNBC report\">{{cite web|url=http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-us&brand=msnbc&tab=m5&rf=&from=00&vid=09e9f856-63f3-40cd-83e6-eb6f2910a31c| publisher=MSNBC|title=Video Game Mind Control|accessdate=2007-03-25|year=2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n* [[PCGamerBike]] similar to a pair of pedals removed from an exercise bike, then set down in front of a chair & used to precisely control game characters instead.\n* [[Optical motion tracking]] systems such as [[TrackIR]] and [[FreeTrack]] use a video camera to track an infrared illuminated or emissive headpiece. Small head movements are tracked and then translated into much larger virtual in-game movements, allowing hands-free view control and improved immersiveness.\n* Mechanical motion tracking systems like [[Gametrak]] use cables attached to gloves for tracking position of physical elements in [[three-dimensional space]] in [[wiktionary:real time|real time]]. The Gametrak mechanism contains a retracting cable reel and a small tubular guide arm from which the cable passes out. The guide arm is articulated in a [[ball joint]] such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. The distance of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure the rotation of the spool drum for the retracting cable reel, and calculating how far the cable is extended.\n* Exoskeleton controllers use exoskeleton technology to provide the player with different responses based on the player's body position, speed of movement, and other sensed data. In addition to audio and visual responses, an exoskeleton controller may provide a controlled resistance to movement and other stimuli to provide realism to the action. This not only lets players feel as if they are actually performing the function, but also helps reinforce the correct muscle pattern for the activity being simulated. The Forcetek XIO is an example of an exoskeleton video game controller.\n* [[Flight instruments|Instrument panels]] are simulated aircraft instrument panels, either generic or specific to a real aircraft, that are used in place of the keyboard to send commands to a flight simulation program. Some of these are far more expensive than all the rest of a computer system combined. The panels usually only simulate switches, buttons, and controls, rather than output instrument displays.\n** Train controls: Other instrument panel like hardware such as train controls have been produced.

Before the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]], plugging in a controller into one of a console's controller ports were the primary means of using a game controller, although since then they have been replaced by wireless controllers, which do not require controller ports on the console but are [[Electric battery|battery]]-powered. [[USB]] game controllers could also be connected to a [[computer]] with a USB port. [[Input devices]] that have been classified as game controllers include keyboards, mouses, gamepads, joysticks, etc. Special purpose devices, such as [[steering wheels]] for [[Racing video game|driving games]] and light guns for [[Shooter games|shooting games]], are also game controllers.\n\nGame controllers have been designed and improved over the years to be as user friendly as possible. The [[Xbox (console)|Microsoft Xbox]] controller, with its ''shoulder triggers'' that mimic actual triggers such as those found on guns, has become popular for [[Shooter game|shooting games]].<ref name = \"stanford\">{{cite web|title = Evolution of Video Game Controllers| url = http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/wlu_2003_1.pdf| first = William| last = Lu|accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Some controllers are designed to be best for one type of game, such as steering wheels for [[Racing video game|driving games]], or [[dance pad]]s for dancing games.\n\nOne of the first video game controllers was a simple dial and single button, used to control the game ''[[Tennis for Two]]''. Controllers have since evolved to include [[D-pad|directional pads]], multiple buttons, [[analog stick]]s, [[joystick]]s, [[motion detection]], [[touch screen]]s and a plethora of other features.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{Cleanup|section|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Gamepad ===\n[[File:Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-FL.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A [[ Nintendo Switch Pro Controller]]]]\n{{Main article|Gamepad}}\n:A [[gamepad]], also known as a joypad, is held in both hands with thumbs and fingers used to provide input. Gamepads can have a number of [[Gamepad|action button]]s combined with one or more omnidirectional control sticks or buttons. Action buttons are generally handled with the digits on the right hand, and the directional input handled with the left. Gamepads are the primary means of input on most modern [[video game console]]s. Due to the ease of use and user-friendly nature of gamepads, they have spread from their origin on traditional consoles to [[computer]]s, where a variety of games and emulators support their input as a replacement for [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] input.<ref name=\"PCGamepad\">{{cite web| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/187658/how_to_use_your_console_gamepad_with_your_PC.html| title = How to use your console gamepad with your PC| accessdate = March 28, 2013}}</ref> Most modern game controllers are a variation of a standard gamepad. Common additions include shoulder buttons placed along the edges of the pad, centrally placed buttons labeled ''start'', ''select'', and ''mode'', and an internal motor to provide [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]]. \n:As modern game controllers advance, so too do their user ability qualities. Typically, the controllers become smaller and more compact to more easily, and comfortably, fit within the user's hand. Modern examples can be drawn from systems such as Xbox, whose controller has transformed subtly, yet dramatically, from the original [[Xbox 360 controller]] to the Xbox One controller introduced in 2013.\n:\n\n=== Paddle ===\n[[File:Atari-2600-Paddle-Controller-FR.jpg|thumb|Paddle controllers were popular early in the 2nd console generation for Pong games.]]\n{{Main article|Paddle (game controller)}}\n: A [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] is a controller that features a round wheel and one or more fire buttons. The wheel is typically used to control movement of the player or of an object along one axis of the video screen. As the user turns the wheel further from the default position, the speed of control in the game become more intensive. Paddle controllers were the first analog controllers and they lost popularity when \"paddle and ball\" type games fell out of favor. A variation, the Atari driving controller, appeared on the [[Atari 2600]]. Designed specifically for the game ''[[Indy 500 (1977 video game)|Indy 500]]'', it functioned almost identically in operation and design to the regular paddle controller. The exceptions were that its wheel could be continuously rotated in either direction, and that it was missing the extra paddle included on the previous model. Unlike a spinner, friction prevented the wheel from gaining momentum.\n\n=== Joystick ===\n[[File:PlayStation-Analog-Joystick.jpg|thumb|A dual-joystick controller for the original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]]][[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Arcade-Stick.jpg|thumb|An [[Arcade controller|arcade style controller]] for the Sega [[Dreamcast]].]]\n{{Main article|Joystick}}\n:A [[joystick]] is a [[peripheral]] that consists of a handheld stick that can be tilted around either of two axes and (sometimes) twisted around a third. The joystick is often used for [[flight simulator]]s. [[HOTAS]] (hands on throttle and stick) controllers, composed of a joystick and throttle quadrant (see below) are a popular combination for flight simulation among its most fanatic devotees. Most joysticks are designed to be operated with the user's primary hand (e.g. with the right hand of a right-handed person), with the base either held in the opposite hand or mounted on a desk. [[Arcade controller]]s are typically joysticks featuring a shaft that has a ball or drop-shaped handle, and one or more buttons for in game actions. Generally the layout has the joystick on the left, and the buttons on the right, although there are instances when this is reversed.\n\n=== Trackball ===\n{{Main article|Trackball}}\n: A [[trackball]] is a smooth sphere that is manipulated with the palm of one's hand. The user can roll the ball in any direction to control the cursor. It has the advantage that it can be faster than a mouse depending on the speed of rotation of the physical ball. Another advantage is that it requires less space than a [[Computer mouse|mouse]], which the trackball was a precursor of. Notable uses of a Trackball as a gaming controller would be games such as ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Marble Madness]]'', ''[[Golden Tee Golf]]'' and ''[[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]''.\n\n=== Throttle quadrant ===\n: A throttle quadrant is a set of one or more levers that are most often used to simulate throttles or other similar controls in a real vehicle, particularly an aircraft. Throttle quadrants are most popular in conjunction with joysticks or yokes used in flight simulation.\n\n=== Steering wheel ===\n[[File:Logitech-Driving-Force-PS3.jpg|thumb|A [[Logitech]] steering wheel for the [[PlayStation 3]]]]\n{{Main article|Racing wheel}}\n:A [[Racing wheel]], essentially a larger version of a paddle, is used in most [[racing video game|racing]] [[arcade game]]s as well as more recent [[Sim racing|racing simulators]] such as ''[[Live for Speed]]'', ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'', ''[[GTR 2 \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR2]]'', and ''[[Richard Burns Rally]]''. While most [[Arcade racer|arcade racing]] games have been using steering wheels since ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' in 1974,<ref name=\"Kohler-16\">{{citation|author=Chris Kohler|year=2005|title=Power-up: how Japanese video games gave the world an extra life|page=16|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> the first steering wheels for home systems appeared on [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth-generation consoles]] such as the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Nintendo 64]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Many are [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] (see [[Haptic technology|Force Feedback Wheel]]), designed to give the same feedback as would be experienced when driving a real car, but the realism of this depends on the game. They usually come with pedals to control the gas and brake. Shifting is taken care of in various ways including paddle shifting systems, simple stick shifters which are moved forward or back to change gears or more complex shifters which mimic those of real vehicles, which may also use a clutch. Most wheels turn only 200 to 270 degrees lock-to-lock but some models, such as the [[Logitech]] [[Driving Force Pro]], [[Logitech G25]] and [[Logitech G27]] can turn 900 degrees, or 2.5 turns, lock-to-lock. The [[Namco]] [[Jogcon]] paddle was available for the PlayStation game ''[[R4: Ridge Racer Type 4]]''. Unlike \"real\" video game steering wheels, the Jogcon was designed to fit in the player's hand. Its much smaller wheel (diameter roughly similar to a [[aluminum can|soda can]]'s) resembles the jog-and-shuttle control wheel used on some [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]]s. The [[Nintendo Wii]] game ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' is bundled with the [[Wii Wheel]]: a steering wheel-shaped shell that the [[Wii Remote]] is placed inside thus using the Wii Remote's motion sensing capabilities to control the [[Go-kart|kart]] during the game. Hori also has a steering wheel that is made for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''. When the steering wheel is placed on the back of the console, then it will have the same ability as in ''Mario Kart Wii'' by using the [[gyroscope]] in [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] mode.\n\n=== Yoke ===\n: A yoke is very similar to a steering wheel except that it resembles the control yoke found on many aircraft and has two axes of movement: not only rotational movement about the shaft of the yoke, but also a forward-and-backward axis equivalent to that of pitch control on the yoke of an aircraft. Some yokes have additional controls attached directly to the yoke for simulation of aircraft functions such as radio push-to-talk buttons. Some flight simulator sets that include yokes also come with various other aircraft controls such as throttle quadrants and pedals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.logitechg.com/en-roeu/products/flight/flight-simulator-yoke-system.html|title=Logitech G Flight Simulator Yoke System with Throttle Quadrant|website=www.logitechg.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref> These sets, including the yoke, are intended to be used in a [[flight simulator]].\n\n=== Pedals ===\n:[[File:LDFGT.JPG|thumb|Logitech Driving Force GT]]Pedals may be used for driving simulations or flight simulations and often ships with a steering-wheel-type input device.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Shelly|first=Gary|last2=Vermaat|first2=Misty|publisher=Course Technology Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=9781423927020|location=Boston, MA|pages=172}}</ref> In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates rudder controls and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals. There are also variations of the pedal controller such as the proposed rotating pedal device for a cycling game, which relies on an ergometer to generate user inputs such as pedal rpm and pedal resistance.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Discovering Computers: Fundamentals|last=Chorianopoulos|first=Konstantinos|last2=Divitini|first2=Monica|last3=Hauge|first3=Jannicke|last4=Jaccheri|first4=Letizia|last5=Malaka|first5=Rainer|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319245881|location=Heidelberg|pages=158}}</ref> A variation of this concept surfaced in 2016 when a startup called VirZoom debuted a set of sensors that can be installed in the pedal and handlebars, turning a physical bike into one controller for games on the [[HTC Vive]] and [[Oculus Rift]] [[Virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]] platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/virzoom-vr-game-controller,news-22601.html|title=This Bike Lets You Pedal Through Virtual Reality|last=Michaels|first=Philip|date=2016-04-28|work=Tom's Guide|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}</ref> The same concept is behind a product called Cyber ExerCycle,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyberbiking.com/|title=Cyber ExerCycle: Interactive Exercise Bike Kit|last=Ltd.|first=Universal Timer|website=www.cyberbiking.com|access-date=2018-08-21}}</ref> which is a set of sensors attached to the pedal and connected to the PC via [[USB]] for bicycle simulation games such as NetAthlon and [[Fuel (video game)|Fuel]].\n\n[[File:W-A-S-D.jpg|thumb|The [[Arrow keys#WASD keys|WASD]] KEYBOARD setup is used widely, but by no means universally.]]\n\n=== Mouse and keyboard ===\n: A [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] and [[computer keyboard]] are typical [[input device]]s for a [[personal computer]] and are currently the main game controllers for [[Video game|computer game]]s. The mouse is often used with a [[mousepad]] to achieve greater speed, comfort, accuracy and smoother movement for the gamer. Some video game consoles also have the ability to function with a keyboard and a mouse. The computer keyboard is modelled after the [[typewriter keyboard]] and was designed for the input of written text. A mouse is a handheld [[pointing device]] used in addition to the keyboard. For games, the keyboard typically controls movement of the character while the mouse is used to control the game camera or used for aiming. While originally designed for general computer input, there are several keyboard and mouse peripherals available which are designed specifically for gaming, often with gaming-specific functions built-in. Examples include peripherals by [[Razer USA|Razer]], the \"Zboard\" range of keyboards and [[Logitech]]'s 'G' series. The numeric [[Keyboard technology|keypad]] found on the keyboard is also used as a game controller and can be found on a number of separate devices, most notably early consoles, usually attached to a joystick or a paddle. The keypad is a small grid of keys with at least the digits 0-9. A [[Gaming keypad]] is a specialized controller used for [[first-person shooter|FPSs]], [[Real-time strategy|RTSs]] and some arcade type games. These controllers can be programmed to allow the emulation of keys, and macros in some cases. These generally resemble a small part of a keyboard but may also feature other inputs such as [[analog stick]]s. They were developed because some of these games require a keyboard to play, and some players find this to be awkward for such a task.\n\n=== Touchscreen ===\n:[[File:Nintendo-DS-Lite-w-stylus.png|thumb|240px|Nintendo DS touchscreen (bottom) with [[stylus]].]]A [[touchscreen]] is an input device that allows the user to interact with the computer by touching the display screen. The first attempt at a [[handheld game console]] with touchscreen controls was Sega's intended successor to the [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the high cost of touchscreen technology in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p7.html|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|page=7|website=IGN|first=Travis|last=Fahs|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref> The first released console to use a touchscreen was the [[Tiger Electronics|Tiger]] [[game.com]] in 1997. Nintendo popularized it for use in video games with the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]]; other systems including the [[Tapwave Zodiac]] as well as [[Smartphone]]s and the vast majority of [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] have also included this feature. The primary controller for Nintendo's [[Wii U]] console, the [[Wii U GamePad]], features an embedded touchscreen. Modern touch screens use a thin, durable, transparent plastic sheet overlaid onto a glass screen. The location of a touch is calculated from the [[capacitance]] for the X and Y [[Coordinate system|axes]], which varies based upon where the sheet is touched. One console that is touchscreen, but is not manufactured by Nintendo is Sony's PlayStation Vita which has a 5 inch OLED touchscreen. The [[Nintendo Switch]] features a 6.2 inch touchscreen.\n\n=== Breathing controllers ===\n: Breathing controllers help their users improve breathing through video games. All controllers have sensors that sense users breath, with which user controls video game on computer, tablet or on smartphone.

The [[Sixaxis]], [[DualShock 3]], and [[PlayStation Move]] controllers for Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] system have similar motion sensing capabilities. In 2010, Microsoft released the [[Kinect]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. This motion sensing controller uses cameras to track a players movement. Microsoft released a revised version of the Kinect with the launch of the [[Xbox One]]. This controller was bundled with the console on launch, and was removed from the default bundle in June 2014. Sony's [[EyeToy]] similarly uses cameras to detect the player's motions and translate them into inputs for the game.\n\n=== Light gun ===\n[[File:Sega-Dreamcast-Lightgun-FL.jpg|thumb|The Dreamcast light gun]]\n{{Main article|Light gun}}\n: A [[light gun]] is a peripheral used to \"shoot\" targets on a screen. They usually roughly resemble firearms or ray guns. Their use is normally limited to [[rail shooter]]s, or [[Shooter game#Shooting gallery|shooting gallery]] games like [[Duck Hunt]] and those which came with the ''[[Shooting Gallery (game accessory)|Shooting Gallery]]'' light gun. A rare example of a non-rail first person shooter game is [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s 1992 [[video game]] ''Gun Buster'', a [[first-person shooter]] that used a [[joystick]] to move and a light gun to [[Free look|aim]].<ref>{{KLOV game|8036|Gun Buster}}</ref> Though light guns have been used in earlier [[arcade game]]s such as [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sega Periscope|Periscope]]'' in 1966<ref>Ashcraft, Brian (2008), ''Arcade Mania! The Turbo Charged World of Japan's Game Centers'', p. 133, Kodansha International</ref> and ''Missile'' in 1969,<ref>{{KLOV game|10600|Missile}}</ref> the first home console light gun was released for the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] in 1972; later on, [[Nintendo]] would include one standard on their Famicom and [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], called the [[NES Zapper]]. Nintendo has also released a \"shell\" in the style of a light gun for the more recent [[Wii Remote]] called the [[Wii Zapper]] which comes bundled with the game ''[[Link's Crossbow Training]]''.\n\n=== Rhythm game controllers ===\n\n[[File:Guitar Hero series controllers.jpg|thumb|Guitar controllers.]]\n: A [[Rhythm game accessories]] used for [[rhythm games]] can resemble musical instruments, such as [[guitar]]s (from 5-button guitars in ''[[Guitar Freaks]]'', the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' series, the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series to real guitars in ''[[Rock Band 3]]'' and ''[[Rocksmith]]''), [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s (''Rock Band 3''), [[drum]]s (''[[Donkey Konga]]'', ''[[Drum Mania]]'', the ''Rock Band'' series and the ''Guitar Hero'' series), or [[maraca]]s (''[[Samba de Amigo]]'') have also seen some success in arcades and home consoles. Other rhythm games are based around the art of Djing or [[turntablism]] (''[[DJ Hero]]''), or playing a [[synthesizer]] (''[[IIDX]]'')  using a [[Turntablism|turntable]] shaped peripheral with buttons.\n\n=== Wireless ===\n: [[Wireless]] versions of many popular controller types (joypads, mice, keyboards) exist, and wireless motion controls are an emerging class for virtual reality.\n\n=== Others ===\n* Pinball controllers and multi-button consoles for strategy games were released in the past, but their popularity was limited to hardcore fans of the genre.\n* [[Dance pad]]s, essentially a grid of flat pressure-sensitive gamepad buttons set on a mat meant to be stepped on, have seen niche success with the popularity of rhythm games like ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' and ''[[Pump It Up (video game)|Pump It Up]]''. The dance pad was first introduced by Bandai on the Famicom in 1986 as a part of their \"Family Fun Fitness\" set, then Exus released the \"Foot Craz\" pad for the Atari 2600 in 1987. Nintendo purchased the technology from Bandai in 1988 and used it on their \"Power Pad\", for the Famicom and NES.\n* [[Balance board]]: The [[Wii Balance Board]] comes with the game ''[[Wii Fit]]''. Several other game are in development which will be compatible with the balance board. This was preceded by decades by the ''[[Joyboard]]'', made to plug into an Atari 2600, to play skiing and surfing games.\n* Buzzers: A recent example of specialized, while very simple, game controllers, is the four large \"buzzers\" (round buttons) supplied with the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 [[Game show|quiz show]] game series ''[[Buzz!]]'' (2005\u2013present); both game and controllers clearly being inspired by the television show genre.\n* [[NeGcon]]: is a unique controller for racing games on the PlayStation. Physically it resembles a gamepad, but its left and right halves twist relative to each other, making it a variation of the paddle controller.\n* [[Microphone]]: A few games have made successes in using a headset or microphone as a secondary controller, such as ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'', the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series, the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]], the ''[[SingStar]]'' series, ''[[Tom Clancy's Endwar]]'', the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, and the ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs]]'' series. The use of these microphones allowed players to issue commands to the game, controlling teammates (as in ''SOCOM'') and other AI characters (e.g., Pikachu). The [[Nintendo DS]] features a microphone that is built into the system. It has been used for a variety of purposes, including [[speech recognition]] (''[[Nintendogs]]'', ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]''), chatting online between and during gameplay sessions ([[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']]), and minigames that require the player to blow or shout into the microphone (''[[Feel the Magic: XY/XX]]'', ''[[WarioWare: Touched!]]'', ''[[Mario Party DS]]'').\n* ''[[Steel Battalion]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] was bundled with a full dashboard, with 2 joysticks and over 30 buttons, in an attempt to make it feel like an actual mecha simulator.\n* [[Fishing rod]]: the first fishing rod controller appeared as an accessory for the [[Dreamcast]] video console for playing ''[[Sega Marine Fishing]]''. Later other games for PlayStation console use also a similar controllers.\n* [[Fog display|Floating Interactive Display]]: at least two commercial systems ([[Heliodisplay]] and [http://fogscreen.com/ FogScreen]) offer interactive \"floating interfaces\" which display an image projected in mid-air but can be interacted with by finger similar to a touch screen.\n* [[Brain\u2013computer interface|Mind-controlled]] headset: As of March 24, 2007 a United States/Australian company called [[Emotiv Systems]] began launching a mind-controlled device for [[video game]]s based on [[electroencephalography]]. It was reported by [[The Wall Street Journal]]'s Don Clark on [[MSNBC]].<ref name=\"MSNBC report\">{{cite web|url=http://video.msn.com/?mkt=en-us&brand=msnbc&tab=m5&rf=&from=00&vid=09e9f856-63f3-40cd-83e6-eb6f2910a31c| publisher=MSNBC|title=Video Game Mind Control|accessdate=2007-03-25|year=2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n* [[PCGamerBike]] similar to a pair of pedals removed from an exercise bike, then set down in front of a chair & used to precisely control game characters instead.\n* [[Optical motion tracking]] systems such as [[TrackIR]] and [[FreeTrack]] use a video camera to track an infrared illuminated or emissive headpiece. Small head movements are tracked and then translated into much larger virtual in-game movements, allowing hands-free view control and improved immersiveness.\n* Mechanical motion tracking systems like [[Gametrak]] use cables attached to gloves for tracking position of physical elements in [[three-dimensional space]] in [[wiktionary:real time|real time]]. The Gametrak mechanism contains a retracting cable reel and a small tubular guide arm from which the cable passes out. The guide arm is articulated in a [[ball joint]] such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. The distance of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure the rotation of the spool drum for the retracting cable reel, and calculating how far the cable is extended.\n* Exoskeleton controllers use exoskeleton technology to provide the player with different responses based on the player's body position, speed of movement, and other sensed data. In addition to audio and visual responses, an exoskeleton controller may provide a controlled resistance to movement and other stimuli to provide realism to the action. This not only lets players feel as if they are actually performing the function, but also helps reinforce the correct muscle pattern for the activity being simulated. The Forcetek XIO is an example of an exoskeleton video game controller.\n* [[Flight instruments|Instrument panels]] are simulated aircraft instrument panels, either generic or specific to a real aircraft, that are used in place of the keyboard to send commands to a flight simulation program. Some of these are far more expensive than all the rest of a computer system combined. The panels usually only simulate switches, buttons, and controls, rather than output instrument displays.\n** Train controls: Other instrument panel like hardware such as train controls have been produced. The \"[[RailDriver]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raildriver.com/products/raildriver.php|title=RailDriver&nbsp;\u2013 Desktop Train Cab Controller|publisher = www.raildriver.com|accessdate=2009-01-24|last = |first = }}</ref> for example is designed to work with ''[[Trainz]]'', ''[[Microsoft Train Simulator]]'' and ''[[Rail Simulator|Kuju Rail Simulator]]''. (as of January 2009) it is limited in ease of use by the lack of a Windows API for some of the software it is designed to work with. A train controller for a [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] bullet train sim has also been made for the [[Wii]] console.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamersquad.com/category/Nintendo-Wii/Wii-train-sim-controller-is-sweeeet/| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071219000000/http://www.gamersquad.com/category/Nintendo-Wii/Wii-train-sim-controller-is-sweeeet/|archivedate=2007-12-19|title=Wii train sim controller \u2013 Bullet Train Controller Wii: GamerSquad discusses the Bullet Train Controller for Nintendo Wii|publisher=www.gamersquad.com|accessdate=2009-01-24|last=|first=}}</ref>\n* [[R.O.B.]] (Robotic Operating Buddy) is an accessory for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), which allowed players to interact with NES games by controlling the robot.

The South Canterbury team play from [[Alpine Energy Stadium]] located in Timaru.\n\n==History==\nClub rugby in South Canterbury predated the formation of South Canterbury RFU by at least two decades. The first recorded club rugby match in South Canterbury was played on 15 October 1867 between The Timaru and Temuka Clubs at Arowhenua. Eight years later, in 1875, the South Canterbury Football Club was formed, founded by [[Alfred St. George Hamersley]] the former captain of the [[England national rugby union team]] and resident of Timaru. Soon after on 24 May 1875 a match was played between North and South Canterbury at Ashburton that resulted in a draw. More clubs were formed, such as the Waimate Football Club on 24 May 1876, and Christchurch are recorded as playing Temuka in 1876. On 26 July 1879, a meeting was held in [[Timaru]] at the instigation again of Hamersley, at which delegates representing the clubs Christchurch, Christ's College, Temuka, North Canterbury (Rangiora), Eastern (Christchurch), South Canterbury (Timaru), Ashburton, and Southbridge agreed to form the [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union]]. \n\nThe '''South Canterbury Rugby Football Union''' (SCRFU) was formed in 1888 when it broke away from the [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union]]. A meeting of delegates from football clubs in South Canterbury was held at the office of ''\"Messrs Hamersley and Wood, Timaru, to consider the advisability of forming a Rugby Football Union in the district.\"''<ref>''Otago Witness'', 16 March 1888, Page 27</ref> Once again, Hamersley was involved in a pivotal point in the history of rugby in the region and his role was commemorated in 2010 with the introduction of the Hamersley trophy, a 186&nbsp;cm tall silver trophy, for the winners of the senior rugby competition (the Personnel Placements club rugby championship).<ref>[http://sportsground.com/Article.asp?SiteID=6676&ArticleID=998 Official site reporting ''Hamersley Cup Unveiled & New Sponsor Welcomed'' \u2013 from Jacob Page, ''Founder remembered in senior trophy'', The Timaru Herald 19 March 2010]</ref> This meeting was attended by delegates from the South Canterbury, Pirates, Temuka, Waimate, Geraldine, Winchester and Fairlie Creek clubs and as a result of the union the South Canterbury club agreed to change its name to the Timaru Club.<ref>[http://www.sportsground.co.nz/ClubSite.asp?SiteID=6676&PageTypeID=13&PageID=44514 South Canterbury RFU Official Site \u2013 History]</ref> Formal association with the Canterbury RFU was broken and it was established that the boundaries of the South Canterbury union were to be the Rangitata and Waitaki rivers, and the headquarters was Timaru. Soon after, a representative match was played on 24 July 1888 against the [[New Zealand Natives|New Zealand Native Team]] on the Athletic Grounds, Timaru.\n\nSouth Canterbury has produced a number of All Blacks and are one of the few unions to have played in all three Divisions of the NPC. South Canterbury has also had some notable victories over touring international sides including the 1961 [[History of the French national rugby union team|French team]]. In 2011 the South Canterbury Heartland Team played the 2011 [[Russia]]n World Cup Team who toured New Zealand on a Pre 2011 Rugby World Cup tour at Alpine Energy Stadium. Also 2011 saw two sell out Super 15 games played at Alpine Energy Stadium in Timaru - the Crusaders vs the [[Bulls (Super Rugby)|Bulls]] and Crusaders vs The [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Blues]].\n\n==Representative Rugby==\n<!-- Malformed, filename missing: [[File: |thumb|South Canterbry 2011 v Russia]] -->\nThe South Canterbury Rugby team play from [[Alpine Energy Stadium]], [[Timaru]] and they play their rugby in the [[Heartland Championship]].

The South Canterbury team play from [[Alpine Energy Stadium]] located in Timaru.\n\n==History==\nClub rugby in South Canterbury predated the formation of South Canterbury RFU by at least two decades. The first recorded club rugby match in South Canterbury was played on 15 October 1867 between The Timaru and Temuka Clubs at Arowhenua. Eight years later, in 1875, the South Canterbury Football Club was formed, founded by [[Alfred St. George Hamersley]] the former captain of the [[England national rugby union team]] and resident of Timaru. Soon after on 24 May 1875 a match was played between North and South Canterbury at Ashburton that resulted in a draw. More clubs were formed, such as the Waimate Football Club on 24 May 1876, and Christchurch are recorded as playing Temuka in 1876. On 26 July 1879, a meeting was held in [[Timaru]] at the instigation again of Hamersley, at which delegates representing the clubs Christchurch, Christ's College, Temuka, North Canterbury (Rangiora), Eastern (Christchurch), South Canterbury (Timaru), Ashburton, and Southbridge agreed to form the [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union]]. \n\nThe '''South Canterbury Rugby Football Union''' (SCRFU) was formed in 1888 when it broke away from the [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union]]. A meeting of delegates from football clubs in South Canterbury was held at the office of ''\"Messrs Hamersley and Wood, Timaru, to consider the advisability of forming a Rugby Football Union in the district.\"''<ref>''Otago Witness'', 16 March 1888, Page 27</ref> Once again, Hamersley was involved in a pivotal point in the history of rugby in the region and his role was commemorated in 2010 with the introduction of the Hamersley trophy, a 186&nbsp;cm tall silver trophy, for the winners of the senior rugby competition (the Personnel Placements club rugby championship).<ref>[http://sportsground.com/Article.asp?SiteID=6676&ArticleID=998 Official site reporting ''Hamersley Cup Unveiled & New Sponsor Welcomed'' \u2013 from Jacob Page, ''Founder remembered in senior trophy'', The Timaru Herald 19 March 2010]</ref> This meeting was attended by delegates from the South Canterbury, Pirates, Temuka, Waimate, Geraldine, Winchester and Fairlie Creek clubs and as a result of the union the South Canterbury club agreed to change its name to the Timaru Club.<ref>[http://www.sportsground.co.nz/ClubSite.asp?SiteID=6676&PageTypeID=13&PageID=44514 South Canterbury RFU Official Site \u2013 History]</ref> Formal association with the Canterbury RFU was broken and it was established that the boundaries of the South Canterbury union were to be the Rangitata and Waitaki rivers, and the headquarters was Timaru. Soon after, a representative match was played on 24 July 1888 against the [[New Zealand Natives|New Zealand Native Team]] on the Athletic Grounds, Timaru.\n\nSouth Canterbury has produced a number of All Blacks and are one of the few unions to have played in all three Divisions of the NPC. South Canterbury has also had some notable victories over touring international sides including the 1961 [[History of the French national rugby union team|French team]]. In 2011 the South Canterbury Heartland Team played the 2011 [[Russia]]n World Cup Team who toured New Zealand on a Pre 2011 Rugby World Cup tour at Alpine Energy Stadium. Also 2011 saw two sell out Super 15 games played at Alpine Energy Stadium in Timaru - the Crusaders vs the [[Bulls (Super Rugby)|Bulls]] and Crusaders vs The [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Blues]].\n\n==Representative Rugby==\n<!-- Malformed, filename missing: [[File: |thumb|South Canterbry 2011 v Russia]] -->\nThe South Canterbury Rugby team play from [[Alpine Energy Stadium]], [[Timaru]] and they play their rugby in the [[Heartland Championship]].

The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its [[Soil salinity|salinisation]] by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified the locations of the sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of [[sabkha]] water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Alsharhan\n|first=A.

The agricultural and domestic sectors' over-utilisation of the Dammam Aquifer, the principal aquifer in Bahrain, has led to its [[Soil salinity|salinisation]] by adjacent brackish and saline water bodies. A hydrochemical study identified the locations of the sources of aquifer salinisation and delineated their areas of influence. The investigation indicates that the aquifer water quality is significantly modified as groundwater flows from the northwestern parts of Bahrain, where the aquifer receives its water by lateral underflow from eastern Saudi Arabia, to the southern and southeastern parts. Four types of salinisation of the aquifer are identified: brackish-water up-flow from the underlying brackish-water zones in north-central, western, and eastern regions; seawater intrusion in the eastern region; intrusion of [[sabkha]] water in the southwestern region; and irrigation return flow in a local area in the western region. Four alternatives for the management of groundwater quality that are available to the water authorities in Bahrain are discussed and their priority areas are proposed, based on the type and extent of each salinisation source, in addition to groundwater use in that area.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Alsharhan\n|first=A.
