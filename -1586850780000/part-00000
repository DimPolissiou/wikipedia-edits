His father, who had migrated to Ganja from Qom in north central Iran, may have been a civil servant; his mother was a daughter of a Kurdish chieftain; having lost both parents early in his life, Nizami was brought up by an uncle. He was married three times, and in his poems laments the death of each of his wives, as well as proferring advice to his son Muhammad. He lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the accounts of later biographers are colored by the many legends built up around the poet''}}</ref> or '''Nez\u0101mi''', whose formal name was ''Jamal ad-D\u012bn Ab\u016b Mu\u1e25ammad Ily\u0101s ibn-Y\u016bsuf ibn-Zakk\u012b'',<ref name=\"moin\">Mo'in, Muhammad(2006), \"Tahlil-i Haft Paykar-i Nezami\", Tehran.: p. 2: Some commentators have mentioned his name as \u201cIlyas the son of Yusuf the son of Zakki the son of Mua\u2019yyad\u201d while others have mentioned that Mu\u2019ayyad is a title for Zakki.  Mohammad Moin, rejects the first interpretation claiming that if it were to mean 'Zakki son of Muayyad' it should have been read as 'Zakki i Muayyad' where izafe (-i-) shows the son-parent relationship but here it is 'Zakki Muayyad' and Zakki ends in silence/stop and there is no izafe (-i-). Some may argue that izafe is dropped due to meter constraints but dropping parenthood izafe is very strange and rare. So it is possible that Muayyad was a sobriquet for Zaki or part of his name (like Muayyad al-Din Zaki).

Mu\u2019ayyad Nizami a native of Ganja in Azarbaijan, is an unrivaled master of thoughts and words, a poet whose freshness and vigor all the succeeding centuries have been unable to dull. Little is known of his life, the only source being his own works, which in many cases provided no reliable information. We can only deduce that he was born between 535 and 540 (1140\u201346) and that his background was urban. Modern Azarbaijan is exceedingly proud of its world famous son and insists that he was not just a native of the region, but that he came from its own Turkic stock. At all events his mother was of Iranian origin, the poet himself calling her Ra\u2019isa and describing her as Kurdish.</ref> background in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] ([[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]]<ref name=\"britannica\"/> empire, now [[Azerbaijan]]) and is believed to have spent his whole life in [[South Caucasus]].

Apparently it's related to the first years of independence. Their works include nationalist beginnings. Objective perspective, scientific understanding of the problems and timeline of historical developments are lacking. Sometimes  there is an outright falsification. For example, Nizami, the monument of whom was erected at  Kamennoostrovsk boulevard, is proclaimed Great Azerbaijani poet. Although he did not even speak Azeri. They justify this by saying that he lived in the territory of current Azerbaijan, but Nizami wrote his poems in Persian language!\".\n--><!--\n'''F)'''\n(Russian) Shnirelman, Viktor A.

The Soviet regime does not pay tribute to Nizami as a great representative of world literature, but is mainly interested in him as a \u2018poet of the Soviet Union\u2019, which he is considered to be because he was born in Gandzha in the territory of the present Azerbaidzhani Soviet Republic. The Soviet regime proclaims its ownership over Nizami also by \u2018interpreting\u2019 his works in accordance with the general pattern of Soviet ideology. Thus the leading Soviet journal Bolshevik stressed that Nizami's \u2018great merit\u2019 consisted in having undermined Islam by \u2018opposing the theological teaching of the unchangeable character of the world\u2019.  Stalin himself intervened in the dispute over Nizami and gave an authoritative verdict on the matter.

His first wife was a [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] slave girl which was sent to him by Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of [[Derbent|Darband]], as part of a larger gift. According to Iraj Bashiri she became Nezami's \"most beloved\" wife. His only son ''Mohammad'' was from this wife. She died after \"[[Khosrow and Shirin]]\" was completed. Mohammad was seven at the time. Nezami mentions his son again in Layli and Majnun adding that now this son is 14 years old and \"apple of my eyes\". In \"Haft Peykar\" (Seven Beauties), he also mentions and advises his son about taking more responsibility as the father was growing more frail.\n\nSome modern writers in the late 20th century have claimed that this wife was called ''Afaq''. Vahid Dastgerdi seems to be the first writer to propose this name for Nezami's first wife, but Said Nafisi (at the same time) and a recent source have challenged this interpretation of the corresponding verse in Nezami's work and the assumption that ''Afaq'' was the real name of his wife <ref>{{cite web |author=Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh |title=On the Modern Politicization of the Persian Poet Nezami Ganjavi |publisher=Victoria Arakelova, YEREVAN SERIES FOR ORIENTAL STUDIES (Editor of the Series Garnik Asatrian), Caucasian Centre for Iranian Studies |location= Yerevan |year=2012 |pages= 173\u2013175 |url=https://archive.org/download/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251/nezami_digital_version_final_2012.pdf }}</ref><ref name=\"archive1\">{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251 |title=ON THE MODERN POLITICIZATION OF THE PERSIAN POET NEZAMI GANJAVI: Siavash Lornejad, Ali Doostzadeh: Free Download & Streaming: Internet Archive |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2014-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902001119/https://archive.org/details/OnTheModernPoliticizationOfThePersianPoetNezamiGanjavi_251 |archive-date=2014-09-02 |url-status=live }}</ref> and have taken the ''Afaq'' in that verse to simply mean \"horizon\" rather than a proper name.

In Iran he rose from the stature of a damned evil conqueror of the country, to that of a national Iranian hero king, and even more, to that of the great prophet of God, preparing all the nations for the true religion.  Yet the Persian legend of Alexander is very little known in the Western world.\"\np. 13: \"Nizami was a typical product of the Iranian culture.  He created a bridge between Islamic Iran and pre-Islamic Iran and also between Iran and the whole ancient world.  His great humanism, strong character, sensibility, drama, colorful description of nature, rich language, and the poetic genius created a new standard of literary achievements and captured the imagination of countless imitators\".\np. 17: \"In the case of previous romances of Khosraw and Bahram, Nizami dealt with national Iranian heroes, though from pre-Islamic times.  In the tale of Layla and Majnun, the Arab nationality of the lover is of no importance since the story is based on a simple Arab folktale which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians\".\np. 19: \"Alexander was glorified by the Muslims as a divine agent, a prophet-king and the blessed conqueror of the lands that were to become the stronghold of Islam.  To some Muslims, Islam was a realization of Alexander's \"koine\" --- a commonwealth where people could live in harmony and in peace of heart and mind.  In this atmosphere attempts were made to make out of Alexander not only a Muslim but a Persian as well\".\np. 21: \"However, it was not Tabari directly, but Ferdowsi who was Nizami's source of inspiration and material in composing Iskandarnameh. Nizami constantly alludes to the Shahnameh in his writing, especially in the prologue to the Iskandarnameh. It seems that he was always fascinated by the work of Firdawsi and made it a goal of his life to write an heroic epic of the same stature.\np. 22: \"It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi's]] monumental epic [[Shahnameh]] (The book of Kings)\".\np. 22: \"In fact, although Alexander conquered Iran, he was soon conquered by Persian customs and ways of life.  In many aspects he was so overwhelmed by Persian civilization that he became more Persian than the Persians.  He tried to make a blend of the Greek and Persian civilization --- even genetically, when he sponsored mass marriages between his troops and Persian women.  He himself married Roxane (Rowshanak) the daughter of the Sogdian prince \u2013 not the daughter of Darius the Third, as both Firdawsi and Nizami believed.  Like Alexander, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and other people who overran the Iranian plateau also came under the spell of Persian culture. Foreign invaders remained to become contributors and patrons of Persian art and culture. To give one example, some of Nizami's benefactors were of Turkic stock.\"</ref>  Nezami has mentioned [[Ferdowsi]] as the Sage (Hakim) and Knower/Wise (daanaa) and the great master of discourse: ''who has decorated words like new bride''.

Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''.  Nezami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nezami's epic poetry.\n\nThe first monumental work of Nezami, the Makhzan al-Asrar is influenced by [[Sanai]]'s \"Hadikat al-Hakika\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |author       = J.T.P.

The poem is based on the popular Arab legend of ill-starred lovers: the poet Qays falls in love with his cousin Layla, but is prevented from marrying her by Layla's father.  Layla's father forbids contact with Qays and Qays becomes obsessed and starts signing of his love for Layla in public.  The obsession becomes so severe that he sees and evaluates everything in terms of Layla; hence his sobriquet \"the possessed\" (Majnun).<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  Realizing that cannot obtain union even when other people intercede for him, he leaves society and roams naked in the desert among the beasts.  However the image of Layla was so ingrained in him that he cannot eat or sleep.  His only activity becomes composing poetry of longing for Layla.<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  Meanwhile, Layla is married against her will, but she guards her virginity by resisting the advances of her husband.  Arranging a secret meeting with Majnun, they meet, but have no physical contact.  Rather they recite poetry to each other from a distance. Layla's husband dies eventually which removes the legal obstacles to a licit union.  However Majnun is so focused on the ideal picture of Layla in his mind that he had fled to the desert.  Layla dies out of grief and is buried in her bridal dress.  Hearing this news, Majun rushes to her grave where he instantly dies.  They are buried side by side and their grave becomes a site of pilgrimage.  Someone dreams that in Paradise they are united and live as a king and queen.<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  Nezami composed his romance at the request of the [[Shirvanshah]] Akhsatan.  Initially, he doubted that this simple story about the agony and pain of an Arab boy wandering in rough mountains and burning deserts would be a suitable subject for royal court poetry and his cultured audience.<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  It was his son who persuaded him to undertake the project, saying: \"wherever tales of love are read, this will add spice to them\".<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  Nezami used many Arabic anecdotes in the story but also adds a strong Persian flavor to the legend.<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  He adapted the disconnected stories about Majnun to fit the requirement of a Persian romance.<ref name=\"EIslamLayla\">[[Charles Pellat|Pellat, Ch.]]; Bruijn, J.T.P. de; Flemming, B.; Haywood, J.A. \"Madjn\u016bn Layl\u0101.\" ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Second Edition.

Excerpts: \"The theme was chosen for the first time as the subject of a Persian narrative poem, but the precedent of the treatment of a similar subject of Arabic origin existed in \u02bfAyy\u016b\u1e33\u012b's War\u1e33a u Gulsh\u0101h.  Ni\u1e93\u0101m\u012b states in the introduction to his poem that he accepted the assignment with some hesitation. At first, he doubted whether this tale of madness and wanderings through the wilderness would be suitable for a royal court (ed. Moscow 1965, pp. 41 ff.).  He adapted the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance. ...In some respects, the Bedouin setting of the original has been changed under the influence of urban conditions more familiar to the poet and his audience: the young lovers become acquainted at school; the generous Nawfal is a prince in the Iranian style rather than an Arab official. Ni\u1e93\u0101m\u012b added a second pair of lovers, Zayn and Zaynab, in whom the love between the main characters is reflected. It is Zayn who in a dream sees Madjn\u016bn and Layl\u012b united in paradise at the end of the romance.\"</ref>\n\nAn important aspect of Layla and Majun that is hardly recognized is the poet's highly humanitarian approach.

By collecting information from both secular and mystical sources about Majnun, Nizami portrayed such a vivid picture of this legendary lover that all subsequent poets were inspired by him, many of them imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. As we shall see in the following chapters, the poet uses various characteristics deriving from \u2018Udhrite love poetry and weaves them into his own Persian culture.

It consists of two books, Sharaf-Nama and Iqbal-nameh. The poem narrates the three stages in Alexander's life: first as the conqueror of the world; then as a seeker after knowledge, gaining enough wisdom to acknowledge his own ignorance; and finally as a prophet, traveling once again across the world, from west to east, and south to north to proclaim his monotheistic creed to the world at large.<ref name=\"IranicaClassical\"/>  The Sharaf-nama discusses the birth of Alexander, his succession to the throne of Rum (Greece), his wars against Africans who invaded Egypt, his conquest of Persia and his marriage to the daughter of Darius.  The episode also discusses Alexander's pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], his stay in the Caucasus and his visit to Queen Nushaba of Barda' and her court of Amazons.  Alexander conquers India, China and the land of the Rus.  The Sharafnama concludes with Alexander's unsuccessful search for the water of immortal life.<ref name=\"eskandar\"/>\n\nThe Iqbal-nameh is a description of Alexander's personal growth into the ideal ruler on a model ultimately derived, through Islamic intermediaries, from [[Plato]]'s [[Republic]].<ref name=\"eskandar\"/>  He has debates with Greek and Indian philosophers (c.f. with [[Asadi Tusi|Garshaspnama]]) and a major portion of the text is devoted to the discourses he has with seven Greek sages.

Excerpt: \"In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar  an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of D\u0101r\u0101 (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by \"the rotation of the Heavens\"....At the time of Ni\u1e93ami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Ni\u1e93ami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, \"I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole\"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran.  He makes him the image of the Iranian \"knight\", peace-loving and moderate, courteous and always ready for any noble action. Like all Ni\u1e93ami's heroes, he conquers the passions of the flesh, and devotes his attention to his undertakings and his friendships. These features appear in the account, which follows ancient tradition, of his conduct towards the women of the family of Darius, in his brotherly attitude on the death of that ruler, in his behaviour towards queen Nushaba (the Kaydaf of Firdawsi, the Kandake of the pseudo-Callisthenes) whom he defends against the Russians.</ref> knight.\n\nAn English translation of the Sharaf-Nama by [[Henry Wilberforce-Clarke]] was published in 1881 under the title Sikandar Nama e Bara and is available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/main?url=pf%3Fauth%3D176%26work%3D002 |title=Persian Literature in Translation The Packard Humanities Institute: Eskandar-Nama (The Book of Alexander) |publisher=Persian.packhum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref>\n\n====''Haft Peykar''====\n{{main|Haft Peykar}}\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Practice Makes Perfect from a \"Haft Paikar\" of Nizami.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Practice Makes Perfect'' from a [[Haft Peykar]] of Nizami.

Bahram whose upbringing is entrusted to No'man becomes a formidable huntsman.  While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses; hence the name Haft Peykar (seven beauties).  Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (traditional [[Zoroastrian]]-Islamic division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them.  His father [[Yazdegerd I]] passes away and [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] returns to Persia to claim his throne from pretenders.  After some episodes he is recognized as King and rescues the Persians from a famine.  Once the country is stable, the King searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides.  His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides.  The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (classical planetary system of Zoroastrian-Islamic world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet.  [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect.  The princesses take up residence in the splendid pavilions.  On each visit, the king visits the princesses on successive days of the week; on Saturday the Indian princess, who is governed by Saturn and so on.  The princesses names are Furak (Nurak), the daughter of the Rajah of India, as beautiful as the moon; Yaghma Naz, the daughter of the [[Khaqan]] of the Turks; Naz Pari, the daughter of the king of [[Chorasmia|Khwarazm]]; Nasrin Nush, the daughter of the king of the Slavs; Azarbin (Azareyon), the daughter of the king of Morocco; Humay, the daughter of the Roman Caesar; and Diroste (wholesome), a beautiful Iranian princess from the House of Kay Ka'us.  Each princess relates to the king a story matching the mood of her respective color.<ref name=\"HaftIranica\"/>  These seven beautifully constructed, highly sensuous stories occupy about half of the whole poem.<ref name=\"HaftIranica\"/>  While the king is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm.  [[Bahram Gur]] discovers that the affairs of Persia are in disarray, the treasury is empty and the neighboring rulers are posed to invade.  He clears his mind first by going hunting.  After returning from hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree.  The owner of the dog, who was shepherd, tells the story of how his faithful watchdog had betrayed his flock to a she-wolf in return for sexual favors.<ref name=\"HaftIranica\"/>  He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered.  The minister is subsequently put to death and [[Bahram Gur]] restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to [[fire temple]]s<ref name=\"HaftIranica\"/> for the pleasure of God.

Besides these, scores of poets have started their composition with the first line of the Makhzan al-Asrar.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rudolf Gelpke: ''Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones.  The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed not less than forty Persians and thirteen Turkish versions'' of Layli and Majnun.<ref name=\"Gelpke\"/>\n\nAccording to Vahid Dastgerdi, ''If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of Layli and Majnun''.\n\n[[Jami]] in his Nafahatol Ons remarks that:  ''Although most of Nezami's work on the surface appear to be romance, in reality they are a mask for the essential truths and for the explanation of divine knowledge''.\n\n[[Jami]] in his Baharestan mentions that: ''Nezami's excellence is more manifest than the sun and has no need of description''.  Hashemi of Kerman remarks: ''The empire of poetry obtained its law and order from Nezami's beautiful verses'' and ''To present words before Nezami's silent speech is a waste of time''.\n\n[[Amir Khusro]] writes:<br />\n\"The ruler of the kingdom of words, famed hero,<br />\nScholar and poet, his goblet [glass] toasts.<br />\nIn it \u2013 pure wine, it's drunkingly sweet,<br />\nYet in goblet [glass] beside us \u2013 only muddy setting.\"\n\n===Western reception===\n[[File:Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature, Baku, 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijani Literature]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].]]\n\n[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] writes:<br />\n''A gentle, highly gifted spirit, who, when [[Ferdowsi]] had completed the collected heroic traditions, chose for the material of his poems the sweetest encounters of the deepest love.  Majnun and Layli, Khosrow and Shirin, lovers he presented; meant for one another by premonition, destiny, nature, habit, inclination, passion staunchly devoted to each other; but divided by mad ideas, stubbornness, chance, necessity, and force, then miraculously reunited, yet in the end again in one way or another torn apart and separated from each other.''\n\nWith regards to the recitation of his poetry, Peter Chelkowski states: \"The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential.  Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled\".<ref name=\"ChelkowskiMirror\"/>\n\nNezami's story of Layla and Majnun also provided the namesake for a hit single by [[Eric Clapton]], also called \"[[Layla (song)|Layla]]\".  Recorded with [[Derek and the Dominos]], \"Layla\" was released on the 1970 album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]''.

His father, who had migrated to Ganja from Qom in north central Iran, may have been a civil servant; his mother was a daughter of a Kurdish chieftain; having lost both parents early in his life, Nizami was brought up by an uncle. He was married three times, and in his poems laments the death of each of his wives, as well as proferring advice to his son Muhammad. He lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the accounts of later biographers are colored by the many legends built up around the poet''}}</ref> or '''Nez\u0101mi''', whose formal name was ''Jamal ad-D\u012bn Ab\u016b Mu\u1e25ammad Ily\u0101s ibn-Y\u016bsuf ibn-Zakk\u012b'',<ref name=\"moin\">Mo'in, Muhammad(2006), \"Tahlil-i Haft Paykar-i Nezami\", Tehran.: p. 2: Some commentators have mentioned his name as \u201cIlyas the son of Yusuf the son of Zakki the son of Mua\u2019yyad\u201d while others have mentioned that Mu\u2019ayyad is a title for Zakki.  Mohammad Moin, rejects the first interpretation claiming that if it were to mean 'Zakki son of Muayyad' it should have been read as 'Zakki i Muayyad' where izafe (-i-) shows the son-parent relationship but here it is 'Zakki Muayyad' and Zakki ends in silence/stop and there is no izafe (-i-). Some may argue that izafe is dropped due to meter constraints but dropping parenthood izafe is very strange and rare. So it is possible that Muayyad was a sobriquet for Zaki or part of his name (like Muayyad al-Din Zaki).

Apparently it's related to the first years of independence. Their works include nationalist beginnings. Objective perspective, scientific understanding of the problems and timeline of historical developments are lacking. Sometimes  there is an outright falsification. For example, Nizami, the monument of whom was erected at  Kamennoostrovsk boulevard, is proclaimed Great Azerbaijani poet. Although he did not even speak Azeri. They justify this by saying that he lived in the territory of current Azerbaijan, but Nizami wrote his poems in Persian language!\".\n--><!--\n'''F)'''\n(Russian) Shnirelman, Viktor A.

The Soviet regime does not pay tribute to Nizami as a great representative of world literature, but is mainly interested in him as a \u2018poet of the Soviet Union\u2019, which he is considered to be because he was born in Gandzha in the territory of the present Azerbaidzhani Soviet Republic.

Thus the leading Soviet journal Bolshevik stressed that Nizami's \u2018great merit\u2019 consisted in having undermined Islam by \u2018opposing the theological teaching of the unchangeable character of the world\u2019.  Stalin himself intervened in the dispute over Nizami and gave an authoritative verdict on the matter.

His first wife was a [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] slave girl which was sent to him by Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of [[Derbent|Darband]], as part of a larger gift. According to Iraj Bashiri she became Nezami's \"most beloved\" wife. His only son ''Mohammad'' was from this wife. She died after \"[[Khosrow and Shirin]]\" was completed. Mohammad was seven at the time. Nezami mentions his son again in Layli and Majnun adding that now this son is 14 years old and \"apple of my eyes\". In \"Haft Peykar\" (Seven Beauties), he also mentions and advises his son about taking more responsibility as the father was growing more frail.\n\nSome modern writers in the late 20th century have claimed that this wife was called ''Afaq''.

In Iran he rose from the stature of a damned evil conqueror of the country, to that of a national Iranian hero king, and even more, to that of the great prophet of God, preparing all the nations for the true religion.  Yet the Persian legend of Alexander is very little known in the Western world.\"\np. 13: \"Nizami was a typical product of the Iranian culture.  He created a bridge between Islamic Iran and pre-Islamic Iran and also between Iran and the whole ancient world.  His great humanism, strong character, sensibility, drama, colorful description of nature, rich language, and the poetic genius created a new standard of literary achievements and captured the imagination of countless imitators\".\np. 17: \"In the case of previous romances of Khosraw and Bahram, Nizami dealt with national Iranian heroes, though from pre-Islamic times.  In the tale of Layla and Majnun, the Arab nationality of the lover is of no importance since the story is based on a simple Arab folktale which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians\".\np. 19: \"Alexander was glorified by the Muslims as a divine agent, a prophet-king and the blessed conqueror of the lands that were to become the stronghold of Islam.  To some Muslims, Islam was a realization of Alexander's \"koine\" --- a commonwealth where people could live in harmony and in peace of heart and mind.  In this atmosphere attempts were made to make out of Alexander not only a Muslim but a Persian as well\".\np. 21: \"However, it was not Tabari directly, but Ferdowsi who was Nizami's source of inspiration and material in composing Iskandarnameh. Nizami constantly alludes to the Shahnameh in his writing, especially in the prologue to the Iskandarnameh. It seems that he was always fascinated by the work of Firdawsi and made it a goal of his life to write an heroic epic of the same stature.\np. 22: \"It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading [[Ferdowsi|Firdawsi's]] monumental epic [[Shahnameh]] (The book of Kings)\".\np. 22: \"In fact, although Alexander conquered Iran, he was soon conquered by Persian customs and ways of life.  In many aspects he was so overwhelmed by Persian civilization that he became more Persian than the Persians.  He tried to make a blend of the Greek and Persian civilization --- even genetically, when he sponsored mass marriages between his troops and Persian women.  He himself married Roxane (Rowshanak) the daughter of the Sogdian prince \u2013 not the daughter of Darius the Third, as both Firdawsi and Nizami believed.  Like Alexander, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and other people who overran the Iranian plateau also came under the spell of Persian culture. Foreign invaders remained to become contributors and patrons of Persian art and culture. To give one example, some of Nizami's benefactors were of Turkic stock.\"</ref>  Nezami has mentioned [[Ferdowsi]] as the Sage (Hakim) and Knower/Wise (daanaa) and the great master of discourse: ''who has decorated words like new bride''.

Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''.  Nezami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nezami's epic poetry.\n\nThe first monumental work of Nezami, the Makhzan al-Asrar is influenced by [[Sanai]]'s \"Hadikat al-Hakika\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |author       = J.T.P.

The poem is based on the popular Arab legend of ill-starred lovers: the poet Qays falls in love with his cousin Layla, but is prevented from marrying her by Layla's father.  Layla's father forbids contact with Qays and Qays becomes obsessed and starts signing of his love for Layla in public.  The obsession becomes so severe that he sees and evaluates everything in terms of Layla; hence his sobriquet \"the possessed\" (Majnun).<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  Realizing that cannot obtain union even when other people intercede for him, he leaves society and roams naked in the desert among the beasts.  However the image of Layla was so ingrained in him that he cannot eat or sleep.  His only activity becomes composing poetry of longing for Layla.<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  Meanwhile, Layla is married against her will, but she guards her virginity by resisting the advances of her husband.  Arranging a secret meeting with Majnun, they meet, but have no physical contact.  Rather they recite poetry to each other from a distance. Layla's husband dies eventually which removes the legal obstacles to a licit union.  However Majnun is so focused on the ideal picture of Layla in his mind that he had fled to the desert.  Layla dies out of grief and is buried in her bridal dress.  Hearing this news, Majun rushes to her grave where he instantly dies.  They are buried side by side and their grave becomes a site of pilgrimage.  Someone dreams that in Paradise they are united and live as a king and queen.<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  Nezami composed his romance at the request of the [[Shirvanshah]] Akhsatan.  Initially, he doubted that this simple story about the agony and pain of an Arab boy wandering in rough mountains and burning deserts would be a suitable subject for royal court poetry and his cultured audience.<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  It was his son who persuaded him to undertake the project, saying: \"wherever tales of love are read, this will add spice to them\".<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  Nezami used many Arabic anecdotes in the story but also adds a strong Persian flavor to the legend.<ref name=\"IranicaLayla\"/>  He adapted the disconnected stories about Majnun to fit the requirement of a Persian romance.<ref name=\"EIslamLayla\">[[Charles Pellat|Pellat, Ch.]]; Bruijn, J.T.P. de; Flemming, B.; Haywood, J.A. \"Madjn\u016bn Layl\u0101.\" ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Second Edition.

Excerpts: \"The theme was chosen for the first time as the subject of a Persian narrative poem, but the precedent of the treatment of a similar subject of Arabic origin existed in \u02bfAyy\u016b\u1e33\u012b's War\u1e33a u Gulsh\u0101h.  Ni\u1e93\u0101m\u012b states in the introduction to his poem that he accepted the assignment with some hesitation. At first, he doubted whether this tale of madness and wanderings through the wilderness would be suitable for a royal court (ed. Moscow 1965, pp. 41 ff.).  He adapted the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance. ...In some respects, the Bedouin setting of the original has been changed under the influence of urban conditions more familiar to the poet and his audience: the young lovers become acquainted at school; the generous Nawfal is a prince in the Iranian style rather than an Arab official. Ni\u1e93\u0101m\u012b added a second pair of lovers, Zayn and Zaynab, in whom the love between the main characters is reflected. It is Zayn who in a dream sees Madjn\u016bn and Layl\u012b united in paradise at the end of the romance.\"</ref>\n\nAn important aspect of Layla and Majun that is hardly recognized is the poet's highly humanitarian approach.

By collecting information from both secular and mystical sources about Majnun, Nizami portrayed such a vivid picture of this legendary lover that all subsequent poets were inspired by him, many of them imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. As we shall see in the following chapters, the poet uses various characteristics deriving from \u2018Udhrite love poetry and weaves them into his own Persian culture. In other words, Nizami Persianises the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.</ref> and adapts the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance.<ref name=\"EIslamLayla\"/>\n\n''The Story of Layla and Majnun by Nizami'', was translated and edited by Dr. Rudolf Gelpke into an English version in collaboration with E.

Mohammad has been mentioned.<ref name=\"eskandar\"/>  The story is based on Islamic myths developed about Alexander the Great, which derive from [[Qur'an]]ic references to the [[Dhu'l-Qarnayn]] as well as from the Greek Alexander romance of [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]]. It consists of two books, Sharaf-Nama and Iqbal-nameh. The poem narrates the three stages in Alexander's life: first as the conqueror of the world; then as a seeker after knowledge, gaining enough wisdom to acknowledge his own ignorance; and finally as a prophet, traveling once again across the world, from west to east, and south to north to proclaim his monotheistic creed to the world at large.<ref name=\"IranicaClassical\"/>  The Sharaf-nama discusses the birth of Alexander, his succession to the throne of Rum (Greece), his wars against Africans who invaded Egypt, his conquest of Persia and his marriage to the daughter of Darius.  The episode also discusses Alexander's pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], his stay in the Caucasus and his visit to Queen Nushaba of Barda' and her court of Amazons.  Alexander conquers India, China and the land of the Rus.  The Sharafnama concludes with Alexander's unsuccessful search for the water of immortal life.<ref name=\"eskandar\"/>\n\nThe Iqbal-nameh is a description of Alexander's personal growth into the ideal ruler on a model ultimately derived, through Islamic intermediaries, from [[Plato]]'s [[Republic]].<ref name=\"eskandar\"/>  He has debates with Greek and Indian philosophers (c.f. with [[Asadi Tusi|Garshaspnama]]) and a major portion of the text is devoted to the discourses he has with seven Greek sages.

Excerpt: \"In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar  an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of D\u0101r\u0101 (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by \"the rotation of the Heavens\"....At the time of Ni\u1e93ami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Ni\u1e93ami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, \"I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole\"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran.  He makes him the image of the Iranian \"knight\", peace-loving and moderate, courteous and always ready for any noble action. Like all Ni\u1e93ami's heroes, he conquers the passions of the flesh, and devotes his attention to his undertakings and his friendships. These features appear in the account, which follows ancient tradition, of his conduct towards the women of the family of Darius, in his brotherly attitude on the death of that ruler, in his behaviour towards queen Nushaba (the Kaydaf of Firdawsi, the Kandake of the pseudo-Callisthenes) whom he defends against the Russians.</ref> knight.\n\nAn English translation of the Sharaf-Nama by [[Henry Wilberforce-Clarke]] was published in 1881 under the title Sikandar Nama e Bara and is available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/main?url=pf%3Fauth%3D176%26work%3D002 |title=Persian Literature in Translation The Packard Humanities Institute: Eskandar-Nama (The Book of Alexander) |publisher=Persian.packhum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}</ref>\n\n====''Haft Peykar''====\n{{main|Haft Peykar}}\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Practice Makes Perfect from a \"Haft Paikar\" of Nizami.jpg|thumbnail|left|''Practice Makes Perfect'' from a [[Haft Peykar]] of Nizami.

Bahram whose upbringing is entrusted to No'man becomes a formidable huntsman.  While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses; hence the name Haft Peykar (seven beauties).  Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (traditional [[Zoroastrian]]-Islamic division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them.  His father [[Yazdegerd I]] passes away and [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] returns to Persia to claim his throne from pretenders.  After some episodes he is recognized as King and rescues the Persians from a famine.  Once the country is stable, the King searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides.  His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides.  The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (classical planetary system of Zoroastrian-Islamic world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet.  [[Bahram Gur|Bahram]] is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect.  The princesses take up residence in the splendid pavilions.  On each visit, the king visits the princesses on successive days of the week; on Saturday the Indian princess, who is governed by Saturn and so on.  The princesses names are Furak (Nurak), the daughter of the Rajah of India, as beautiful as the moon; Yaghma Naz, the daughter of the [[Khaqan]] of the Turks; Naz Pari, the daughter of the king of [[Chorasmia|Khwarazm]]; Nasrin Nush, the daughter of the king of the Slavs; Azarbin (Azareyon), the daughter of the king of Morocco; Humay, the daughter of the Roman Caesar; and Diroste (wholesome), a beautiful Iranian princess from the House of Kay Ka'us.  Each princess relates to the king a story matching the mood of her respective color.<ref name=\"HaftIranica\"/>  These seven beautifully constructed, highly sensuous stories occupy about half of the whole poem.<ref name=\"HaftIranica\"/>  While the king is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm.  [[Bahram Gur]] discovers that the affairs of Persia are in disarray, the treasury is empty and the neighboring rulers are posed to invade.  He clears his mind first by going hunting.  After returning from hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree.  The owner of the dog, who was shepherd, tells the story of how his faithful watchdog had betrayed his flock to a she-wolf in return for sexual favors.<ref name=\"HaftIranica\"/>  He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered.  The minister is subsequently put to death and [[Bahram Gur]] restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to [[fire temple]]s<ref name=\"HaftIranica\"/> for the pleasure of God.

Besides these, scores of poets have started their composition with the first line of the Makhzan al-Asrar.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rudolf Gelpke: ''Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones.  The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed not less than forty Persians and thirteen Turkish versions'' of Layli and Majnun.<ref name=\"Gelpke\"/>\n\nAccording to Vahid Dastgerdi, ''If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of Layli and Majnun''.\n\n[[Jami]] in his Nafahatol Ons remarks that:  ''Although most of Nezami's work on the surface appear to be romance, in reality they are a mask for the essential truths and for the explanation of divine knowledge''.\n\n[[Jami]] in his Baharestan mentions that: ''Nezami's excellence is more manifest than the sun and has no need of description''.  Hashemi of Kerman remarks: ''The empire of poetry obtained its law and order from Nezami's beautiful verses'' and ''To present words before Nezami's silent speech is a waste of time''.\n\n[[Amir Khusro]] writes:<br />\n\"The ruler of the kingdom of words, famed hero,<br />\nScholar and poet, his goblet [glass] toasts.<br />\nIn it \u2013 pure wine, it's drunkingly sweet,<br />\nYet in goblet [glass] beside us \u2013 only muddy setting.\"\n\n===Western reception===\n[[File:Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature, Baku, 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijani Literature]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].]]\n\n[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] writes:<br />\n''A gentle, highly gifted spirit, who, when [[Ferdowsi]] had completed the collected heroic traditions, chose for the material of his poems the sweetest encounters of the deepest love.  Majnun and Layli, Khosrow and Shirin, lovers he presented; meant for one another by premonition, destiny, nature, habit, inclination, passion staunchly devoted to each other; but divided by mad ideas, stubbornness, chance, necessity, and force, then miraculously reunited, yet in the end again in one way or another torn apart and separated from each other.''\n\nWith regards to the recitation of his poetry, Peter Chelkowski states: \"The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential.  Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled\".<ref name=\"ChelkowskiMirror\"/>\n\nNezami's story of Layla and Majnun also provided the namesake for a hit single by [[Eric Clapton]], also called \"[[Layla (song)|Layla]]\".  Recorded with [[Derek and the Dominos]], \"Layla\" was released on the 1970 album ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]''.

He served under the first seven governors of the Colony, and from 1810 to 1821, he was ''great assistant'' to Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]. Wentworth led a campaign for the rights and recognition of [[Emancipist|emancipists]] and for [[trial by jury]].<ref>W.W.Walker, ''[[Jane & D'Arcy: Jane Austen & D'Arcy Wentworth]]'' Volume 2, ''[[Such Talent& Such Success]]'', Arcana Press, 2017, page 315</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nD'Arcy Wentworth was born in [[Portadown]], [[County Armagh]], [[Ireland]], the sixth child and fourth son of Martha and D'Arcy Wentworth. His family had left Yorkshire for safe haven in Ireland after the execution of [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]], in 1641. In 1778, aged sixteen, D'Arcy was apprenticed to Alexander Patton, a surgeon-apothecary, in nearby [[Tandragee]]. In 1782, he joined the [[Ulster Volunteers]], one of the local regiments formed during the [[American War of Independence]], to defend Ireland against invasion from France. In May 1785, having completed a seven-year apprenticeship, D'Arcy left Ireland. He was seeking an appointment with the [[East India Company]], and as the training of Irish surgeons was not recognised in England, it was necessary to go to London to gain accreditation.\n\n== Life in England ==\nWentworth sailed on the mailboat from Donaghadee to Portpatrick in Scotland. First he went to South Yorkshire, as the guest of his cousin, [[William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam]], at ''[[Wentworth Woodhouse]].'' It was the beginning os a lifelong friendship. Fitzwilliam gave D'Arcy encouragement and advice. He attended Whig party gatherings and race meetings at [[York]], [[Doncaster]] and [[Wakefield]] with Fitzwilliam, who introduced him to the societies of York and London, with their up and coming lawyers, young politicians and aspiring bureaucrats. \n\nOn 1 December 1785, Wentworth went before the Court of Examiners of the Company of Surgeons in London. He qualified as a ''Mate to Indiamen,'' eligible to work with the East India Companyonce he had twelve months practical experience ''walking the wards'' in one of London's large charity hospitals.<ref>Royal College of Surgeons, \"Company of Surgeons Examination Book 1745-1800, page 11.</ref> Wentworth accepted the invitation of [[Percivall Pott]],one of his examiners, to ''walk the wards'' of St Bartholomew's, Smithfield under his direction. He attended lectures by other prominent physicians such as [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]],and dissections held in the Company of Surgeons' anatomy theatre at the Old Bailey.\n\nWentworth waited in vain for a position to become available in the [[East India Company]]. [[Warren Hastings]] had brought peace to India, and the Company had an over supply of surgeons. Wentworth supported himself in London by mastering the art of card playing, and gambling at card tables in several inns and coffee houses. He found that many of those who lost to him would simply refuse to pay.\n\nEventually, Wentworth pursued a number of prominent players who had defaulted on their debts. Chief Magistrate and novelist, [[Henry Fielding]], had described gambling as, ''the School in which most Highwaymen of great Eminence have been bred.'' <ref>Henry Fielding, \u201cAn Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase in Robbers\u201d, London, 1751, Part III.</ref> Wentworth was arraigned before the Courts four times for highway robbery, but never convicted. On each occasion his defaulter either failed to appear to prosecute him, found himself unable to positively identify D'Arcy Wentworth, or sought only to name and shame him. \n\nIn March 1787, Fitzwilliam's patronage secured him a direction from the Home Office, to leave without delay for [[Portsmouth]], where the [[First Fleet]] was making ready to sail to [[Botany Bay]]. He was to seek out [[John White]], Principal Surgeon, on the ''[[Charlotte]]'', who could advise him of any vacancies for assistant surgeons on the Fleet. D'Arcy learnt  that to become a naval surgeon he would require another accreditation from the Company of Surgeons. He returned to his studies, and on 5 July 1897, he appeared before the Court of Examiners once again and qualified as an Assistant Surgeon, Second Mate, Third Rate.<ref>Royal College of Surgeons, ''Company of Surgeons Examination Book 1745-1800'', page 22. The rate determined the class of vessel on which the Assistant Surgeon could serve, according to the number of her cannons.</ref>\n\n== Arrival in the Colony of New South Wales ==                                   \nOn 17 January 1790, Wentworth left England on the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] on board the ''[[Neptune (1780 ship)|Neptune]]'', the most notorious of the convict transports. The neglect and ill treatment of her convicts resulted in the deaths of one hundred and forty-seven men and eleven women, over 30% of the.convicts she transported. Wentworth was on board as a passenger, he had no influence, no position on the ship and no employment arranged in the Colony. He arrived in Sydney on 26 June 1790, he spent his first five weeks assisting the local surgeons to care for the newly arrived convicts. \n\nThe Colony was short of food, strict rationing had been in place for three months. Five weeks after the ''[[Neptune]]'' arrived, to avoid a worsening disaster, Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] sent nearly 200 convicts and their superintendents to [[Norfolk Island]] on the ''[[Surprize (1780 ship)|Surprize]]''. Wentworth was sent with them, ''to act as an assistant to the surgeon there, being reputed to have the necessary requisites for such a situation\".<ref>Captain David Collins, \"Diary\", 1 August 1780.</ref>\n\nWentworth went ashore on Norfolk Island on 16 August 1790. The Commandant, Lt. Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] appointed him as an unpaid Assistant Surgeon. On the island, he became a good friend of Captain [[John Hunter]], whose vessel, ''[[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS Sirius]]'', was wrecked on a sunken reef off the island five months earlier. Hunter and most of his crew were stranded there for nearly a year, awaiting a vessel to return to Sydney. \n\nIn December 1791, King appointed Wentworth to a second, paid position on [[Norfolk Island]], as Superintendent of Convicts, responsible for overseeing up to 150 convict labourers on building projects, land clearing and farm work.<ref>Lieut. Governor King to Governor Phillip, 29 December 1791, ''HRNSW'', Vol.I, Part II, page 575. </ref>  In June 1793, Earl Fitzwilliam offered him a lifeline, he appointed his London lawyer, Charles Cookney, Wentworth's agent, making it possible for him to become an early trader in the Colony<ref>Earl Fitzwilliam to D'Arcy Wentworth, 24 June 1793. ''Wentworth Woodhouse Muniments,'' Sheffield.</ref>  \n\n== Public Life ==\nDuring his thirty-seven years in New South Wales, D'Arcy Wentworth served under the first seven governors of the Colony.\n\n===Governor Arthur Phillip, RN, 12 October 1786 to 10 December 1792===\n[[Arthur Phillip]], the first Governor of New South Wales, returned to England in 1792, after five years in the Colony. He applied for leave in April 1790, and again in March and November 1791, but received no response from London. Weak, ill, and in constant pain, the Governor made his own arrangements. He delegated Major [[Francis Grose]], senior officer of the [[New South Wales Corps]], to act as administrator in his absence, and on 11 December 1792 he left Sydney Town on the ''Atlantic.'' Two Aboriginal men, [[Bennelong]] and Imeeranwanyee, who had befriended and assisted him during the first years of the settlement, accompanied him to England.\n\n===Governor John Hunter, RN, 6 February 1794 to 27 December 1800===\nPhillip\u2019s successor, Captain [[John Hunter]], was appointed in February 1794. He had been Phillip\u2019s second in command, the captain of ''[[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS Sirius]]'' that had provided a naval escort for the [[First Fleet]]. He was to return to the Colony on ''[[HMS Reliance]]'', but after she was thrown ashore at Plymouth in wild weather, it was another year before he sailed. After an anxious voyage through French infested waters, Governor [[Hunter]] arrived in Sydney on 7 September 1795, nearly three years after Phillip\u2019s departure.\n \nIn that time, Major [[Grose]] had placed the Colony under military rule. He had abolished the Courts, made generous land grants to his officers and provided them with convict labour, fed and clothed at Government expense. Food produced on their farms could be sold profitably to the Government Stores. Under [[Arthur Phillip|Phillip]] rationing had applied to everyone, including the Governor. After a poor harvest in 1793, [[Grose]] decreased food rations for the convicts but not for the military. \n\n[[Arthur Phillip|Phillip]] had not permitted the military to import spirits or goods to trade. Neither [[Grose]] nor [[William Paterson]], who succeeded him in December 1794, imposed such restrictions. Groups of officers chartered ships to deliver alcohol and tradeable goods to the Colony, the scarce coinage was replaced by rum, it became the Colony\u2019s currency, used to pay for labour, food and other necessities. The [[New South Wales Corps]] became known as the ''Rum Corps''. When [[Hunter]] arrived in late 1795, he found the Colony completely altered, rife with drunkenness and crime. The populace, subject to the whims of the Rum Corps, was riven with divisions and hostilities. \n\nUnder [[Grose]], the Rum Corps officers controlled the prices of all imported commodities, their monopoly over trading reaped enormous profits. Emancipated convicts, no longer on Government rations, were unable to pay for necessities. If they provided labour to officers or wealthy settlers, they were exploited for negligible reward. Many went into debt or bankruptcy, abandoned their land grants or sold them cheaply to the officers and crowded back into Sydney Town to live or to await an opportunity to join a ship going home.\n\nGovernor Hunter gave D\u2019Arcy Wentworth permission to leave Norfolk Island, and he arrived back in Sydney on 5 March 1796. He had worked without a break for six years on the island. He received \u00a340 a year as Superintendent of Convicts, but had not been paid for his work as Assistant Surgeon. His applications for leave and requests for his position to be regularized had been ignored. In London, Earl Fitzwilliam pursued the matter of payment for his service as Assistant Surgeon, and in 1798, as a result of his efforts, Wentworth was paid arrears of \u00a3160, for six years work.<ref>Charles Cookney to D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, 1798, \"Wentworth Papers\", Mitchell Library, Sydney.</ref>\n\nSoon after Wentworth\u2019s return, Governor [[Hunter]] appointed him to Sydney Cove Hospital as an Assistant Surgeon, replacing Samuel Leeds, who disqualified himself though drunkenness. In Sydney, [[Hunter]] allowed several people including Wentworth, to act as traders, in an attempt to break the power of the Rum Corps officers through competition, and lower the price of commodities. On 11 May 1799, he appointed Wentworth Assistant Surgeon at Parramatta, in charge of the hospital there, replacing James Mileham, later court martialled for refusing to attend the settlers, free people, and others. <ref>Thomas Jamison, Principal Surgeon, to Earl Camden, 20 July 1805.

P.J.Fulton, Meigunyah Press, Melbourne, 2000. </ref> A week later, on 16 May 1799, Governor Hunter granted him a fourteen year lease over six acres and twenty roods, on a knoll at Parramatta, overlooking the river. Wentworth planted a dozen young Norfolk Island pines along the ridge line, and built a comfortable two storey house he named ''Wentworth Woodhouse''. John Price, surgeon on the ''Minerva,'' visited him there, he described it as ''charmingly situated and, as Milton says, \"Bosomed high in tufted trees\".'' <ref> John Washington Price, op cit. Price was quoting from John Milton\u2019s ''L\u2019Allegro'':''Towers & battlements it sees, bosom\u2019d high in tufted trees.''</ref>  \n\n===Governor Philip Gidley King, RN, 28 September 1800 to 12 August 1806===\nWentworth had been friendly with [[Philip Gidley King]] on [[Norfolk Island]]. On 15 April 1800, King returned to Sydney from London with a dormant commission, to act as governor in the case of the death or during the absence of Captain [[John Hunter]].<ref>Dublin Post, 27 January 1798.</ref> During Governor Hunter\u2019s final five months in the Colony, Wentworth provided friendship, assistance and undivided loyalty. His support rankled King. When he took over as governor, King curtailed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth\u2019s trading, he impounded his trading stock and sent him back to [[Norfolk Island]]. John Grant, an emancipist, commented, ''Governor King hates Hunter\u2019s friends.''<ref>John Grant to his mother and sister, 13 July 1804, John Grant Papers, NLA.</ref>\n \n===Captain William Bligh, RN, 13 August 1806 to 26 January 1808===\nCaptain [[William Bligh]], who succeeded King, had D\u2019Arcy Wentworth court martialled for disrespect, the result of conflicting instructions given by the Governor.  As a consequence of Bligh\u2019s belligerence, Wentworth supported Major [[George Johnston]] and [[John Macarthur]] in the [[Rum Rebellion]] on 26 January 1808, that overthrew the Governor and placed him under house arrest.\n \n===Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, CB, 1 January 1810 to 1 December 1821===\n[[Lachlan Macquarie]] came ashore in Sydney on 1 January 1810. On 7 January he issued a Government and General Order declaring all official appointments made since Bligh\u2019s arrest null and void. On 20 February 1810, he ordered that D\u2019Arcy Wentworth remain as Principal Surgeon, pending instructions from London. Macquarie recommended his appointment in his first despatch: ''Mr Wentworth is a gentleman of considerable professional abilities, extremely attentive and humane in his attendance and practice, and in every respect well qualified for being placed at the head of the medical department here.''<ref> Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 8 March 1810, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 306.</ref> \n\nUnder Governor Macquarie, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth found great recognition. From the outset Macquarie respected his judgement, he placed new and heavy responsibilities on his shoulders, and Wentworth responded with absolute loyalty and diligence. Macquarie found him ''indefagitable in his Exertions and Assiduity''.<ref> Governor Macquarie to Earl Liverpool, 18 October 1811, ''HRNSW'', Vol. VII, page 600.</ref>  The two men, both over six feet tall, were the same age, forty-seven, born a fortnight apart in 1762. They shared their generation\u2019s belief in the principles of the Enlightenment. They recognized that reason, science, and an exchange of ideas, knowledge and experience were necessary to progress the Colony and to achieve Macquarie\u2019s vision for a more harmonious and inclusive society.\n\nOn 31 March 1810, Macquarie appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, Treasurer of the Colonial Police Fund, the consolidated revenue fund of the Colony. He was effectively the Treasurer of the Colony, responsible for receiving revenue raised within the Colony from government activities, including three-quarters of all customs duties, fees collected at the port and town of Sydney, licensing fees from markets, inns, hotels and breweries, and the licences recently issued to publicans for vending spirituous liquors.<ref>Government and General Order, ''Sydney Gazette'', 31 March 1810.</ref> Macquarie ordered the Fund was to be used for: ''All Gaol and Police Expenses of every description shall be defrayed, together with such other Expended as may be necessarily incurred in ornamenting and improving the Town of Sydney, and in constructing and repairing the Quays, Wharfs, Bridges, Streets and Roads.''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 354.</ref> Wentworth submitted quarterly accounts to the Governor for his approval, that were published in the ''Sydney Gazette''.\n\nOn 7 April 1810, Macquarie made Wentworth a Commissioner of the new turnpike road to be built from Sydney to Parramatta and the Hawkesbury.<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 7 April 1810</ref> On 17 May 1810, the Governor appointed Wentworth one of two Justices of the Peace.<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 19 May 1810.</ref> On 11 August 1810, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth was made a member of the Court of Civil Jurisdiction.<ref>Sydney Gazette, 11 August 1810.</ref>\n\nOn 6 October 1810, Macquarie announced Sydney was to have a single effective police force. He appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth Chief Magistrate and Superintendent of Police,<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 29 December 1810,</ref> informing Lord Liverpool: ''I found the police of the town of Sydney very defective and totally inadequate to the preserving of peace and good order in this populous and extensive town. Under the Appellation of Superintendent of the Police at Sydney, I have appointed Mr D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, the present Acting Principal Surgeon, whose long residence in the Country gave him so full a Knowledge of the Persons and Characters of the Inhabitants as rendered him particularly well qualified for the Situation\u2026He has merited my fullest Approbation and that of the Public''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Lord Liverpool, 18 October 1811, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 386.</ref>\n\nIn 1814, Macquarie set up the ''Native Institute for the Education of Indigenous Children'', and appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth to the committee of management.<ref>Government and General Order, ''Sydney Gazette'', Saturday, 24 December 1814.</ref> Wentworth had the respect and trust of the Aboriginal people in Sydney, they could take their grievances to him as Police Magistrate and could look to him for support and redress. Peter Cunningham, a Scot who made four trips to the Colony as ship\u2019s surgeon, before settling in the Hunter Valley, observed: ''all the Natives around Sydney understand English well, & speak it too, so as to be understood by the residents. The Billingsgate slang they certainly have acquired in perfection, & no white need think of competing with them in abuse or hard swearing, a constant torrent of which flows from their mouths as long as their antagonist remains before them; it is no use for him to reply, his words being quickly drowned in the roar of cursings & contemptuous appellations. I have stood for a considerable time witnessing contests of this kind, our Native satyrs invariably forcing their opponents to retrograde, while the instant blacky perceived whity beating a retreat, he vociferates after him\u2014\u201cGo along you dam rascal; go along you dam scoundrel; go along you dam blackguard\u201d exalting his voice as the enemy retires. But should this volley of abuse provoke \u201cwhite fellow\u201d to run up and threaten to strike him, \u201cblacky\u201d would dare him to the scratch, threaten him with Jail & Massa Wenta'', (D\u2019Arcy Wentworth) ''if he attempted it''.<ref>Peter Cunningham, ''Two Years in New South Wales,'' Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1827, Vol. 1, page 21.</ref>\n\n====The Rum Hospital====\nOne of Wentworth\u2019s achievements was the construction of new hospital for Sydney. In 1806, Governor Bligh reported the wooden hospital at Dawes Point, that arrived on the Second Fleet, was ''rotten and decayed, not worth rep\u2019g'', and the other hospitals were in ''a ruinous state''.<ref>Governor Bligh to William Windham, 25 January 1807, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol.VI, page 99.</ref> \nMacquarie confirmed this in his first despatch to London: ''there will be an absolute necessity for building a new general hospital as soon as possible''. It was necessary to provide ''a proper place of reception, and more secure detention of the sick, and of moving it to a more airy and retired situation in the town''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 8 March 1810, ''HRNSW'', Vol.VI, page 99</ref> Without waiting for a reply, within two months the Governor had called for tenders.<ref>Bigge Report, Vol. III, page 105.</ref>\n \nMacquarie signed the contract for construction of a new hospital on 6 November 1810, with a consortium of businessmen\u2013Garnham Blaxcell and Alexander Riley, later joined by D'Arcy Wentworth. They would receive convict labour and a monopoly on rum imports, from which they expected to recoup the cost of the building and gain considerable profits. The contract allowed them an exclusive right to import 45,000 (later increased to 60,000) gallons of rum to sell, with the excise collected, paid into the Colonial Fund. Their projected profit on the building of the hospital did not eventuate, as a result of many unforeseen problems and the cost of the remedial work required. On its completion in 1816, convict patients were transferred to the new hospital, known as the \"Rum Hospital\".<ref>''HRA'' Series 1, Vol. VI. page 99, and Vol. VII, pages 306 & 596. Bigge Report Vol. III, page 105</ref>.\n   \n====Bank of New South Wales====\nThe Colony of New South Wales was established without any cash. Coinage brought to the Colony leaked out rapidly, mainly on ships that called with necessities, clothes, food, and knick knacks. As a result there was insufficient coinage to permit normal business transactions, forcing the Colony to rely on local paper currency and rum.\n \nOn 30 April 1810, Macquarie wrote to Lord Castlereagh: ''there is one circumstance to which I beg your Lordship\u2019s most serious attention, as on it seems to hinge much of the future prosperity of this colony. In consequence of there being neither gold nor silver coins of any denomination, nor any legal currency, as a substitute for specie in the colony, the people have been in some degree forced on the expedient of issuing and receiving notes of hand to supply the place of real money, and this petty banking has thrown open a door to frauds and impositions of a most grievous nature to the country at large\u2026At present the agricultural and commercial pursuits of the territory are very much impeded and obstructed by the want of some adequately secured circulating medium''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, ''HRNSW'', Vol.VII, page 348</ref>.\n\nUnder D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, the Colonial Fund had a quasi-bank role, printing promissary notes and issuing them as currency, to people who had claims on the Fund. Wentworth had the ''Sydney Gazette'' print books of notes, labelled Police Fund, with four different Sterling values: two shillings and sixpence, five shillings, ten shillings and one pound. To protect against forgery, he had a Latin quotation from Cicero with a decorative border printed on the reverse side, and he signed each note. They circulated throughout the Colony, helping to overcome the shortage of small change.\n\nThe idea of establishing a bank was raised in March 1810, but it wasn't until November 1816 that a meeting was held to discuss the proposal. In February 1817, the Bank of New South Wales was established, Macquarie gave it a Charter as a joint stock company, providing its directors with limited liability. The first directors were: D'Arcy Wentworth, John Harris, Robert Jenkins, Thomas Wylde, Alexander Riley, William Redfern and John Thomas Campbell. Campbell, Macquarie\u2019s secretary, was elected the bank's first president, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth was elected president in 1825.<ref>Reginald Frank Holder, Bank of New South Wales : a history, 1 (1817-1893), 1970, Angus and Robertson, Sydney. ISBN 978-0-207-95362-0</ref> The new bank facilitated financial transactions and encouraged commerce, it helped bring to an end the Colony\u2019s dependence on rum as money, and the need for dubious promissary notes. The bank received deposits from the Colonial Fund, previously held by Wentworth.\n\n==== Macquarie and the Emancipists====\nIn his third despatch to London, written on Easter Monday 1810, Macquarie reported on what he observed as the Colony\u2019s most pressing problem: ''I was very much surprised and Concerned, on my Arrival here, at the extraordinary and illiberal Policy I found had been adopted by all the Persons who had preceded me in Office, respecting those Men who had been originally sent out to this Country as Convicts, but who, by long Habits of Industry and total Reformation of Manners, had not only become respectable, but by Many Degrees the most Useful Members of the Community. Those persons have never been Countenanced or received into Society.''\n\n''I have nevertheless, taken upon my self to adopt a new Line of Conduct, Conceiving that Emancipation, when united with Rectitude and long-tried good Conduct, should lead a Man back to that Rank in Society which he had forfeited, and do away, in as far as the Case will admit, All Retrospect of former bad Conduct. This appears to me to be the greatest inducement that Can be held out towards the Reformation of Manners of the establishment, and I think it is Consistent with the gracious and humane Intentions of His Majesty and His Ministers.''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, HRNSW, Vol.VII, page 348.</ref>\n\nMacquarie welcomed the emancipists into society, he appointed them to positions in the public sector, reversing the previous policy towards former convicts. Most likely D\u2019Arcy Wentworth had advocated on their behalf, for Macquarie had assumed he was an emancipist. He listed for Castlereagh the men who gave the most liberal assistance to government and conducted themselves with the greatest propriety, whom he had: admitted to my table, ''namely Mr D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, principal Surgeon; Mr William Redfern, Assistant Surgeon; Mr Andrew Thompson, an opulent Farmer and Proprietor of Land; and Mr Simeon Lord, an opulent Merchant.''<ref> Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, HRNSW, Vol.VII, page 348.</ref> On 26 July 1811, Lord Liverpool acknowledged the principles Macquarie had outlined.\n\nThe Governor resolutely pursued his new Line of Conduct, championing emancipists of good conduct, raising them into key positions of authority and to a new rank in society. His approach startled and dismayed the Exclusives and wealthier free settlers, and met immediate opposition within the barracks, from the officers of the 73rd Regiment, sent to the Colony to replace the discredited Rum Corps.\nThe most vigorous opponents of the Governor\u2019s new inclusiveness were the clergy and judiciary of the Colony. They worked to frustrate and denigrate his progress, and complained noisily to London. The petitioned Members of Parliament, the Colonial Office and influential spokesmen within their own hierarchies, belaboring them with an increasing stream of grievances and gossip. D\u2019Arcy, working close to Macquarie, became an easy target for much of the venom directed towards the Governor.\n\nIn London, Opposition support for their campaign spurred the Secretary of State, Earl Bathurst, to propose in April 1817: ''the appointment of commissioners who shall forthwith proceed to the settlement with full powers to investigate all the complaints which have been made, both with respect to the treatment of convicts, and the general administration of the government.''<ref>Earl Bathurst to Viscount Sidmouth, 23 April 1817, HRA, Series I, Vol. IX, page 727.</ref>\n\n====John Thomas Bigge & his Report====\nNearly two years later, on 19 January 1819, John Thomas Bigge was appointed Commissioner of Inquiry, with a private instruction from Bathurst to end Macquarie\u2019s dream of an inclusive society in the Colony. <ref>(Earl Bathurst to Commissioner Bigge, 6 January 1819. ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. X, page 2.</ref> \n\nBigge did not attack Macquarie directly in his report, tabled in Parliament in 1822 and 1823, though he maligned him to the authorities in London. In his attempt to discredit Macquarie, Bigge\u2019s report took aim at those closest to the Governor. He attacked D\u2019Arcy Wentworth in particular, personally and professionally, and others who supported Macquarie\u2019s policy of a more inclusive society, including William Redfern and J.T. Campbell, the Governor\u2019s Secretary. \n\nIn May 1818, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth submitted his resignation as Principal Surgeon. Macquarie recommended that William Redfern, his Assistant Surgeon, an emancipist, replace him. Bigge opposed his appointment. On 23 October 1819, three weeks after James Bowman, Wentworth's replacement, arrived with Commissioner Bigge, Wentworth retired as Principal Surgeon. He had served 29 years as a surgeon in New South Wales, ten of those as Principal Surgeon. The Government and General Order announcing his retirement included a note from the Governor:''His Excellency would be doing Injustice to his own Feelings as well as to the Merits of Mr Wentworth, were he not to express an entire Satisfaction at, and unqualified Approbation of, the able, zealous, humane and intelligent Manner in which he has uniformly conducted the Duties of Principal Surgeon; and which His Excellency is happy to bear Testimony, were also conducted with the strictest Honour and Integrity. And whilst His Excellency regrets the Retirement of so able and useful a Medical Officer, he doubts not that the numerous and humane and charitable Acts which have so eminently distinguished his Professional Character during a long Course of Years will afford him a constant Source of the most consolatory and gratifying Reflections on every Retrospect of his active and important Public Service''.<ref>Government & General Order, 23 October 1819.</ref>\n\nIn March 1820, Wentworth resigned as Superintendent of Police, and received another public acknowledgement from Macquarie: ''In receiving Mr Wentworth\u2019s resignation of the office of Superintendent of Police, which he has filled for nearly ten years past with equal credit to himself and benefit to the community, his Excellency feels it due to that Gentleman to express in this public manner his unqualified approbation his steady, upright, able and impartial conduct in the discharge of its arduous and important duties''.<ref>Government and General Order 31 March 1820, ''Sydney Gazette'', 1 April 1820</ref>.  \nSix months later, when Wentworth resigned as Treasurer of the Police Fund, Macquarie made a further ''public Testimony of Approbation of his honourable, zealous, and punctual discharge of the important Trust which has been confided to him for upwards of ten Years past as Treasurer of the Police Fund''.<ref>Government and General Order 3 June 1820, ''Sydney Gazette'', 3 June 1820</ref>. In he Report, Bigge  referred to <ref>''the punctuality and credit with which Mr Wentworth acquitted himself in the discharge of his duty as Treasurer''</ref>.\n\nA few months later, on 26 March 1821, Wentworth\u2019s replacement William Minchin died, and Macquarie persuaded him to return as Superintendent of Police and Treasurer of the Colonial Revenue. He wrote to Earl  Bathurst, ''there was no-one else in the Colony capable of performing the duties''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Earl Bathurst, 21 July 1821, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. X, page 532.</ref>. D\u2019Arcy agreed to his request, and on 21 July 1821, his return was greeted with wide acclaim<ref>D\u2019Arcy Wentworth to Charles Cookney, 22 July 1821, Wentworth Papers, ML.</ref>.\n\nOn 31 January 1822, his sixtieth birthday, Macquarie invited D\u2019Arcy and other close friends to celebrate. At day break on 12 February 1822, with his wife Elizabeth and son Lachlan, he passed through an ''immense concourse'' to the harbour, filled with ''a great gathering of launches, barges, cutters, pinnaces and wherries'', and went aboard the ''Surry'', for the voyage home. ''The Surry was towed slowly through the ships in the cove, which were all manned with colours displayed, and many of them saluting in honour of the occasion, the Battery saluting at the same time with 19 guns. The New Fort (named Fort Macquarie) and all the Rocks on Bennelong Point, as well as the Dawes Battery and the Rocks on the Northern side of the Harbour were covered with men, women and children and a vast number of boats were also sailing or rowing in the Harbour, full of People \u2013 cheering us repeatedly as we passed along through them.''<ref>Lachlan Macquarie, ''Journals''.</ref>\nThe ''Gazette'' reported: ''never did Sydney look so attractive and gay. The shores were lined with spectators, innumerable, but on each countenance was an indication of feeling too big, too sincere for utterance''<ref>''Sydney Gazette'\", 15 February 1822.</ref>.\n\n===Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, CB, 1 December 1821 to 1 December 1825===\n \n \n \n\n\n\nWentworth had several children by several local women; he acknowledged [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]] as his eldest son.  According to Ritchie (page 23), Wentworth did not board the ''Neptune'' until mid-December 1789 when he met for the first time Catherine Crowley, who was already on board.  Catherine gave birth to William on 13 August 1790, barely eight months later (Ritchie page 52).  Ritchie on page 53 noted that the baby was at least five weeks premature and had to struggle for his life.  Wentworth, who had assisted at the birth, appeared to have no doubt that the baby was his. A second child, [[D'Arcy Wentworth, Jr.|Dorset Crowley]], was born in 1793.\n\nIn 1799, Wentworth was appointed surgeon at Parramatta. He leased land in the vicinity of D\u2019Arcy Street in [[Parramatta]], before 6 acres were granted to him. He was later granted twelve acres in 1810.<ref name=parracouncil>{{cite web|url=http://arc.parracity.nsw.gov.au/city-of-parramatta-wards/origins-of-parramatta-street-names/|title=Parramatta Central Business District (CBD) Street Names|website=City of Parramatta Council Research Services|accessdate=24 May 2019|date=April 2019}}</ref>\n\nWentworth was granted 3.73&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land in what is now known as north [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]], part of the [[Strathfield|Strathfield municipality]].  Historian Michael Jones says that \"Wentworth is popularly credited with having called the area after his 'home in the bush', although Homebush is also a place in Kent.\" In about 1807, he sold to Gregory Blaxland {{convert|450|acre|ha}} at the Brush Farm (near [[Eastwood, New South Wales|Eastwood]]) for \u00a31500. In Homebush he was put in charge of the police force and in 1810 became the commissioner of a toll road from Sydney to Parramatta.\n\nAround 1808, Wentworth played a significant role in the [[Rum Rebellion]] against Governor [[William Bligh]]. The participants in the rebellion claimed that Bligh had suspended Wentworth from his role as assistant surgeon on the staff, without reason or justice.\n\nIn 1810 Wentworth with two others was given by Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] a licence to import large quantities of [[rum]] on condition that they built a hospital to cater for up to two hundred patients. The original [[Sydney Hospital]] was in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|the Rocks]], but the one covered by the contract was in [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]]. What was the original Sydney Hospital in Macquarie Street became in 1854 the [[Sydney branch of the Royal Mint]]. Wentworth was one of the original shareholders and directors of the [[Bank of New South Wales]] (now Westpac Banking Corporation) formed at the end of 1816. \n \nWentworth built his home in the relatively secluded settlement he had been apportioned. By the time of his death Wentworth had accumulated 543.2&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land and had built a large family home. He died in 1827 and his property was inherited by his acknowledged son, William Charles Wentworth. His funeral procession, which started at Homebush and ended at Parramatta, was attended by 150 mourners.\n\nAnother part of his property, nine portions of land around Sydney, were inherited under entail by his daughter Katherine. The lands came to be known as the Bassett-Darley Estate in acknowledgement of Katherine's two marriages, and became the subject of litigation and an Act of Parliament to remove the legal impediments to their sale.\n\n==Recognition==\nThe Sydney suburbs of [[Wentworthville]] and [[Wentworth Point, New South Wales|Wentworth Point]] are named after him. Darcy Street (formerly D'arcy Street), within [[Parramatta]], is also named after him.<ref name=parracouncil/> Woodhouse Lane, also within Parramatta, was named after his two story mansion known as \"Wentworth Woodhouse\", which was built in this area.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n \nWal Walker, a descendant of Wentworth, argues that his ancestor was a lover of [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://janeanddarcy.com/ | title=Jane & D\u02bcArcy \u2013 the Secret Romance Revealed}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* Barker, Hedley Philip (1971), [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110356330 'D'Arcy Wentworth', with bibliography], unpublished thesis submitted for M.A., Department of History, [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], Armidale, NSW.

He served under the first seven governors of the Colony, and from 1810 to 1821, he was ''great assistant'' to Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]. Wentworth led a campaign for the rights and recognition of [[Emancipist|emancipists]] and for [[trial by jury]].<ref>W.W.Walker, ''[[Jane & D'Arcy: Jane Austen & D'Arcy Wentworth]]'' Volume 2, ''[[Such Talent& Such Success]]'', Arcana Press, 2017, page 315</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nD'Arcy Wentworth was born in [[Portadown]], [[County Armagh]], [[Ireland]], the sixth child and fourth son of Martha and D'Arcy Wentworth. His family had left Yorkshire for safe haven in Ireland after the execution of [[Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]], in 1641. In 1778, aged sixteen, D'Arcy was apprenticed to Alexander Patton, a surgeon-apothecary, in nearby [[Tandragee]]. In 1782, he joined the [[Ulster Volunteers]], one of the local regiments formed during the [[American War of Independence]], to defend Ireland against invasion from France. In May 1785, having completed a seven-year apprenticeship, D'Arcy left Ireland. He was seeking an appointment with the [[East India Company]], and as the training of Irish surgeons was not recognised in England, it was necessary to go to London to gain accreditation.\n\n== Life in England ==\nWentworth sailed on the mailboat from Donaghadee to Portpatrick in Scotland. First he went to South Yorkshire, as the guest of his cousin, [[William Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam]], at ''[[Wentworth Woodhouse]].'' It was the beginning os a lifelong friendship. Fitzwilliam gave D'Arcy encouragement and advice. He attended Whig party gatherings and race meetings at [[York]], [[Doncaster]] and [[Wakefield]] with Fitzwilliam, who introduced him to the societies of York and London, with their up and coming lawyers, young politicians and aspiring bureaucrats. \n\nOn 1 December 1785, Wentworth went before the Court of Examiners of the Company of Surgeons in London. He qualified as a ''Mate to Indiamen,'' eligible to work with the East India Companyonce he had twelve months practical experience ''walking the wards'' in one of London's large charity hospitals.<ref>Royal College of Surgeons, \"Company of Surgeons Examination Book 1745-1800, page 11.</ref> Wentworth accepted the invitation of [[Percivall Pott]],one of his examiners, to ''walk the wards'' of St Bartholomew's, Smithfield under his direction. He attended lectures by other prominent physicians such as [[John Hunter]],and dissections held in the Company of Surgeons' anatomy theatre at the Old Bailey.\n\nWentworth waited in vain for a position to become available in the [[East India Company]]. [[Warren Hastings]] had brought peace to India, and the Company had an over supply of surgeons. Wentworth supported himself in London by mastering the art of card playing, and gambling at card tables in several inns and coffee houses. He found that many of those who lost to him would simply refuse to pay.\n\nEventually, Wentworth pursued a number of prominent players who had defaulted on their debts. Chief Magistrate and novelist, [[Henry Fielding]], had described gambling as, ''the School in which most Highwaymen of great Eminence have been bred.'' <ref>Henry Fielding, \u201cAn Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase in Robbers\u201d, London, 1751, Part III.</ref> Wentworth was arraigned before the Courts four times for highway robbery, but never convicted. On each occasion his defaulter either failed to appear to prosecute him, found himself unable to positively identify D'Arcy Wentworth, or sought only to name and shame him. \n\nIn March 1787, Fitzwilliam's patronage secured him a direction from the Home Office, to leave without delay for [[Portsmouth]], where the [[First Fleet]] was making ready to sail to [[Botany Bay]]. He was to seek out [[John White]], Principal Surgeon, on the ''[[Charlotte]]'', who could advise him of any vacancies for assistant surgeons on the Fleet. D'Arcy learnt  that to become a naval surgeon he would require another accreditation from the Company of Surgeons. He returned to his studies, and on 5 July 1897, he appeared before the Court of Examiners once again and qualified as an Assistant Surgeon, Second Mate, Third Rate.<ref>Royal College of Surgeons, ''Company of Surgeons Examination Book 1745-1800'', page 22. The rate determined the class of vessel on which the Assistant Surgeon could serve, according to the number of her cannons.</ref>\n\n== Arrival in the Colony of New South Wales ==                                   \nOn 17 January 1790, Wentworth left England on the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]] on board the ''[[Neptune (1780 ship)|Neptune]]'', the most notorious of the convict transports. The neglect and ill treatment of her convicts resulted in the deaths of one hundred and forty-seven men and eleven women, over 30% of the.convicts she transported. Wentworth was on board as a passenger, he had no influence, no position on the ship and no employment arranged in the Colony. He arrived in Sydney on 26 June 1790, he spent his first five weeks assisting the local surgeons to care for the newly arrived convicts. \n\nThe Colony was short of food, strict rationing had been in place for three months. Five weeks after the ''[[Neptune]]'' arrived, to avoid a worsening disaster, Governor [[Arthur Phillip]] sent nearly 200 convicts and their superintendents to [[Norfolk Island]] on the ''[[Surprize (1780 ship)|Surprize]]''. Wentworth was sent with them, ''to act as an assistant to the surgeon there, being reputed to have the necessary requisites for such a situation\".<ref>Captain David Collins, \"Diary\", 1 August 1780.</ref>\n\nWentworth went ashore on Norfolk Island on 16 August 1790. The Commandant, Lt. Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] appointed him as an unpaid Assistant Surgeon. On the island, he became a good friend of Captain [[John Hunter]], whose vessel, ''[[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS Sirius]]'', was wrecked on a sunken reef off the island five months earlier. Hunter and most of his crew were stranded there for nearly a year, awaiting a vessel to return to Sydney. \n\nIn December 1791, King appointed Wentworth to a second, paid position on [[Norfolk Island]], as Superintendent of Convicts, responsible for overseeing up to 150 convict labourers on building projects, land clearing and farm work.<ref>Lieut. Governor King to Governor Phillip, 29 December 1791, ''HRNSW'', Vol.I, Part II, page 575. </ref>  In June 1793, Earl Fitzwilliam offered him a lifeline, he appointed his London lawyer, Charles Cookney, Wentworth's agent, making it possible for him to become an early trader in the Colony<ref>Earl Fitzwilliam to D'Arcy Wentworth, 24 June 1793. ''Wentworth Woodhouse Muniments,'' Sheffield.</ref>  \n\n== Public Life ==\nDuring his thirty-seven years in New South Wales, D'Arcy Wentworth served under the first seven governors of the Colony.\n\n===Governor Arthur Phillip, RN, 12 October 1786 to 10 December 1792===\n[[Arthur Phillip]], the first Governor of New South Wales, returned to England in 1792, after five years in the Colony. He applied for leave in April 1790, and again in March and November 1791, but received no response from London. Weak, ill, and in constant pain, the Governor made his own arrangements. He delegated Major [[Francis Grose]], senior officer of the [[New South Wales Corps]], to act as administrator in his absence, and on 11 December 1792 he left Sydney Town on the ''Atlantic.'' Two Aboriginal men, [[Bennelong]] and Imeeranwanyee, who had befriended and assisted him during the first years of the settlement, accompanied him to England.\n\n===Governor John Hunter, RN, 6 February 1794 to 27 December 1800===\nPhillip\u2019s successor, Captain [[John Hunter]], was appointed in February 1794. He had been Phillip\u2019s second in command, the captain of ''[[HMS Sirius (1786)|HMS Sirius]]'' that had provided a naval escort for the [[First Fleet]]. He was to return to the Colony on ''[[HMS Reliance]]'', but after she was thrown ashore at Plymouth in wild weather, it was another year before he sailed. After an anxious voyage through French infested waters, Governor [[Hunter]] arrived in Sydney on 7 September 1795, nearly three years after Phillip\u2019s departure.\n \nIn that time, Major [[Grose]] had placed the Colony under military rule. He had abolished the Courts, made generous land grants to his officers and provided them with convict labour, fed and clothed at Government expense. Food produced on their farms could be sold profitably to the Government Stores. Under [[Arthur Phillip|Phillip]] rationing had applied to everyone, including the Governor. After a poor harvest in 1793, [[Grose]] decreased food rations for the convicts but not for the military. \n\n[[Arthur Phillip|Phillip]] had not permitted the military to import spirits or goods to trade. Neither [[Grose]] nor [[William Paterson]], who succeeded him in December 1794, imposed such restrictions. Groups of officers chartered ships to deliver alcohol and tradeable goods to the Colony, the scarce coinage was replaced by rum, it became the Colony\u2019s currency, used to pay for labour, food and other necessities. The [[New South Wales Corps]] became known as the ''Rum Corps''. When [[Hunter]] arrived in late 1795, he found the Colony completely altered, rife with drunkenness and crime. The populace, subject to the whims of the Rum Corps, was riven with divisions and hostilities. \n\nUnder [[Grose]], the Rum Corps officers controlled the prices of all imported commodities, their monopoly over trading reaped enormous profits. Emancipated convicts, no longer on Government rations, were unable to pay for necessities. If they provided labour to officers or wealthy settlers, they were exploited for negligible reward. Many went into debt or bankruptcy, abandoned their land grants or sold them cheaply to the officers and crowded back into Sydney Town to live or to await an opportunity to join a ship going home.\n\nGovernor Hunter gave D\u2019Arcy Wentworth permission to leave Norfolk Island, and he arrived back in Sydney on 5 March 1796. He had worked without a break for six years on the island. He received \u00a340 a year as Superintendent of Convicts, but had not been paid for his work as Assistant Surgeon. His applications for leave and requests for his position to be regularized had been ignored. In London, Earl Fitzwilliam pursued the matter of payment for his service as Assistant Surgeon, and in 1798, as a result of his efforts, Wentworth was paid arrears of \u00a3160, for six years work.<ref>Charles Cookney to D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, 1798, \"Wentworth Papers\", Mitchell Library, Sydney.</ref>\n\nSoon after Wentworth\u2019s return, Governor [[Hunter]] appointed him to Sydney Cove Hospital as an Assistant Surgeon, replacing Samuel Leeds, who disqualified himself though drunkenness. In Sydney, [[Hunter]] allowed several people including Wentworth, to act as traders, in an attempt to break the power of the Rum Corps officers through competition, and lower the price of commodities. On 11 May 1799, he appointed Wentworth Assistant Surgeon at Parramatta, in charge of the hospital there, replacing James Mileham, later court martialled for refusing to attend the settlers, free people, and others. <ref>Thomas Jamison, Principal Surgeon, to Earl Camden, 20 July 1805. ''HRNSW'', Vol. V, page 667.</ref>\n\nD\u2019Arcy Wentworth took up duty at Parramatta Hospital, \u2018\u2019two long sheds, built in the form of a tent, and thatched\u2026capable of holding two hundred patients.\u2019\u2019<ref>Watkin Tench, A Complete Account of the Settlement of Port Jackson, Chapter XVI.</ref> ''It was large and clean with a large vegetable garden attached to it.''<ref>John Washington Price, ''Minerva Journal'', ed. P.J.Fulton, Meigunyah Press, Melbourne, 2000. </ref> A week later, on 16 May 1799, Governor Hunter granted him a fourteen year lease over six acres and twenty roods, on a knoll at Parramatta, overlooking the river. Wentworth planted a dozen young Norfolk Island pines along the ridge line, and built a comfortable two storey house he named ''Wentworth Woodhouse''. John Price, surgeon on the ''Minerva,'' visited him there, he described it as ''charmingly situated and, as Milton says, \"Bosomed high in tufted trees\".'' <ref> John Washington Price, op cit. Price was quoting from John Milton\u2019s ''L\u2019Allegro'':''Towers & battlements it sees, bosom\u2019d high in tufted trees.''</ref>  \n\n===Governor Philip Gidley King, RN, 28 September 1800 to 12 August 1806===\nWentworth had been friendly with [[Philip Gidley King]] on [[Norfolk Island]]. On 15 April 1800, King returned to Sydney from London with a dormant commission, to act as governor in the case of the death or during the absence of Captain [[John Hunter]].<ref>Dublin Post, 27 January 1798.</ref> During Governor Hunter\u2019s final five months in the Colony, Wentworth provided friendship, assistance and undivided loyalty. His support rankled King. When he took over as governor, King curtailed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth\u2019s trading, he impounded his trading stock and sent him back to [[Norfolk Island]]. John Grant, an emancipist, commented, ''Governor King hates Hunter\u2019s friends.''<ref>John Grant to his mother and sister, 13 July 1804, John Grant Papers, NLA.</ref>\n \n===Captain William Bligh, RN, 13 August 1806 to 26 January 1808===\nCaptain [[William Bligh]], who succeeded King, had D\u2019Arcy Wentworth court martialled for disrespect, the result of conflicting instructions given by the Governor.  As a consequence of Bligh\u2019s belligerence, Wentworth supported Major [[George Johnston]] and [[John Macarthur]] in the [[Rum Rebellion]] on 26 January 1808, that overthrew the Governor and placed him under house arrest.\n \n===Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, CB, 1 January 1810 to 1 December 1821===\n[[Lachlan Macquarie]] came ashore in Sydney on 1 January 1810. On 7 January he issued a Government and General Order declaring all official appointments made since Bligh\u2019s arrest null and void. On 20 February 1810, he ordered that D\u2019Arcy Wentworth remain as Principal Surgeon, pending instructions from London. Macquarie recommended his appointment in his first despatch: ''Mr Wentworth is a gentleman of considerable professional abilities, extremely attentive and humane in his attendance and practice, and in every respect well qualified for being placed at the head of the medical department here.''<ref> Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 8 March 1810, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 306.</ref> \n\nUnder Governor Macquarie, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth found great recognition. From the outset Macquarie respected his judgement, he placed new and heavy responsibilities on his shoulders, and Wentworth responded with absolute loyalty and diligence. Macquarie found him ''indefagitable in his Exertions and Assiduity''.<ref> Governor Macquarie to Earl Liverpool, 18 October 1811, ''HRNSW'', Vol. VII, page 600.</ref>  The two men, both over six feet tall, were the same age, forty-seven, born a fortnight apart in 1762. They shared their generation\u2019s belief in the principles of the Enlightenment. They recognized that reason, science, and an exchange of ideas, knowledge and experience were necessary to progress the Colony and to achieve Macquarie\u2019s vision for a more harmonious and inclusive society.\n\nOn 31 March 1810, Macquarie appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, Treasurer of the Colonial Police Fund, the consolidated revenue fund of the Colony. He was effectively the Treasurer of the Colony, responsible for receiving revenue raised within the Colony from government activities, including three-quarters of all customs duties, fees collected at the port and town of Sydney, licensing fees from markets, inns, hotels and breweries, and the licences recently issued to publicans for vending spirituous liquors.<ref>Government and General Order, ''Sydney Gazette'', 31 March 1810.</ref> Macquarie ordered the Fund was to be used for: ''All Gaol and Police Expenses of every description shall be defrayed, together with such other Expended as may be necessarily incurred in ornamenting and improving the Town of Sydney, and in constructing and repairing the Quays, Wharfs, Bridges, Streets and Roads.''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 354.</ref> Wentworth submitted quarterly accounts to the Governor for his approval, that were published in the ''Sydney Gazette''.\n\nOn 7 April 1810, Macquarie made Wentworth a Commissioner of the new turnpike road to be built from Sydney to Parramatta and the Hawkesbury.<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 7 April 1810</ref> On 17 May 1810, the Governor appointed Wentworth one of two Justices of the Peace.<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 19 May 1810.</ref> On 11 August 1810, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth was made a member of the Court of Civil Jurisdiction.<ref>Sydney Gazette, 11 August 1810.</ref>\n\nOn 6 October 1810, Macquarie announced Sydney was to have a single effective police force. He appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth Chief Magistrate and Superintendent of Police,<ref>''Sydney Gazette'', 29 December 1810,</ref> informing Lord Liverpool: ''I found the police of the town of Sydney very defective and totally inadequate to the preserving of peace and good order in this populous and extensive town. Under the Appellation of Superintendent of the Police at Sydney, I have appointed Mr D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, the present Acting Principal Surgeon, whose long residence in the Country gave him so full a Knowledge of the Persons and Characters of the Inhabitants as rendered him particularly well qualified for the Situation\u2026He has merited my fullest Approbation and that of the Public''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Lord Liverpool, 18 October 1811, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. VII, page 386.</ref>\n\nIn 1814, Macquarie set up the ''Native Institute for the Education of Indigenous Children'', and appointed D\u2019Arcy Wentworth to the committee of management.<ref>Government and General Order, ''Sydney Gazette'', Saturday, 24 December 1814.</ref> Wentworth had the respect and trust of the Aboriginal people in Sydney, they could take their grievances to him as Police Magistrate and could look to him for support and redress. Peter Cunningham, a Scot who made four trips to the Colony as ship\u2019s surgeon, before settling in the Hunter Valley, observed: ''all the Natives around Sydney understand English well, & speak it too, so as to be understood by the residents. The Billingsgate slang they certainly have acquired in perfection, & no white need think of competing with them in abuse or hard swearing, a constant torrent of which flows from their mouths as long as their antagonist remains before them; it is no use for him to reply, his words being quickly drowned in the roar of cursings & contemptuous appellations. I have stood for a considerable time witnessing contests of this kind, our Native satyrs invariably forcing their opponents to retrograde, while the instant blacky perceived whity beating a retreat, he vociferates after him\u2014\u201cGo along you dam rascal; go along you dam scoundrel; go along you dam blackguard\u201d exalting his voice as the enemy retires. But should this volley of abuse provoke \u201cwhite fellow\u201d to run up and threaten to strike him, \u201cblacky\u201d would dare him to the scratch, threaten him with Jail & Massa Wenta'', (D\u2019Arcy Wentworth) ''if he attempted it''.<ref>Peter Cunningham, ''Two Years in New South Wales,'' Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1827, Vol. 1, page 21.</ref>\n\n====The Rum Hospital====\nOne of Wentworth\u2019s achievements was the construction of new hospital for Sydney. In 1806, Governor Bligh reported the wooden hospital at Dawes Point, that arrived on the Second Fleet, was ''rotten and decayed, not worth rep\u2019g'', and the other hospitals were in ''a ruinous state''.<ref>Governor Bligh to William Windham, 25 January 1807, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol.VI, page 99.</ref> \nMacquarie confirmed this in his first despatch to London: ''there will be an absolute necessity for building a new general hospital as soon as possible''. It was necessary to provide ''a proper place of reception, and more secure detention of the sick, and of moving it to a more airy and retired situation in the town''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 8 March 1810, ''HRNSW'', Vol.VI, page 99</ref> Without waiting for a reply, within two months the Governor had called for tenders.<ref>Bigge Report, Vol. III, page 105.</ref>\n \nMacquarie signed the contract for construction of a new hospital on 6 November 1810, with a consortium of businessmen\u2013Garnham Blaxcell and Alexander Riley, later joined by D'Arcy Wentworth. They would receive convict labour and a monopoly on rum imports, from which they expected to recoup the cost of the building and gain considerable profits. The contract allowed them an exclusive right to import 45,000 (later increased to 60,000) gallons of rum to sell, with the excise collected, paid into the Colonial Fund. Their projected profit on the building of the hospital did not eventuate, as a result of many unforeseen problems and the cost of the remedial work required. On its completion in 1816, convict patients were transferred to the new hospital, known as the \"Rum Hospital\".<ref>''HRA'' Series 1, Vol. VI. page 99, and Vol. VII, pages 306 & 596. Bigge Report Vol. III, page 105</ref>.\n   \n====Bank of New South Wales====\nThe Colony of New South Wales was established without any cash. Coinage brought to the Colony leaked out rapidly, mainly on ships that called with necessities, clothes, food, and knick knacks. As a result there was insufficient coinage to permit normal business transactions, forcing the Colony to rely on local paper currency and rum.\n \nOn 30 April 1810, Macquarie wrote to Lord Castlereagh: ''there is one circumstance to which I beg your Lordship\u2019s most serious attention, as on it seems to hinge much of the future prosperity of this colony. In consequence of there being neither gold nor silver coins of any denomination, nor any legal currency, as a substitute for specie in the colony, the people have been in some degree forced on the expedient of issuing and receiving notes of hand to supply the place of real money, and this petty banking has thrown open a door to frauds and impositions of a most grievous nature to the country at large\u2026At present the agricultural and commercial pursuits of the territory are very much impeded and obstructed by the want of some adequately secured circulating medium''.<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, ''HRNSW'', Vol.VII, page 348</ref>.\n\nUnder D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, the Colonial Fund had a quasi-bank role, printing promissary notes and issuing them as currency, to people who had claims on the Fund. Wentworth had the ''Sydney Gazette'' print books of notes, labelled Police Fund, with four different Sterling values: two shillings and sixpence, five shillings, ten shillings and one pound. To protect against forgery, he had a Latin quotation from Cicero with a decorative border printed on the reverse side, and he signed each note. They circulated throughout the Colony, helping to overcome the shortage of small change.\n\nThe idea of establishing a bank was raised in March 1810, but it wasn't until November 1816 that a meeting was held to discuss the proposal. In February 1817, the Bank of New South Wales was established, Macquarie gave it a Charter as a joint stock company, providing its directors with limited liability. The first directors were: D'Arcy Wentworth, John Harris, Robert Jenkins, Thomas Wylde, Alexander Riley, William Redfern and John Thomas Campbell. Campbell, Macquarie\u2019s secretary, was elected the bank's first president, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth was elected president in 1825.<ref>Reginald Frank Holder, Bank of New South Wales : a history, 1 (1817-1893), 1970, Angus and Robertson, Sydney. ISBN 978-0-207-95362-0</ref> The new bank facilitated financial transactions and encouraged commerce, it helped bring to an end the Colony\u2019s dependence on rum as money, and the need for dubious promissary notes. The bank received deposits from the Colonial Fund, previously held by Wentworth.\n\n==== Macquarie and the Emancipists====\nIn his third despatch to London, written on Easter Monday 1810, Macquarie reported on what he observed as the Colony\u2019s most pressing problem: ''I was very much surprised and Concerned, on my Arrival here, at the extraordinary and illiberal Policy I found had been adopted by all the Persons who had preceded me in Office, respecting those Men who had been originally sent out to this Country as Convicts, but who, by long Habits of Industry and total Reformation of Manners, had not only become respectable, but by Many Degrees the most Useful Members of the Community. Those persons have never been Countenanced or received into Society.''\n\n''I have nevertheless, taken upon my self to adopt a new Line of Conduct, Conceiving that Emancipation, when united with Rectitude and long-tried good Conduct, should lead a Man back to that Rank in Society which he had forfeited, and do away, in as far as the Case will admit, All Retrospect of former bad Conduct. This appears to me to be the greatest inducement that Can be held out towards the Reformation of Manners of the establishment, and I think it is Consistent with the gracious and humane Intentions of His Majesty and His Ministers.''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, HRNSW, Vol.VII, page 348.</ref>\n\nMacquarie welcomed the emancipists into society, he appointed them to positions in the public sector, reversing the previous policy towards former convicts. Most likely D\u2019Arcy Wentworth had advocated on their behalf, for Macquarie had assumed he was an emancipist. He listed for Castlereagh the men who gave the most liberal assistance to government and conducted themselves with the greatest propriety, whom he had: admitted to my table, ''namely Mr D\u2019Arcy Wentworth, principal Surgeon; Mr William Redfern, Assistant Surgeon; Mr Andrew Thompson, an opulent Farmer and Proprietor of Land; and Mr Simeon Lord, an opulent Merchant.''<ref> Governor Macquarie to Viscount Castlereagh, 30 April 1810, HRNSW, Vol.VII, page 348.</ref> On 26 July 1811, Lord Liverpool acknowledged the principles Macquarie had outlined.\n\nThe Governor resolutely pursued his new Line of Conduct, championing emancipists of good conduct, raising them into key positions of authority and to a new rank in society. His approach startled and dismayed the Exclusives and wealthier free settlers, and met immediate opposition within the barracks, from the officers of the 73rd Regiment, sent to the Colony to replace the discredited Rum Corps.\nThe most vigorous opponents of the Governor\u2019s new inclusiveness were the clergy and judiciary of the Colony. They worked to frustrate and denigrate his progress, and complained noisily to London. The petitioned Members of Parliament, the Colonial Office and influential spokesmen within their own hierarchies, belaboring them with an increasing stream of grievances and gossip. D\u2019Arcy, working close to Macquarie, became an easy target for much of the venom directed towards the Governor.\n\nIn London, Opposition support for their campaign spurred the Secretary of State, Earl Bathurst, to propose in April 1817: ''the appointment of commissioners who shall forthwith proceed to the settlement with full powers to investigate all the complaints which have been made, both with respect to the treatment of convicts, and the general administration of the government.''<ref>Earl Bathurst to Viscount Sidmouth, 23 April 1817, HRA, Series I, Vol. IX, page 727.</ref>\n\n====John Thomas Bigge & his Report====\nNearly two years later, on 19 January 1819, John Thomas Bigge was appointed Commissioner of Inquiry, with a private instruction from Bathurst to end Macquarie\u2019s dream of an inclusive society in the Colony. <ref>(Earl Bathurst to Commissioner Bigge, 6 January 1819. ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. X, page 2.</ref> \n\nBigge did not attack Macquarie directly in his report, tabled in Parliament in 1822 and 1823, though he maligned him to the authorities in London. In his attempt to discredit Macquarie, Bigge\u2019s report took aim at those closest to the Governor. He attacked D\u2019Arcy Wentworth in particular, personally and professionally, and others who supported Macquarie\u2019s policy of a more inclusive society, including William Redfern and J.T. Campbell, the Governor\u2019s Secretary. \n\nIn May 1818, D\u2019Arcy Wentworth submitted his resignation as Principal Surgeon. Macquarie recommended that William Redfern, his Assistant Surgeon, an emancipist, replace him. Bigge opposed his appointment. On 23 October 1819, three weeks after James Bowman, Wentworth's replacement, arrived with Commissioner Bigge, Wentworth retired as Principal Surgeon. He had served 29 years as a surgeon in New South Wales, ten of those as Principal Surgeon. The Government and General Order announcing his retirement included a note from the Governor:''His Excellency would be doing Injustice to his own Feelings as well as to the Merits of Mr Wentworth, were he not to express an entire Satisfaction at, and unqualified Approbation of, the able, zealous, humane and intelligent Manner in which he has uniformly conducted the Duties of Principal Surgeon; and which His Excellency is happy to bear Testimony, were also conducted with the strictest Honour and Integrity. And whilst His Excellency regrets the Retirement of so able and useful a Medical Officer, he doubts not that the numerous and humane and charitable Acts which have so eminently distinguished his Professional Character during a long Course of Years will afford him a constant Source of the most consolatory and gratifying Reflections on every Retrospect of his active and important Public Service''.<ref>Government & General Order, 23 October 1819.</ref>\n\nIn March 1820, Wentworth resigned as Superintendent of Police, and received another public acknowledgement from Macquarie: ''In receiving Mr Wentworth\u2019s resignation of the office of Superintendent of Police, which he has filled for nearly ten years past with equal credit to himself and benefit to the community, his Excellency feels it due to that Gentleman to express in this public manner his unqualified approbation his steady, upright, able and impartial conduct in the discharge of its arduous and important duties''.<ref>Government and General Order 31 March 1820, ''Sydney Gazette'', 1 April 1820</ref>.  \nSix months later, when Wentworth resigned as Treasurer of the Police Fund, Macquarie made a further ''public Testimony of Approbation of his honourable, zealous, and punctual discharge of the important Trust which has been confided to him for upwards of ten Years past as Treasurer of the Police Fund''.<ref>Government and General Order 3 June 1820, ''Sydney Gazette'', 3 June 1820</ref>. In he Report, Bigge  referred to <ref>''the punctuality and credit with which Mr Wentworth acquitted himself in the discharge of his duty as Treasurer''</ref>.\n\nA few months later, on 26 March 1821, Wentworth\u2019s replacement William Minchin died, and Macquarie persuaded him to return as Superintendent of Police and Treasurer of the Colonial Revenue. He wrote to Earl  Bathurst, ''there was no-one else in the Colony capable of performing the duties''<ref>Governor Macquarie to Earl Bathurst, 21 July 1821, ''HRA'', Series I, Vol. X, page 532.</ref>. D\u2019Arcy agreed to his request, and on 21 July 1821, his return was greeted with wide acclaim<ref>D\u2019Arcy Wentworth to Charles Cookney, 22 July 1821, Wentworth Papers, ML.</ref>.\n\nOn 31 January 1822, his sixtieth birthday, Macquarie invited D\u2019Arcy and other close friends to celebrate. At day break on 12 February 1822, with his wife Elizabeth and son Lachlan, he passed through an ''immense concourse'' to the harbour, filled with ''a great gathering of launches, barges, cutters, pinnaces and wherries'', and went aboard the ''Surry'', for the voyage home. ''The Surry was towed slowly through the ships in the cove, which were all manned with colours displayed, and many of them saluting in honour of the occasion, the Battery saluting at the same time with 19 guns. The New Fort (named Fort Macquarie) and all the Rocks on Bennelong Point, as well as the Dawes Battery and the Rocks on the Northern side of the Harbour were covered with men, women and children and a vast number of boats were also sailing or rowing in the Harbour, full of People \u2013 cheering us repeatedly as we passed along through them.''<ref>Lachlan Macquarie, ''Journals''.</ref>\nThe ''Gazette'' reported: ''never did Sydney look so attractive and gay. The shores were lined with spectators, innumerable, but on each countenance was an indication of feeling too big, too sincere for utterance''<ref>''Sydney Gazette'\", 15 February 1822.</ref>.\n\n===Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, CB, 1 December 1821 to 1 December 1825===\n \n \n \n\n\n\nWentworth had several children by several local women; he acknowledged [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]] as his eldest son.  According to Ritchie (page 23), Wentworth did not board the ''Neptune'' until mid-December 1789 when he met for the first time Catherine Crowley, who was already on board.  Catherine gave birth to William on 13 August 1790, barely eight months later (Ritchie page 52).  Ritchie on page 53 noted that the baby was at least five weeks premature and had to struggle for his life.  Wentworth, who had assisted at the birth, appeared to have no doubt that the baby was his. A second child, [[D'Arcy Wentworth, Jr.|Dorset Crowley]], was born in 1793.\n\nIn 1799, Wentworth was appointed surgeon at Parramatta. He leased land in the vicinity of D\u2019Arcy Street in [[Parramatta]], before 6 acres were granted to him. He was later granted twelve acres in 1810.<ref name=parracouncil>{{cite web|url=http://arc.parracity.nsw.gov.au/city-of-parramatta-wards/origins-of-parramatta-street-names/|title=Parramatta Central Business District (CBD) Street Names|website=City of Parramatta Council Research Services|accessdate=24 May 2019|date=April 2019}}</ref>\n\nWentworth was granted 3.73&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land in what is now known as north [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]], part of the [[Strathfield|Strathfield municipality]].  Historian Michael Jones says that \"Wentworth is popularly credited with having called the area after his 'home in the bush', although Homebush is also a place in Kent.\" In about 1807, he sold to Gregory Blaxland {{convert|450|acre|ha}} at the Brush Farm (near [[Eastwood, New South Wales|Eastwood]]) for \u00a31500. In Homebush he was put in charge of the police force and in 1810 became the commissioner of a toll road from Sydney to Parramatta.\n\nAround 1808, Wentworth played a significant role in the [[Rum Rebellion]] against Governor [[William Bligh]]. The participants in the rebellion claimed that Bligh had suspended Wentworth from his role as assistant surgeon on the staff, without reason or justice.\n\nIn 1810 Wentworth with two others was given by Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] a licence to import large quantities of [[rum]] on condition that they built a hospital to cater for up to two hundred patients. The original [[Sydney Hospital]] was in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|the Rocks]], but the one covered by the contract was in [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]]. What was the original Sydney Hospital in Macquarie Street became in 1854 the [[Sydney branch of the Royal Mint]]. Wentworth was one of the original shareholders and directors of the [[Bank of New South Wales]] (now Westpac Banking Corporation) formed at the end of 1816. \n \nWentworth built his home in the relatively secluded settlement he had been apportioned. By the time of his death Wentworth had accumulated 543.2&nbsp;km\u00b2 of land and had built a large family home. He died in 1827 and his property was inherited by his acknowledged son, William Charles Wentworth. His funeral procession, which started at Homebush and ended at Parramatta, was attended by 150 mourners.\n\nAnother part of his property, nine portions of land around Sydney, were inherited under entail by his daughter Katherine. The lands came to be known as the Bassett-Darley Estate in acknowledgement of Katherine's two marriages, and became the subject of litigation and an Act of Parliament to remove the legal impediments to their sale.\n\n==Recognition==\nThe Sydney suburbs of [[Wentworthville]] and [[Wentworth Point, New South Wales|Wentworth Point]] are named after him. Darcy Street (formerly D'arcy Street), within [[Parramatta]], is also named after him.<ref name=parracouncil/> Woodhouse Lane, also within Parramatta, was named after his two story mansion known as \"Wentworth Woodhouse\", which was built in this area.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n \nWal Walker, a descendant of Wentworth, argues that his ancestor was a lover of [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://janeanddarcy.com/ | title=Jane & D\u02bcArcy \u2013 the Secret Romance Revealed}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* Barker, Hedley Philip (1971), [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110356330 'D'Arcy Wentworth', with bibliography], unpublished thesis submitted for M.A., Department of History, [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], Armidale, NSW.

{"title_page": "Adventure Racing World Series", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2017}}\nThe '''Adventure Racing World Series''' (ARWS)<ref>The Free Dictionary, 2011.</ref> is an endurance racing season where [[adventure racing]] teams compete in a range of disciplines including, for example, [[navigation]], [[trekking]], [[mountain biking]], [[paddling]] and [[climbing]].<ref>Science Daily, 2011.</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nMixed gender teams of four competitors compete in a series of up to a dozen races held in locations spread across the globe.  These races culminate in the staging of the Adventure Racing World Championships, the winner of which is crowned [[Champion|World Champions]].\n\nThe competition's format provides that each of the individual events of the World Series function as a qualifier for the World Championships. The top two finishing teams in each event secure the opportunity to compete in the World Championships. The field of event winners and second place getters is then supplemented by the reigning world champions, who are given the right to defend their title, and a selection of [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] entrants round out the number of starters.\n\nThe actual World Championship race rotates each year.  One of the qualifying events is singled out and designated as the World Championship event and this event provides a dramatic conclusion to the end of the World Series racing season.\n\nIn addition to the World Championship race, points are assigned to results from each of the qualifying races in the series to determine a World Ranking.  Points are allocated on a team's best two results in a calendar year over a two-year period (with heavier weighting given to World Championship results), with the ranking cycle periodically refreshed every 4\u20136 months.\n\n== History ==\nThe Adventure Racing World Championship was the brainchild of Geoff Hunt and Pascale Lorre, long-time adventure racers who sought to \"lend badly needed structure to the sport\".<ref name=\"Swift\">Swift, 2001.</ref> Hunt and Lorre's vision was first brought to fruition in Switzerland in 2001 where 41 teams contested the Discovery Channel World Championship with the controversy-plagued event eventually won by Finland's Team Nokia Adventure.<ref name=\"Swift\" /> A team from New Zealand, including [[Kathy Lynch]], came second that year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Multisport: Heroes make a year of it |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=585666 |accessdate=12 February 2017 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=9 January 2002}}</ref>\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus the Adventure Racing World Championships was next held in Canada in 2004 and has subsequently been held every year since.\n\nIn 2011 management of the series was passed to the Australian company Geocentric Outdoors.<ref>Sleepmonsters, 2011.</ref> The 2011 World Championships - won by Thule Adventure Team - were staged at the XPD Expedition Race in Tasmania, Australia, where 90 teams drawn from 21 countries made for the largest starting field in the event's history.<ref>AG Outdoor, 2011.</ref> This is testament to the fact that the World Series hosts the very best teams in the world and \"continues to grow and become more prominent\".<ref>Adventure Junkie, 2011.</ref> Geocentric Outdoors also instigated a number of new initiatives for the world series, including standardized equipment lists and logistics across the races, restrictions on mixed nationality teams at the World Championship race each year as well as the introduction of the World Series ranking system.  These initiatives have encouraged larger international fields at the various races by lowering the logistical barriers for participation and rewarding participation in multiple events.\n\nIn 2012, the World Championships was held at Raid in France and were won by Team Seagate from New Zealand.<ref>Explore Compete Live, 2011.</ref>  The title of World Champion returned to the Thule Adventure Team at Costa Rica in 2013, before again being reclaimed by Team Seagate in Ecuador in 2014.  Despite having never won a World Championship, Spanish team Columbia Vidaraid held the number-one position in the World Series ranking through 2014 and 2015 due to their string of wins in World Series qualifying races in addition to their second-place finishes in the 2013 and 2014 World Championships. Seagate regained the top position in the rankings in 2016 after dominating at the incredibly demanding 2015 World Championships, held in the Pantanal in Brazil, as well as in the Shoalhaven area of Australia in 2016.\n\n==World Championship results==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Year''' || '''Country''' || '''Race''' || '''World Champion'''\n|'''Nationality'''\n|-\n| 2001 ||  Switzerland ||  Discovery Channel World Championships || Team Nokia Adventure\n|Finland\n|-\n| 2004 ||  Canada ||  [[Raid The North Extreme]] || Nike ACG Balance Bar\n|USA\n|-\n| 2005 ||  New Zealand ||   Southern Traverse || Balance Vector\n|New Zealand\n|-\n| 2006 ||  Sweden ||  Explore Sweden || Nike PowerBlast\n|USA\n|-\n| 2007 ||  Scotland ||  Wilderness ARC<ref>Scotland, 2011.</ref> || Nike\n|USA\n|-\n| 2008 ||  Brazil ||  Ecomotion<ref>Xtreme Sport, 2008.</ref> || Orion Health\n|New Zealand\n|-\n| 2009 ||  Portugal ||  Portugal XPD<ref>Xtreme Sport, 2009.</ref> || Helly Hansen Prunesco\n|Britain\n|-\n| 2010 ||  Spain ||  Bimbache Extrem || Buff Thermocool\n|Spain\n|-\n| 2011 ||  Australia ||  XPD Expedition Race || Thule Adventure Team\n|Sweden\n|-\n| 2012 ||  France || Raid in France || Team Seagate\n|New Zealand\n|-\n| 2013 ||  Costa Rica ||  Costa Rica AR || Thule Adventure Team\n|France\n|-\n| 2014 || Ecuador || Husirasinchi Explorer || Seagate\n|New Zealand\n|-\n|2015  || Brazil || ARWS Brazil || Seagate\n|New Zealand\n|-\n|2016\n|Australia||XPD Expedition Race|| Seagate ||New Zealand\n|-\n|2017||USA||Cameco Cowboy Tough|| Seagate ||New Zealand\n|-\n|-\n|2018||La Reunion Island||Raid in France|| Avaya ||New Zealand\n|-\n|-\n|2019||Sri Lanka||Canceled||-||-\n|-\n|-\n|2020||Paraguay||Expedition Guarani||TBD||TBD\n|-\n|}\n\n==2015 Adventure Racing World Series==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Race''' || '''Country''' || '''Dates''' || '''Winner''' ||'''Nationality'''\n|-\n|GODZone Adventure Race||New Zealand||March 2015||Seagate||New Zealand\n|-\n|Tierra Viva||Chile||April 2015||SAFAT||Sweden\n|-\n|Raid Gallaecia||Spain||May 2015||Haglofs Sliva||Sweden\n|-\n|Expedition Africa||Swaziland||June 2015||Merrell Adventure Addicts||Republic of South Africa\n|-\n|Expedition Alaska||USA||June 2015||Tecnu||USA\n|-gallac\n|Cameco Cowboy Tough||USA||July 2015||Tecnu||USA\n|-\n|XPD Expedition Race||Australia||August 2015||Mountain Designs||Australia\n|-\n|Raid in France||France||September 2015||Raidlight||France\n|-\n|ARWS Brazil||Brazil||November 2015||Seagate||New Zealand\n|}\n\n==2016 Adventure Racing World Series==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Race''' || '''Country''' || '''Dates''' || '''Winner''' ||'''Nationality'''\n|-\n|Maya Mountain Adventure Challenge||Belize||February 2016||Team Adventure Medical Kits||USA\n|-\n|GODZone Adventure Race||New Zealand||April 2016||Team Yealands Family Wines||New Zealand\n|-\n|Tierra Viva||Chile||April 2016||2 DSN 74 Hoka||France\n|-\n|Expedition Africa||South Africa||May 2016||Team Featherbed Painted Wolf||South Africa\n|-\n|Expedition Guarani||Paraguay||July 2016||Columbia Vidaraid||Brazil/Spain/UK\n|-\n|Cameco Cowboy Tough||USA||July 2016||Team Adventure Medical Kits||USA\n|-\n|Huairasinchi||Colombia||August 2016||Fairis||Ecuador\n|-\n|ITERA Expedition Race||Ireland||August 2016||TEAM FMR||France\n|-\n|Raid in France||France||September 2016||Seagate||New Zealand\n|-\n|Xtrail Expedition (Demonstration Race)||China||September 2016||Thule Adventure Team\n|Sweden\n|-\n|XPD World Championships||Australia||November 2016||Seagate||New Zealand\n|-\n|-\n|}\n\n==2017 Adventure Racing World Series==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Race''' || '''Country''' || '''Dates''' || '''Winner''' ||'''Nationality'''\n|-\n|Expedition Guarani||Paraguay||March 2017||Cyanosis||South Africa\n|-\n|Huairasinchi||Ecuador||April 2017||Terra Aventura \u2013 Finalin||Ecuador\n|-\n|Raid Gallaecia||Spain||May 2017||Naturex||France\n|-\n|Expedition Africa||South Africa||May 2017||Skylotec Adventure||Sweden\n|-\n|Xtrail Expedition||China||June 2017||Seagate||New Zealand\n|-\n|Raid in France||France||June 2017||Lozere Team2Raid||France\n|-\n|Cameco Cowboy Tough World Championships||USA||August 2017||Seagate||New Zealand\n|-\n|}\n\n==2018 Adventure Racing World Series==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Race''' || '''Country''' || '''Dates''' || '''Winner''' ||'''Nationality'''\n|-\n|Maya Mountain Adventure Challenge||Belize||March 2018||Bones||USA\n|-\n|XPD Expedition Race||Australia||April 2018||Tri Adventure Antelopes||Australia\n|-\n|Expedition Guarani||Paraguay||May 2018||Columbia Vidaraid||Brazil\n|-\n|Expedition Africa||South Africa||May 2018||Blizzard||Russia\n|-\n|Expedition Oregon||USA||June 2018||Leki||Sweden\n|-\n|Huairasinchi||Ecuador||June 2018||Movistar -

These races culminate in the staging of the Adventure Racing World Championships, the winner of which is crowned [[Champion|World Champions]].\n\nThe competition's format provides that each of the individual events of the World Series function as a qualifier for the World Championships. The top two finishing teams in each event secure the opportunity to compete in the World Championships. The field of event winners and second place getters is then supplemented by the reigning world champions, who are given the right to defend their title, and a selection of [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] entrants round out the number of starters.\n\nThe actual World Championship race rotates each year.  One of the qualifying events is singled out and designated as the World Championship event and this event provides a dramatic conclusion to the end of the World Series racing season.\n\nIn addition to the World Championship race, points are assigned to results from each of the qualifying races in the series to determine a World Ranking.  Points are allocated on a teams best two results in a calendar year over a two-year period (with heavier weighting given to World Championship results), with the ranking cycle periodically refreshed every 4\u20136 months.\n\n== History ==\nThe Adventure Racing World Championship was the brainchild of Geoff Hunt and Pascale Lorre, long-time adventure racers who sought to \"lend badly needed structure to the sport\".<ref name=\"Swift\">Swift, 2001.</ref> Hunt and Lorre's vision was first brought to fruition in Switzerland in 2001 where 41 teams contested the Discovery Channel World Championship with the controversy-plagued event eventually won by Finland's Team Nokia Adventure.<ref name=\"Swift\" /> A team from New Zealand, including [[Kathy Lynch]], came second that year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Multisport: Heroes make a year of it |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=585666 |accessdate=12 February 2017 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=9 January 2002}}</ref>\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus the Adventure Racing World Championships was next held in Canada in 2004 and has subsequently been held every year since.\n\nIn 2011 management of the series was passed to the Australian company Geocentric Outdoors.<ref>Sleepmonsters, 2011.</ref> The 2011 World Championships - won by Thule Adventure Team - were staged at the XPD Expedition Race in Tasmania, Australia, where 90 teams drawn from 21 countries made for the largest starting field in the event's history.<ref>AG Outdoor, 2011.</ref> This is testament to the fact that the World Series hosts the very best teams in the world and \"continues to grow and become more prominent\".<ref>Adventure Junkie, 2011.</ref> Geocentric Outdoors also instigated a number of new initiatives for the world series, including standardized equipment lists and logistics across the races, restrictions on mixed nationality teams at the World Championship race each year as well as the introduction of the World Series ranking system.  These initiatives have encouraged larger international fields at the various races by lowering the logistical barriers for participation and rewarding participation in multiple events.\n\nIn 2012, the World Championships was held at Raid in France and were won by Team Seagate from New Zealand.<ref>Explore Compete Live, 2011.</ref>  The title of World Champion returned to the Thule Adventure Team at Costa Rica in 2013, before again being reclaimed by Team Seagate in Ecuador in 2014.  Despite having never won a World Championship, Spanish team Columbia Vidaraid held the number-one position in the World Series ranking through 2014 and 2015 due to their string of wins in World Series qualifying races in addition to their second-place finishes in the 2013 and 2014 World Championships. Seagate regained the top position in the rankings in 2016 after dominating at the incredibly demanding 2015 World Championships, held in the Pantanal in Brazil, as well as in the Shoalhaven area of Australia in 2016.\n\n==World Championship results==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Year''' || '''Country''' || '''Race''' || '''World Champion'''\n|'''Nationality'''\n|-\n| 2001 ||  Switzerland ||  Discovery Channel World Championships || Team Nokia Adventure\n|Finland\n|-\n| 2004 ||  Canada ||  [[Raid The North Extreme]] || Nike ACG Balance Bar\n|USA\n|-\n| 2005 ||  New Zealand ||   Southern Traverse || Balance Vector\n|New Zealand\n|-\n| 2006 ||  Sweden ||  Explore Sweden || Nike PowerBlast\n|USA\n|-\n| 2007 ||  Scotland ||  Wilderness ARC<ref>Scotland, 2011.</ref> || Nike\n|USA\n|-\n| 2008 ||  Brazil ||  Ecomotion<ref>Xtreme Sport, 2008.</ref> || Orion Health\n|New Zealand\n|-\n| 2009 ||  Portugal ||  Portugal XPD<ref>Xtreme Sport, 2009.</ref> || Helly Hansen Prunesco\n|Britain\n|-\n| 2010 ||  Spain ||  Bimbache Extrem || Buff Thermocool\n|Spain\n|-\n| 2011 ||  Australia ||  XPD Expedition Race || Thule Adventure Team\n|Sweden\n|-\n| 2012 ||  France || Raid in France || Team Seagate\n|New Zealand\n|-\n| 2013 ||  Costa Rica ||  Costa Rica AR || Thule Adventure Team\n|France\n|-\n| 2014 || Ecuador || Husirasinchi Explorer || Seagate\n|New Zealand\n|-\n|2015  || Brazil || ARWS Brazil || Seagate\n|New Zealand\n|-\n|2016\n|Australia||XPD Expedition Race|| Seagate ||New Zealand\n|-\n|2017||USA||Cameco Cowboy Tough|| Seagate ||New Zealand\n|-\n|-\n|2018||La Reunion Island||Raid in France|| Avaya ||New Zealand\n|-\n|-\n|2019||Sri Lanka||Canceled||-||-\n|-\n|-\n|2020||Paraguay||Expedition Guarani||TBD||TBD\n|-\n|}\n\n==2015 Adventure Racing World Series==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Race''' || '''Country''' || '''Dates''' || '''Winner''' ||'''Nationality'''\n|-\n|GODZone Adventure Race||New Zealand||March 2015||Seagate||New Zealand\n|-\n|Tierra Viva||Chile||April 2015||SAFAT||Sweden\n|-\n|Raid Gallaecia||Spain||May 2015||Haglofs Sliva||Sweden\n|-\n|Expedition Africa||Swaziland||June 2015||Merrell Adventure Addicts||Republic of South Africa\n|-\n|Expedition Alaska||USA||June 2015||Tecnu||USA\n|-gallac\n|Cameco Cowboy Tough||USA||July 2015||Tecnu||USA\n|-\n|XPD Expedition Race||Australia||August 2015||Mountain Designs||Australia\n|-\n|Raid in France||France||September 2015||Raidlight||France\n|-\n|ARWS Brazil||Brazil||November 2015||Seagate||New Zealand\n|}\n\n==2016 Adventure Racing World Series==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Race''' || '''Country''' || '''Dates''' || '''Winner''' ||'''Nationality'''\n|-\n|Maya Mountain Adventure Challenge||Belize||February 2016||Team Adventure Medical Kits||USA\n|-\n|GODZone Adventure Race||New Zealand||April 2016||Team Yealands Family Wines||New Zealand\n|-\n|Tierra Viva||Chile||April 2016||2 DSN 74 Hoka||France\n|-\n|Expedition Africa||South Africa||May 2016||Team Featherbed Painted Wolf||South Africa\n|-\n|Expedition Guarani||Paraguay||July 2016||Columbia Vidaraid||Brazil/Spain/UK\n|-\n|Cameco Cowboy Tough||USA||July 2016||Team Adventure Medical Kits||USA\n|-\n|Huairasinchi||Colombia||August 2016||Fairis||Ecuador\n|-\n|ITERA Expedition Race||Ireland||August 2016||TEAM FMR||France\n|-\n|Raid in France||France||September 2016||Seagate||New Zealand\n|-\n|Xtrail Expedition (Demonstration Race)||China||September 2016||Thule Adventure Team\n|Sweden\n|-\n|XPD World Championships||Australia||November 2016||Seagate||New Zealand\n|-\n|-\n|}\n\n==2017 Adventure Racing World Series==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Race''' || '''Country''' || '''Dates''' || '''Winner''' ||'''Nationality'''\n|-\n|Expedition Guarani||Paraguay||March 2017||Cyanosis||South Africa\n|-\n|Huairasinchi||Ecuador||April 2017||Terra Aventura \u2013 Finalin||Ecuador\n|-\n|Raid Gallaecia||Spain||May 2017||Naturex||France\n|-\n|Expedition Africa||South Africa||May 2017||Skylotec Adventure||Sweden\n|-\n|Xtrail Expedition||China||June 2017||Seagate||New Zealand\n|-\n|Raid in France||France||June 2017||Lozere Team2Raid||France\n|-\n|Cameco Cowboy Tough World Championships||USA||August 2017||Seagate||New Zealand\n|-\n|}\n\n==2018 Adventure Racing World Series==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#efefef\n| '''Race''' || '''Country''' || '''Dates''' || '''Winner''' ||'''Nationality'''\n|-\n|Maya Mountain Adventure Challenge||Belize||March 2018||Bones||USA\n|-\n|XPD Expedition Race||Australia||April 2018||Tri Adventure Antelopes||Australia\n|-\n|Expedition Guarani||Paraguay||May 2018||Columbia Vidaraid||Brazil\n|-\n|Expedition Africa||South Africa||May 2018||Blizzard||Russia\n|-\n|Expedition Oregon||USA||June 2018||Leki||Sweden\n|-\n|Huairasinchi||Ecuador||June 2018||Movistar -
