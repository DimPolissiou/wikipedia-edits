{"title_page": "Grand final replay", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=October 2013}}\nA '''grand final replay''' is a method of deciding the winner of a competition when a [[grand final]] is drawn.

It meant that the minor premiers [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] had a two-weekend bye instead of one, and many believed that the extended layoff had contributed to their losses to Collingwood, both in the second semi-final and in the grand final. Additionally, by 1990, there were many more events and corporate entertainment functions scheduled during the AFL finals than had been the case in 1977 (when the previous finals draw had occurred), and the one-week delay in the finals schedule caused chaos for venues and hotels as these events were rescheduled. \n\nTo avoid a repeat of these undesirable outcomes, the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] initiated the use of [[extra time]] (five minutes each way) to decide drawn finals, except for the grand final (that being the case in [[2010 AFL Grand Final|2010]]), from 1991 onward.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=66|author=Bruce Matthews|date=11 September 1990|title=Commission rules out grand final change}}</ref> However, from 1991 until 2015, a grand final replay would still be played after a drawn grand final.
