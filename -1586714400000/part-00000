It ran in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men (vol. 2)]]'', ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', and ''[[X-Force]]'', and featured [[Stryfe]] as the central villain. The story was heavily hyped as revealing the origin of popular ''X-Force'' star [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but ultimately Cable's origin was not covered in any of the installments.\n\nThe main issues of the crossover were sold polybagged with a special trading card that featured Stryfe's personal views of key characters from the crossover. Because of this, the issues themselves were priced at $1.50, twenty-five cents more than their normal price of $1.25.\n\n==Plot==\nMutant pop-star [[Lila Cheney]] organizes a free concert in [[Central Park]] to promote diversity in society and invites [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] to speak at the concert. His speech is interrupted by [[Stryfe]] who, disguised as his doppelganger and nemesis [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], shoots Xavier with a bullet that infects the professor with a lethal strain of the [[Techno-organic virus]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[War (Marvel Comics character)#Abraham Kieros|War]] and [[Famine (comics)|Famine]], the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]], attack [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], distracting them from [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], who kidnaps [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]. The Horsemen are working for [[Mr. Sinister]], who is impersonating the Horsemen's former master [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Mr. Sinister organized the kidnapping as part of his newly formed alliance with Stryfe. Stryfe trades Mr. Sinister a canister containing the past and future Summers family DNA history, and receives Jean Grey and Cyclops in the exchange.\n\nWhile Xavier is rushed to the hospital, X-Factor and the Blue X-Men strike team go after [[X-Force]], Cable's team of mutants. X-Force, however, is in the dark about Cable's current location (having been separated from him during a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]-organized raid of their headquarters). But mutual distrust causes the two groups to attack and ultimately capture X-Force. Meanwhile, Mr. Sinister doublecrosses Stryfe by revealing to the X-Men that Stryfe, under the guise of Cable, was the shooter.\n\nWhile the Blue X-Men strike team, X-Factor, [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] go after the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s Gold X-Men strike team, along with [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], confront Apocalypse over Scott and Jean's kidnapping, hoping as well to gain a cure for the virus that is threatening Xavier's life. Apocalypse is incredibly weak, having been nearly killed by Cyclops in their previous encounter and prematurely awoken from his regeneration chamber by his minions the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]. After learning from the Dark Riders that someone had been impersonating him, and ordered his old minions to kidnap Jean and Scott, Apocalypse barely escapes with his life. [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] finds himself becoming more and more consumed with punishing Apocalypse for his crimes, most notably Apocalypse's converting Archangel into the blue-skinned, metal winged angel of death.\n\nThe Mutant Liberation Front is defeated, though at the cost of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] being blinded by MLF member [[Strobe (comics)|Strobe]]. Meanwhile, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] locate Cable and after a brawl, decide to give him the benefit of the doubt and work together to find Jean and Scott.\n\nApocalypse is ambushed by [[Stryfe]], who declares that he is out for revenge for unknown wrongs committed against him as a child by Apocalypse. After Stryfe stabs him in the chest, Apocalypse escapes and seeks refuge amongst the X-Men, ultimately curing Xavier of the [[techno-organic virus]] as payment for [[sanctuary]].\n\nCyclops and Jean are systematically tortured by Stryfe, who blames the two mutants for ruining his life, a claim that leaves the two X-Men stunned since they never encountered Stryfe before their kidnapping. Stryfe and his new minions the Dark Riders, who pledge their allegiance to Stryfe after he defeats Apocalypse, move the two to Apocalypse's former base on the Moon. Scott and Jean escape, entering the vacuum before realizing they are not on Earth. Her powers no longer blocked, Jean sends a frantic SOS to Wolverine.\n\nThe X-Men, knowing Xavier will live now that Apocalypse has purged the techno-virus from him, head into space to save their teammates. Cable, Wolverine, and Bishop head out to Stryfe's base on the Moon too and arrive there first, decimating Stryfe's defenses just as the X-Men ([[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Psylocke]], [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], Cannonball, [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], Iceman and Archangel) and Apocalypse arrive. Splitting up, Apocalypse is ambushed by the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], who beat their former master to the brink of death. Apocalypse is later confronted by Archangel who refuses Apocalypse's request for a mercy killing.\n\nUpon catching Jean and Scott Summers outside the moonbase, Stryfe takes them to a giant time portal he had constructed on the Moon. As [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Cannonball, Havok and Polaris make their way to the tower, a forcefield is activated that prevents any without the Summers DNA from approaching the tower just as Stryfe activated the tower's time portal technology. Stryfe planned this so he could confront Cable alone, and though Havok has enough genetic similarity to Scott to pass through the forcefield, doing so renders him unconscious. Cable finds himself hopelessly outmatched by Stryfe, but as they battle, Jean Grey and Cyclops break free and Havok regains consciousness. Driven to despair, Stryfe tries to collapse the active tower upon the X-Men. Cable grabs Stryfe and orders Cyclops to activate the time vortex, a plan that would kill both Stryfe and Cable. Cyclops reluctantly does so; both men are sucked into a massive vortex that is created as the tower explodes. Cyclops and Jean Grey begin to suspect that either Stryfe or Cable is Cyclops' son Nathan Christopher Summers, who Cyclops was forced to abandon and send into the future after Apocalypse infected him with a techno-virus.\n\n[[Mr. Sinister]] has a minion, Gordan, open the canister given to him by Stryfe, only to find it apparently empty. Though not revealed in ''X-Cutioner's Song'', the canister in fact contained the [[Legacy Virus]].\n\nOf note, in X-men issue #303 Illyana Rasputina, the sister of Colossus, died of the Legacy virus, prompting him to eventually leave the X-men and join Magento for a time.\n===Epilogue===\nProfessor X discovers that the techno-organic virus has left him temporarily capable of walking and spends his few hours without paralysis bonding with [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] hang out together as Rogue agrees to let Gambit be her \"eyes\" until she regains her sight, laying the groundwork for the two finally becoming a couple. Archangel and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] rebuild the bar that Cyclops and Jean Grey were kidnapped in and think back to their days as the original X-Men.\n\n==''Stryfe's Strike File''==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stryfesf.jpg|Cover to ''Stryfe's Strike File'' #1. Art by Andy Kubert.|thumb|200px]] -->\n''Stryfe's Strike File'' was the name of a 1993 ''[[X-Men]]'' one-shot written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Scott Lobdell]]. It included several years worth of foreshadowing of Lobdell and Nicieza's X-Men plotlines, most notably the Legacy Virus plotline. The comic framing device was that the files in the one-shot were on a CD-ROM found at Stryfe's base by Bishop and handed over to Xavier without telling anyone else about it. After nearly two dozen pages of text and picture files, most of which were taken from the trading card inserts included in the individual issues of the crossover, the book ended with a closing sequence where Xavier destroys the disk rather than showing it to Cyclops and Jean Grey.\n\nThe book contained entries for [[Graydon Creed]], [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]], and [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]] prior to their first appearances elsewhere. Graydon Creed would appear as a villain two months later, Threnody would appear eleven months later, yet Holocaust would not appear in the [[X-Men]] comics until the alternate reality ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline. The version found in that storyline differs from the one found in Stryfe's Strike File in that the Age of Apocalypse Holocaust requires a containment suit and is very talkative while the Holocaust in the files does not need a containment suit and is a silent killer.\n\n==Publication==\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #294\n#''X-Factor'' #84\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #14\n#''X-Force'' #16\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #295\n#''X-Factor'' #85\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15\n#''X-Force'' #17\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #296\n#''X-Factor'' #86\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #16\n#''X-Force'' #18\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #297 (Epilogue)\n#''X-Force'' #19 (Epilogue)\n# \"Stryfe's Strike File\"\n\n===Collected editions===\nThe storyline (except for \"Epilogues 1 & 2 \" & \"Stryfe's Strike File\") have been collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (May 1994, {{ISBN|0-7851-0025-3}})\n\nIt has also been collected into a hardcover:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (368 pages, October 19, 2011, {{ISBN|0785156100}}) \nCollects Uncanny X-Men #294-297, X-Factor #84-86, X-Men #14-16, X-Force #16-19 and Stryfe's Strike File\n\n==Publication history==\nIn 1991, the X-Men franchise had reached a popularity level unheard of at the time, with the release of the high selling ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1 and ''X-Force'' #1, as well as the contributions of popular artists [[Jim Lee]], [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Whilce Portacio]] to the main X-Men books. But by 1992, Portacio, Lee and Liefeld left Marvel Comics to form their own comic company [[Image Comics]], alongside several other high profile Marvel artists. New writers and artists were quickly drafted to replace the departing fan favorite artists, most notably writers [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist [[Greg Capullo]].\n\nAt a writer's retreat held by the X-Men writing staff in 1992, the writers began to plan which direction for the X-Men. A massive crossover had been decided upon prior to the formation of Image Comics and it was decided by the new writers to continue with the plan as a means to keep attention on the X-Men books at the time. The subject of the crossover was having the X-Men face their biggest enemies at the time, Stryfe, Apocalypse, and Mr. Sinister, and revealing the origin of the popular X-Force leader Cable.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nA year earlier it was heavily implied that Cable was Nathan Christopher Summers, the infant son of X-Man Cyclops and Madelyne Prior.<ref>[[Simonson, Louise]] (w).

''[[New Mutants]]'' #100. Marvel Comics</ref> As fans had picked up on these plot threads, Fabian Nicieza pushed for the reveal that Stryfe was the time-displaced Nathan Summers and that Cable was the heroic clone of the missing Summers child.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nDuring the planning of the crossover, Scott Lobdell and Fabian Nicieza wanted to feature the return of Magneto, believed to be dead at the time, during the storyline, mainly to provide fans with an added shock moment and to add to the impact of the story, which would have the X-Men and their allies face down against their worst enemies in a single crisis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Peter David]] sarcastically proclaimed that Magneto should remove Wolverine's [[adamantium]] skeleton upon his return. While the plan to make Magneto's return was dropped from the storyline, David's suggestion would be used when the writers brought Magneto back the following year as part of the \"[[Fatal Attractions (comics)|Fatal Attractions]]\" storyline.<ref>Cronin, Brian (March 29, 2007).

''Writing for Comics with Peter David'', Impact</ref>\n\nThere is a long-standing rumor that X-Men editor Bob Harras forced Lobdell and Nicieza to change the ending of the story to remove what was supposed to be the main drawing point of the storyline: Cable's origin. However, Nicieza has stated that this was not the case.<ref>Cronin, Brian (April 5, 2007).

Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nSales of ''X-Cutioner's Song'' were considerably higher than the issues of the participating series which preceded and succeeded it. However, the story was considered a disappointment by fans, chiefly because it had been promised that it would reveal Cable's origin, but instead provided only cryptic and sometimes confusing hints about the identities of Cable and Stryfe.<ref name=\"futureNow\">{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first= Patrick Daniel | date = August 1993 | title = The Future is Now | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 12\u201325}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nStryfe and Apocalypse were both brought back to life. Excluding the \"Age of Apocalypse\" storyline, Apocalypse would return in ''Cable'' #19, while Stryfe would return as a ghost who possessed Cable. The story ended with Cable freeing himself from Stryfe's control, sending Stryfe's spirit to Hell for all eternity.<ref name=\"Cable6\"/> Stryfe reappeared when his ghost attempted to escape Hell by possessing X-Force member Warpath but was foiled by the members of X-Force.<ref>''X-Force'' #74. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUltimately Stryfe would be brought back to life as a time anomaly, having shown up out of the blue alongside the Dark Riders during a crossover between Cable and [[X-Man]] and would go on to bedevil the X-Men until his most death during the Gambit/Bishop mini-series.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Stryfe would yet again return after the \"[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]\" storyline and appeared to perish again, although it is unknown if it is a Stryfe from another reality.\n\nThe major long-term result of \"X-Cutioner's Song\" was the [[Legacy Virus]]. Stryfe had earlier given [[Mister Sinister]] a canister that he claimed contained two thousand years worth of genetic material from the Summers bloodline. When Sinister opened it after Stryfe was apparently killed by Cable, he found nothing inside. The canister actually contained a plague, Stryfe's \"Legacy\" to the world. The virus, presumably from the future, was 100% fatal and struck only mutants but later infected the human doctor and long-time X-Men ally, [[Moira MacTaggert]]. MacTaggert would ultimately develop a cure just before her death, though it would cost the mutant Peter Rasputin ([[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]) his life, due to the cure requiring a mutant to die in order to activate it.\n\n==In other media==\nThe 1995 video game ''[[X-Men: Gamesmaster's Legacy]]'' is loosely based on the events of \"X-Cutioner's Song\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Executioner's Song]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060717234705/http://www.mutanthigh.com/xcutionerssong.html X-Cutioners Song X-Over issue-by-issue synopsis]\n*{{comicbookdb|type=storyarc|id=125|title=X-Cutioner's Song}}\n\n{{X-Comics}}\n\n[[Category:Comics by Fabian Nicieza]]\n[[Category:Comics by Peter David]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{About|the Marvel Comics crossover series ''X-Cutioner's Song''|the supervillain|X-Cutioner}}\n{{Infobox comics story arc <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image          = X-Cutioner's Song Cover.jpg\n|imagesize      = <!-- default 250 -->\n|caption        = {{Descript-cvr|X-Cutioner's Song|||1994|type=TPB}}Art by [[Jae Lee]].\n|publisher      = [[Marvel Comics]]\n|startmo        = November\n|startyr        = 1992\n|endmo          = February\n|endyr          = 1993\n|Crossover      = y\n|titles         = ''[[#Stryfe's Strike File|Stryfe's Strike File]] #1''<br><!--\n-->''[[Uncanny X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #294-297<br /><!--\n-->''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' vol. 1, #84-86<br /><!--\n-->''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' vol. 2, #14-16<br /><!--\n-->''[[X-Force]]'' vol. 1, #16-19<br /><!--\n-->Cable - Blood and Metal #1-2<br /><!--\n-->What If? #69\n|main_char_team = [[X-Men]]<br/>[[X-Force]]<br/>[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]<br/>[[Mutant Liberation Front]]<br/>[[Stryfe]]\n|writers        = [[Scott Lobdell]], [[Fabian Nicieza]], [[Peter David]]\n|artists        =\n|pencillers     = [[Brandon Peterson]], [[Andy Kubert]], [[Jae Lee]], [[Greg Capullo]]\n|inkers         = [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]], [[Mark Pennington (comics)|Mark Pennington]], [[Al Milgrom]], [[Harry Candelario]]\n|letterers      =\n|editors        =\n|colorists      = Mike Thomas, [[Marie Javins]], Glynis Oliver, Joe Rosas, Steve Buccellato\n|TPB            = X-cutioners Song\n|ISBN           = 0-7851-0025-3\n|cat            = X-Men\n|sortkey        = X-Cutioner's Song\n}}\n\"'''X-Cutioner's Song'''\" is a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline published by [[Marvel Comics]]' in twelve parts from November 1992 to early 1993.

As [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Cannonball, Havok and Polaris make their way to the tower, a forcefield is activated that prevents any without the Summers DNA from approaching the tower just as Stryfe activated the tower's time portal technology. Stryfe planned this so he could confront Cable alone, and though Havok has enough genetic similarity to Scott to pass through the forcefield, doing so renders him unconscious. Cable finds himself hopelessly outmatched by Stryfe, but as they battle, Jean Grey and Cyclops break free and Havok regains consciousness. Driven to despair, Stryfe tries to collapse the active tower upon the X-Men. Cable grabs Stryfe and orders Cyclops to activate the time vortex, a plan that would kill both Stryfe and Cable. Cyclops reluctantly does so; both men are sucked into a massive vortex that is created as the tower explodes. Cyclops and Jean Grey begin to suspect that either Stryfe or Cable is Cyclops' son Nathan Christopher Summers, who Cyclops was forced to abandon and send into the future after Apocalypse infected him with a techno-virus.\n\n[[Mr. Sinister]] has a minion, Gordan, open the canister given to him by Stryfe, only to find it apparently empty. Though not revealed in ''X-Cutioner's Song'', the canister in fact contained the [[Legacy Virus]].\n\nOf note, in X-men issue #303 Illyana Rasputina, the sister of Colossus, died of the Legacy virus, prompting him to eventually leave the X-men and join Magento for a time\n===Epilogue===\nProfessor X discovers that the techno-organic virus has left him temporarily capable of walking and spends his few hours without paralysis bonding with [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] hang out together as Rogue agrees to let Gambit be her \"eyes\" until she regains her sight, laying the groundwork for the two finally becoming a couple. Archangel and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] rebuild the bar that Cyclops and Jean Grey were kidnapped in and think back to their days as the original X-Men.\n\n==''Stryfe's Strike File''==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stryfesf.jpg|Cover to ''Stryfe's Strike File'' #1. Art by Andy Kubert.|thumb|200px]] -->\n''Stryfe's Strike File'' was the name of a 1993 ''[[X-Men]]'' one-shot written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Scott Lobdell]]. It included several years worth of foreshadowing of Lobdell and Nicieza's X-Men plotlines, most notably the Legacy Virus plotline. The comic framing device was that the files in the one-shot were on a CD-ROM found at Stryfe's base by Bishop and handed over to Xavier without telling anyone else about it. After nearly two dozen pages of text and picture files, most of which were taken from the trading card inserts included in the individual issues of the crossover, the book ended with a closing sequence where Xavier destroys the disk rather than showing it to Cyclops and Jean Grey.\n\nThe book contained entries for [[Graydon Creed]], [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]], and [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]] prior to their first appearances elsewhere. Graydon Creed would appear as a villain two months later, Threnody would appear eleven months later, yet Holocaust would not appear in the [[X-Men]] comics until the alternate reality ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline. The version found in that storyline differs from the one found in Stryfe's Strike File in that the Age of Apocalypse Holocaust requires a containment suit and is very talkative while the Holocaust in the files does not need a containment suit and is a silent killer.\n\n==Publication==\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #294\n#''X-Factor'' #84\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #14\n#''X-Force'' #16\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #295\n#''X-Factor'' #85\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15\n#''X-Force'' #17\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #296\n#''X-Factor'' #86\n#''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #16\n#''X-Force'' #18\n#''Uncanny X-Men'' #297 (Epilogue)\n#''X-Force'' #19 (Epilogue)\n# \"Stryfe's Strike File\"\n\n===Collected editions===\nThe storyline (except for \"Epilogues 1 & 2 \" & \"Stryfe's Strike File\") have been collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (May 1994, {{ISBN|0-7851-0025-3}})\n\nIt has also been collected into a hardcover:\n\n*''X-Men: X-Cutioners Song'' (368 pages, October 19, 2011, {{ISBN|0785156100}}) \nCollects Uncanny X-Men #294-297, X-Factor #84-86, X-Men #14-16, X-Force #16-19 and Stryfe's Strike File\n\n==Publication history==\nIn 1991, the X-Men franchise had reached a popularity level unheard of at the time, with the release of the high selling ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1 and ''X-Force'' #1, as well as the contributions of popular artists [[Jim Lee]], [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Whilce Portacio]] to the main X-Men books. But by 1992, Portacio, Lee and Liefeld left Marvel Comics to form their own comic company [[Image Comics]], alongside several other high profile Marvel artists. New writers and artists were quickly drafted to replace the departing fan favorite artists, most notably writers [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist [[Greg Capullo]].\n\nAt a writer's retreat held by the X-Men writing staff in 1992, the writers began to plan which direction for the X-Men. A massive crossover had been decided upon prior to the formation of Image Comics and it was decided by the new writers to continue with the plan as a means to keep attention on the X-Men books at the time. The subject of the crossover was having the X-Men face their biggest enemies at the time, Stryfe, Apocalypse, and Mr. Sinister, and revealing the origin of the popular X-Force leader Cable.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nA year earlier it was heavily implied that Cable was Nathan Christopher Summers, the infant son of X-Man Cyclops and Madelyne Prior.<ref>[[Simonson, Louise]] (w). ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #65-68. [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> Meanwhile, Stryfe revealed that he had the same face as Cable.<ref>[[Liefeld, Rob]]; [[Nicieza, Fabian]] (w), Liefeld, Rob (a). ''[[New Mutants]]'' #100. Marvel Comics</ref> As fans had picked up on these plot threads, Fabian Nicieza pushed for the reveal that Stryfe was the time-displaced Nathan Summers and that Cable was the heroic clone of the missing Summers child.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nDuring the planning of the crossover, Scott Lobdell and Fabian Nicieza wanted to feature the return of Magneto, believed to be dead at the time, during the storyline, mainly to provide fans with an added shock moment and to add to the impact of the story, which would have the X-Men and their allies face down against their worst enemies in a single crisis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Peter David]] sarcastically proclaimed that Magneto should remove Wolverine's [[adamantium]] skeleton upon his return. While the plan to make Magneto's return was dropped from the storyline, David's suggestion would be used when the writers brought Magneto back the following year as part of the \"[[Fatal Attractions (comics)|Fatal Attractions]]\" storyline.<ref>Cronin, Brian (March 29, 2007).

''Writing for Comics with Peter David'', Impact</ref>\n\nThere is a long-standing rumor that X-Men editor Bob Harras forced Lobdell and Nicieza to change the ending of the story to remove what was supposed to be the main drawing point of the storyline: Cable's origin. However, Nicieza has stated that this was not the case.<ref>Cronin, Brian (April 5, 2007).

Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nSales of ''X-Cutioner's Song'' were considerably higher than the issues of the participating series which preceded and succeeded it. However, the story was considered a disappointment by fans, chiefly because it had been promised that it would reveal Cable's origin, but instead provided only cryptic and sometimes confusing hints about the identities of Cable and Stryfe.<ref name=\"futureNow\">{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first= Patrick Daniel | date = August 1993 | title = The Future is Now | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 12\u201325}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nStryfe and Apocalypse were both brought back to life. Excluding the \"Age of Apocalypse\" storyline, Apocalypse would return in ''Cable'' #19, while Stryfe would return as a ghost who possessed Cable. The story ended with Cable freeing himself from Stryfe's control, sending Stryfe's spirit to Hell for all eternity.<ref name=\"Cable6\"/> Stryfe reappeared when his ghost attempted to escape Hell by possessing X-Force member Warpath but was foiled by the members of X-Force.<ref>''X-Force'' #74. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUltimately Stryfe would be brought back to life as a time anomaly, having shown up out of the blue alongside the Dark Riders during a crossover between Cable and [[X-Man]] and would go on to bedevil the X-Men until his most death during the Gambit/Bishop mini-series.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Stryfe would yet again return after the \"[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]\" storyline and appeared to perish again, although it is unknown if it is a Stryfe from another reality.\n\nThe major long-term result of \"X-Cutioner's Song\" was the [[Legacy Virus]]. Stryfe had earlier given [[Mister Sinister]] a canister that he claimed contained two thousand years worth of genetic material from the Summers bloodline. When Sinister opened it after Stryfe was apparently killed by Cable, he found nothing inside. The canister actually contained a plague, Stryfe's \"Legacy\" to the world. The virus, presumably from the future, was 100% fatal and struck only mutants but later infected the human doctor and long-time X-Men ally, [[Moira MacTaggert]]. MacTaggert would ultimately develop a cure just before her death, though it would cost the mutant Peter Rasputin ([[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]) his life, due to the cure requiring a mutant to die in order to activate it.\n\n==In other media==\nThe 1995 video game ''[[X-Men: Gamesmaster's Legacy]]'' is loosely based on the events of \"X-Cutioner's Song\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Executioner's Song]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060717234705/http://www.mutanthigh.com/xcutionerssong.html X-Cutioners Song X-Over issue-by-issue synopsis]\n*{{comicbookdb|type=storyarc|id=125|title=X-Cutioner's Song}}\n\n{{X-Comics}}\n\n[[Category:Comics by Fabian Nicieza]]\n[[Category:Comics by Peter David]]\n", "name_user": "RSStockdale", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:added missing period", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Cutioner%27s_Song"}

Modules with this capability enable the end user to monitor parameters of the SFP, such as optical output power, optical input power, temperature, laser bias current, and transceiver supply voltage, in real time. This functionality is commonly implemented for monitoring on routers, switches and optical transport equipment via [[Simple Network Management Protocol]] (SNMP).\n\nA DDM interface allows end users to display diagnostics data and alarms for optical fiber transceivers and can be used to diagnose why a transceiver optics is not working, increasing popularity of transceiver optics with DDM. Generally, the transceiver vendor sets the thresholds that trigger a high alarm, low alarm, high warning, or low warning before shipment.

They are used in Fibre Channel [[host adapter]]s and storage equipment. Because of their low cost, low profile, and ability to provide a connection to different types of optical fiber, SFP provides such equipment with enhanced flexibility.\n\n==Standardization==\nThe SFP transceiver is not standardized by any official standards body, but rather is specified by a [[multi-source agreement]] (MSA) among competing manufacturers. The SFP was designed after the [[GBIC]] interface, and allows greater ''port density'' (number of transceivers per given area) than the GBIC, which is why SFP is also known as mini-GBIC.\n\nHowever, as a practical matter, some networking equipment manufacturers engage in [[vendor lock-in]] practices whereby they deliberately break compatibility with \"generic\" SFPs by adding a check in the device's [[firmware]] that will enable only the vendor's own modules.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toad.com/gnu/sysadmin/sfp-lockin.html |title=Gigabit Ethernet fiber SFP slots and lock-in |author=John Gilmore |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}</ref> Third-party SFP manufacturers have introduced SFPs with EEPROMs which may be programmed to match any vendor ID.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flexoptix.net/en/flexbox-series-configure-universal-transceivers.html?395=1357&co9424= |title=FLEXBOX SERIES - CONFIGURE UNIVERSAL TRANSCEIVERS |access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref>\n\n==Color coding of SFP==\n\n===Color coding of SFP ===\n<!---{{partial|''proprietary<br /><small>(non SFF)</small>''}}--->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; \"\n|-\n!

Modules with this capability enable the end user to monitor parameters of the SFP, such as optical output power, optical input power, temperature, laser bias current, and transceiver supply voltage, in real time. This functionality is commonly implemented for monitoring on routers, switches and optical transport equipment via [[Simple Network Management Protocol]] (SNMP).\n\nA DDM interface allows end users to display diagnostics data and alarms for optical fiber transceivers and can be used to diagnose why a transceiver optics is not working, increasing popularity of transceiver optics with DDM. Generally, the transceiver vendor sets the thresholds that trigger a high alarm, low alarm, high warning, or low warning before shipment.
