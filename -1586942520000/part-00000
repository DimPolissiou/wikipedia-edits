Hayes''' (born July 29, 1967) is an American [[biologist]] and professor of Integrative Biology at [[University of California, Berkeley]] known for his research findings concluding that the [[herbicide]] [[atrazine]] is an [[endocrine disruptor]] that demasculinizes and feminizes male frogs. He is also an advocate for critical review and regulation of pesticides and other chemicals that may cause adverse health effects. He has presented hundreds of papers, talks, and seminars on his conclusions that environmental chemical contaminants have played a role in global amphibian declines and in the health disparities that occur in minority and low income populations. His research has not been able to be replicated and has been contested by [[Syngenta]], the Swiss manufacturer of atrazine, nor the [[Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority]]. It was used as the basis for the settlement of a multimillion-dollar class-action lawsuit against Syngenta.\n\n==Education and career==\nBorn in Columbia, South Carolina, Hayes spent his childhood studying frogs and lizards and won a state science fair with research that showed [[Dactyloidae|anole]] lizards had to be awake to change color.<ref name=\"Mother Jones 2012\">{{Cite journal |last1=Slater |first1=Dashka |title=The Frog of War |journal=Mother Jones |date=January\u2013February 2012 |url=http://motherjones.com/environment/2011/11/tyrone-hayes-atrazine-syngenta-feud-frog-endangered}}</ref>  After graduating from [[Harvard University]], Hayes was a technician and freelance consultant from 1990\u20131992 for [[Tiburon, California]] based Biosystems, Inc.<ref name=\"vita\">{{cite web |title=Tyrone Hayes Curriculum Vita |url=http://www.atrazinelovers.com/t2d.html |publisher=Atrazine Lovers Website |accessdate=August 23, 2013}}</ref>  Hayes has held an academic appointment (professorship) at the University of California, Berkeley since completing his doctoral research there in 1992;<ref name=\"Mother Jones 2012\" /> He was hired as a graduate student instructor in 1992, became an assistant professor in 1994, associate professor in 2000, and professor in 2003 in the Department of Integrative Biology, Molecular Toxicology, Group in Endocrinology, Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, Energy and Resources Group, University of California, Berkeley.<ref name=\"vita\" />\n\n===Atrazine research===\n[[File:African clawed frogs; Xenopus laevis.jpg|thumb|left| ''Xenopus laevis'', the African Clawed frog]]\nIn 1997, the consulting firm EcoRisk, Inc. paid Hayes to join a panel of experts conducting studies for [[Novartis]] (later [[Syngenta]]) on the [[herbicide]] [[atrazine]].<ref name=\"Mother Jones 2012\" /><ref name=\"Aviv\">{{cite journal |last=Aviv |first=Rachel |title=A Valuable Reputation: After Tyrone Hayes said that a chemical was harmful, its maker pursued him |journal=The New Yorker |date=February 10, 2014 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/02/10/140210fa_fact_aviv?currentPage=all |accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref>  When Hayes' research found unexpected toxicities for atrazine, he reported them to the panel, however the panel and company were resistant to his findings.

He is also an advocate for critical review and regulation of pesticides and other chemicals that may cause adverse health effects.

An expert eye surgeon is responsible for selecting the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient, and for taking the necessary safety precautions. Mentions of eye surgery can be found in several ancient texts dating back as early as 1800 BC, with cataract treatment starting in the fifth century BC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-lasik-directory.com/article_history-ophthalmology2.html|title=The History of Ophthalmology}}</ref> Today it continues to be a widely practiced type of surgery, having developed various techniques for treating eye problems.\n\n== Preparation and precautions ==\n{{Main|Anaesthesia for ocular surgery}}\nSince the eye is heavily supplied by nerves, [[anesthesia]] is essential. [[Local anesthesia]] is most commonly used. [[Topical anesthesia]] using [[lidocaine]] topical gel is often used for quick procedures. Since topical anesthesia requires cooperation from the patient, [[general anesthesia]] is often used for children, traumatic eye injuries, or major orbitotomies, and for apprehensive patients. The [[Anesthesiologist|physician administering anesthesia]], or a [[nurse anesthetist]] or [[anesthetist assistant]] with expertise in anesthesia of the eye, monitors the patient's cardiovascular status. Sterile precautions are taken to prepare the area for surgery and lower the risk of infection. These precautions include the use of [[antiseptics]], such as [[povidone-iodine]], and sterile drapes, gowns, and gloves.\n\n== Laser eye surgery ==\nAlthough the terms laser eye surgery and [[refractive surgery]] are commonly used as if they were interchangeable, this is not the case. Lasers may be used to treat nonrefractive conditions (e.g. to seal a retinal tear).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/health-and-beauty/laser-eye-surgery-in-ireland/ | work=The Irish Times | title=Laser Eye Surgery | first=Stephen | last=Maguire}}</ref> Laser eye surgery or laser corneal surgery is a medical procedure that uses a laser to reshape the surface of the eye to correct myopia (short-sightedness), hypermetropia (long-sightedness), and astigmatism (uneven curvature of the eye's surface).

If [[visual loss]] is significant, surgical removal of the lens may be warranted, with lost [[optical power]] usually replaced with a plastic [[intraocular lens]]. Owing to the high prevalence of cataracts, cataract extraction is the most common eye surgery.

Many types of glaucoma surgery exist, and variations or combinations of those types can facilitate the escape of excess [[aqueous humor]] from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, and a few that lower it by decreasing the production of aqueous humor.\n\n=== Canaloplasty ===\nCanaloplasty is an advanced, nonpenetrating procedure designed to enhance drainage through the eye\u2019s natural drainage system to provide sustained reduction of intraocular pressure. Canaloplasty uses microcatheter technology in a simple and minimally invasive procedure.\nTo perform a canaloplasty, an ophthalmologist creates a tiny incision to gain access to a canal in the eye. A microcatheter circumnavigates the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened. By opening up the canal, the pressure inside the eye can be reduced.<ref>https://mediamillinc.com/vjo.php?display=video&id=013</ref><ref>http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(08)00004-7/abstract,</ref><ref>http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(07)00697-9/abstract</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(09)00139-4/abstract|title=Canaloplasty: Circumferential viscodilation and tensioning of Schlemm canal using a flexible microcatheter for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma in adults|first1=Richard A.|last1=Lewis|first2=Kurt von|last2=Wolff|first3=Manfred|last3=Tetz|first4=Norbert|last4=Koerber|first5=John R.|last5=Kearney|first6=Bradford J.|last6=Shingleton|first7=Thomas W.|last7=Samuelson|date=1 May 2009|publisher=|journal=Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery|volume=35|issue=5|pages=814\u2013824|via=www.jcrsjournal.org|doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2009.01.010|pmid=19393879}}</ref>\n\n== Refractive surgery ==\n{{Main|Refractive surgery}}\nRefractive surgery aims to correct errors of refraction in the eye, reducing or eliminating the need for corrective lenses.\n* [[Keratomilleusis]] is a method of reshaping the corneal surface to change its [[optical power]].

An expert eye surgeon is responsible for selecting the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient, and for taking the necessary safety precautions. Mentions of eye surgery can be found in several ancient texts dating back as early as 1800 BC, with cataract treatment starting in the fifth century BC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-lasik-directory.com/article_history-ophthalmology2.html|title=The History of Ophthalmology}}</ref> Today it continues to be a widely practiced type of surgery, having developed various techniques for treating eye problems.\n\n== Preparation and precautions ==\n{{Main|Anaesthesia for ocular surgery}}\nSince the eye is heavily supplied by nerves, [[anesthesia]] is essential. [[Local anesthesia]] is most commonly used. [[Topical anesthesia]] using [[lidocaine]] topical gel is often used for quick procedures. Since topical anesthesia requires cooperation from the patient, [[general anesthesia]] is often used for children, traumatic eye injuries, or major orbitotomies, and for apprehensive patients. The [[Anesthesiologist|physician administering anesthesia]], or a [[nurse anesthetist]] or [[anesthetist assistant]] with expertise in anesthesia of the eye, monitors the patient's cardiovascular status. Sterile precautions are taken to prepare the area for surgery and lower the risk of infection. These precautions include the use of [[antiseptics]], such as [[povidone-iodine]], and sterile drapes, gowns, and gloves.\n\n== Laser eye surgery ==\nAlthough the terms laser eye surgery and [[refractive surgery]] are commonly used as if they were interchangeable, this is not the case. Lasers may be used to treat nonrefractive conditions (e.g. to seal a retinal tear).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/health-and-beauty/laser-eye-surgery-in-ireland/ | work=The Irish Times | title=Laser Eye Surgery | first=Stephen | last=Maguire}}</ref> Laser eye surgery or laser corneal surgery is a medical procedure that uses a laser to reshape the surface of the eye to correct myopia (short-sightedness), hypermetropia (long-sightedness), and astigmatism (uneven curvature of the eye's surface).

If [[visual loss]] is significant, surgical removal of the lens may be warranted, with lost [[optical power]] usually replaced with a plastic [[intraocular lens]]. Owing to the high prevalence of cataracts, cataract extraction is the most common eye surgery. Rest after surgery is recommended.<ref>Uhr, Barry W.

Many types of glaucoma surgery exist, and variations or combinations of those types can facilitate the escape of excess [[aqueous humor]] from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, and a few that lower it by decreasing the production of aqueous humor.\n\n=== Canaloplasty ===\nCanaloplasty is an advanced, nonpenetrating procedure designed to enhance drainage through the eye\u2019s natural drainage system to provide sustained reduction of intraocular pressure. Canaloplasty uses microcatheter technology in a simple and minimally invasive procedure.\nTo perform a canaloplasty, an ophthalmologist creates a tiny incision to gain access to a canal in the eye. A microcatheter circumnavigates the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened. By opening up the canal, the pressure inside the eye can be reduced.<ref>https://mediamillinc.com/vjo.php?display=video&id=013</ref><ref>http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(08)00004-7/abstract,</ref><ref>http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(07)00697-9/abstract</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jcrsjournal.org/article/S0886-3350(09)00139-4/abstract|title=Canaloplasty: Circumferential viscodilation and tensioning of Schlemm canal using a flexible microcatheter for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma in adults|first1=Richard A.|last1=Lewis|first2=Kurt von|last2=Wolff|first3=Manfred|last3=Tetz|first4=Norbert|last4=Koerber|first5=John R.|last5=Kearney|first6=Bradford J.|last6=Shingleton|first7=Thomas W.|last7=Samuelson|date=1 May 2009|publisher=|journal=Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery|volume=35|issue=5|pages=814\u2013824|via=www.jcrsjournal.org|doi=10.1016/j.jcrs.2009.01.010|pmid=19393879}}</ref>\n\n== Refractive surgery ==\n{{Main|Refractive surgery}}\nRefractive surgery aims to correct errors of refraction in the eye, reducing or eliminating the need for corrective lenses.\n* [[Keratomilleusis]] is a method of reshaping the corneal surface to change its [[optical power]].

The second step is the concerted loss of a [[sulphu\nr dioxide]] molecule and its replacement by the chloride, which was attached to the sulphite group. The difference between S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>i is actually that the ion pair is not completely dissociated, and therefore no real carbocation is formed, which else would lead to a racemisation. \n\nThis reaction type is linked to many forms of [[neighbouring group participation]], for instance the reaction of the [[sulphur]] or [[nitrogen]] [[lone pair]] in [[sulfur mustard]] or [[nitrogen mustard]] to form the [[cation]]ic [[reactive intermediate|intermediate]].\n\nThis reaction mechanism is supported by the observation that addition of [[pyridine]] to the reaction leads to [[Walden inversion|inversion]]. The reasoning behind this finding is that pyridine reacts with the intermediate sulphite replacing chlorine.

The second step is the concerted loss of a [[sulfur dioxide]] molecule and its replacement by the chloride, which was attached to the sulphite group. The difference between S<sub>N</sub>1 and S<sub>N</sub>i is actually that the ion pair is not completely dissociated, and therefore no real carbocation is formed, which else would lead to a racemisation. \n\nThis reaction type is linked to many forms of [[neighbouring group participation]], for instance the reaction of the [[sulfur]] or [[nitrogen]] [[lone pair]] in [[sulfur mustard]] or [[nitrogen mustard]] to form the [[cation]]ic [[reactive intermediate|intermediate]].\n\nThis reaction mechanism is supported by the observation that addition of [[pyridine]] to the reaction leads to [[Walden inversion|inversion]].

Following the rise of [[fast food]] and [[take-out]] restaurants, a [[retronym]] for the older \"standard\" restaurant was created, '''sit-down restaurant'''.  Most commonly, \"sit-down restaurant\" refers to a casual-[[dining]] restaurant with [[table service]], rather than a [[fast food restaurant]] or a [[diner]], where one orders food at a [[countertop|counter]]. Sit-down restaurants are often further categorized, in North America, as \"family-style\" or \"[[Full course dinner|formal]]\".\n\nIn [[British English]], the term ''restaurant'' almost always means an eating establishment with table service, so the \"sit down\" qualification is not usually necessary. Fast food and takeaway (take-out) outlets with counter service are not normally referred to as restaurants. Outside North America, the terms fast casual dining restaurants, family style, and casual dining are not used and distinctions among different kinds of restaurants are often not the same. In France, for example, some restaurants are called \"bistros\" to indicate a level of casualness or trendiness, though some \"bistros\" are quite formal in the kind of food they serve and clientele they attract. Others are called \"brasseries\", a term which indicates hours of service. \"Brasseries\" may serve food round the clock, whereas \"restaurants\" usually only serve at set intervals during the day. In Sweden, restaurants of many kinds are called \"restauranger\", but restaurants attached to bars or cafes are sometimes called \"k\u00f6k\", literally \"kitchens\", and sometimes a bar-restaurant combination is called a \"krog\", in English a \"tavern\".\n\nIn ''Dishing It Out: In Search of the Restaurant Experience'',{{full|date=December 2018}} [[Robert Appelbaum]] argues that all restaurants can be categorized according to a set of social parameters defined as polar opposites: high or low, cheap or dear, familiar or exotic, formal or informal, and so forth.

Except for buffet-style restaurants, casual dining restaurants typically provide table service. Chain examples include [[Harvester (restaurant)|Harvester]] in the United Kingdom and [[TGI Fridays]] in the United States. Casual dining comprises a market segment between fast-food establishments and fine-dining restaurants. Casual-dining restaurants often have a full bar with separate bar staff, a full beer menu and a limited wine menu. They are frequently, but not necessarily, part of a wider chain, particularly in the US. In Italy, such casual restaurants are often called \"[[trattoria]]\", and are usually independently owned and operated.\n\n===Premium casual===\nPremium casual restaurants originate from Western Canada and include chains such as [[Cactus Club Cafe]], [[Earl's]] and [[JOEY]]. Premium casual restaurants are described as upscale fast casual. Similarly to casual dining, they typically feature a dining room section and a lounge section with multiple screens. They are typically found downtown or in shopping districts. Premium casual restaurants carry a wide range of menu options including burgers, steaks, seafood, pizza, pasta and Asian foods.<!-- This is horribly US-centric. Nowhere in the rest of the world would have this combination, let alone use this term. -->\n\n===Family style===\nFamily style restaurants are a type of casual dining restaurants where food is often served on platters and the diners serve themselves. It can also be used to describe family-friendly diners or casual restaurants. \n\n===Fine dining===\n[[File:The Fat Duck, High Street, Bray - geograph.org.uk - 1271175-MJ.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Fat Duck]], a fine dining destination restaurant in Bray, UK]]\n\nFine dining restaurants are full-service restaurants with specific dedicated meal courses.

In the United States, [[bistros]] usually have more refined decor, fewer tables, finer foods and higher prices. When used in [[English language|English]], the term ''bistro'' usually indicates a [[Continental food|continental]] menu.\n\n===Buffet and sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord===\n{{see also|List of buffet restaurants}}\n[[Buffet]]s and [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord]] offer patrons a selection of food at a fixed price. Food is served on trays around bars, from which customers with plates serve themselves. The selection can be modest or very extensive, with the more elaborate menus divided into categories such as salad, soup, appetizers, hot entr\u00e9es, cold entr\u00e9es, and dessert and fruit. Often the range of cuisine can be eclectic, while other restaurants focus on a specific type, such as home-cooking, Chinese, Indian, or Swedish. The role of the waiter or waitress in this case is relegated to removal of finished plates, and sometimes the ordering and refill of drinks.  In Italy, a kind of semi-buffet is featured in either a tavola calda, serving hot foods, and a tavola fredda, which serves cold food.  Either can be found in bars and cafes at meal times or in dedicated sites, sometimes with seating and service at a counter.\n\n===Caf\u00e9===\n[[File:Byways Cafe (Portland, Oregon).jpg|thumb|right|Byways Cafe in Portland, Oregon, USA]]\n\n[[British cafe]]s and American [[diner]]s are informal eateries offering a range of hot meals and made-to-order sandwiches or rolls.  [[Coffeehouse]]s or caf\u00e9s are not full restaurants, because they primarily serve and derive the majority of their revenue from hot drinks.  Many cafes are open at breakfast time and will serve full hot breakfasts all day. In some areas, cafes offer outdoor seating. The word comes from the French ''caf\u00e9''.\n\n===Cafeteria===\nA [[cafeteria]] is a restaurant serving ready-cooked food arranged behind a food-serving counter.  There is no table service. Typically, a patron takes a tray and pushes it along a track in front of the counter.  Depending on the establishment, servings may be ordered from attendants, selected as ready-made portions already on plates, or self-serve their own portions. Cafeterias are common in hospitals, corporations and educational institutions. In Italy it's very common and known as \"mensa aziendale\".\n\nIn the UK, a cafeteria may also offer a large selection of hot food and the use of the term [[cafeteria]] is deprecated in favour of '''self-service restaurant'''.  Cafeterias have a wider variety of prepared foods. For example, it may have a variety of roasts (e.g. beef, ham, turkey) ready for carving by a server, as well as other main courses, rather than simple offerings of hamburgers or fried chicken.\n\n===Coffee house===\n[[File:The Last Stand Coffee Company.jpg|thumb|right|The Last Stand Coffeehouse, seating optional]]\n{{see also|Tea house}}\n[[Coffeehouse]]s are casual restaurants without table service that emphasize [[coffee]] and other beverages; typically a limited selection of cold foods such as pastries and perhaps sandwiches are offered as well. Their distinguishing feature is that they allow patrons to relax and socialize on their premises for long periods of time without pressure to leave promptly after eating, and are thus frequently chosen as sites for meetings.\n\n===Destination restaurant===\nA '''destination restaurant''' is one that has a strong enough appeal to draw customers from beyond its community.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Make a Destination Restaurant|url=http://www.setupmyrestaurant.com/promotion/destination.htm|work=Setupmyrestaurant.com|accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=How to Develop Standard Operating Procedures for Quick Service Restaurant (QSR)?|url=http://www.yourretailcoach.in/blog/how-to-develop-standard-operating-procedures-for-quick-service-restaurant-qsr/|work=yourretailcoach.in|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> The idea of a destination restaurant originated in France with the [[Michelin Guide]], which rated restaurants as to whether they were worth a special trip or a detour while one travelled by car in France.\n\n===Greasy spoon===\nA [[greasy spoon]] is a colloquial term for a [[British cafe]], [[United States|American]] [[diner]] or other small eatery which tends to serve food at a low cost. Generally fried foods are served, and in the United Kingdom, such places frequently serve all-day breakfasts and strong [[builder's tea]]. They are commonly found in working-class areas.\n\n===Tabletop cooking===\nCustomers are seated as in a casual dining setting. Food items are prepared by the establishments for cooking on embedded [[gas stoves]], [[induction cookers]], or [[charcoal grill]]s; the customer has control over the heating power of the appliance.\n\n===Mongolian barbecue===\nDespite the name, the [[Mongolian barbecue]] form of restaurant is not Mongolian, rather is derived from Taiwan and inspired by Japanese [[teppanyaki]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Customers create a bowl from an assortment of ingredients displayed in a buffet fashion. The bowl is then handed to the cook, who stir-fries the food on a large griddle and returns it on a plate or in a bowl to the consumer.\n\n===Pub===\n{{main|Pub}}\nTraditionally, pubs were primarily drinking establishments with food in a secondary position, whereas many modern pubs rely on food as well, to the point where [[gastropub]]s are often known for their high-quality fine-dining style pub food and concomitantly high prices. A typical pub has a large selection of beers and ales on tap.\n\n===Teppanyaki-style===\nMany restaurants specializing in Japanese cuisine offer the [[teppanyaki]] grill, which is more accurately based on a type of charcoal stove that is called [[shichirin]] in Japan. Diners, often in multiple, unrelated parties, sit around the grill while a chef prepares their food orders in front of them. Often the chef is trained in entertaining the guests with special techniques, including cracking a spinning egg in the air, forming a volcano out of differently-sized onion slices, and flipping grilled shrimp pieces into patrons' mouths, in addition to various props. Also referred to as hibachi.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|Companies}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[:Category:Restaurants_by_type|Category: Restaurants by Type]]\n* [[Automat]]\n* [[Concession stand]]\n* [[Diner]]\n* [[Dining car]]\n* [[Food trucks]] \n* [[Hot dog stand]]\n* [[Ice cream parlors]]\n* [[Pizzerias]]\n* [[Sandwich bar]]\n* [[Truck stop]]\n* [[Brasserie]]\n* [[Cabmen's Shelter Fund|Cabmen's shelter]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Appelbaum, Robert, ''Dishing It Out: In Search of the Restaurant Experience'' (London: Reaktion, 2011).\n\n{{Lists of restaurants}}\n\n[[Category:Restaurants by type| ]]\n[[Category:Restaurant terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Based upon menu style, preparation methods and pricing, as well by how the food is served}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=September 2010}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n'''Restaurants''' fall into several industry classifications, based upon menu style, preparation methods and pricing, as well as the means by which the food is served to the customer.\n\n==Origin of categories==\nHistorically, ''restaurant'' referred only to places that provided tables where one ate while seated, typically served by a [[waiter]].

When used in [[English language|English]], the term ''bistro'' usually indicates a [[Continental food|continental]] menu.\n\n===Buffet and sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord===\n{{see also|List of buffet restaurants}}\n[[Buffet]]s and [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord]] offer patrons a selection of food at a fixed price. Food is served on trays around bars, from which customers with plates serve themselves. The selection can be modest or very extensive, with the more elaborate menus divided into categories such as salad, soup, appetizers, hot entr\u00e9es, cold entr\u00e9es, and dessert and fruit. Often the range of cuisine can be eclectic, while other restaurants focus on a specific type, such as home-cooking, Chinese, Indian, or Swedish. The role of the waiter or waitress in this case is relegated to removal of finished plates, and sometimes the ordering and refill of drinks.  In Italy, a kind of semi-buffet is featured in either a tavola calda, serving hot foods, and a tavola fredda, which serves cold food.  Either can be found in bars and cafes at meal times or in dedicated sites, sometimes with seating and service at a counter.\n\n===Caf\u00e9===\n[[File:Byways Cafe (Portland, Oregon).jpg|thumb|right|Byways Cafe in Portland, Oregon, USA]]\n\n[[British cafe]]s and American [[diner]]s are informal eateries offering a range of hot meals and made-to-order sandwiches or rolls.  [[Coffeehouse]]s or caf\u00e9s are not full restaurants, because they primarily serve and derive the majority of their revenue from hot drinks.  Many cafes are open at breakfast time and will serve full hot breakfasts all day. In some areas, cafes offer outdoor seating. The word comes from the French ''caf\u00e9''.\n\n===Cafeteria===\nA [[cafeteria]] is a restaurant serving ready-cooked food arranged behind a food-serving counter.  There is no table service. Typically, a patron takes a tray and pushes it along a track in front of the counter.  Depending on the establishment, servings may be ordered from attendants, selected as ready-made portions already on plates, or self-serve their own portions. Cafeterias are common in hospitals, corporations and educational institutions. In Italy it's very common and known as \"mensa aziendale\".\n\nIn the UK, a cafeteria may also offer a large selection of hot food and the use of the term [[cafeteria]] is deprecated in favour of '''self-service restaurant'''.  Cafeterias have a wider variety of prepared foods. For example, it may have a variety of roasts (e.g. beef, ham, turkey) ready for carving by a server, as well as other main courses, rather than simple offerings of hamburgers or fried chicken.\n\n===Coffee house===\n[[File:The Last Stand Coffee Company.jpg|thumb|right|The Last Stand Coffeehouse, seating optional]]\n{{see also|Tea house}}\n[[Coffeehouse]]s are casual restaurants without table service that emphasize [[coffee]] and other beverages; typically a limited selection of cold foods such as pastries and perhaps sandwiches are offered as well. Their distinguishing feature is that they allow patrons to relax and socialize on their premises for long periods of time without pressure to leave promptly after eating, and are thus frequently chosen as sites for meetings.\n\n===Destination restaurant===\nA '''destination restaurant''' is one that has a strong enough appeal to draw customers from beyond its community.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Make a Destination Restaurant|url=http://www.setupmyrestaurant.com/promotion/destination.htm|work=Setupmyrestaurant.com|accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=How to Develop Standard Operating Procedures for Quick Service Restaurant (QSR)?|url=http://www.yourretailcoach.in/blog/how-to-develop-standard-operating-procedures-for-quick-service-restaurant-qsr/|work=yourretailcoach.in|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> The idea of a destination restaurant originated in France with the [[Michelin Guide]], which rated restaurants as to whether they were worth a special trip or a detour while one travelled by car in France.\n\n===Greasy spoon===\nA [[greasy spoon]] is a colloquial term for a [[British cafe]], [[United States|American]] [[diner]] or other small eatery which tends to serve food at a low cost. Generally fried foods are served, and in the United Kingdom, such places frequently serve all-day breakfasts and strong [[builder's tea]]. They are commonly found in working-class areas.\n\n===Tabletop cooking===\nCustomers are seated as in a casual dining setting. Food items are prepared by the establishments for cooking on embedded [[gas stoves]], [[induction cookers]], or [[charcoal grill]]s; the customer has control over the heating power of the appliance.\n\n===Mongolian barbecue===\nDespite the name, the [[Mongolian barbecue]] form of restaurant is not Mongolian, rather is derived from Taiwan and inspired by Japanese [[teppanyaki]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. Customers create a bowl from an assortment of ingredients displayed in a buffet fashion. The bowl is then handed to the cook, who stir-fries the food on a large griddle and returns it on a plate or in a bowl to the consumer.\n\n===Pub===\n{{main|Pub}}\nTraditionally, pubs were primarily drinking establishments with food in a secondary position, whereas many modern pubs rely on food as well, to the point where [[gastropub]]s are often known for their high-quality fine-dining style pub food and concomitantly high prices. A typical pub has a large selection of beers and ales on tap.\n\n===Teppanyaki-style===\nMany restaurants specializing in Japanese cuisine offer the [[teppanyaki]] grill, which is more accurately based on a type of charcoal stove that is called [[shichirin]] in Japan. Diners, often in multiple, unrelated parties, sit around the grill while a chef prepares their food orders in front of them. Often the chef is trained in entertaining the guests with special techniques, including cracking a spinning egg in the air, forming a volcano out of differently-sized onion slices, and flipping grilled shrimp pieces into patrons' mouths, in addition to various props. Also referred to as hibachi.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|Companies}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[:Category:Restaurants_by_type|Category: Restaurants by Type]]\n* [[Automat]]\n* [[Concession stand]]\n* [[Diner]]\n* [[Dining car]]\n* [[Food trucks]] \n* [[Hot dog stand]]\n* [[Ice cream parlors]]\n* [[Pizzerias]]\n* [[Sandwich bar]]\n* [[Truck stop]]\n* [[Brasserie]]\n* [[Cabmen's Shelter Fund|Cabmen's shelter]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Appelbaum, Robert, ''Dishing It Out: In Search of the Restaurant Experience'' (London: Reaktion, 2011).\n\n{{Lists of restaurants}}\n\n[[Category:Restaurants by type| ]]\n[[Category:Restaurant terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Smiguu", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFine dining)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_restaurants"}

During the years of 1947-1953, specifically, France saw a large influx of Northern African immigrants. Legal Algerian immigrants numbered 740,000 between these years<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Colonial Culture in France since the Revolution|last=Deroo|first=Eric|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=372\u2013379}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, the French government began encouraging Algerian migration, as a result of pressure from businesses. This pressure was partly caused by the lack of workers in post-WWII France (Germain 23). In December 1958, they instituted the Social Action Fund, which supported African immigrants by allocating 500 million [[Franc]]s towards North African immigrant shelters and housing. However, the situation these immigrants in were still unpleasant as a result of their employers, who took them as indentured servants. Thus, they were paid low wages and given little government aid compared to other workers. Ultimately, many of them were deported back to Africa. However, by the late 1950s, France\u2019s intake of Algerian migrants began to outnumber those being deported, resulting in a sharp uptick in the French Algerian population.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, Algerians continued to attempt to immigrate to France. Many of these people obtained three month work visas, reflecting their intent to work in France for a short time period before returning home. However, the French government viewed this is as a hostile move, assuming that these immigrants intended to stay in the country permanently. Thus, the government continued to regularly deport Algerians. They were required to have a French address to remain in the country, which most Algerian immigrants did have. However, officials simply didn\u2019t believe the authenticity of their identification and paperwork; thus, in the 1960s, the French government deported 5-8% of African immigrants. By 1968, there were 40,000 Africans in France.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing the Republic: African and Caribbean Migrants in Postwar Paris, 1946-1974|last=Germain|first=Felix|publisher=Michigan State University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=East Lansing|pages=21\u201340}}</ref>\n\n== Causes of Migration ==\nThe migratory movement of Northern Africans into France is generally attributed to push factors. There was little opportunity to move freely throughout society in Algeria, so many were motivated to migrate to France for a better life.<ref name=\":1\" /> The presence of a post-colonial economic opportunity gap when Algeria was freed after the [[Algerian War]] also contributed to the increase of Algerian immigrants.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, some North Africans migrated to France because they would have more political freedom to protest French suppression in Algeria than they would in Africa.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Role of Algerians in WWII ===\nFrom 1943-1945, approximately 200,000 North Africans enlisted into France\u2019s armed forces. Additionally, an additional \u2248100,000 North Africans participated in the war effort through working in wartime industries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Post WWII ===\nWhile North Africans played a significant role in France\u2019s war effort, their contribution was ignored after the war. Rather, the French government continued their oppression in Algeria, angering North Africans in France and causing the rise of African rights groups. African rights groups include the [[Algerian People's Party|Algerian Populist Party]] and the [[Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Racism ==\nIn the 1950s, the French government used racism as a tool to delegitimize the efforts of African Nationalist groups. The government used tensions between different groups to depict Algerian immigrants as barbaric in propaganda campaigns. This was massively effective, negatively impacting public opinion on African immigrants. The 1953 survey by the [[Institut national d'\u00e9tudes d\u00e9mographiques|National Institute of Demographic Studies]] showed that North Africans and Germans were ranked last in sympathy levels for immigrants. This impact is exemplified by a piece published by the [[L'Aurore (1944 newspaper)|''L\u2019Aurore'']], a French periodical, in which it was written:\n\n\u201c''In Paris, North Africans are specialists and record makers in the nocturnal attack. The Arab is, quite precisely, the thief who waits on the corner of the road for the late passerby, whom he clubs for the sake of a watch\u2026\u201d''\n\n- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;''L\u2019Aurore, 1954''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, this sort of racial propaganda continued with the help of public health institutes. They targeted Algerian immigrants along with other African immigrants from Maurice, Mali and other countries.<ref name=\":1\" />  A study, published in 1963, entitled \u201cBlack workers in the Parisian region\u201d (''Les travailleurs noirs dans la region parisienne'')'','' outlined reasons for why, for public health reasons, African immigrants were not beneficial for France:\n\n''\u201cThey are accustomed to wearing practically nothing in Africa where the temperature ranges from 90 to 100 degrees, and when they arrive in Paris, especially during the cold winter, they are highly prone to catching disease like tuberculosis\u201d.''\n\nThis report also cited Africans\u2019 perceived diets as reason to reject them as workers. These public health officials were under the impression that Africans ate only simple foods such as rice and beans, and therefore, could not survive the heavy workload required of them in France. In reality, Africans ate a variety of healthy foods and balanced meals. This report further argued that these food deficiencies meant Africans were ridden with disease. Thus, African immigrants in France were required to carry around passbooks with detailed medical information, and were often randomly stopped and checked by French officials.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis type of racial bias showed a resurgence in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the French political party, the [[National Rally (France)|National Front]]. [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], the leader of the National Front, led with the slogan \u201cTwo million immigrants, two million unemployed\u201d.

During the years of 1947-1953, specifically, France saw a large influx of Northern African immigrants. Legal Algerian immigrants numbered 740,000 between these years<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Colonial Culture in France since the Revolution|last=Deroo|first=Eric|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=372\u2013379}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, the French government began encouraging Algerian migration, as a result of pressure from businesses. This pressure was partly caused by the lack of workers in post-WWII France (Germain 23). In December 1958, they instituted the Social Action Fund, which supported African immigrants by allocating 500 million [[Franc]]s towards North African immigrant shelters and housing. However, the situation these immigrants in were still unpleasant as a result of their employers, who took them as indentured servants. Thus, they were paid low wages and given little government aid compared to other workers. Ultimately, many of them were deported back to Africa. However, by the late 1950s, France\u2019s intake of Algerian migrants began to outnumber those being deported, resulting in a sharp uptick in the French Algerian population.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, Algerians continued to attempt to immigrate to France. Many of these people obtained three month work visas, reflecting their intent to work in France for a short time period before returning home. However, the French government viewed this is as a hostile move, assuming that these immigrants intended to stay in the country permanently. Thus, the government continued to regularly deport Algerians. They were required to have a French address to remain in the country, which most Algerian immigrants did have. However, officials simply didn\u2019t believe the authenticity of their identification and paperwork; thus, in the 1960s, the French government deported 5-8% of African immigrants. By 1968, there were 40,000 Africans in France.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing the Republic: African and Caribbean Migrants in Postwar Paris, 1946-1974|last=Germain|first=Felix|publisher=Michigan State University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=East Lansing|pages=21\u201340}}</ref>\n\n== Causes of Migration ==\nThe migratory movement of Northern Africans into France is generally attributed to push factors. There was little opportunity to move freely throughout society in Algeria, so many were motivated to migrate to France for a better life.<ref name=\":1\" /> The presence of a post-colonial economic opportunity gap when Algeria was freed after the [[Algerian War]] also contributed to the increase of Algerian immigrants.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, some North Africans migrated to France because they would have more political freedom to protest French suppression in Algeria than they would in Africa.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Role of Algerians in WWII ===\nFrom 1943-1945, approximately 200,000 North Africans enlisted into France\u2019s armed forces. Additionally, an additional \u2248100,000 North Africans participated in the war effort through working in wartime industries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Post WWII ===\nWhile North Africans played a significant role in France\u2019s war effort, their contribution was ignored after the war. Rather, the French government continued their oppression in Algeria, angering North Africans in France and causing the rise of African rights groups. African rights groups include the [[Algerian People's Party|Algerian Populist Party]] and the [[Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Racism ==\nIn the 1950s, the French government used racism as a tool to delegitimize the efforts of African Nationalist groups. The government used tensions between different groups to depict Algerian immigrants as barbaric in propaganda campaigns. This was massively effective, negatively impacting public opinion on African immigrants. The 1953 survey by the [[Institut national d'\u00e9tudes d\u00e9mographiques|National Institute of Demographic Studies]] showed that North Africans and Germans were ranked last in sympathy levels for immigrants. This impact is exemplified by a piece published by the [[L'Aurore (1944 newspaper)|''L\u2019Aurore'']], a French periodical, in which it was written:\n\n\u201c''In Paris, North Africans are specialists and record makers in the nocturnal attack. The Arab is, quite precisely, the thief who waits on the corner of the road for the late passerby, whom he clubs for the sake of a watch\u2026\u201d''\n\n- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;''L\u2019Aurore, 1954''<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, this sort of racial propaganda continued with the help of public health institutes. They targeted Algerian immigrants along with other African immigrants from Maurice, Mali and other countries.<ref name=\":1\" />  A study, published in 1963, entitled \u201cBlack workers in the Parisian region\u201d (''Les travailleurs noirs dans la region parisienne'')'','' outlined reasons for why, for public health reasons, African immigrants were not beneficial for France:\n\n''\u201cThey are accustomed to wearing practically nothing in Africa where the temperature ranges from 90 to 100 degrees, and when they arrive in Paris, especially during the cold winter, they are highly prone to catching disease like tuberculosis\u201d.''\n\nThis report also cited Africans\u2019 perceived diets as reason to reject them as workers. These public health officials were under the impression that Africans ate only simple foods such as rice and beans, and therefore, could not survive the heavy workload required of them in France. In reality, Africans ate a variety of healthy foods and balanced meals. This report further argued that these food deficiencies meant Africans were ridden with disease. Thus, African immigrants in France were required to carry around passbooks with detailed medical information, and were often randomly stopped and checked by French officials.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis type of racial bias showed a resurgence in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the French political party, the [[National Rally (France)|National Front]]. [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], the leader of the National Front, led with the slogan \u201cTwo million immigrants, two million unemployed\u201d. Le Pen is also quoted as saying \u201cYes, I believe in racial inequality\u2026 they do not all have the same capacity to evolve\u201d. During this time, books with black children featured on the covers were banned. As the 1990s progressed, the National Front\u2019s influence grew. The group took political control of the French city of Toulon, and promised to deny housing to African immigrants living in the city.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1997|title=The Resurgence of Racial Hate in France|url=|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|volume=|pages=141\u2013142|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\n==Ethnic groups==\n===Arabs===\n{{see also|Arabs in France}}\nArabs form the majority of Algerians living in France.\n\n===Berbers===\n{{see also|Berbers in Algeria|Berbers in France}}\n\nThe [[Berbers in France]] form a significant portion of the Algerian community in the country.\n\n===Jews===\n{{see also|History of the Jews in Algeria}}\nFollowing [[Algerian War|Algerian independence]] in 1962, most of Algeria's Jews, having been granted French citizenship in 1870, left with the [[pied-noir]]s.
