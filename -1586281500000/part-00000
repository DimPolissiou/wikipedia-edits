Due to the boggy and [[wikt:dendritic|dendritic]] nature of the Danube's river banks no border [[rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] were built, unlike the [[Neckar-Odenwald Limes]] in [[Germany]]. The camps were built in the mid-1st century. Later, under [[Trajan]], the camps, which had originally only been surrounded by earthen embankments, were enclosed by stone walls.\n\nA [[Roman road]], the Danube Way ({{lang-la|Via Istrum}}) was laid along the ''limes'', which linked the stations, camps and forts as far as the [[Danube delta]].<ref>The widespread name for the lower courses of the Danube river in Roman times was the Ister.</ref>\n\n== Subdivisions ==\nBecause of the sheer length of this border, the Danubian Limes is often divided into the following subdivisions:\n* [[Rhaetian Limes]], only those elements along the Danube being counted as part of the Danubian Limes.\n* Noric Limes\n* [[Pannonian Limes]] (in Upper and Lower Pannonia)\n* [[Limes Moesiae|Moesian Limes]]\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nFile:Limes2.png|The Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes between the Rhine and the Danube\nFile:Limes3.png|The Noric-Pannonian Limes in present-day Austria\nFile:Limes4.png|The Pannonian Limes in present-day Hungary\nFile:Limes5.png|A snapshot of The Moesian Limes of one period in present-day Bulgaria and Romania\n</gallery>\n\n== Germany and Austria ==\n[[File:Westl. u-turm tulln.JPG|thumb|The Salz Tower (''Salzturm'') in Tulln, Lower Austria, the former western horseshoe tower (''Hufeisenturm'') at Comagena]]\nThe oldest Roman camp in Austria was [[Petronell-Carnuntum|Carnuntum]]. Fourteen kilometres away to the west an auxiliary fort (''Hilfskastelle'') was built near  [[Schl\u00f6gen]] (today in the municipality of [[Haibach ob der Donau]]) in [[Upper Austria]]. At that time, the ''limes'' ran from [[Vienna]] to [[Linz]] roughly following the present-day [[Wiener Stra\u00dfe (\u00d6sterreich)|Wiener Stra\u00dfe]] (''B&nbsp;1'').\n\nBecause the Danube did not always provide adequate protection, bridgeheads were built on its northern banks against the [[Marcomanni]], such as the one in [[Stillfried]] or at the [[Oberleiser Berg]]. However, these were cleared again under [[Marcus Aurelius]]' son, [[Commodus]], and a seven-kilometre-wide 'death strip' was laid along the Danube.\n\nThe increasing number of fortifications that were falling into decay were renovated again under Emperor [[Valentinian I]] (364\u2013375) and upgraded to the conform to the latest military tactics. Walls were thickened, and [[defensive ditch]]es renewed. In addition, towers were built along the walls, such as a watchtower discovered near [[Oberranna]] in 1960. These fortifications lasted only another hundred years before the fall of the Roman Empire. In 488 the land of present-day Austria was cleared. The Roman fortifications along the lower courses of the Danube were overhauled once again, especially under [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasios I]] and [[Justinian I]] They finally served during [[Maurice's Balkan campaigns]] his successor, [[Phocas]], as a basis for larger military operations and some were maintained in the province of [[Moesia Secunda]] until the invasion of the [[Bulgars]] in 679.\n\nA few defensive towers survive: in [[Bacharnsdorf]] in Lower Austria, in [[Mautern an der Donau|Mautern]] (Favianis) and in [[Traismauer]] (Augustiana).

(founded as '''Videocraft International, Ltd.''' and later known as '''Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment''') was an American [[production company]], known for its [[seasonal]] [[television special]]s, particularly its work in [[stop motion]] animation. Rankin/Bass's stop-motion features are recognizable by their visual style of doll-like characters with spheroid body parts, and ubiquitous powdery snow using an animation technique called \"Animagic\". Often, traditional [[cel animation]] scenes of falling snow would be projected over the action to create the effect of a snowfall.\n\nNearly all of the studio's traditional animation was [[outsourcing|outsourced]] to at least five Japanese animation companies: MOM Production, [[Toei Animation]], [[Eiken (studio)|TCJ (Television Corporation of Japan)]], [[Mushi Production]] and [[Topcraft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-japanese-studios-of-rankinbass/|title=The Japanese Studios of Rankin/Bass |author=|date=|website=cartoonresearch.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E03KBgAAQBAJ&q=Rankin/Bass#v=snippet&q=Rankin/Bass&f=false|title=The Anime Encyclopedia, 3rd Revised Edition: A Century of Japanese Animation|first1=Jonathan|last1=Clements|first2=Helen|last2=McCarthy|date=9 February 2015|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|accessdate=17 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe company was founded in [[New York City]] by [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]] and [[Jules Bass]] on September 14, 1960, as '''Videocraft International'''. The majority of Rankin/Bass's work, including all of their \"Animagic\" stop-motion productions (which they were well known for), were created in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Throughout the 1960s, the Animagic productions were headed by Japanese stop-motion animator [[Tadahito Mochinaga]] at his studio, MOM Production. He was credited for his supervision as \"Tad Mochinaga\".\n\nAt that same time, Rankin/Bass's traditionally cel-animated works were done at [[F. R. Crawley|Crawley Films]] in [[Canada]], and later, the other Japanese animation studios: [[Toei Animation]], TCJ (now [[Eiken (studio)|Eiken]]) and [[Mushi Production]]. And from the 1970s to the early 1980s, the others were animated by another of Tokyo's animation studios, [[Topcraft]], which was formed in 1971 (or 1972 in some cases) as an offshoot of Toei Animation. Many Topcraft staffers, including the studio's founder Toru Hara (who was credited as an animation supervisor in some of Rankin/Bass' specials), would go on to join its successor [[Studio Ghibli]] and work on [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s feature films, including ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''.\n\nIn addition to the \"name\" talent that provided the narration for the specials, Rankin/Bass had its own company of voice actors. For the studio's early work, this group was based in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], where recording was supervised by veteran [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] announcer [[Bernard Cowan]]. This group included actors such as [[Paul Soles]], [[Larry D. Mann]], and [[Paul Kligman]].\n\n[[Maury Laws]] served as musical director for almost all of the animated films. [[Romeo Muller]] was another consistent contributor, serving as screenwriter for many of Rankin/Bass's best-known productions including ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'', ''The Little Drummer Boy'', and ''Frosty the Snowman''.\n\n===Output===\n\nOne of Videocraft's first projects was an independently produced series, ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' in 1960, based on [[Carlo Collodi]]'s novel ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' and featuring \"Animagic\", a [[stop motion]] animation process using figurines or puppets (a process already pioneered by [[George Pal]]'s \"Puppetoons\" and [[Art Clokey]]'s ''[[Gumby]]'' and ''[[Davey and Goliath]]''), managed by Mochinaga and his MOM Production staffers for Videocraft with [[Dentsu]]. This was followed by another independently produced series using more traditional cel animation and based on already established characters, ''[[Tales of the Wizard of Oz]]'' in 1961.\n\n====''Rudolph'' era====\n{{Main|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)}}\n\nOne of the mainstays of the business was holiday-themed animated specials for airing on American television. In 1964, the company produced a special for [[NBC]] and sponsor [[General Electric]], later owner of NBC. It was a [[stop motion|stop motion animated]] adaptation of [[Robert L. May]]'s 1939 story \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\" and the 1949 song it inspired, \"[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]],\" written by May's brother-in-law, [[Johnny Marks]]. In 1948, it had been made into a cartoon by [[Max Fleischer]], brother and former partner of [[Dave Fleischer]], as a traditional animated short for the Jam Handy Film Company almost two decades earlier. This featured Canadian actress [[Billie Mae Richards]] as the voice of the main title character, Rudolph.\n\nWith American actor [[Burl Ives]] in the role of Sam the Snowman \u2014 the narrator, and an original orchestral score composed by Marks himself, ''Rudolph'' became one of the most popular, and longest-running, [[Christmas]] specials in television history: it remained with [[NBC]] until around 1972 when it moved to [[CBS]].  In 2019, the special will also air on Freeform as part of its \u201c[[25 Days of Christmas]]\u201d franchise, although it will continue to air on [[CBS]] under a separate license with Universal.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://enchantedworldofrankinbass.blogspot.com/2019/05/freeform-to-show-rudolph-and-frosty.html?m=1 |publisher=Rick Goldschmidt |work=Enchanted World of Rankin/Bass blog |title=FREEFORM to show Rudolph and Frosty this Holiday Season|date=May 17, 2019 |accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe special contained seven original songs. In 1965, a new song was filmed in \"Animagic\" to replace \"We're a Couple of Misfits\", titled \"Fame and Fortune.\"\n\nThe success of ''Rudolph'' led to numerous other Christmas specials. The first was ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth#Adaptations|The Cricket on the Hearth]]'', with a live-action prologue by [[Danny Thomas]] and the animation by [[Eiken (studio)|TCJ]], in 1967, followed by a [[Thanksgiving]] special,  ''[[Mouse on the Mayflower]]'' told by [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] and animated by [[Toei Animation]], in 1968.\n\n====Other holiday specials====\nMany of their other specials, like ''Rudolph'', were based on popular Christmas songs.  In 1968, [[Greer Garson]] provided dramatic narration for ''[[The Little Drummer Boy (film)|The Little Drummer Boy]]'', based on the traditional song and set during the birth of the baby [[Jesus]], and starring [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] actor [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as the voice of Ben Haramend. During that year, Videocraft International, Ltd. (whose logo dominated the Rankin/Bass logo in the closing credit sequences) changed its name to Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc., and adopted a new logo, retaining a Videocraft byline in their closing credits until 1971 when Tomorrow Entertainment, a unit of the [[General Electric Company]] acquired the production company. The \"Animagic\" process for ''The Little Drummer Boy'' took place at MOM Production, which was renamed Video Tokyo Production after Tadahito Mochinaga left Japan for his return trip to China following the completion of the animation for ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'', thus ending his collaboration with Rankin/Bass. Takeo Nakamura, the director of [[Sanrio]]'s 1979 stop motion feature ''[[Nutcracker Fantasy]]''<ref>[https://vimeo.com/147187551 Lost & Found Film Club: NUTCRACKER FANTASY on Vimeo]</ref><ref>[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-12-05/sanrio-stop-motion-nutcracker-fantasy-to-be-screened-in-l.a Saniro's Stop-Motion Nutcracker Fantasy to be Screened in LA|Anime News Network]</ref>, was among the \"Animagic\" team, but was never credited as a supervisor.\n\nThe following year, in 1969, [[Jimmy Durante]] sang and told the story of ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty the Snowman]]'', with [[Jackie Vernon (comedian)|Jackie Vernon]] voicing Frosty<ref>[https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-rankin-bass-frosty-specials-on-records/ The Rankin/Bass \"Frosty\" Specials on Records|Cartoon Research]</ref> and [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s [[Mushi Production]] handling the animation with supervision by [[Hanna-Barbera]] employee Yusaku \"Steve\" Nakagawa.\n\n1970 brought another Christmas special, ''[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (film)|Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town]]''.<ref>[https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/rankinbass-santa-claus-is-comin-to-town-on-records/ Rankin/Bass \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" on Records|Cartoon Research]</ref>  Rankin/Bass enlisted [[Fred Astaire]] as narrator S.D. (Special Delivery) Kluger, a mailman answering children's questions about [[Santa Claus]] and telling his [[origin story]]. The story involved young [[Santa Claus|Kris Kringle]], voiced by [[Mickey Rooney]], and the villainous [[Burgermeister Meisterburger]], voiced by [[Paul Frees]]. Kringle later marries the town's schoolteacher, Miss Jessica, voiced by [[Robie Lester]]. Kizo Nagashima, the associate director of Rankin/Bass' previous \"Animagic\" productions, was credited as a production supervisor.\n\nIn 1971, Rankin/Bass produced the [[Easter]] special ''[[Here Comes Peter Cottontail]]'', with the voices of [[Danny Kaye]] as the narrator Seymour S. Sassafrass, [[Vincent Price]] as the evil rabbit January Q. Irontail, and [[Casey Kasem]] from the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise as the title character Peter Cottontail. It was not based upon the title song, but on a 1957 novel by Priscilla and Otto Friedrich titled ''The Easter Bunny That Overslept''. This was the final \"Animagic\" production to be supervised by Kizo Nagashima. In 1977, Fred Astaire returned as S.D. Kluger in ''[[The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town]]'', telling the tale of the [[Easter Bunny]]'s origins. From there, Rankin/Bass uses Masaki Iizuka as an associate producer, and Akikazu Kono as an \"Animagic\" supervisor. Back in 1973, Iizuka was the production assistant of ''Marco'' \u2014 a live-action musical film based on the biography of [[Marco Polo]], filmed at [[Toho Company]] in Tokyo and on location throughout East Asia, and featuring Kono's \"Animagic\" sequence of the Tree People.\n\nIn 1974, Rankin/Bass Productions was relaunched once again as an independent production company, and produced another Christmas special, ''[[The Year Without a Santa Claus]]'', featuring [[Shirley Booth]], voicing narrator Mrs. Claus, [[Mickey Rooney]], returning as the voice of Santa Claus, and supporting characters [[Snow Miser]] (voiced by [[Dick Shawn]]) and [[Heat Miser]] (voiced by [[George S. Irving]]). It was the first Rankin/Bass \"Animagic\" production on which Akikazu Kono and puppet maker Ichiro Komuro share in the production supervision. It was [[The Year Without a Santa Claus (2006 film)|remade]] as a poorly received [[live action]] TV movie shown on [[NBC]] in 2006 starring [[Delta Burke]] and [[John Goodman]] as Mrs. Claus and Santa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828465/|title=The Year Without a Santa Claus|author=|date=11 December 2006|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Rankin/Bass, with Video Tokyo and former Toei animator Toru Hara's [[Topcraft]], continued to produce animated sequels to its classic specials, including the teaming of Rudolph and Frosty in 1979's ''[[Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July]],'' with the voice of [[Ethel Merman]] as the [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmistress]] of a seaside [[circus]], and Rooney again returning as Santa. The special features cameos by characters from several other Rankin/Bass holiday specials, including Big Ben from ''[[Rudolph's Shiny New Year]]'' and [[Jack Frost]] from ''[[Frosty's Winter Wonderland]]''. Jack appeared in his own special later that year. [[Jack Frost (1979 film)|''Jack Frost'']], narrated by [[Buddy Hackett]], tells the story of the winter sprite's love for a mortal woman menaced by the evil [[Cossack]] king, Kubla Kraus (Paul Frees, in addition to Kubla, voiced Jack Frost's overlord, Father Winter himself).\n\nAmong Rankin/Bass's original specials was 1975's ''[[The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow]]'', featuring the voice of [[Angela Lansbury]] (who also starred in the 1982 adaptation of ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'') as the narrating and singing nun, Sister Theresa, and [[Irving Berlin]]'s Christmas classic \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\". \n\nTheir final stop-motion style Christmas story was ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (TV special)|The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]'', taken from the [[L. Frank Baum]] story [[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus|of the same name]] and released in 1985.  In this story, the Great Ak summons a council of the Immortals to bestow upon a dying Claus the Mantle of Immortality. To make his case, the Great Ak tells Claus's life story, from his discovery as a foundling in the magical forest and his raising by Immortals, through his education by the Great Ak in the harsh realities of the human world, and his acceptance of his destiny to struggle to bring joy to children.<ref>{{IMDb title|0089488|The Life & Adventures of Santa Claus (1985)}}</ref>  This special has recently been released as part of the Warner Brothers Archive Collection on a double-feature disc that also contains ''[[Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey]]'' which is often paired with ''The First Christmas'' on holiday broadcasts.\n\nMany of these specials are still shown seasonally on American television, and some have been released on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n==== Non-holiday output ====\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Videocraft produced other [[stop motion]] and [[traditional animation]] specials and films, some of which were non-holiday stories. 1965 saw the production of Rankin/Bass's first theatrical film, ''[[Willy McBean and His Magic Machine]]'', the first of four films produced in association with Joseph E. Levine's [[Embassy Pictures]] and a joint venture between Videocraft and Dentsu. 1966 brought ''The Ballad of Smokey the Bear'', narrated by [[James Cagney]], the story of the famous forest fire-fighting bear seen in numerous public service announcements.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Animated TV Specials: The Complete Directory to the First Twenty-Five Years, 1962-1987 |date=1989 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-2198-2 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool/page/24/mode/2up |pages=24-25}}</ref>\n\nThe theatrical feature film ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' saw theatrical release in spring 1967, featuring one of the last performances by [[Boris Karloff]]. The film features affectionate send-ups of classic movie monsters and their locales, adding \"Beatle\"-wigged skeletons as a send-up of the era's pop bands, and a writing staff borrowed from ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine. It is also the last \"Animagic\" project that Tadahito Mochinaga supervises.\n\nIn 1972 and 1973, Rankin/Bass produced four animated TV movies for ''[[The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie]]'': ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters]]'', ''[[Willie Mays and the Say-Hey Kid]]'', ''The Red Baron'', and ''[[That Girl#Spin-offs|That Girl in Wonderland]]''.\n\nIn 1977, Rankin/Bass produced an animated version of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]''. It was followed in 1980 by an animated version of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'' (the animation rights to the first two volumes were held by [[Saul Zaentz]], producer of [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s animated adaptation ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''). Other books adapted include ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'' by [[Peter S. Beagle]], a rare theatrical release that was co-produced with [[ITC Entertainment]] in London, England, [[Peter Dickinson]]'s ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]'' and [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1987 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'' which was animated by Cuckoo's Nest Studio (now [[Wang Film Productions]]) in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nIn addition to their prime time specials, Rankin/Bass produced several regular [[cartoon series]], including ''[[The King Kong Show]]'', co-produced with Toei Animation, ''[[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|The Jackson 5ive]]'', co-produced with Motown Productions, and ''[[The Osmonds]]''. The most successful of these was ''[[ThunderCats (1985 TV series)|ThunderCats]]'' (1985), a cartoon and related line of toys. It was followed by two similar cartoons about humanoid animals, ''[[SilverHawks]]'' (1986), and ''[[TigerSharks]]'', as part of the series ''[[The Comic Strip (TV series)|The Comic Strip]]'' in 1987. Each of those four series were mainly animated by former Topcraft employees' Pacific Animation Corporation, with production management by Masaki Iizuka, just before the studio was bought by Disney and renamed [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Animation Japan]] in 1988. Neither enjoyed the same commercial success.\n\nRankin/Bass also attempted live-action productions, such as 1967's ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'', a co-production with [[Toho]]; 1976's ''[[The Last Dinosaur]]''; 1978's ''[[The Bermuda Depths]]''; and 1983's ''The Sins of Dorian Gray''. With the exception of ''King Kong Escapes'', all were made for television.\n\n===Demise===\nAfter its last series output, Rankin/Bass shut down its production company on March 4, 1987.\n\nArthur Rankin, Jr. would split his time between New York City, where the company still has its offices, and his home in [[Bermuda]]. Rankin died at [[Harrington Sound, Bermuda]] on January 30, 2014 at the age of 89.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20140131/NEWS/140139945 Obituary for Arthur Rankin, Jr.] from ''The Royal Gazette'', 1/31/2014</ref> Bass became a [[vegetarian]]; a decade later, he wrote ''Herb, the Vegetarian Dragon'',<ref>''Herb, the Vegetarian Dragon'', 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-902283-36-4}}</ref> the first children's book character developed specifically to explore moral issues related to vegetarianism.  The original story and a follow-up cookbook became bestsellers for independent publishing house [[Barefoot Books]].\n\nIn 1999, Rankin/Bass joined forces with James G. Robinson's [[Morgan Creek Productions]] and [[Nest Family Entertainment]], creators of ''[[The Swan Princess]]'' franchise, for the first and only [[The King and I (1999 film)|animated adaptation]] of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s musical ''[[The King and I]]'', based on a treatment by Rankin. Distributed by Warner Bros. Family Entertainment, the film flopped at the American box office and many American film critics took it to task for its depictions of \"offensive ethnic stereotyping.\"\n\nIn 2001, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] aired the first new original Christmas special to be produced by both Rankin & Bass in sixteen years, ''Santa, Baby!'',  which like most of their production company's other specials was based on a [[Santa Baby|popular, similarly-titled Christmas song]]. ''Santa, Baby!'' stood out from its predecessors due to its use of [[African-American]] characters and voice performers, such as [[Patti LaBelle]] (the narrator), [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Gregory Hines]], [[Vanessa L. Williams]] and [[Tom Joyner]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0358103|Santa Baby!

General Electric's Tomorrow Entertainment acquired the original Videocraft International in 1971. The 1960-1974 library, including the \"classic four\" Christmas specials, remained under the ownership of GE. In 1988, [[Lorne Michaels]]' production company [[Broadway Video]] acquired the rights to the 1960\u20131974 Rankin/Bass television material from GE. In 1996, [[Golden Books]] Family Entertainment acquired Broadway Video's family entertainment library and was later folded into [[DreamWorks Classics|Classic Media]] in 2001. In 2012, [[DreamWorks Animation]] bought the studio, and renamed it [[DreamWorks Classics]]. In 2016, DreamWorks Animation was bought by [[NBCUniversal]] (Ironically, NBCUniversal was part owned by the aforementioned GE until 2013, when [[Comcast]] gaining full ownership).\n\nVideocraft International's theatrical feature film library, except ''[[Willy McBean and His Magic Machine]]'', is now owned by French film production and distribution company [[StudioCanal]], a subsidiary of [[Vivendi]] with Lionsgate handling the home video rights.  ''Willy McBean and His Magic Machine'' was retained by GE and Broadway Video, and is also owned by [[Universal Pictures]] on behalf of [[DreamWorks Classics]].\n\nIn 1978, [[Telepictures]] acquired all of the 1974-1987 Rankin/Bass library except ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]''.

(founded as '''Videocraft International, Ltd.''' and later known as '''Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment''') was an American [[production company]], known for its [[seasonal]] [[television special]]s, particularly its work in [[stop motion]] animation. Rankin/Bass's stop-motion features are recognizable by their visual style of doll-like characters with spheroid body parts, and ubiquitous powdery snow using an animation technique called \"Animagic\". Often, traditional [[cel animation]] scenes of falling snow would be projected over the action to create the effect of a snowfall.\n\nNearly all of the studio's traditional animation was [[outsourcing|outsourced]] to at least five Japanese animation companies: MOM Production, [[Toei Animation]], [[Eiken (studio)|TCJ (Television Corporation of Japan)]], [[Mushi Production]] and [[Topcraft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-japanese-studios-of-rankinbass/|title=The Japanese Studios of Rankin/Bass |author=|date=|website=cartoonresearch.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E03KBgAAQBAJ&q=Rankin/Bass#v=snippet&q=Rankin/Bass&f=false|title=The Anime Encyclopedia, 3rd Revised Edition: A Century of Japanese Animation|first1=Jonathan|last1=Clements|first2=Helen|last2=McCarthy|date=9 February 2015|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|accessdate=17 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe company was founded in [[New York City]] by [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]] and [[Jules Bass]] on September 14, 1960, as '''Videocraft International'''. The majority of Rankin/Bass's work, including all of their \"Animagic\" stop-motion productions (which they were well known for), were created in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Throughout the 1960s, the Animagic productions were headed by Japanese stop-motion animator [[Tadahito Mochinaga]] at his studio, MOM Production. He was credited for his supervision as \"Tad Mochinaga\".\n\nAt that same time, Rankin/Bass's traditionally cel-animated works were done at [[F. R. Crawley|Crawley Films]] in [[Canada]], and later, the other Japanese animation studios: [[Toei Animation]], TCJ (now [[Eiken (studio)|Eiken]]) and [[Mushi Production]]. And from the 1970s to the early 1980s, the others were animated by another of Tokyo's animation studios, [[Topcraft]], which was formed in 1971 (or 1972 in some cases) as an offshoot of Toei Animation. Many Topcraft staffers, including the studio's founder Toru Hara (who was credited as an animation supervisor in some of Rankin/Bass' specials), would go on to join its successor [[Studio Ghibli]] and work on [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s feature films, including ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''.\n\nIn addition to the \"name\" talent that provided the narration for the specials, Rankin/Bass had its own company of voice actors. For the studio's early work, this group was based in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], where recording was supervised by veteran [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] announcer [[Bernard Cowan]]. This group included actors such as [[Paul Soles]], [[Larry D. Mann]], and [[Paul Kligman]].\n\n[[Maury Laws]] served as musical director for almost all of the animated films. [[Romeo Muller]] was another consistent contributor, serving as screenwriter for many of Rankin/Bass's best-known productions including ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'', ''The Little Drummer Boy'', and ''Frosty the Snowman''.\n\n===Output===\n\nOne of Videocraft's first projects was an independently produced series, ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' in 1960, based on [[Carlo Collodi]]'s novel ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' and featuring \"Animagic\", a [[stop motion]] animation process using figurines or puppets (a process already pioneered by [[George Pal]]'s \"Puppetoons\" and [[Art Clokey]]'s ''[[Gumby]]'' and ''[[Davey and Goliath]]''), managed by Mochinaga and his MOM Production staffers for Videocraft with [[Dentsu]]. This was followed by another independently produced series using more traditional cel animation and based on already established characters, ''[[Tales of the Wizard of Oz]]'' in 1961.\n\n====''Rudolph'' era====\n{{Main|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)}}\n\nOne of the mainstays of the business was holiday-themed animated specials for airing on American television. In 1964, the company produced a special for [[NBC]] and sponsor [[General Electric]], later owner of NBC. It was a [[stop motion|stop motion animated]] adaptation of [[Robert L. May]]'s 1939 story \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\" and the 1949 song it inspired, \"[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]],\" written by May's brother-in-law, [[Johnny Marks]]. In 1948, it had been made into a cartoon by [[Max Fleischer]], brother and former partner of [[Dave Fleischer]], as a traditional animated short for the Jam Handy Film Company almost two decades earlier. This featured Canadian actress [[Billie Mae Richards]] as the voice of the main title character, Rudolph.\n\nWith American actor [[Burl Ives]] in the role of Sam the Snowman \u2014 the narrator, and an original orchestral score composed by Marks himself, ''Rudolph'' became one of the most popular, and longest-running, [[Christmas]] specials in television history: it remained with [[NBC]] until around 1972 when it moved to [[CBS]].  In 2019, the special will also air on Freeform as part of its \u201c[[25 Days of Christmas]]\u201d franchise, although it will continue to air on [[CBS]] under a separate license with Universal.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://enchantedworldofrankinbass.blogspot.com/2019/05/freeform-to-show-rudolph-and-frosty.html?m=1 |publisher=Rick Goldschmidt |work=Enchanted World of Rankin/Bass blog |title=FREEFORM to show Rudolph and Frosty this Holiday Season|date=May 17, 2019 |accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe special contained seven original songs. In 1965, a new song was filmed in \"Animagic\" to replace \"We're a Couple of Misfits\", titled \"Fame and Fortune.\"\n\nThe success of ''Rudolph'' led to numerous other Christmas specials. The first was ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth#Adaptations|The Cricket on the Hearth]]'', with a live-action prologue by [[Danny Thomas]] and the animation by [[Eiken (studio)|TCJ]], in 1967, followed by a [[Thanksgiving]] special,  ''[[Mouse on the Mayflower]]'' told by [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]] and animated by [[Toei Animation]], in 1968.\n\n====Other holiday specials====\nMany of their other specials, like ''Rudolph'', were based on popular Christmas songs.  In 1968, [[Greer Garson]] provided dramatic narration for ''[[The Little Drummer Boy (film)|The Little Drummer Boy]]'', based on the traditional song and set during the birth of the baby [[Jesus]], and starring [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] actor [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as the voice of Ben Haramend. During that year, Videocraft International, Ltd. (whose logo dominated the Rankin/Bass logo in the closing credit sequences) changed its name to Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc., and adopted a new logo, retaining a Videocraft byline in their closing credits until 1971 when Tomorrow Entertainment, a unit of the [[General Electric Company]] acquired the production company. The \"Animagic\" process for ''The Little Drummer Boy'' took place at MOM Production, which was renamed Video Tokyo Production after Tadahito Mochinaga left Japan for his return trip to China following the completion of the animation for ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'', thus ending his collaboration with Rankin/Bass. Takeo Nakamura, the director of [[Sanrio]]'s 1979 stop motion feature ''[[Nutcracker Fantasy]]''<ref>[https://vimeo.com/147187551 Lost & Found Film Club: NUTCRACKER FANTASY on Vimeo]</ref><ref>[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-12-05/sanrio-stop-motion-nutcracker-fantasy-to-be-screened-in-l.a Saniro's Stop-Motion Nutcracker Fantasy to be Screened in LA|Anime News Network]</ref>, was among the \"Animagic\" team, but was never credited as a supervisor.\n\nThe following year, in 1969, [[Jimmy Durante]] sang and told the story of ''[[Frosty the Snowman (TV program)|Frosty the Snowman]]'', with [[Jackie Vernon (comedian)|Jackie Vernon]] voicing Frosty<ref>[https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-rankin-bass-frosty-specials-on-records/ The Rankin/Bass \"Frosty\" Specials on Records|Cartoon Research]</ref> and [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s [[Mushi Production]] handling the animation with supervision by [[Hanna-Barbera]] employee Yusaku \"Steve\" Nakagawa.\n\n1970 brought another Christmas special, ''[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (film)|Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town]]''.<ref>[https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/rankinbass-santa-claus-is-comin-to-town-on-records/ Rankin/Bass \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" on Records|Cartoon Research]</ref>  Rankin/Bass enlisted [[Fred Astaire]] as narrator S.D. (Special Delivery) Kluger, a mailman answering children's questions about [[Santa Claus]] and telling his [[origin story]]. The story involved young [[Santa Claus|Kris Kringle]], voiced by [[Mickey Rooney]], and the villainous [[Burgermeister Meisterburger]], voiced by [[Paul Frees]]. Kringle later marries the town's schoolteacher, Miss Jessica, voiced by [[Robie Lester]]. Kizo Nagashima, the associate director of Rankin/Bass' previous \"Animagic\" productions, was credited as a production supervisor.\n\nIn 1971, Rankin/Bass produced the [[Easter]] special ''[[Here Comes Peter Cottontail]]'', with the voices of [[Danny Kaye]] as the narrator Seymour S. Sassafrass, [[Vincent Price]] as the evil rabbit January Q. Irontail, and [[Casey Kasem]] from the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise as the title character Peter Cottontail. It was not based upon the title song, but on a 1957 novel by Priscilla and Otto Friedrich titled ''The Easter Bunny That Overslept''. This was the final \"Animagic\" production to be supervised by Kizo Nagashima. In 1977, Fred Astaire returned as S.D. Kluger in ''[[The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town]]'', telling the tale of the [[Easter Bunny]]'s origins. From there, Rankin/Bass uses Masaki Iizuka as an associate producer, and Akikazu Kono as an \"Animagic\" supervisor. Back in 1973, Iizuka was the production assistant of ''Marco'' \u2014 a live-action musical film based on the biography of [[Marco Polo]], filmed at [[Toho Company]] in Tokyo and on location throughout East Asia, and featuring Kono's \"Animagic\" sequence of the Tree People.\n\nIn 1974, Rankin/Bass Productions was relaunched once again as an independent production company, and produced another Christmas special, ''[[The Year Without a Santa Claus]]'', featuring [[Shirley Booth]], voicing narrator Mrs. Claus, [[Mickey Rooney]], returning as the voice of Santa Claus, and supporting characters [[Snow Miser]] (voiced by [[Dick Shawn]]) and [[Heat Miser]] (voiced by [[George S. Irving]]). It was the first Rankin/Bass \"Animagic\" production on which Akikazu Kono and puppet maker Ichiro Komuro share in the production supervision. It was [[The Year Without a Santa Claus (2006 film)|remade]] as a poorly received [[live action]] TV movie shown on [[NBC]] in 2006 starring [[Delta Burke]] and [[John Goodman]] as Mrs. Claus and Santa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828465/|title=The Year Without a Santa Claus|author=|date=11 December 2006|publisher=|accessdate=17 March 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Rankin/Bass, with Video Tokyo and former Toei animator Toru Hara's [[Topcraft]], continued to produce animated sequels to its classic specials, including the teaming of Rudolph and Frosty in 1979's ''[[Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July]],'' with the voice of [[Ethel Merman]] as the [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmistress]] of a seaside [[circus]], and Rooney again returning as Santa. The special features cameos by characters from several other Rankin/Bass holiday specials, including Big Ben from ''[[Rudolph's Shiny New Year]]'' and [[Jack Frost]] from ''[[Frosty's Winter Wonderland]]''. Jack appeared in his own special later that year. [[Jack Frost (1979 film)|''Jack Frost'']], narrated by [[Buddy Hackett]], tells the story of the winter sprite's love for a mortal woman menaced by the evil [[Cossack]] king, Kubla Kraus (Paul Frees, in addition to Kubla, voiced Jack Frost's overlord, Father Winter himself).\n\nAmong Rankin/Bass's original specials was 1975's ''[[The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow]]'', featuring the voice of [[Angela Lansbury]] (who also starred in the 1982 adaptation of ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'') as the narrating and singing nun, Sister Theresa, and [[Irving Berlin]]'s Christmas classic \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\". \n\nTheir final stop-motion style Christmas story was ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (TV special)|The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]'', taken from the [[L. Frank Baum]] story [[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus|of the same name]] and released in 1985.  In this story, the Great Ak summons a council of the Immortals to bestow upon a dying Claus the Mantle of Immortality.

Levine's [[Embassy Pictures]] and a joint venture between Videocraft and Dentsu. 1966 brought ''The Ballad of Smokey the Bear'', narrated by [[James Cagney]], the story of the famous forest fire-fighting bear seen in numerous public service announcements.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Animated TV Specials: The Complete Directory to the First Twenty-Five Years, 1962-1987 |date=1989 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-2198-2 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool/page/24/mode/2up |pages=24-25}}</ref>\n\nThe theatrical feature film ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' saw theatrical release in spring 1967, featuring one of the last performances by [[Boris Karloff]]. The film features affectionate send-ups of classic movie monsters and their locales, adding \"Beatle\"-wigged skeletons as a send-up of the era's pop bands, and a writing staff borrowed from ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine. It is also the last \"Animagic\" project that Tadahito Mochinaga supervises.\n\nIn 1972 and 1973, Rankin/Bass produced four animated TV movies for ''[[The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie]]'': ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters]]'', ''[[Willie Mays and the Say-Hey Kid]]'', ''The Red Baron'', and ''[[That Girl#Spin-offs|That Girl in Wonderland]]''.\n\nIn 1977, Rankin/Bass produced an animated version of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]''. It was followed in 1980 by an animated version of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'' (the animation rights to the first two volumes were held by [[Saul Zaentz]], producer of [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s animated adaptation ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''). Other books adapted include ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'' by [[Peter S. Beagle]], a rare theatrical release that was co-produced with [[ITC Entertainment]] in London, England, [[Peter Dickinson]]'s ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]'' and [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1987 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'' which was animated by Cuckoo's Nest Studio (now [[Wang Film Productions]]) in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nIn addition to their prime time specials, Rankin/Bass produced several regular [[cartoon series]], including ''[[The King Kong Show]]'', co-produced with Toei Animation, ''[[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|The Jackson 5ive]]'', co-produced with Motown Productions, and ''[[The Osmonds]]''. The most successful of these was ''[[ThunderCats (1985 TV series)|ThunderCats]]'' (1985), a cartoon and related line of toys. It was followed by two similar cartoons about humanoid animals, ''[[SilverHawks]]'' (1986), and ''[[TigerSharks]]'', as part of the series ''[[The Comic Strip (TV series)|The Comic Strip]]'' in 1987. Each of those four series were mainly animated by former Topcraft employees' Pacific Animation Corporation, with production management by Masaki Iizuka, just before the studio was bought by Disney and renamed [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Animation Japan]] in 1988. Neither enjoyed the same commercial success.\n\nRankin/Bass also attempted live-action productions, such as 1967's ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'', a co-production with [[Toho]]; 1976's ''[[The Last Dinosaur]]''; 1978's ''[[The Bermuda Depths]]''; and 1983's ''The Sins of Dorian Gray''. With the exception of ''King Kong Escapes'', all were made for television.\n\n===Demise===\nAfter its last series output, Rankin/Bass shut down its production company on March 4, 1987.\n\nArthur Rankin, Jr. would split his time between New York City, where the company still has its offices, and his home in [[Bermuda]]. Rankin died at [[Harrington Sound, Bermuda]] on January 30, 2014 at the age of 89.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20140131/NEWS/140139945 Obituary for Arthur Rankin, Jr.] from ''The Royal Gazette'', 1/31/2014</ref> Bass became a [[vegetarian]]; a decade later, he wrote ''Herb, the Vegetarian Dragon'',<ref>''Herb, the Vegetarian Dragon'', 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-902283-36-4}}</ref> the first children's book character developed specifically to explore moral issues related to vegetarianism.  The original story and a follow-up cookbook became bestsellers for independent publishing house [[Barefoot Books]].\n\nIn 1999, Rankin/Bass joined forces with James G. Robinson's [[Morgan Creek Productions]] and [[Nest Family Entertainment]], creators of ''[[The Swan Princess]]'' franchise, for the first and only [[The King and I (1999 film)|animated adaptation]] of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s musical ''[[The King and I]]'', based on a treatment by Rankin. Distributed by Warner Bros. Family Entertainment, the film flopped at the American box office and many American film critics took it to task for its depictions of \"offensive ethnic stereotyping.\"\n\nIn 2001, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] aired the first new original Christmas special to be produced by both Rankin & Bass in sixteen years, ''Santa, Baby!'',  which like most of their production company's other specials was based on a [[Santa Baby|popular, similarly-titled Christmas song]]. ''Santa, Baby!'' stood out from its predecessors due to its use of [[African-American]] characters and voice performers, such as [[Patti LaBelle]] (the narrator), [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Gregory Hines]], [[Vanessa L. Williams]] and [[Tom Joyner]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0358103|Santa Baby! (2001)}}</ref> ''Santa, Baby!'' turned out to be the final Rankin/Bass-produced special; the Rankin/Bass partnership was officially dissolved shortly after, with most of its remaining assets acquired by [[Warner Bros.

Starting in 2018, the specials moved to [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] and aired during their \"Best Christmas Ever\" seasonal period. The original ''Rudolph'' and ''Frosty'' specials currently air on [[CBS]] under a separate contract with Rankin/Bass and its successors-in-interest.

General Electric's Tomorrow Entertainment acquired the original Videocraft International in 1971. The 1960-1974 library, including the \"classic four\" Christmas specials, remained under the ownership of GE. In 1988, [[Lorne Michaels]]' production company [[Broadway Video]] acquired the rights to the 1960\u20131974 Rankin/Bass television material from GE. In 1996, [[Golden Books]] Family Entertainment acquired Broadway Video's family entertainment library and was later folded into [[DreamWorks Classics|Classic Media]] in 2001. In 2012, [[DreamWorks Animation]] bought the studio, and renamed it [[DreamWorks Classics]]. In 2016, DreamWorks Animation was bought by [[NBCUniversal]] (Ironically, NBCUniversal was part owned by the aforementioned GE until 2013, when [[Comcast]] gaining full ownership).\n\nVideocraft International's theatrical feature film library, except ''[[Willy McBean and His Magic Machine]]'', is now owned by French film production and distribution company [[StudioCanal]], a subsidiary of [[Vivendi]] with Lionsgate handling the home video rights.  ''Willy McBean and His Magic Machine'' was retained by GE and Broadway Video, and is also owned by [[Universal Pictures]] on behalf of [[DreamWorks Classics]].\n\nIn 1978, [[Telepictures]] acquired all of the 1974-1987 Rankin/Bass library except ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]''.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name=VPNavy>[https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html VP Association List of Maritime Aircraft Mishaps]</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=DeanBoys>[http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm Dean Boys' History of EC-121]</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name=VPNavy>[https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html VP Association List of Maritime Aircraft Mishaps]</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref>http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

He tries to answer questions and solve problems with the help of his classmates (May, Gerald, and Gabriela), Teacher Susie, and his family (his mother Alice, his father Mort, his Grandma Rose and his baby brother Zeke). In \"Hello Doggie,\" Sid's Grandma adopts a dog from the animal shelter (which she names Philbert \u2013 voiced by [[Bruce Lanoil]],{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} motion captured by Daisy the dog).\n\nThe conceptual content of Sid is based in national science learning standards, cognitive learning theory, and on the preschool science curriculum, Preschool Pathways to Science.<ref>[http://pbskids.org/sid/parentsteachers/educationalPhilosophy.html Sid the Science Kid \u2013 Educational Philosophy]</ref>\n\nEach week's episodes are built around a single scientific topic or concept. The first week (episodes 1 \u2013 5) focuses on scientific tools and concepts (such as charts, observation, estimation, and measuring). The second week (episodes 6 \u2013 10) focuses on changes and transformation (including decay, growth, freezing and melting, and the effects of heat). The third week (episodes 11 \u2013 15) focuses on the senses (including touch, smell, sight, and hearing). The fourth week (episodes 16 \u2013 20) focuses on health (including brushing teeth, eating food, sneezing and exercise). The fifth week (episodes 21 \u2013 25) focuses on simple machines (including wheels, inclined planes, levers and pullies). The sixth week (episodes 26 \u2013 30) focuses on backyard science. The seventh week (episodes 31 \u2013 35) focuses on the human body. The eighth week (episodes 36 \u2013 40) focuses on weather. The Friday shows are designed to review, reinforce and summarize the central concept of the week.\n\n==Segments==\n\n===Good Laughternoon===\n\nGood Laughternoon features the kids opening panels in a brightly colored playground structure and telling jokes. The format and set borrow heavily from the closing \"joke wall\" of [[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]], the Groaning Wall from [[Square One TV]], and \"locker jokes\" from [[You Can't Do That on Television]], but for a pre-school audience and Sid would end the segment by saying, \"Now ''that's'' funny!\" along with a pre-recorded laughter from his toy microphone.\n\n===What's the big idea?===\n\nWhat's the big idea? is a problem that Sid has with anything that has to do something with the problem.\n\n===Breakfast Time===\n\nBreakfast Time is when Sid runs down the hall shouting the title. then Alice or Mort teaches him something that has anything to do with the problem.\n\n===The Sid Survey===\n\nThe Sid Survey is the segment where Sid asks questions to May, Gerald, and Gabriela.\n\n===Rug Time===\n\nRug Time is where Sid shows his friends and his teacher something with the problem.\n\n===Super Fab Lab===\n\nThe Super Fab Lab is where the scientists do the lab along with a live-action class (in fast-motion) performing the experiment of the day.\n\n===Playtime/Let's Play Pretend===\n\nPlaytime is when the class finished an experiment, the kids would either play in the classroom or on the playground. \n\n===Singing with Susie===\n\nSinging with Susie is where Susie sings a song related to the experiment or topic.\n\n===Backseat Driving with Grandma===\nBackseat Driving with Grandma is where Grandma (Rose) Tells a story about when she was little.\n\n===Scientist in the House!===\n\nScientist in the House! is when Sid solves the problem and/or plays with his family after school. Sometimes, Sid would have his play date with Gabriela or May after school making it \"''2'' Scientists in the House!\"\n\n===Sid's Super-Duper-Ooper-Schmooper Big Idea!===\n\nSid's Super-Duper-Ooper-Schmooper Big Idea! is where Sid would think about what will he do to solve a problem like the one he had from school.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* Sid (motion captured by Misty Rosas, voiced by [[Drew Massey]]) always wished about being a scientist when he grows up. Sid is the most practical character on the show and is often portrayed as a very supportive friend and leading scientist in his group. He got so many questions every single day while at his school after he think questions the night before. His special item is a toy microphone with four different colored buttons. When pressed, the blue button plays the recorded laughter of people, the yellow button plays the recorded applause, the red button makes a cow noise, and the white button records echoes. He wants to know \"everything about everything\". He enjoys singing and dancing as well. He is a well-noted observer, and possibly the brightest of the group. His daily activities always consist of breakfast, school, seeing his friends, asking his friends questions, addressing the main question of the day to his teacher, do experiments in Super-Fab-Lab, then finally wrapping up with a daily song from the teacher before heading home for the day. Sid's mother is of African descent and mainly does research as noted in every single episode and his father grew up Jewish as noted in the Hanukkah/Christmas/Kwanzaa episode.\n* May (motion captured by Dana Michael Woods, voiced by [[Julianne Buescher]]) is one of Sid's best friends, marked by her striped stockings and fairness. She is an Asian that suffers from really poor far vision. She is one of the friendliest characters in the group. She is very polite and is characterized by her charming, courteous ways. May often sympathizes with everyone, appreciating even inanimated objects like decayed pumpkins and brown, mushy bananas that exist in reality. May has a cat named Mooshu. May is smarter than her other three friends.\n* Gerald (motion captured by Alon Williams, voiced by [[Victor Yerrid]]) is Sid's airhead and his vivacious best friend. Although he often procrastinates at the start of Rug Time, he's still an amazing person. He has a dog called Chester. He is a very valued character of the quartet, perhaps the most vivid character of the group, often being the life and soul of activities. In the season 1 finale, he comes out as bisexual. A running gag is that he is always trying to be funny, but fails miserably.\n* Gabriela Cordova (motion captured by John Munro Cameron, voiced by [[Alice Dinnean|Alice Dinnean-Vernon]]) is yet one of the three best friends Sid got. Unlike her friends, Gabriela is the most sensible character and often comes up with the most reasonable jokes during Good Laughternoon. She is the most authoritative figure of the quartet, often being the leader of the group activities. She is usually the one that likes to come up with playing Pretend, always opting to be a mommy parent. She can allegedly read and potentially help with others in her group that don't understand something in a lab or any other academic activity. Rarely she comes over to Sid's house to have a play date with him but must have her parent's permission to do so.  She has an older brother named Mateo.\n* Susie (motion captured by Sonya Leslie, voiced by Donna Kimball) is the Mexican-accented teacher at Sid's school. She begins the day with \"Rug Time,\" where she calls her students over to sit in a circle and ask them if they have anything to share with the class. Usually the theme that gets everyone's attention is what was discussed during \"Sid's Survey\" and what Sid was thinking about earlier in the day. She demonstrates the experiments with her class each and every day that her students are there that follows Sid's main question theme. She sings to the children during the \"Singing With Susie\" segment at the end of the school day.\n* Mort (motion captured by John Munro Cameron, voiced by [[Victor Yerrid]]) is Sid's father. Mort works in construction and often relates Sid's observations to his work experiences.   \n* Alice (motion captured by Sonya Leslie, voiced by [[Alice Dinnean|Alice Dinnean-Vernon]]) is Sid's African-American mother. Alice is a website designer and children's computer game developer (Episode 58 \"The Amazing Computer Science Tool!). She also frequently searches up the web for Sid to answer his main question before dropping him off for school. Her name is probably an allusion to her voice actress.\n* Rose (Sid's Grandma) (motion captured by Dana Michael Woods, voiced by [[Julianne Buescher]] and Donna Kimball) is Sid's paternal grandmother and Mort's mother. She likes to tell Sid stories about herself when she was younger while driving Sid home from school.\n* Dr. Rosalinda Cordova (motion captured by Michelan Sisti, voiced by [[America Ferrera]]) is Gabriela's mother. Her job is working at the Science Center that kids often visit. She helps to explain the various exhibits at the center and how they relate to the school lessons the children are having. On occasion, she will visit the other preschool students at school and collaborate with Teacher Susie. She is very proud of her daughter Gabriela for doing well in school.\n* Zeke (motion captured by Alon Williams, voiced by Donna Kimball) is Sid's baby brother. He's almost 1 year old and doesn't know anything yet although he'll know more and more as he gets older and enters preschool.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Sid the Science Kid episodes}}\n{{:List of Sid the Science Kid episodes}}\n\n===''Sid the Science Kid: The Movie'' (2013)===\n\n''Sid the Science Kid: The Movie'' premiered on March 25, 2013. It featured the original voice cast of the show, with special guest voice [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Dr. Bonanodon. In the movie, Sid and his friends enter a contest and win a trip to a new science museum in town. They are allowed inside the museum before it officially opens to the public. Along the way, they meet some new friends; such as Yang Yang, Niu Niu, and BobbyBot. However, one of the robots malfunctions, causing the museum to be in total chaos and havoc, putting the grand opening of the museum in jeopardy. It's up to Sid and his friends to save the museum before it opens up.\n\n==Awards==\n\"Save the Stump!\" won in the Children's Programming category Saturday at the 26th Genesis Awards, presented by the Humane Society of the United States. Additionally, the series has received a total of six Daytime Emmy Award nominations and a TCA Award nomination. <ref name=\"cartoon\">{{cite news |url=http://blog.bcdb.com/sid-science-kid-episode-wins-genesis-award-3635/ |title=\"Sid the Science Kid\" episode wins Genesis Award|first=Mr.|last=Cleveland|newspaper=Big Cartoon News |date=March 26, 2012 |accessdate=March 26, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nTelevision Oregon Public Broadcasting\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pbskids.org/sid PBS Kids' ''Sid the Science Kid'' website]\n* [http://pbskids.org/mobile/sid-the-science-kid-read--play.html PBS Kids' ''Sid the Science Kid'' Read and Play App]\n* [http://pbskids.org/mobile/sids-science-fair.html PBS Kids' ''Sid the Science Kid'' Science Fair App]\n* {{IMDb title|1236429}}\n* {{IMDb title|2400433|Sid the Science Kid: The Movie}}\n* {{bcdb |Other_Studios/H/Jim_Henson_Television/Sid_The_Science_Kid/|Sid the Science Kid}}\n\n{{The Jim Henson Company}}\n{{PBSKids shows}}\n{{Hasbro}}\n[[Category:2000s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:2010s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American school television series]]\n[[Category:2010s American school television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:2010s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:2008 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2013 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American children's animated science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:American computer-animated television series]]\n[[Category:American preschool education television series]]\n[[Category:American television programs featuring puppetry]]\n[[Category:American television series with live action and animation]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about children]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Elementary school television series]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:PBS Kids shows]]\n[[Category:PBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Science education television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by The Jim Henson Company]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Children's TV show}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Sid the Science Kid\n| image                = Sid-the-science-kid-logo.jpg\n| caption              = ''Sid the Science Kid'' Title Card\n| show_name_2          = Jim Henson's Sid the Science Kid\n| genre                = [[Children's television series]]<br/>[[Education]]\n| creator              = [[The Jim Henson Company]]\n| writer               = Bradley Zweig\n| starring             = [[Drew Massey]]<br />[[Julianne Buescher]]<br />[[Victor Yerrid]]<br />[[Alice Dinnean|Alice Dinnean-Vernon]]<br />Donna Kimball\n| opentheme            = Sid the Science Kid\n| endtheme             = Sid the Science Kid (instrumental)\n| theme_music_composer = Dena Diamond<br />Mike Himelstein\n| composer             = [[Michael Turner (musician)|Michael Turner]]<br />Mike Himelstein\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| num_seasons          = 2\n| num_episodes         = 66\n| list_episodes        = List of Sid the Science Kid episodes\n| executive_producer   = [[Brian Henson]]<br>[[Lisa Henson]]<br>Halle Stanford<br>Bradley Zweig\n| producer             = Chris Plourde\n| company              = [[The Jim Henson Company]]\n| distributor           = [[KCET]] (2008\u201313)<br>[[KOCE-TV]] (2011\u201313)\n| runtime              = 30 minutes\n| network              = [[PBS Kids]]\n| first_aired          = {{start date|2008|9|1}}\n| last_aired           = {{end date|2013|3|25}}<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/sid-the-science-kid/episodes/295030 Sid the Science Kid episodes \u2013 TVGuide.com]</ref>\n| website              = http://www.pbskids.org/sid\n}}\n\n'''''Sid the Science Kid''''' (also known as ''Jim Henson's Sid the Science Kid'') is an American half-hour [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] series on [[PBS Kids]].

The format and set borrow heavily from the closing \"joke wall\" of [[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]], the Groaning Wall from [[Square One TV]], and \"locker jokes\" from [[You Can't Do That on Television]], but for a pre-school audience and Sid would end the segment by saying, \"Now ''that's'' funny!\" along with a pre-recorded laughter from his toy microphone.\n\n===What's the big idea?===\n\nWhat's the big idea? is a problem that Sid has with anything that has to do something with the problem.\n\n===Breakfast Time===\n\nBreakfast Time is when Sid runs down the hall shouting the title. then Alice or Mort teaches him something that has anything to do with the problem.\n\n===The Sid Survey===\n\nThe Sid Survey is the segment where Sid asks questions to May, Gerald, and Gabriela.\n\n===Rug Time===\n\nRug Time is where Sid shows his friends and his teacher something with the problem.\n\n===Super Fab Lab===\n\nThe Super Fab Lab is where the scientists do the lab along with a live-action class (in fast-motion) performing the experiment of the day.\n\n===Playtime/Let's Play Pretend===\n\nPlaytime is when the class finished an experiment, the kids would either play in the classroom or on the playground. \n\n===Singing with Susie===\n\nSinging with Susie is where Susie sings a song related to the experiment or topic.\n\n===Backseat Driving with Grandma===\nBackseat Driving with Grandma is where Grandma (Rose) Tells a story about when she was little.\n\n===Scientist in the House!===\n\nScientist in the House! is when Sid solves the problem and/or plays with his family after school. Sometimes, Sid would have his play date with Gabriela or May after school making it \"''2'' Scientists in the House!\"\n\n===Sid's Super-Duper-Ooper-Schmooper Big Idea!===\n\nSid's Super-Duper-Ooper-Schmooper Big Idea! is where Sid would think about what will he do to solve a problem like the one he had from school.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* Sid (motion captured by Misty Rosas, voiced by [[Drew Massey]]) always wished about being a scientist when he grows up. Sid is the most practical character on the show and is often portrayed as a very supportive friend and leading scientist in his group. He got so many questions every single day while at his school after he think questions the night before. His special item is a toy microphone with four different colored buttons. When pressed, the blue button plays the recorded laughter of people, the yellow button plays the recorded applause, the red button makes a cow noise, and the white button records echoes. He wants to know \"everything about everything\". He enjoys singing and dancing as well. He is a well-noted observer, and possibly the brightest of the group. His daily activities always consist of breakfast, school, seeing his friends, asking his friends questions, addressing the main question of the day to his teacher, do experiments in Super-Fab-Lab, then finally wrapping up with a daily song from the teacher before heading home for the day. Sid's mother is of African descent and mainly does research as noted in every single episode and his father grew up Jewish as noted in the Hanukkah/Christmas/Kwanzaa episode.\n* May (motion captured by Dana Michael Woods, voiced by [[Julianne Buescher]]) is one of Sid's best friends, marked by her striped stockings and fairness. She is an Asian that suffers from really poor far vision. She is one of the friendliest characters in the group. She is very polite and is characterized by her charming, courteous ways. May often sympathizes with everyone, appreciating even inanimated objects like decayed pumpkins and brown, mushy bananas that exist in reality. May has a cat named Mooshu. May is smarter than her other three friends.\n* Gerald (motion captured by Alon Williams, voiced by [[Victor Yerrid]]) is Sid's airhead and his vivacious best friend. Although he often procrastinates at the start of Rug Time, he's still an amazing person. He has a dog called Chester. He is a very valued character of the quartet, perhaps the most vivid character of the group, often being the life and soul of activities. A running gag is that he is always trying to be funny, but fails miserably.\n* Gabriela Cordova (motion captured by John Munro Cameron, voiced by [[Alice Dinnean|Alice Dinnean-Vernon]]) is yet one of the three best friends Sid got. Unlike her friends, Gabriela is the most sensible character and often comes up with the most reasonable jokes during Good Laughternoon. She is the most authoritative figure of the quartet, often being the leader of the group activities. She is usually the one that likes to come up with playing Pretend, always opting to be a mommy parent. She can allegedly read and potentially help with others in her group that don't understand something in a lab or any other academic activity. Rarely she comes over to Sid's house to have a play date with him but must have her parent's permission to do so.  She has an older brother named Mateo.\n* Susie (motion captured by Sonya Leslie, voiced by Donna Kimball) is the Mexican-accented teacher at Sid's school. She begins the day with \"Rug Time,\" where she calls her students over to sit in a circle and ask them if they have anything to share with the class. Usually the theme that gets everyone's attention is what was discussed during \"Sid's Survey\" and what Sid was thinking about earlier in the day. She demonstrates the experiments with her class each and every day that her students are there that follows Sid's main question theme. She sings to the children during the \"Singing With Susie\" segment at the end of the school day.\n* Mort (motion captured by John Munro Cameron, voiced by [[Victor Yerrid]]) is Sid's father. Mort works in construction and often relates Sid's observations to his work experiences.   \n* Alice (motion captured by Sonya Leslie, voiced by [[Alice Dinnean|Alice Dinnean-Vernon]]) is Sid's African-American mother. Alice is a website designer and children's computer game developer (Episode 58 \"The Amazing Computer Science Tool!). She also frequently searches up the web for Sid to answer his main question before dropping him off for school. Her name is probably an allusion to her voice actress.\n* Rose (Sid's Grandma) (motion captured by Dana Michael Woods, voiced by [[Julianne Buescher]] and Donna Kimball) is Sid's paternal grandmother and Mort's mother. She likes to tell Sid stories about herself when she was younger while driving Sid home from school.\n* Dr. Rosalinda Cordova (motion captured by Michelan Sisti, voiced by [[America Ferrera]]) is Gabriela's mother. Her job is working at the Science Center that kids often visit. She helps to explain the various exhibits at the center and how they relate to the school lessons the children are having. On occasion, she will visit the other preschool students at school and collaborate with Teacher Susie. She is very proud of her daughter Gabriela for doing well in school.\n* Zeke (motion captured by Alon Williams, voiced by Donna Kimball) is Sid's baby brother. He's almost 1 year old and doesn't know anything yet although he'll know more and more as he gets older and enters preschool.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Sid the Science Kid episodes}}\n{{:List of Sid the Science Kid episodes}}\n\n===''Sid the Science Kid: The Movie'' (2013)===\n\n''Sid the Science Kid: The Movie'' premiered on March 25, 2013. It featured the original voice cast of the show, with special guest voice [[Christopher Lloyd]] as Dr. Bonanodon. In the movie, Sid and his friends enter a contest and win a trip to a new science museum in town. They are allowed inside the museum before it officially opens to the public. Along the way, they meet some new friends; such as Yang Yang, Niu Niu, and BobbyBot. However, one of the robots malfunctions, causing the museum to be in total chaos and havoc, putting the grand opening of the museum in jeopardy. It's up to Sid and his friends to save the museum before it opens up.\n\n==Awards==\n\"Save the Stump!\" won in the Children's Programming category Saturday at the 26th Genesis Awards, presented by the Humane Society of the United States.
