There is one large town, Tuoji Town (\u7823\u77f6\u9547, population 8,495) and seven smaller towns with forty villages, with a total population in the county of 52,000.\n\n==Economy==\nThe major occupation is [[aquaculture]], producing products such as [[sea cucumber]]s, [[abalone]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[bivalve]]s, [[kelp]], [[scallop]]s, [[prawn]]s and [[fish]].  [[Tourism]] is also important; many of the villages sport resort hotels.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe islands are regularly served by both a passenger and vehicle [[RORO|Roll On, Roll Off]] ferry from Penglai.  There is a small military airport on the largest island, South Changshan Island.\n\n==Tourism==\nBoth Changdao National Forest Park and Changdao National Nature Reserve are located on the islands, which are on a cross-Bohai Sea flyway.\n\nTemple Island ({{zh|labels=no |t={{linktext|\u5edf\u5cf6}} |s={{linktext|\u5e99\u5c9b}} |p=Mi\u00e0od\u01ceo}}) got its name from the large number of temples that were built there. Xianying Palace is a temple that was built during the Northern Song Dynasty, starting in 1122. It was originally a [[Taoist]] temple to the sea goddess [[Matsu (goddess)|Matsu]], but became [[Buddhist]] later. At the present time the local government has restored the temple to its [[Ming Dynasty]] appearance, although many additions had been made during the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]].\n\n{{citation needed span|Changdao Island was previously closed to non-Chinese nationals. Westerners found on the island were swiftly taken to the passenger ferry terminal and placed on the next ferry back to Penglai by the islands Police service. Islanders promptly reported all \"''outsiders''\" to the islands police service. Police explained the reasons for this was due to the high number of military installations on the Island. The Changdao Islands are now open to non-Chinese nationals, including westerners.

Tenant farming is an [[Agrarian system|agricultural production system]] in which landowners contribute their land and often a measure of operating [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and management, while tenant farmers contribute their labor along with at times varying amounts of capital and management. Depending on the contract, tenants can make payments to the owner either of a fixed portion of the product, in cash or in a combination. The rights the tenant has over the land, the form, and measures of payment varies across systems (geographically and chronologically). In some systems, the tenant could be evicted at whim ([[tenancy at will]]); in others, the landowner and tenant sign a contract for a fixed number of years ([[tenancy for years]] or [[indentured servant|indenture]]). In most [[developed country|developed countries]] today, at least some restrictions are placed on the rights of landlords to evict tenants under normal circumstances.\n\n==England and Wales==\nHistorically, rural society utilised a three tier structure of [[landowner]]s ([[nobility]], [[gentry]], [[yeomen|yeomanry]]), tenant farmers, and [[farmworker]]s. Originally, tenant farmers were known as [[peasants]].

The essence of the code was to establish complex constraints on the landlord's ability to give the notice to quit, whilst also converting fixed-term tenancies into yearly tenancies at the conclusion of the fixed term. In addition, there was a uniform rent ascertainment scheme contained in section 12.\n\nIt became difficult to obtain new tenancies as a result of landlords' reluctance to have a tenant protected by the 1986 Act and in 1995 the government of the day, with the support of industry organizations, enacted a new market-oriented code in the form of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995. The protection of the 1986 Act remains in respect of tenancies created prior to the existence of the 1995 Act, and for those tenancies falling within section 4 of the 1995 Act. For all other tenancies granted on or after 1 September 1995 their regulation is within the 1995 Act framework.\n\nThat Act was altered with effect from 18 October 2006 by the Regulatory Reform (Agricultural Tenancies)(England and Wales) Order 2006 SI 2006/2805, which also contains changes to the 1986 Act. Tenancies granted after 18 October 2006 over agricultural land used for a trade or business will fall within the limited protection of the 1995 Act so as to enjoy (provided the term is more than two years in length or there is a yearly tenancy) a mandatory minimum twelve months written notice to quit, including in respect of fixed terms. There is for all tenancies within the scope of the Act a mandatory tenants' right to remove fixtures and buildings (section 8) together with compensation for improvements (Part III).  The rent review provisions in Part II may be the subject of choice to a much greater extent than previously. Disputes under the Act are usually, by the terms of Part IV, the subject of statutory arbitration controlled by the framework of the Arbitration Act 1996.\n\nThe current regime under the 1995 Act for regulating tenancies, commonly known as Farm Business Tenancies,  permits the creation of a clearly and easily terminable interest, whether by a periodic tenancy or a fixed term.  In the cycle of animal husbandry and land use and improvement, the long-term effect of the Farm Business Tenancy on the landscape of Britain is not yet proven. It was predicted by landowners and other industry spokesmen that the 1995 Act would create opportunities for new tenants by allowing large areas of new lettings but this has not happened in practice as most landowners have continued to favor share farming or management agreements over formal tenancies and the majority of new lettings under the Act have been to existing farmers, often [[owner-occupier]]s taking on extra land at significantly higher rents than could be afforded by a traditional tenant.<ref name=Gibbard />\n\n==Canada==\nTenant farming immigrants came to Canada not just from the British Isles but also the United States of America.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Plains Farmer and the Prairie Province Frontier, 1897-1914 |first=K.

Heavy demands were placed on these tenants by their landlords, the ''b\u00f8nder'' or land-owning farmers. The majority of the Husmann's working hours were usually taken up by work for the landlord, leaving him little time to work on his own land or better his own situation. As a result, though the husmenn were technically free to leave the land at any time, their poor economic state made them in essence \"economic serfs\". Failing to own their own land also made tenant farmers ineligible to vote according to the [[Norwegian Constitution]] at the time. The number of tenant farmers in the country grew during the 19th century, rising from 48,571 in 1825 to 65,060 in 1855, the latter figure representing the height of the Husmann population in Norway, most of whom lived in the eastern part of the country. Given their difficult economic and social position in Norway, many Norwegian husmenn immigrated to Canada and the United States throughout the 19th century. Following the [[revolutions of 1848]] the husmenn's cause was taken up by [[Marcus Thrane]]. Thrane fought for the husmenn's rights at home and also encouraged them to emigrate and seek better fortunes abroad. The number of husmenn began to decline in the second half of the 19th century, and by 1910 they made up less than 5% of Norwegian society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blegen|first=Theodore C.|title=Norwegian Migration to America 1825-1860|publisher=The Norwegian-American Historical Association|date=1931|location=Northfield, Minnesota}}</ref>\n\n===Sweden and Finland ===\nThe Swedish terms ''[[statare]]'' and ''Torpare'' refer to slightly different types of tenant farmers. Their situation was usually poor, but in theory, they were always free to leave. In some cases, the Torpare ([[crofter]]) was the owner of his own plot of land (typically less than a quarter [[mantal]]) and was also a subject to taxation. This taxation could be in the form of [[corv\u00e9e]], but payment in money was usually cheaper if possible. The Torre could have contracts as long as 50 years. They would work their own land as well as that of a free farmer (bonde), noble or other. In some aspects their situation made them easy victims of [[impressment]] The statare was a class of people who received their income mostly from labor on the land of the landowner, not in money but subsistence, and would have a one-year contract ending in October or September. Their lives were described by prominent Swedish and Finnish novelists and writers such as [[Ivar Lo-Johansson]], [[Jan Frideg\u00e5rd]], [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna]] ([[Under the North Star trilogy]]) and [[Moa Martinson]] who helped end the system of the state in 1945 (Sweden) and 1918 (Finland).<ref>Rasila V. 1970.

Neither the AHA 1986 nor the ATA 1995 applies in Scotland. The relevant legislation for Scotland is rather the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991 and the Agriculture (Scotland) Act 1948.<ref name=HMRC1995/>\n\nFor Scotland see [[Crofting]], a traditional and long-established means of tenant and subsistence farming.\n\n==United States==\nTenant farming has been important in the US from the 1870s to the present. Tenants typically bring their own tools and animals. To that extent it is distinguished from being a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]], which is a tenant farmer who usually provides no capital and pays fees with crops.\n\nA hired hand is an agricultural employee even though he or she may live on the premises and exercise a considerable amount of control over the agricultural work, such as a foreman. A [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]] is a farm tenant who pays rent with a portion (often half) of the crop he raises and who brings little to the operation besides his family labor; the landlord usually furnishing working stock, tools, fertilizer, housing, fuel, and seed, and often providing regular advice and oversight.\n\nTenant farming in the North was historically a step on the \"agricultural ladder\" from hired hand or sharecropper taken by young farmers as they accumulated enough experience and capital to buy land (or buy out their siblings when a farm was inherited).<ref>Donald L.

Very little cash changed hands. The few local banks were small and cash was scarce and had to be hoarded for taxes. Landowners needed a great deal of labor at harvest time to pick the cash crop, cotton.<ref>Arthur F. Raper, ''Preface to peasantry: A tale of two black belt counties'' (1936)  [https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3A%28%27%27Preface+to+peasantry%22%29&page=2 Online free to borrow].\n</ref> The typical plan was to divide old plantations into small farms that were assigned to the tenants. Throughout the year the tenants lived rent-free. The operator their own gardens. Every week bought food and supplies on credit through the local country store. At harvest time, the tenants picked the cotton, and turned it all over to the landowners. They sold the cotton on the national market and used part of the funds to pay the debts owed to the country store. The cycle then started all over again. Landowners also worked some of the land directly, using black labor paid in cash. The landowners held all the political power, and fought vigorously against government welfare programs that would provide cash that would undermine the cashless system. Economic historians Lee Alston and Joseph Ferrie (1999) describe the system as essentially an informal contract that: \n:bound employer and worker through the provision of housing, medical care, and other in-kind services along with cash wages. At its heart, it guaranteed a stable and adequate labor supply to the planter. Though restricted by the directives of the planter, workers in return received some measure of economic stability, including a social safety net, access to financial capital, and physical protection in an often-violent society.<ref> Lee Alston and Joseph Ferrie, ''Southern Paternalism and the American Welfare State'' (1999) p 28 quoted in Gibbs, \"Reconsidering the Southern Black Belt\" (2003)  p 258.</ref>\n\nTenant farmers often had agricultural managers who supervised their activities. In 1907, for instance, J. H. Netterville began employment for the Panola Company, an agricultural business founded by William Mackenzie Davidson in the rich farming area of [[St. Joseph, Louisiana|St. Joseph]] in [[Tensas Parish, Louisiana|Tensas Parish]] in northeastern Louisiana in the Mississippi River [[River delta|delta]] country. In its heyday, Panola controlled some eleven thousand acres, two thirds planted in cotton and the other third in grains. Netterville became general manager of three highly profitable Panola properties, the Balmoral, Blackwater, and Wyoming plantations near [[Newellton, Louisiana|Newellton]], in which capacity he supervised 125 African-American tenant farming families, with little strife and great ease, according to reports from that period.<ref>Henry E.

Tenant farming is an [[Agrarian system|agricultural production system]] in which landowners contribute their land and often a measure of operating [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and management, while tenant farmers contribute their labor along with at times varying amounts of capital and management. Depending on the contract, tenants can make payments to the owner either of a fixed portion of the product, in cash or in a combination. The rights the tenant has over the land, the form, and measures of payment varies across systems (geographically and chronologically). In some systems, the tenant could be evicted at whim ([[tenancy at will]]); in others, the landowner and tenant sign a contract for a fixed number of years ([[tenancy for years]] or [[indentured servant|indenture]]). In most [[developed country|developed countries]] today, at least some restrictions are placed on the rights of landlords to evict tenants under normal circumstances.\n\n==England and Wales==\nHistorically, rural society utilised a three tier structure of [[landowner]]s ([[nobility]], [[gentry]], [[yeomen|yeomanry]]), tenant farmers, and [[farmworker]]s.

The essence of the code was to establish complex constraints on the landlord's ability to give the notice to quit, whilst also converting fixed-term tenancies into yearly tenancies at the conclusion of the fixed term. In addition, there was a uniform rent ascertainment scheme contained in section 12.\n\nIt became difficult to obtain new tenancies as a result of landlords' reluctance to have a tenant protected by the 1986 Act and in 1995 the government of the day, with the support of industry organizations, enacted a new market-oriented code in the form of the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995. The protection of the 1986 Act remains in respect of tenancies created prior to the existence of the 1995 Act, and for those tenancies falling within section 4 of the 1995 Act. For all other tenancies granted on or after 1 September 1995 their regulation is within the 1995 Act framework.\n\nThat Act was altered with effect from 18 October 2006 by the Regulatory Reform (Agricultural Tenancies)(England and Wales) Order 2006 SI 2006/2805, which also contains changes to the 1986 Act. Tenancies granted after 18 October 2006 over agricultural land used for a trade or business will fall within the limited protection of the 1995 Act so as to enjoy (provided the term is more than two years in length or there is a yearly tenancy) a mandatory minimum twelve months written notice to quit, including in respect of fixed terms. There is for all tenancies within the scope of the Act a mandatory tenants' right to remove fixtures and buildings (section 8) together with compensation for improvements (Part III).  The rent review provisions in Part II may be the subject of choice to a much greater extent than previously. Disputes under the Act are usually, by the terms of Part IV, the subject of statutory arbitration controlled by the framework of the Arbitration Act 1996.\n\nThe current regime under the 1995 Act for regulating tenancies, commonly known as Farm Business Tenancies,  permits the creation of a clearly and easily terminable interest, whether by a periodic tenancy or a fixed term.  In the cycle of animal husbandry and land use and improvement, the long-term effect of the Farm Business Tenancy on the landscape of Britain is not yet proven. It was predicted by landowners and other industry spokesmen that the 1995 Act would create opportunities for new tenants by allowing large areas of new lettings but this has not happened in practice as most landowners have continued to favor share farming or management agreements over formal tenancies and the majority of new lettings under the Act have been to existing farmers, often [[owner-occupier]]s taking on extra land at significantly higher rents than could be afforded by a traditional tenant.<ref name=Gibbard />\n\n==Canada==\nTenant farming immigrants came to Canada not just from the British Isles but also the United States of America.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Plains Farmer and the Prairie Province Frontier, 1897-1914 |first=K.

Heavy demands were placed on these tenants by their landlords, the ''b\u00f8nder'' or land-owning farmers. The majority of the Husmann's working hours were usually taken up by work for the landlord, leaving him little time to work on his own land or better his own situation. As a result, though the husmenn were technically free to leave the land at any time, their poor economic state made them in essence \"economic serfs\". Failing to own their own land also made tenant farmers ineligible to vote according to the [[Norwegian Constitution]] at the time. The number of tenant farmers in the country grew during the 19th century, rising from 48,571 in 1825 to 65,060 in 1855, the latter figure representing the height of the Husmann population in Norway, most of whom lived in the eastern part of the country. Given their difficult economic and social position in Norway, many Norwegian husmenn immigrated to Canada and the United States throughout the 19th century. Following the [[revolutions of 1848]] the husmenn's cause was taken up by [[Marcus Thrane]]. Thrane fought for the husmenn's rights at home and also encouraged them to emigrate and seek better fortunes abroad. The number of husmenn began to decline in the second half of the 19th century, and by 1910 they made up less than 5% of Norwegian society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blegen|first=Theodore C.|title=Norwegian Migration to America 1825-1860|publisher=The Norwegian-American Historical Association|date=1931|location=Northfield, Minnesota}}</ref>\n\n===Sweden and Finland ===\nThe Swedish terms ''[[statare]]'' and ''Torpare'' refer to slightly different types of tenant farmers. Their situation was usually poor, but in theory, they were always free to leave. In some cases, the Torpare ([[crofter]]) was the owner of his own plot of land (typically less than a quarter [[mantal]]) and was also a subject to taxation. This taxation could be in the form of [[corv\u00e9e]], but payment in money was usually cheaper if possible. The Torre could have contracts as long as 50 years. They would work their own land as well as that of a free farmer (bonde), noble or other. In some aspects their situation made them easy victims of [[impressment]] The statare was a class of people who received their income mostly from labor on the land of the landowner, not in money but subsistence, and would have a one-year contract ending in October or September. Their lives were described by prominent Swedish and Finnish novelists and writers such as [[Ivar Lo-Johansson]], [[Jan Frideg\u00e5rd]], [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna]] ([[Under the North Star trilogy]]) and [[Moa Martinson]] who helped end the system of the state in 1945 (Sweden) and 1918 (Finland).<ref>Rasila V. 1970.

Neither the AHA 1986 nor the ATA 1995 applies in Scotland. The relevant legislation for Scotland is rather the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991 and the Agriculture (Scotland) Act 1948.<ref name=HMRC1995/>\n\nFor Scotland see [[Crofting]], a traditional and long-established means of tenant and subsistence farming.\n\n==United States==\nTenant farming has been important in the US from the 1870s to the present. Tenants typically bring their own tools and animals. To that extent it is distinguished from being a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]], which is a tenant farmer who usually provides no capital and pays fees with crops.\n\nA hired hand is an agricultural employee even though he or she may live on the premises and exercise a considerable amount of control over the agricultural work, such as a foreman. A [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]] is a farm tenant who pays rent with a portion (often half) of the crop he raises and who brings little to the operation besides his family labor; the landlord usually furnishing working stock, tools, fertilizer, housing, fuel, and seed, and often providing regular advice and oversight.\n\nTenant farming in the North was historically a step on the \"agricultural ladder\" from hired hand or sharecropper taken by young farmers as they accumulated enough experience and capital to buy land (or buy out their siblings when a farm was inherited).<ref>Donald L.  Winters, \"Tenant farming in Iowa, 1860-1900: a study of the terms of rental leases.\" ''Agricultural History'' 48.1 (1974): 130-150.

Very little cash changed hands. The few local banks were small and cash was scarce and had to be hoarded for taxes. Landowners needed a great deal of labor at harvest time to pick the cash crop, cotton.<ref>Arthur F. Raper, ''Preface to peasantry: A tale of two black belt counties'' (1936)  [https://archive.org/search.php?query=title%3A%28%27%27Preface+to+peasantry%22%29&page=2 Online free to borrow].\n</ref> The typical plan was to divide old plantations into small farms that were assigned to the tenants. Throughout the year the tenants lived rent-free. The operator their own gardens. Every week bought food and supplies on credit through the local country store. At harvest time, the tenants picked the cotton, and turned it all over to the landowners. They sold the cotton on the national market and used part of the funds to pay the debts owed to the country store. The cycle then started all over again. Landowners also worked some of the land directly, using black labor paid in cash. The landowners held all the political power, and fought vigorously against government welfare programs that would provide cash that would undermine the cashless system. Economic historians Lee Alston and Joseph Ferrie (1999) describe the system as essentially an informal contract that: \n:bound employer and worker through the provision of housing, medical care, and other in-kind services along with cash wages. At its heart, it guaranteed a stable and adequate labor supply to the planter. Though restricted by the directives of the planter, workers in return received some measure of economic stability, including a social safety net, access to financial capital, and physical protection in an often-violent society.<ref> Lee Alston and Joseph Ferrie, ''Southern Paternalism and the American Welfare State'' (1999) p 28 quoted in Gibbs, \"Reconsidering the Southern Black Belt\" (2003)  p 258.</ref>\n\nTenant farmers often had agricultural managers who supervised their activities. In 1907, for instance, J. H. Netterville began employment for the Panola Company, an agricultural business founded by William Mackenzie Davidson in the rich farming area of [[St. Joseph, Louisiana|St. Joseph]] in [[Tensas Parish, Louisiana|Tensas Parish]] in northeastern Louisiana in the Mississippi River [[River delta|delta]] country. In its heyday, Panola controlled some eleven thousand acres, two thirds planted in cotton and the other third in grains. Netterville became general manager of three highly profitable Panola properties, the Balmoral, Blackwater, and Wyoming plantations near [[Newellton, Louisiana|Newellton]], in which capacity he supervised 125 African-American tenant farming families, with little strife and great ease, according to reports from that period.<ref>Henry E.

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss Dali's marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.  In paintings such as ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]],'' ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross|The Christ of Saint John on the Cross]]'' and ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]],'' Dal\u00ed sought to synthesize Christian [[iconography]] with images of material disintegration inspired by [[nuclear physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed Bio, Art on 5th|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504050531/http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|archive-date=4 May 2006|access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 461-63</ref> His later Nuclear Mysticism works included ''[[La Gare de Perpignan]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Hallucinogenic Toreador]]'' (1968\u201370).\n\nDal\u00ed's keen interest in natural science and [[mathematics and art|mathematics]] was further manifested by the proliferation of images of DNA and [[rhinoceros horn]] shapes in works from the mid-1950s.

However, Jodorowsky changed his mind after Dal\u00ed publicly supported the execution of alleged ETA terrorists in December 1975.

Other designs Dal\u00ed made for her include a shoe-shaped hat, and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles. In 1950, Dal\u00ed created a special \"costume for the year 2045\" with [[Christian Dior]].<ref name=\"designws\">[http://www.designws.com/pagina/1dalieng.htm Dal\u00ed Rotterdam Museum Boijmans].

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nDal\u00ed worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Workers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss Dali's marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nDal\u00ed worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Workers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!
