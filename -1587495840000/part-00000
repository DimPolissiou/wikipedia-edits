During the war, the company was a major supplier for the U.S. military, producing over a billion dollars worth of steel and aluminum products. In 1944, a record workforce of some 31,000 men and women built a wide variety of items, including aircraft gun turrets, wings, stabilizers, ailerons, tank hulls, bomb and wheel doors for the [[B-29]], to mention only a few.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1973|title=Body by Briggs|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=19|pages=29|via=}}</ref> But by September 1944, when Pietsch signed on, they were already looking ahead to post-war car designs, and efforts were underway to secure contracts for automotive bodies from [[Packard]] and [[Chrysler]], among other companies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early styling projects assigned to Pietsch included work on the [[Packard]] Clipper as well as some formal limousines on [[Chrysler]] chassis, and \"special sedans,\" some designed specifically for [[Walter P.

In October 1947, with samples of his work in tow, he interviewed successfully and by mid-November of that year, he was working at [[Ford]] as the new assistant head of styling in the Ford studio, working initially in exteriors under the supervision of Adrian Gil Spear. For most U.S. automobile companies, designs for the first two or three postwar years were not much more than facelifts of 1941 and 1942 models. This was certainly true for Ford\u2014efforts in 1946 were nearly all directed toward the first all-new model, which turned out to be the highly successful 1949 Ford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bridges|first=John|title=Bob Bourke Designs for Studebaker|publisher=J.

Exner had the salesmanship and persuasiveness required to make badly needed changes that would by the mid-1950s bring [[Chrysler]] to the forefront of American automobile design.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Godshall|first=Jeff|date=1975|title=The last DeSoto: Styling by Virgil Exner|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=26|pages=14|via=}}</ref> Now as Director of Styling, Exner set about rebuilding the department, turning it into the talk of the town, not only among Detroit's styling circles but of the entire country. Pietsch played a decisive role in this domestic success as well as in Chrysler's association with Italian auto makers\u2014first, a short-lived relationship with [[Pinin Farina]] in 1950, and then, in the following year, with [[Carrozzeria Ghia]] of [[Turin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|date=1975|title=Thinking ahead: Ghia-Chrysler showcars|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=30|pages=18|via=}}</ref> By 1953, a half a dozen Italian-built Chrysler show-cars had been created. Under these ideal working conditions, it's a wonder that Pietsch didn't stay longer with Exner\u2014the potential at [[Chrysler]] for new and exciting things was enormous, but once again the thrill of a new challenge was too great. Responding in early 1952 to an attractive offer from [[Raymond Loewy]], brokered in part by his old friend Bob Koto, he moved from Detroit to [[South Bend, Indiana]], to join [[Raymond Loewy and Associates]], which at the time held the [[Studebaker]] design contract.\n<br />\n[[File:Banshee, two-door coupe, with transparent Plexiglass top, by T.

Shortly thereafter, all kinds of lucrative contracts came his way. By the late 1930s and early 40s, he had sold designs for [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, Pensy railcars and locomotives, [[TWA]] sleeper planes, [[Matson, Inc.|Matson]] ships and large ocean liners, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste tubes, [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric shavers, buildings of all kinds, including supermarkets, and hundreds of other products, not the least of which were [[Studebaker]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1971|title=Before the new wore off: What the \"Stude Graveyard\" cars looked like when new|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=6|pages=13|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Reese|first=Elizabeth|title=Raymond Loewy: Pioneer of American Industrial Design|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|year=1990|isbn=|location=Munich, Germany|pages=39-41}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 31, 1949|title=Up from the Egg|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=54(18)|pages=68-74|via=}}</ref>\n<br />\n[[File:White Speedster, with red underbody, by T.

Pietsch, 1955]]\nWorking for [[Raymond Loewy]] and Associates, which at that time was responsible for all [[Studebaker]] styling, was a unique experience. There were no individual studios set up with all sorts of titles for the designers, just several large rooms located in the old Chippewa Avenue truck plant in [[South Bend]] where [[Studebaker]] had manufactured its aircraft engines and army trucks during the war. The designers had just one boss, Bob Bourke, and his assistant, Bob Koto, and everyone, including Bourke and Koto, wore many hats. They sketched, and modeled in clay; in fact, the emphasis was on modeling. They often worked into the small hours of the morning with no overtime pay. The clay work was new to Pietsch and by his own admission he never became very adept at it because designers in [[Detroit]], where he had received all his prior training, were not involved in modeling. He strongly believed, however, that designers should be skilled at drawing and rendering as well as modeling.\n[[File:Design for a Studebaker, high-speed express truck, by T. W.

Pietsch remembers management complaining about how European styling ruined [[Studebaker]], but it was, in his opinion, all misplaced condemnation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=165}}</ref>\n\nThings were so bad by late 1953 that discussion turned to the idea of teaming up with another car company, and by the following June, with sales for 1954 worse than ever, a merger with [[Packard]] was approved.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=72}}</ref> The new [[Studebaker-Packard]] management decided to sever the expensive relationship with [[Loewy]] and Associates, thinking that their own in-house styling team should be given full control of [[Studebaker]] design efforts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=81}}</ref> Thus, in early 1955, the contract with [[Raymond Loewy]], which had existed since 1938, was not renewed, and Pietsch, along with everyone else, was given the option of staying with [[Loewy]] or switching over to [[Studebaker]] proper. Pietsch decided that the [[Loewy]] situation was much too tenuous and, even as shabby as [[Studebaker]] was at the time, opted to stay with the sinking ship.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Design for a Studebaker, cab-forward, pick-up truck, by T.

But despite reorganization and new faces, [[Studebaker-Packard]] remained in deep trouble.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=102}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=131, 141}}</ref> In 1958, the situation was so dire that Pietsch and a number of his fellow designers were laid off. Now, for the first time in his career, Pietsch was unable to immediately step into another automotive design job. After several months looking for work in the [[South Bend]] area, he went to [[Chicago]], where he was soon offered a position by the industrial design firm of Dave Chapman, Incorporated. Commuting weekly by train between [[South Bend]] and [[Chicago]], he was responsible for the account of a department of [[Montgomery Ward]] and Company, which included, among other things, the design of water heaters, water softeners, water pumps, furnaces, air-conditioners, incinerators, and ventilating fans. He also did considerable work on the design of boats, outboard motors, and radios.\n[[File:Sovereign Coupe, black airbrush on red paper, by T. W.

Randal D. Faurot, newly appointed head of styling, called on Pietsch to help rebuild the department, offering him a position as his assistant that he couldn't refuse. In June 1962, however, frustrated and angry over management's abrupt decision to cancel a project that he had worked for many months\u2014the design for an all-new version of the [[Studebaker]] Lark for 1962\u2014Pietsch lost his temper and was fired.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was a tumultuous and abrupt ending to a frustrating, decade-long struggle at [[Studebaker]].\n\n==A last Stint at Chrysler, American Motors, and Retirement: 1962\u20131972==\nOnce again out of work, Pietsch wrote on July 2, 1962, to his old friend Cliff Voss in [[Detroit]], one of \"Exner's boys,\" with whom he had worked at [[Chrysler]] back in the early 1950s. Within a few weeks, Pietsch was back for a third and final hitch with the [[Chrysler Corporation]], but these turned out to be unhappy years. [[Chrysler]] was by now a completely different place. There was no longer the camaraderie and warm atmosphere that had been there before. The studios were now segregated and the old feeling of team effort, along with most of his old friends, was gone. Styling had become a big well-structured and impersonal organization much like the situation at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]].\n<br />\n[[File:Lynx, two-seater convertible, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969.jpg|left|thumb|Lynx, Two-seater Convertible, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969]]\nAdding to the disappointment, Pietsch was assigned from the start to \"interiors,\" which meant dashboards\u2014sketches and more sketches of instruments and instrument panels, reminiscent of the work that had \"bored him to death\" back at [[Ford]] in the late 1940s. Soon this narrowed down to nothing but \"ornamentation,\" in which he was obliged to spend all his time designing nameplates, lettering, and the configuration of numerals on speedometers, tachometers, and other instruments, all extremely tedious work. But he stuck with it for seven and a half years, exclaiming later that he didn't know how he managed to do it for so long.\n[[File:Mercedes Benz Model S Roadster, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969.jpg|left|thumb|Mercedes Benz Model S Roadster, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969]]\n\nIn February 1970, Pietsch was caught one last time in one of the many [[Chrysler]] lay-offs, but, lucky once again, he got a call a short time later from [[American Motors]], asking if he'd like to go to work for [[Jeep]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foster|first=P.R.|title=The Story of Jeep, 2nd edition|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2004|isbn=|location=Lola, Wisconsin|pages=132}}</ref> But before Pietsch realized it, he was right back where he had been at [[Chrysler]] the year before, \"doing mostly calibrations of the numerals on dashboard instruments.\" That his graphics were used without change on the instrument panels of the '72 and '73 [[Jeep Wagoneer]] provided little satisfaction. There was nothing about the [[Jeep]] line that interested him. Although he did his best every day to appear enthusiastic, Pietsch was so bored at work that he \"could hardly see straight,\" and he worried also that his health was beginning to fail. In February 1972, after only two years with Jeep, he decided to retire.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Theodore Wells Pietsch II, working at home, Highland Park, Michigan, 1938.jpg|thumb|Theodore Wells Pietsch II, working at home, Highland Park, Michigan, 1938]]\n<br />\n==Personal life==\nOn June 24, 1938, Pietsch married Louise Mary Shamlian (December 1, 1914, Watertown, Massachusetts \u2212 January 15, 1987, Seal Beach, California), with whom he had three children: Priscilla Esther Pietsch, born December 22, 1941; [[Theodore Wells Pietsch III]], March 6, 1945; and Louise Jean Pietsch May 11, 1948.

During the war, the company was a major supplier for the U.S. military, producing over a billion dollars worth of steel and aluminum products. In 1944, a record workforce of some 31,000 men and women built a wide variety of items, including aircraft gun turrets, wings, stabilizers, ailerons, tank hulls, bomb and wheel doors for the [[B-29]], to mention only a few.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1973|title=Body by Briggs|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=19|pages=29|via=}}</ref> But by September 1944, when Pietsch signed on, they were already looking ahead to post-war car designs, and efforts were underway to secure contracts for automotive bodies from [[Packard]] and [[Chrysler]], among other companies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early styling projects assigned to Pietsch included work on the [[Packard]] Clipper as well as some formal limousines on [[Chrysler]] chassis, and \"special sedans,\" some designed specifically for [[Walter P.

In October 1947, with samples of his work in tow, he interviewed successfully and by mid-November of that year, he was working at [[Ford]] as the new assistant head of styling in the Ford studio, working initially in exteriors under the supervision of Adrian Gil Spear. For most U.S. automobile companies, designs for the first two or three postwar years were not much more than facelifts of 1941 and 1942 models. This was certainly true for Ford\u2014efforts in 1946 were nearly all directed toward the first all-new model, which turned out to be the highly successful 1949 Ford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bridges|first=John|title=Bob Bourke Designs for Studebaker|publisher=J.

Exner had the salesmanship and persuasiveness required to make badly needed changes that would by the mid-1950s bring [[Chrysler]] to the forefront of American automobile design.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Godshall|first=Jeff|date=1975|title=The last DeSoto: Styling by Virgil Exner|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=26|pages=14|via=}}</ref> Now as Director of Styling, Exner set about rebuilding the department, turning it into the talk of the town, not only among Detroit's styling circles but of the entire country. Pietsch played a decisive role in this domestic success as well as in Chrysler's association with Italian auto makers\u2014first, a short-lived relationship with [[Pinin Farina]] in 1950, and then, in the following year, with [[Carrozzeria Ghia]] of [[Turin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|date=1975|title=Thinking ahead: Ghia-Chrysler showcars|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=30|pages=18|via=}}</ref> By 1953, a half a dozen Italian-built Chrysler show-cars had been created. Under these ideal working conditions, it's a wonder that Pietsch didn't stay longer with Exner\u2014the potential at [[Chrysler]] for new and exciting things was enormous, but once again the thrill of a new challenge was too great. Responding in early 1952 to an attractive offer from [[Raymond Loewy]], brokered in part by his old friend Bob Koto, he moved from Detroit to [[South Bend, Indiana]], to join [[Raymond Loewy and Associates]], which at the time held the [[Studebaker]] design contract.\n<br />\n[[File:Banshee, two-door coupe, with transparent Plexiglass top, by T.

Shortly thereafter, all kinds of lucrative contracts came his way. By the late 1930s and early 40s, he had sold designs for [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, Pensy railcars and locomotives, [[TWA]] sleeper planes, [[Matson, Inc.|Matson]] ships and large ocean liners, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste tubes, [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric shavers, buildings of all kinds, including supermarkets, and hundreds of other products, not the least of which were [[Studebaker]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1971|title=Before the new wore off: What the \"Stude Graveyard\" cars looked like when new|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=6|pages=13|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Reese|first=Elizabeth|title=Raymond Loewy: Pioneer of American Industrial Design|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|year=1990|isbn=|location=Munich, Germany|pages=39-41}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 31, 1949|title=Up from the Egg|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=54(18)|pages=68-74|via=}}</ref>\n<br />\n[[File:White Speedster, with red underbody, by T.

There were no individual studios set up with all sorts of titles for the designers, just several large rooms located in the old Chippewa Avenue truck plant in [[South Bend]] where [[Studebaker]] had manufactured its aircraft engines and army trucks during the war. The designers had just one boss, Bob Bourke, and his assistant, Bob Koto, and everyone, including Bourke and Koto, wore many hats. They sketched, and modeled in clay; in fact, the emphasis was on modeling. They often worked into the small hours of the morning with no overtime pay. The clay work was new to Pietsch and by his own admission he never became very adept at it because designers in [[Detroit]], where he had received all his prior training, were not involved in modeling. He strongly believed, however, that designers should be skilled at drawing and rendering as well as modeling.\n[[File:Design for a Studebaker, high-speed express truck, by T. W.

Pietsch decided that the [[Loewy]] situation was much too tenuous and, even as shabby as [[Studebaker]] was at the time, opted to stay with the sinking ship.\n<br />\n[[File:Design for a Studebaker, cab-forward, pick-up truck, by T.

Now, for the first time in his career, Pietsch was unable to immediately step into another automotive design job. After several months looking for work in the [[South Bend]] area, he went to [[Chicago]], where he was soon offered a position by the industrial design firm of Dave Chapman, Incorporated. Commuting weekly by train between [[South Bend]] and [[Chicago]], he was responsible for the account of a department of [[Montgomery Ward]] and Company, which included, among other things, the design of water heaters, water softeners, water pumps, furnaces, air-conditioners, incinerators, and ventilating fans. He also did considerable work on the design of boats, outboard motors, and radios.\n[[File:Sovereign Coupe, black airbrush on red paper, by T. W.

Randal D. Faurot, newly appointed head of styling, called on Pietsch to help rebuild the department, offering him a position as his assistant that he couldn't refuse. In June 1962, however, frustrated and angry over management's abrupt decision to cancel a project that he had worked for many months\u2014the design for an all-new version of the [[Studebaker]] Lark for 1962\u2014Pietsch lost his temper and was fired.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was a tumultuous and abrupt ending to a frustrating, decade-long struggle at [[Studebaker]].\n\n==A last Stint at Chrysler, American Motors, and Retirement: 1962\u20131972==\nOnce again out of work, Pietsch wrote on July 2, 1962, to his old friend Cliff Voss in [[Detroit]], one of \"Exner's boys,\" with whom he had worked at [[Chrysler]] back in the early 1950s. Within a few weeks, Pietsch was back for a third and final hitch with the [[Chrysler Corporation]], but these turned out to be unhappy years. [[Chrysler]] was by now a completely different place. There was no longer the camaraderie and warm atmosphere that had been there before. The studios were now segregated and the old feeling of team effort, along with most of his old friends, was gone. Styling had become a big well-structured and impersonal organization much like the situation at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]].\n<br />\n[[File:Lynx, two-seater convertible, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969.jpg|left|thumb|Lynx, Two-seater Convertible, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969]]\nAdding to the disappointment, Pietsch was assigned from the start to \"interiors,\" which meant dashboards\u2014sketches and more sketches of instruments and instrument panels, reminiscent of the work that had \"bored him to death\" back at [[Ford]] in the late 1940s. Soon this narrowed down to nothing but \"ornamentation,\" in which he was obliged to spend all his time designing nameplates, lettering, and the configuration of numerals on speedometers, tachometers, and other instruments, all extremely tedious work. But he stuck with it for seven and a half years, exclaiming later that he didn't know how he managed to do it for so long.\n[[File:Mercedes Benz Model S Roadster, by T. W.

Pietsch, 1969]]\n\nIn February 1970, Pietsch was caught one last time in one of the many [[Chrysler]] lay-offs, but, lucky once again, he got a call a short time later from [[American Motors]], asking if he'd like to go to work for [[Jeep]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foster|first=P.R.|title=The Story of Jeep, 2nd edition|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2004|isbn=|location=Lola, Wisconsin|pages=132}}</ref> But before Pietsch realized it, he was right back where he had been at [[Chrysler]] the year before, \"doing mostly calibrations of the numerals on dashboard instruments.\" That his graphics were used without change on the instrument panels of the '72 and '73 [[Jeep Wagoneer]] provided little satisfaction. There was nothing about the [[Jeep]] line that interested him. Although he did his best every day to appear enthusiastic, Pietsch was so bored at work that he \"could hardly see straight,\" and he worried also that his health was beginning to fail. In February 1972, after only two years with Jeep, he decided to retire.\n[[File:Theodore Wells Pietsch II, working at home, Highland Park, Michigan, 1938.jpg|thumb|Theodore Wells Pietsch II, working at home, Highland Park, Michigan, 1938]]\n<br />\n==Personal life==\nOn June 24, 1938, Pietsch married Louise Mary Shamlian (December 1, 1914, Watertown, Massachusetts \u2212 January 15, 1987, Seal Beach, California), with whom he had three children: Priscilla Esther Pietsch, born December 22, 1941; [[Theodore Wells Pietsch III]], March 6, 1945; and Louise Jean Pietsch May 11, 1948.

They were kept not only for their value as beasts of burden, but also for their flesh, hides, and [[wool]].\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Lamini.jpg|upright|thumb|left|1776 illustration of various lamines, including the mysterious chilihueque]] \nAlthough they were often compared to sheep by early writers, their affinity to the camel was soon perceived.  They were included in the genus ''[[Camelus]]'' in the ''Systema Naturae'' of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]].  In 1800, [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]] moved the llama, alpaca, and guanaco to the genus ''Llama'', and the vicu\u00f1a to the genus ''[[Vicugna]]''.  Later, the alpaca was transferred to ''Vicugna''. These camelids are, with the two species of true [[camel]]s, the sole [[extant taxon|extant]] representatives of a distinct section of [[Artiodactyla]] (even-toed ungulates) called [[Tylopoda]], or \"hump-footed\", from the peculiar bumps on the soles of their feet. This section consists of a single family, the [[Camelidae]], the other sections of the same great division being the [[Suina]] or [[pig]]s, the Tragulina or [[chevrotain]]s, and the Pecora or true [[ruminants]], to each of which the Tylopoda have some affinity, standing in some respects in a central position between them, sharing some characters from each, but showing special modifications not found in any of the others.\n\nDiscovery of the [[extinction|extinct]] fauna of the American continent of the Paleogene and Neogene periods, starting with the 19th-century paleontologists [[Joseph Leidy|Leidy]], [[Edward Drinker Cope|Cope]], and [[Othniel Charles Marsh|Marsh]], has revealed the early history of this family. Llamas were not always confined to South America; their remains are abundant in the [[Pleistocene]] deposits of the [[Rocky Mountains]] region, and in [[Central America]]; some of these extinct forms were much larger than any now living.\n\nNone of these transitional forms has been found in Old World strata; [[North America]] was the original home of the Tylopoda. Camelids invaded the Old World via [[Beringia]], and South America via the [[Isthmus of Panama]], as part of the [[Great American Interchange]]. The Old World forms were gradually driven southward, perhaps by changes of [[climate]], and having become isolated, they have undergone further special modifications. Meanwhile, the New World members of the family became restricted to [[South America]] following the peopling of the Americas by [[Paleo-Indians]] and the accompanying extinction of the [[megafauna]].\n\nA possible variety is the hueque or [[chilihueque]] that existed in [[Zona Central, Chile|central]] and [[Zona Sur|south-central]] Chile in [[pre-Hispanic]] and early colonial times.

Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: '''primary active transport''' that uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and '''secondary active transport''' that uses an electrochemical gradient. An example of active transport in [[human physiology]] is the uptake of [[glucose]] in the [[gastrointestinal tract|intestines]].\n\n== Active cellular transportation (ACT) ==\n\nUnlike [[passive transport]], which uses the [[kinetic energy]] and natural [[entropy]] of molecules moving down a gradient, active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient, polar repulsion, or other resistance. Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs, such as [[ion]]s, [[glucose]] and [[amino acid]]s.

Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an [[electrochemical]] gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Antiport and symport processes are associated with [[secondary active transport]], meaning that one of the two substances is transported against its concentration gradient, utilizing the energy derived from the transport of another ion (mostly Na{{Sup|+}}, K{{Sup|+}} or H{{Sup|+}} ions) down its concentration gradient.\n\nIf substrate molecules are moving from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration<ref>[http://www.biologycorner.com/bio1/active.html Active Transport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824003030/http://www.biologycorner.com/bio1/active.html |date=August 24, 2011 }}.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>. These charged particles require [[Ion transporter|ion pump]]s or [[ion channel]]s to cross membranes and distribute through the body.\n\nMost of the [[enzyme]]s that perform this type of transport are transmembrane [[ATPase]]s. A primary ATPase universal to all animal life is the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]], which helps to maintain the [[Membrane potential|cell potential]]. The sodium-potassium pump maintains the membrane potential by moving three Na<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cell for every two<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tenth Edition, Campbell's Biology|last=Reese|first=Jane B.|last2=Urry|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Cain|first3=Michael L.|last4=Wasserman|first4=Steven A.|last5=Minorsky|first5=Peter V.|last6=Jackson|first6=Robert B.|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-321-77565-8|location=United States|pages=135|edition=Tenth}}</ref> K<sup>+</sup> ions moved into the cell. Other sources of energy for primary active transport are [[redox]] energy and [[photon]] energy ([[light]]). An example of primary active transport using redox energy is the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] that uses the reduction energy of [[NADH]] to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration). [[Phosphorylation]] of the [[carrier protein]] and the binding of a [[hydrogen ion]] induce a conformational (shape) change that drives the hydrogen ions to transport against the electrochemical gradient. [[Hydrolysis]] of the bound [[phosphate group]] and release of hydrogen ion then restores the carrier to its original conformation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey|title=The Cell: A Molecular Approach|year=2009|publisher=ASM PRESS|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780878933006|page=65}}</ref>\n\n== Types of primary active transporters ==\n\n#[[P-type ATPase]]: [[sodium potassium pump]], [[calcium pump]], [[proton pump]]\n#[[F-ATPase]]: mitochondrial ATP synthase, chloroplast ATP synthase\n# [[V-ATPase]]: vacuolar ATPase\n# ABC ([[ATP binding cassette]]) transporter: MDR, CFTR, etc.\n\nAdenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters ([[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ABC transporters]]) comprise a large and diverse protein family, often functioning as ATP-driven pumps. Usually, there are several domains involved in the overall transporter protein's structure, including two nucleotide-binding domains that constitute the ATP-binding motif and two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that create the \"pore\" component. In broad terms, ABC transporters are involved in the import or export of molecules across a cell membrane; yet within the protein family there is an extensive range of function.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Joohyun|last2=Park|first2=Jiyoung|date=December 6, 2011|title=Plant ABC Transporters|journal= The Arabidopsis Book|volume=9|pages=e0153|doi=10.1199/tab.0153|pmid=22303277|pmc=3268509}}</ref>\n\nIn plants, ABC transporters are often found within cell and organelle membranes, such as the mitochondria, chloroplast, and plasma membrane.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an [[electrochemical]] gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration).

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an [[electrochemical]] gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

An example of primary active transport using redox energy is the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] that uses the reduction energy of [[NADH]] to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration).

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: '''primary active transport''' that uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and '''secondary active transport''' that uses an electrochemical gradient. An example of active transport in [[human physiology]] is the uptake of [[glucose]] in the [[gastrointestinal tract|intestines]].\n\n== Active cellular transportation (ACT) ==\n\nUnlike [[passive transport]], which uses the [[kinetic energy]] and natural [[entropy]] of molecules moving down a gradient, active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient, polar repulsion, or other resistance. Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs, such as [[ion]]s, [[glucose]] and [[amino acid]]s.

In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an [[electrochemical]] gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

Other sources of energy for primary active transport are [[redox]] energy and [[photon]] energy ([[light]]). An example of primary active transport using redox energy is the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] that uses the reduction energy of [[NADH]] to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration).

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: '''primary active transport''' that uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and '''secondary active transport''' that uses an electrochemical gradient.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: '''primary active transport''' that uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and '''secondary active transport''' that uses an electrochemical gradient.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: '''primary active transport''' that uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and '''secondary active transport''' that uses an electrochemical gradient.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane.

Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Antiport and symport processes are associated with [[secondary active transport]], meaning that one of the two substances is transported against its concentration gradient, utilizing the energy derived from the transport of another ion (mostly Na{{Sup|+}}, K{{Sup|+}} or H{{Sup|+}} ions) down its concentration gradient.\n\nIf substrate molecules are moving from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration<ref>[http://www.biologycorner.com/bio1/active.html Active Transport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824003030/http://www.biologycorner.com/bio1/active.html |date=August 24, 2011 }}.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>. These charged particles require [[Ion transporter|ion pump]]s or [[ion channel]]s to cross membranes and distribute through the body.\n\nMost of the [[enzyme]]s that perform this type of transport are transmembrane [[ATPase]]s. A primary ATPase universal to all animal life is the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]], which helps to maintain the [[Membrane potential|cell potential]]. The sodium-potassium pump maintains the membrane potential by moving three Na<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cell for every two<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tenth Edition, Campbell's Biology|last=Reese|first=Jane B.|last2=Urry|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Cain|first3=Michael L.|last4=Wasserman|first4=Steven A.|last5=Minorsky|first5=Peter V.|last6=Jackson|first6=Robert B.|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-321-77565-8|location=United States|pages=135|edition=Tenth}}</ref> K<sup>+</sup> ions moved into the cell. Other sources of energy for primary active transport are [[redox]] energy and [[photon]] energy ([[light]]). An example of primary active transport using redox energy is the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] that uses the reduction energy of [[NADH]] to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration). [[Phosphorylation]] of the [[carrier protein]] and the binding of a [[hydrogen ion]] induce a conformational (shape) change that drives the hydrogen ions to transport against the electrochemical gradient. [[Hydrolysis]] of the bound [[phosphate group]] and release of hydrogen ion then restores the carrier to its original conformation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey|title=The Cell: A Molecular Approach|year=2009|publisher=ASM PRESS|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780878933006|page=65}}</ref>\n\n== Types of primary active transporters ==\n\n#[[P-type ATPase]]: [[sodium potassium pump]], [[calcium pump]], [[proton pump]]\n#[[F-ATPase]]: mitochondrial ATP synthase, chloroplast ATP synthase\n# [[V-ATPase]]: vacuolar ATPase\n# ABC ([[ATP binding cassette]]) transporter: MDR, CFTR, etc.\n\nAdenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters ([[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ABC transporters]]) comprise a large and diverse protein family, often functioning as ATP-driven pumps. Usually, there are several domains involved in the overall transporter protein's structure, including two nucleotide-binding domains that constitute the ATP-binding motif and two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that create the \"pore\" component. In broad terms, ABC transporters are involved in the import or export of molecules across a cell membrane; yet within the protein family there is an extensive range of function.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Joohyun|last2=Park|first2=Jiyoung|date=December 6, 2011|title=Plant ABC Transporters|journal= The Arabidopsis Book|volume=9|pages=e0153|doi=10.1199/tab.0153|pmid=22303277|pmc=3268509}}</ref>\n\nIn plants, ABC transporters are often found within cell and organelle membranes, such as the mitochondria, chloroplast, and plasma membrane.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an [[electrochemical]] gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration).

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an [[electrochemical]] gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

An example of primary active transport using redox energy is the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] that uses the reduction energy of [[NADH]] to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration).

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: '''primary active transport''' that uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and '''secondary active transport''' that uses an electrochemical gradient. An example of active transport in [[human physiology]] is the uptake of [[glucose]] in the [[gastrointestinal tract|intestines]].\n\n== Active cellular transportation (ACT) ==\n\nUnlike [[passive transport]], which uses the [[kinetic energy]] and natural [[entropy]] of molecules moving down a gradient, active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient, polar repulsion, or other resistance. Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs, such as [[ion]]s, [[glucose]] and [[amino acid]]s.

In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an [[electrochemical]] gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

Other sources of energy for primary active transport are [[redox]] energy and [[photon]] energy ([[light]]). An example of primary active transport using redox energy is the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] that uses the reduction energy of [[NADH]] to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration).

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: '''primary active transport''' that uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and '''secondary active transport''' that uses an electrochemical gradient.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: '''primary active transport''' that uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and '''secondary active transport''' that uses an electrochemical gradient.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: '''primary active transport''' that uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and '''secondary active transport''' that uses an electrochemical gradient.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane.

Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Antiport and symport processes are associated with [[secondary active transport]], meaning that one of the two substances is transported against its concentration gradient, utilizing the energy derived from the transport of another ion (mostly Na{{Sup|+}}, K{{Sup|+}} or H{{Sup|+}} ions) down its concentration gradient.\n\nIf substrate molecules are moving from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration<ref>[http://www.biologycorner.com/bio1/active.html Active Transport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824003030/http://www.biologycorner.com/bio1/active.html |date=August 24, 2011 }}.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>. These charged particles require [[Ion transporter|ion pump]]s or [[ion channel]]s to cross membranes and distribute through the body.\n\nMost of the [[enzyme]]s that perform this type of transport are transmembrane [[ATPase]]s. A primary ATPase universal to all animal life is the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]], which helps to maintain the [[Membrane potential|cell potential]]. The sodium-potassium pump maintains the membrane potential by moving three Na<sup>+</sup> ions out of the cell for every two<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tenth Edition, Campbell's Biology|last=Reese|first=Jane B.|last2=Urry|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Cain|first3=Michael L.|last4=Wasserman|first4=Steven A.|last5=Minorsky|first5=Peter V.|last6=Jackson|first6=Robert B.|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-321-77565-8|location=United States|pages=135|edition=Tenth}}</ref> K<sup>+</sup> ions moved into the cell. Other sources of energy for primary active transport are [[redox]] energy and [[photon]] energy ([[light]]). An example of primary active transport using redox energy is the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] that uses the reduction energy of [[NADH]] to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration). [[Phosphorylation]] of the [[carrier protein]] and the binding of a [[hydrogen ion]] induce a conformational (shape) change that drives the hydrogen ions to transport against the electrochemical gradient. [[Hydrolysis]] of the bound [[phosphate group]] and release of hydrogen ion then restores the carrier to its original conformation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey|title=The Cell: A Molecular Approach|year=2009|publisher=ASM PRESS|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780878933006|page=65}}</ref>\n\n== Types of primary active transporters ==\n\n#[[P-type ATPase]]: [[sodium potassium pump]], [[calcium pump]], [[proton pump]]\n#[[F-ATPase]]: mitochondrial ATP synthase, chloroplast ATP synthase\n# [[V-ATPase]]: vacuolar ATPase\n# ABC ([[ATP binding cassette]]) transporter: MDR, CFTR, etc.\n\nAdenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters ([[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ABC transporters]]) comprise a large and diverse protein family, often functioning as ATP-driven pumps. Usually, there are several domains involved in the overall transporter protein's structure, including two nucleotide-binding domains that constitute the ATP-binding motif and two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that create the \"pore\" component. In broad terms, ABC transporters are involved in the import or export of molecules across a cell membrane; yet within the protein family there is an extensive range of function.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Joohyun|last2=Park|first2=Jiyoung|date=December 6, 2011|title=Plant ABC Transporters|journal= The Arabidopsis Book|volume=9|pages=e0153|doi=10.1199/tab.0153|pmid=22303277|pmc=3268509}}</ref>\n\nIn plants, ABC transporters are often found within cell and organelle membranes, such as the mitochondria, chloroplast, and plasma membrane.

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an [[electrochemical]] gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration).

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an [[electrochemical]] gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.

These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].\n\nPlants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>-</sup>) and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) ions exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n==Primary active transport==\n\n[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]\nPrimary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}</ref> Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup>, [[potassium|K]]<sup>+</sup>, [[magnesium|Mg]]<sup>2+</sup>, and [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup>.

An example of primary active transport using redox energy is the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] that uses the reduction energy of [[NADH]] to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient. An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].\n\n===Model of active transport===\n\n[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration).

PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection. To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed. Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds. Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates. Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAdditionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites. Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites. One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1. This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors. NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization. Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Secondary active transport==\n[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]\nIn secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}</ref> Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]).

Sage Vidyajnana expounded their manifestation.<ref name=Cards /> The basis of the Four Tantras is to keep the three bodily humors in balance; (wind [[rlung]], bile [[mkhris pa]], phlegm [[bad kan]].)\n\n* Root Tantra - A general outline of the principles of Tibetan Medicine, it discusses the [[humors]] in the body and their imbalances and their link to illness. The Four Tantra uses visual observation to diagnose predominantly the analysis of the [[pulse]], [[tongue]] and analysis of the urine (in modern terms known as [[urinalysis]] )\n* Exegetical Tantra - This section discusses in greater detail the theory behind the Four Tantras and gives general theory on subjects such as [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[psychopathology]], [[embryology]] and [[Therapy|treatment]].\n* Instructional Tantra -The longest of the Tantras is mainly a practical application of treatment, it explains in detail illnesses and which humoral imbalance which causes the illness. This section also describes their specific treatments.\n* Subsequent Tantra - Diagnosis and therapies, including the preparation of Tibetan medicine and cleansing of the body internally and externally with the use of techniques such as [[moxibustion]], [[massage]] and minor surgeries.\n\nSome believe the Four Tantra to be the authentic teachings of the [[Buddha]] 'Master of remedies' which was translated from [[sanskrit]], others believe it to be solely Tibetan in creation by Yuthog the Elder or Yuthog the Younger. Noting these two theories there remain others sceptical as to its original author.\n\nBelievers in the Buddhist origin of the Four Tantras and how it came to be in Tibet believe it was first taught in India by the buddha when he manifested as the 'Master of Remedies'. The Four Tantra was then in the eighth century translated and offered to [[Padmasambhava]] by [[Vairocana]] and concealed in [[Samye]] monastery. In the second half of the eleventh century it was rediscovered and in the following century it was in the hands of Yuthog the Younger who completed the Four Tantras and included elements of Tibetan medicine, which would explain why there is Indian elements to the Four Tantras.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alphen|first=Jan Van|title=Oriental Medicine An Illustrated Guide to the Asian Arts of Healing|publisher=Serindia Publications|location=London|page=114}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there is clear written instruction in the Four Tantra, the oral transmission of medical knowledge still remained a strong element in Tibetan Medicine, for example oral instruction may have been needed to know how to perform a [[moxibustion]] technique.\n\n==Three principles of function==\nLike other systems of traditional Asian medicine, and in contrast to [[biomedicine]], Tibetan medicine first puts forth a specific definition of health in its theoretical texts.  To have good health, Tibetan medical theory states that it is necessary to maintain balance in the body's three principles of function [often translated as ''[[humors]]'']: ''rLung'' (pron. Loong), ''mKhris-pa'' (pron. Tree-pa) [often translated as ''[[bile]]''], and ''Bad-kan'' (pron.

It considers a single medical doctrine from four perspectives. Sage Vidyajnana expounded their manifestation.<ref name=Cards /> The basis of the Four Tantras is to keep the three bodily humors in balance; (wind [[rlung]], bile [[mkhris pa]], phlegm [[bad kan]].)\n\n* Root Tantra \u2013 A general outline of the principles of Tibetan medicine, it discusses the [[humors]] in the body and their imbalances and their link to illness. The Four Tantra uses visual observation to diagnose predominantly the analysis of the [[pulse]], [[tongue]] and analysis of the urine (in modern terms known as [[urinalysis]] )\n* Exegetical Tantra \u2013 This section discusses in greater detail the theory behind the Four Tantras and gives general theory on subjects such as [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[psychopathology]], [[embryology]] and [[Therapy|treatment]].\n* Instructional Tantra \u2013 The longest of the Tantras is mainly a practical application of treatment, it explains in detail illnesses and which humoral imbalance which causes the illness. This section also describes their specific treatments.\n* Subsequent Tantra \u2013 Diagnosis and therapies, including the preparation of Tibetan medicine and cleansing of the body internally and externally with the use of techniques such as [[moxibustion]], [[massage]] and minor surgeries.\n\nSome believe the Four Tantra to be the authentic teachings of the [[Buddha]] 'Master of remedies' which was translated from [[Sanskrit]], others believe it to be solely Tibetan in creation by Yuthog the Elder or Yuthog the Younger. Noting these two theories there remain others sceptical as to its original author.\n\nBelievers in the Buddhist origin of the Four Tantras and how it came to be in Tibet believe it was first taught in India by the Buddha when he manifested as the 'Master of Remedies'. The Four Tantra was then in the eighth century translated and offered to [[Padmasambhava]] by [[Vairocana]] and concealed in [[Samye]] monastery. In the second half of the eleventh century it was rediscovered and in the following century it was in the hands of Yuthog the Younger who completed the Four Tantras and included elements of Tibetan medicine, which would explain why there is Indian elements to the Four Tantras.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alphen|first=Jan Van|title=Oriental Medicine An Illustrated Guide to the Asian Arts of Healing|publisher=Serindia Publications|location=London|page=114}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there is clear written instruction in the Four Tantra, the oral transmission of medical knowledge still remained a strong element in Tibetan Medicine, for example oral instruction may have been needed to know how to perform a [[moxibustion]] technique.\n\n==Three principles of function==\nLike other systems of traditional Asian medicine, and in contrast to [[biomedicine]], Tibetan medicine first puts forth a specific definition of health in its theoretical texts.  To have good health, Tibetan medical theory states that it is necessary to maintain balance in the body's three principles of function [often translated as ''[[humors]]'']: ''rLung'' (pron. Loong), ''mKhris-pa'' (pron. Tree-pa) [often translated as ''[[bile]]''], and ''Bad-kan'' (pron.

By the late 1950s, three Canadian-based airlines were providing primary scheduled passenger air service at the airport: major air carriers [[Canadian Pacific Air Lines]] (which would become [[CP Air]]) and [[Trans-Canada Air Lines]] (TCA, which would become [[Air Canada]]) as well as regional air carrier [[Pacific Western Airlines]] (PWA). In 1959, Canadian Pacific was operating international service to Europe with four nonstop flights a week flown with [[Douglas DC-6B]] \"Empress\" propliners between Edmonton and [[Amsterdam]] with these flights originating and terminating in [[Vancouver]] and was also operating local domestic service with [[Convair 240]] prop aircraft to [[Grande Prairie, Alberta]] and [[Fort St. John, British Columbia]].<ref name=TimeImg1/> A year earlier in 1958, Trans-Canada was flying [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]] and [[Canadair North Star]] (a Canadian produced version of the [[Douglas DC-4]]) propliners in addition to [[Vickers Viscount]] turboprops on nonstop services to [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Saskatoon]] as well as direct, no change of plane flights to [[Montreal]].<ref name=TimeImg5/> According to the June 1, 1958 Trans-Canada Air Lines system timetable, the air carrier was also operating five nonstop departures a day to [[Calgary]] with Viscount propjets.

Pacific Western flew its \"Chieftain Airbus\" shuttle service between the airport and [[Calgary]] (YYC) for many years with the 737 and in 1976 was operating up to fourteen Boeing 737-200 departures a day nonstop from ECCA to YYC in addition to operating direct 737 jet flights into the airport from [[Castlegar, BC]], [[Cranbrook, BC]], [[Dawson Creek, BC]], [[Fort Chipewyan]], AB, [[High Level]], AB, [[Kamloops, BC]], [[Kelowna, BC]], [[Peace River]], AB, [[Penticton, BC]], [[Prince George, BC]], [[Uranium City]], SK and [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]].<ref name=OAG1976/> The runway lengths at ECCA mandated the absolute maximum performance characteristics of the Boeing 737-200 jetliner due to its weight; however, the extreme wear caused by utilising this airfield and pushing these limits was a concern. Other jet service came in the form of the [[British Aerospace]] [[BAe 146-200]] as Air Canada Connector flights operated by [[Air BC]] on behalf of [[Air Canada]]. [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] jets in Air Canada livery operated briefly out of ECCA in the mid 1980s but left due to field/weight limitations.

In 2008 Champ Car merged with the [[Indy Racing League]], and became the [[IndyCar Series]]. The [[NASCAR Canadian Tire Series]] also raced at the speedway in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012. Beginning with the July 2011 event, the track layout was reconfigured to use a more northeasterly section of the airport, including Runway 16/34 (which had been permanently closed).<ref name=EdJournal/><ref name=IndyCar/>\n\n==Obsolescence and closure==\n===Debate===\nThe fate of the Edmonton City Centre Airport (ECCA) was fiercely debated for decades, beginning in the 1950s.\n\nTo accommodate demands for ever-increasing range, new generations of jet aircraft became increasingly larger and heavier,  resulting in the need for a longer set of [[runway]]s. It became clear that it would be economically and in many cases physically impossible to accommodate modern jet aircraft at ECCA. With no ability to expand the runways, a search began for a site for construction of a new international airport. Edmonton entered into fifty years of airport debates shaped by issues of logistics, transportation, and regional disparities.\n\nTo the north of the city, a World War II military base (now [[CFB Edmonton]]) had been built at Namao by the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. In the 1950s, the base was expanded to handle [[Strategic Air Command]] military bomber aircraft, including the longest runway in Canada.\n\n[[Leduc, Alberta]], located {{convert|14|NM|lk=in|abbr=on}} south by southwest of downtown Edmonton,<ref name=CFS/> was chosen as the site for the [[Edmonton International Airport]] {{Airport codes|YEG|CYEG}} which opened in 1960.\n\nIt was initially decided that ECCA would be closed in 1963, upon completion of a new passenger terminal at Edmonton International. However, the issue was reexamined by consultants,<ref name=Fisher/> and particularly in view of the unforeseen development of [[regional airliner]] service at ECCA, especially to [[Calgary]], \nthe City of Edmonton decided to keep ECCA open and operate both airports.\n\nIn Edmonton's [[1992 Edmonton municipal election|1992 municipal election]], the City of Edmonton held a plebiscite, the Edmonton Municipal Airport Referendum. The result of the referendum was that Bylaw No. 10,205, which kept ECCA open to all traffic that the field could legally handle, was approved with a vote of 54%.\n\nIn the [[1995 Edmonton municipal election|1995 election]], a second plebiscite was put forth to the citizens of Edmonton asking if the bylaw should be repealed on the basis of consolidating all scheduled traffic at Edmonton International. Determination of whether or not to close the airport was not given as an option. 77% of voters approved the proposed version, and in June 1996, the consolidation process was finalized.\n\n===Closure===\nOn July 8, 2009, the city council decided on a phased closure of the airport. The [[Alberta Aviation Museum]] and some non-aviation institutions were to remain, with some land transferred to [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]], and the rest converted to a primarily residential development.<ref name=CityCentre/>\n\nThe north-south runway, Runway 16/34, was to be the first runway closed. The closure was postponed until after the Indy and Airfest events of 2010.<ref name=Liebrecht/> On August 3, 2010, Runway 16/34 was closed to air traffic with a [[NOTAM|Notice to Airmen]] being issued at 3:00&nbsp;am that morning.<ref name=Gavriloff/>\n\nClosure of the remaining runway, Runway 12/30, was announced at an Edmonton City Council meeting on September 26, 2013. Licenses for scheduled air service were not renewed.\n\nOn the afternoon of November 30, 2013, the last airplane to leave the airfield was a [[Cessna 172]], owned and piloted by a local. Weather prevented a pair of [[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet|CF-18 fighter jets]] from performing a [[touch-and-go landing]] as the ceremonial last takeoff.<ref name=Theobald/> Shortly afterwards, ERAA placed barricades on Runway 12/30 to prevent access, and markers were placed to clearly signal to pilots that it was closed.<ref name=Ramsay2013/>\n\nOn February 21, 2015, a [[Pipistrel Virus]] aircraft C-FCDZ flying over the site of the airport suffered a propeller failure, resulting in an unplanned landing on the airport grounds using the plane's [[ballistic parachute]].<ref name=Ramsay2015/>\n\n{{Anchor|Blatchford community}}\n\n==Blatchford community==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

The field maintained 24/7 operations, with the strictest noise regulations in effect from 10:00 pm to 7:00 am local time.\n\n===Facilities and amenities===\nFor private and corporate aviation, there were two [[fixed-base operator]]s (FBO) on site, located on the west side of the airfield off Taxiway A.\n\nOn-site amenities included the Alberta Aviation Museum, two hotels, and a cafeteria in the [[Edmonton Flying Club]]'s building.\n\nA flight school was operated at Centennial Flight Centre.<ref name=Ramsay2015/>\n\nPrivate [[air ambulance]]s used the [[Esso]] Avitat hangar to store their ground support units.

in [[Alberta]], Canada.\n\nIt was bordered by [[Alberta Highway 16|Yellowhead Trail]] to the north, [[Kingsway, Edmonton|Kingsway]] to the south, 121 Street to the west, and the [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]] (NAIT) and Jefferson armouries to the east. It encompassed approximately {{convert|144|acre}} of land just north of the city centre of Edmonton.\n\nThe airport was originally called Blatchford Field, named for former mayor [[Kenny Blatchford|Kenneth Alexander Blatchford]]. It later was known as the Edmonton Municipal Airport, then as Edmonton Industrial Airport,<ref name=OAG1976/> and then Edmonton City Centre Airport (ECCA), finally ending as Blatchford Field at Edmonton City Centre Airport. Over the years, the three letter code \"YXD\" {{Airport codes|YXD|CYXD}} continued to be used for the airport by all of the airlines serving the airfield.\n\nThe airport was closed in November 2013, and {{As of|2018|lc=y}}, the land is being redeveloped by the City of Edmonton as a planned community called [[#Blatchford community|Blatchford]].\n\n==Early history==\nThe airport has a rich [[aviation]] history, being the first licensed airfield in Canada (1929).<ref name=EdmontonPop/> Characters such as [[Wilfrid R. \"Wop\" May|Wop May]], a World War I fighter ace and bush pilot, helped pioneer aviation in Alberta and [[Northern Canada]], further solidifying Blatchford Field as the \"Gateway to the North\".\n\nAlong with May, the Mayor of Edmonton, [[Kenny Blatchford]], had played a key role in establishing the airport in 1927.<ref name=AviationMuseum/> Blatchford's son, [[Howard Peter Blatchford]], became a fighter ace in WWII.\n\n[[Wiley Post]] landed at the airport during both of his circumnavigations.\n\n==RCAF Station Edmonton==\nThe airport served as a military airbase during [[World War II]], when it was a major stop-over on the [[Northwest Staging Route]] and hosted two [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] schools.\n\nNo. 2 Air Observer School (AOS), operated by Canadian Airways and Canadian Pacific Airlines, opened at RCAF Station Edmonton on August 5, 1940. Later that year, on November 11, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) established No. 16 Elementary Flying Training School (EFTS), operated by the Edmonton Flying Club; this school was closed on July 17, 1942 to allow for an expansion of No. 2 Air Observer School. Upon winding down of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, No. 2 AOS was closed on July 14, 1944.<ref name=\"hatch\">{{cite book\n | last1 = Hatch\n | first1 = F.

By the late 1950s, three Canadian-based airlines were providing primary scheduled passenger air service at the airport: major air carriers [[Canadian Pacific Air Lines]] (which would become [[CP Air]]) and [[Trans-Canada Air Lines]] (TCA, which would become [[Air Canada]]) as well as regional air carrier [[Pacific Western Airlines]] (PWA). In 1959, Canadian Pacific was operating international service to Europe with four nonstop flights a week flown with [[Douglas DC-6B]] \"Empress\" propliners between Edmonton and [[Amsterdam]] with these flights originating and terminating in [[Vancouver]] and was also operating local domestic service with [[Convair 240]] prop aircraft to [[Grande Prairie, Alberta]] and [[Fort St. John, British Columbia]].<ref name=TimeImg1/> A year earlier in 1958, Trans-Canada was flying [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]] and [[Canadair North Star]] (a Canadian produced version of the [[Douglas DC-4]]) propliners in addition to [[Vickers Viscount]] turboprops on nonstop services to [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Saskatoon]] as well as direct, no change of plane flights to [[Montreal]].<ref name=TimeImg5/> According to the June 1, 1958 Trans-Canada Air Lines system timetable, the air carrier was also operating five nonstop departures a day to [[Calgary]] with Viscount propjets. Pacific Western was operating regional services from the airport in 1959 with [[Curtiss C-46]] and [[Douglas DC-4]] prop aircraft to a number of Canadian destinations located north of Edmonton including Fort McMurray, Fort Smith, Fort Resolution, Fort Vermilion, Hay River, Inuvik, Norman Wells, Peace River, Uranium City, and Yellowknife.<ref name=TimeImg6/>\n\nBy 1964, Pacific Western had expanded its domestic service from the airport with the addition of regional flights to Cambridge Bay, Coppermine, Dawson Creek, Fort Simpson and Wrigley as well as to the [[Resolute Bay Airport]] in the [[Arctic]] which is the northernmost destination in Canada served by scheduled airline flights.<ref name=TimeImg7/> By 1968, Pacific Western had introduced [[Convair 640]] turboprop aircraft (which the airline called the \"Javelin Jet-Prop\") on many of its flights from the airport and had also introduced its \"Chieftain Airbus\" shuttle service linking Edmonton and Calgary operated with [[Douglas DC-6]] propliners with six round trip nonstop flights a day between the two cities.<ref name=TimeImg8/> According to the June 24, 1968 Pacific Western system timetable, Douglas DC-6 and DC-6B passenger aircraft as well as all-cargo [[DC-4]] aircraft were also being operated by the airline to destinations located north of Edmonton. The jet age arrived at the airport in 1969 when Pacific Western introduced [[Boeing 737-200]] jetliners with nonstop flights to Calgary, Fort Smith and Hay River with direct, no change of plane 737 jet service to Vancouver, Yellowknife, Kamloops, Kelowna, Cranbrook, Penticton, Inuvik and Norman Wells.<ref name=TimeImg9/>\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\n[[File:Edmonton City Centre Airport.jpg|thumb|Edmonton City Centre Airport]]\nSeveral types of jet passenger aircraft were operated into ECCA, notably the [[Boeing 737-200]]. As noted above, these 737 flights were initially operated by [[Pacific Western Airlines]]<ref name=OAG1976/> followed by its successor [[Canadian Airlines]] (formerly [[CP Air]]) from the initial purchase of these aircraft in the late 1960s up until the merger of Pacific Western with Canadian with the latter continuing to operate 737 flights into the airport. Pacific Western flew its \"Chieftain Airbus\" shuttle service between the airport and [[Calgary]] (YYC) for many years with the 737 and in 1976 was operating up to fourteen Boeing 737-200 departures a day nonstop from ECCA to YYC in addition to operating direct 737 jet flights into the airport from [[Castlegar, BC]], [[Cranbrook, BC]], [[Dawson Creek, BC]], [[Fort Chipewyan]], AB, [[High Level]], AB, [[Kamloops, BC]], [[Kelowna, BC]], [[Peace River]], AB, [[Penticton, BC]], [[Prince George, BC]], [[Uranium City]], SK and [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]].<ref name=OAG1976/> The runway lengths at ECCA mandated the absolute maximum performance characteristics of the Boeing 737-200 jetliner due to its weight; however, the extreme wear caused by utilising this airfield and pushing these limits was a concern. Other jet service came in the form of the [[British Aerospace]] [[BAe 146-200]] as Air Canada Connector flights operated by [[Air BC]] on behalf of [[Air Canada]]. [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] jets in Air Canada livery operated briefly out of ECCA in the mid 1980s but left due to field/weight limitations. [[Time Air]] and its later brand of [[Canadian Regional Airlines|Canadian Regional]] operated [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]] twin jets, while [[Echo Bay Mines Limited]] operated a private passenger/cargo [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-100]] [[combi aircraft]] trijet from the field for several years. Time Air previously operated [[Fokker F27 Friendship]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] and [[Short 330]] turboprop aircraft from the airfield during the 1970s<ref name=OAG1976/> as well as [[Convair 580]], [[Convair 640]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7]] and [[de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8]] turboprops during the 1980s.<ref name=Sched11/> Both the Twin Otter and Dash 7 have short takeoff and landing ([[STOL]]) capabilities so runway length was not an issue for these particular aircraft types. Besides operating flights with 737 jets, Pacific Western also operated [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] turboprop service from the airport during the mid 1970s with nonstop flights to [[Fort Chipewyan]], [[Fort McMurray]] and [[Peace River]] in [[Alberta]] province as well as direct to [[Fort Smith, NWT]] and [[Yellowknife, NWT]].<ref name=Sched12/>\n\nBy early 1985, Pacific Western was operating eighteen nonstop [[Boeing 737-200]] flights every weekday from the airport to Calgary via its \"Chieftain Airbus\" shuttle schedule linking the two cities.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 15, 1985 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Calgary flight schedules (OAG)</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2018}} There were also two other airlines competing with Pacific Western at this time on the Edmonton (YXD) - Calgary (YYC) nonstop route:  [[Air Canada]] operating [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] jets with two flights on weekdays and [[Time Air]] operating [[de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7]] turboprops with three  flights on weekdays for a combined total of 23 flights every weekday operated by the three airlines.<ref name=\"departedflights.com\">http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 15, 1985 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Calgary flight schedules</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2018}}  In contrast, there were only four nonstop jet flights every weekday from Calgary (YYC) to [[Edmonton International Airport]] (YEG) at this same time in 1985:  one flight each respectively operated by Air Canada and [[CP Air]] and two flights operated by Pacific Western.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 15, 1985 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Edmonton International Airport flight schedules</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2018}}  Also in contrast at this same time, there was only one nonstop flight a day operated on the weekdays from Edmonton International to Calgary with this service being flown by [[CP Air]].<ref name=\"departedflights.com\"/>{{Failed verification|date=December 2018}}  Other airlines serving ECCA as this time were [[Norcanair]] with [[Fairchild F-27]] turboprop service nonstop from [[Lloydminster]] and direct from [[Saskatoon]], and [[Southern Frontier Airlines]] with nonstop [[Beechcraft 99]] commuter turboprop service from [[Cold Lake, AB]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 15, 1985 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Edmonton Municipal Airport flight schedules</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2018}} According to the April 28, 1985 Pacific Western system timetable, in addition to its nonstop flights to Calgary the airline was operating direct, no change of plane 737 jet service from the airport to the Canadian destinations of [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatoon]], [[Cranbrook, BC]], [[Fort McMurray]], [[Kamloops]], [[Kelowna]] and [[Penticton]].<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, April 28, 1985 Pacific Western Airlines system timetable</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2018}} Pacific Western had become an all-jet air carrier with a fleet of 737 aircraft at this time.

In 2008 Champ Car merged with the [[Indy Racing League]], and became the [[IndyCar Series]]. The [[NASCAR Canadian Tire Series]] also raced at the speedway in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012. Beginning with the July 2011 event, the track layout was reconfigured to use a more northeasterly section of the airport, including Runway 16/34 (which had been permanently closed).<ref name=EdJournal/><ref name=IndyCar/>\n\n==Obsolescence and closure==\n===Debate===\nThe fate of the Edmonton City Centre Airport (ECCA) was fiercely debated for decades, beginning in the 1950s.\n\nTo accommodate demands for ever-increasing range, new generations of jet aircraft became increasingly larger and heavier,  resulting in the need for a longer set of [[runway]]s. It became clear that it would be economically and in many cases physically impossible to accommodate modern jet aircraft at ECCA. With no ability to expand the runways, a search began for a site for construction of a new international airport. Edmonton entered into fifty years of airport debates shaped by issues of logistics, transportation, and regional disparities.\n\nTo the north of the city, a World War II military base (now [[CFB Edmonton]]) had been built at Namao by the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. In the 1950s, the base was expanded to handle [[Strategic Air Command]] military bomber aircraft, including the longest runway in Canada.\n\n[[Leduc, Alberta]], located {{convert|14|NM|lk=in|abbr=on}} south by southwest of downtown Edmonton,<ref name=CFS/> was chosen as the site for the [[Edmonton International Airport]] {{Airport codes|YEG|CYEG}} which opened in 1960.\n\nIt was initially decided that ECCA would be closed in 1963, upon completion of a new passenger terminal at Edmonton International. However, the issue was reexamined by consultants,<ref name=Fisher/> and particularly in view of the unforeseen development of [[regional airliner]] service at ECCA, especially to [[Calgary]], \nthe City of Edmonton decided to keep ECCA open and operate both airports.\n\nIn Edmonton's [[1992 Edmonton municipal election|1992 municipal election]], the City of Edmonton held a plebiscite, the Edmonton Municipal Airport Referendum. The result of the referendum was that Bylaw No. 10,205, which kept ECCA open to all traffic that the field could legally handle, was approved with a vote of 54%.\n\nIn the [[1995 Edmonton municipal election|1995 election]], a second plebiscite was put forth to the citizens of Edmonton asking if the bylaw should be repealed on the basis of consolidating all scheduled traffic at Edmonton International. Determination of whether or not to close the airport was not given as an option. 77% of voters approved the proposed version, and in June 1996, the consolidation process was finalized.\n\n===Closure===\nOn July 8, 2009, the city council decided on a phased closure of the airport. The [[Alberta Aviation Museum]] and some non-aviation institutions were to remain, with some land transferred to [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]], and the rest converted to a primarily residential development.<ref name=CityCentre/>\n\nThe north-south runway, Runway 16/34, was to be the first runway closed. The closure was postponed until after the Indy and Airfest events of 2010.<ref name=Liebrecht/> On August 3, 2010, Runway 16/34 was closed to air traffic with a [[NOTAM|Notice to Airmen]] being issued at 3:00&nbsp;am that morning.<ref name=Gavriloff/>\n\nClosure of the remaining runway, Runway 12/30, was announced at an Edmonton City Council meeting on September 26, 2013. Licenses for scheduled air service were not renewed.\n\nOn the afternoon of November 30, 2013, the last airplane to leave the airfield was a [[Cessna 172]], owned and piloted by a local. Weather prevented a pair of [[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet|CF-18 fighter jets]] from performing a [[touch-and-go landing]] as the ceremonial last takeoff.<ref name=Theobald/> Shortly afterwards, ERAA placed barricades on Runway 12/30 to prevent access, and markers were placed to clearly signal to pilots that it was closed.<ref name=Ramsay2013/>\n\nOn February 21, 2015, a [[Pipistrel Virus]] aircraft C-FCDZ flying over the site of the airport suffered a propeller failure, resulting in an unplanned landing on the airport grounds using the plane's [[ballistic parachute]].<ref name=Ramsay2015/>\n\n{{Anchor|Blatchford community}}\n\n==Blatchford community==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

By the mid 1970s it was clear that reducing illness, death, and rising health care costs could best be achieved through a focus on health promotion and disease prevention.  At the heart of the new approach was the role of a health educator <ref name = \"Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education\">Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, 2009.</ref>  A health educator is \"a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive to the health of individuals, groups, and communities\" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p.&nbsp;100).  In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985). A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996). These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below. The Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis (HESPA II 2020) produced \"a new hierarchical model with 8 Areas of Responsibility, 35 Competencies, and 193 Sub-competencies\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nchec.org/news/posts/hespa2|title=Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis II 2020 Validates and Reveals Eight Areas of Responsibility for Health Education Specialists|website=www.nchec.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>. \n\n[[File:Healthed mindmap.jpg]]\n\n===Responsibility I: Assessing Individual and Community Needs for Health Education===\n*Provides the foundation for program planning\n*Determines what health problems might exist in any given groups\n*Includes determination of community resources available to address the problem\n*Community Empowerment encourages the population to take ownership of their health problems\n*Includes careful data collection and analysis\n*It is essential for healthy life\n*to find out the vital health statistics in community\n*The planned activity should be achievable and take into consideration the financial, personnel, and time constraints on the resources you have available. you should not plan unachievable activities.\n\n===Responsibility II: Plan Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs===\n\n*Actions are based on the needs assessment done for the community (see Responsibility I)\n*Involves the development of goals and objectives which are specific and measurable\n*Interventions are developed that will meet the goals and objectives\n*According to Rule of Sufficiency, strategies are implemented which are sufficiently robust, effective enough, and have a reasonable chance of meeting stated objectives\n\n===Responsibility III: Implement Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs===\n\n*Implementation is based on a thorough understanding of the priority population\n*Utilize a wide range of educational methods and techniques\n\n===Responsibility IV: Conduct Evaluation and Research Related to Health Education===\n\n*Depending on the setting, utilize tests, surveys, observations, tracking epidemiological data, or other methods of data collection\n*Health Educators make use of research to improve their practices.\n\n===Responsibility V: Administer Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs===\n\n*Administration is generally a function of the more experienced practitioner\n*Involves facilitating cooperation among personnel, both within and between programs\n\n===Responsibility VI: Serve as a Health Education Resource Person===\n*Involves skills to access needed resources, and establish effective consultative relationships.\n\n===Role VII: Communicate and Advocate for Health and Health Education===\n\n*Translates scientific language into understandable information\n*Address diverse audience in diverse settings\n*Formulates and support rules, policies and legislation\n*Advocate for the profession of health education\n\n==Motivation==\nEducation for health begins with people. It hopes to motivate them with whatever interests they may have in improving their [[living conditions]]. Its aim come is to develop in them a sense of responsibility for health conditions for themselves as individuals, as members of families, and as communities. In communicable disease control, health education commonly includes an appraisal of what is known by a population about a disease, an assessment of habits and attitudes of the people as they relate to spread and frequency of the disease, and the presentation of specific means to remedy observed deficiencies.<ref>[http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm Washington State Department of Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107002810/http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm |date=2010-01-07 }}</ref>\n\nHealth education is also an effective tool that helps improve health in developing nations. It not only teaches prevention and basic health knowledge but also conditions ideas that re-shape everyday habits of people with unhealthy lifestyles in developing countries. This type of conditioning not only affects the immediate recipients of such education but also future generations will benefit from an improved and properly cultivated ideas about health that will eventually be ingrained with widely spread health education. Moreover, besides physical health prevention, health education can also provide more aid and help people deal healthier with situations of extreme stress, anxiety, depression or other emotional disturbances to lessen the impact of these sorts of mental and emotional constituents, which can consequently lead to detrimental physical effects.,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bundy D. |author2=Guya H.L. | year = 1996 | title = Schools for health, education and the school-age child | url = | journal = Parasitology Today | volume = 12 | issue = 8| pages = 1\u201316 | doi=10.1016/0169-4758(96)30011-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kann L. |author2=Brener N.D. |author3=Allensworth D.D. | year = 2001 | title = Health education: Results from the School Health Policies and Programs Study 2000 | url = | journal = Journal of School Health | volume = 71 | issue = 7| pages = 266\u2013278 | doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2001.tb03504.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.307.2181 | pmid = 11822302 }}</ref>\n\n==Credentialing==\n\nCredentialing is the process by which the qualifications of licensed professionals, organizational members or an organization are determined by assessing the individuals or group background and legitimacy through a standardized process. Accreditation, licensure, or certifications are all forms of credentialing.\n\nIn 1978, Helen Cleary, the president of the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (SOPHE) started the process of certification of health educators. Prior to this, there was no certification for individual health educators, with exception to the licensing for school health educators.  The only accreditation available in this field was for school health and public health professional preparation programs.\n\nHer initial response was to incorporate experts in the field and to promote funding for the process. The director if the Division of Associated Health Professions in the Bureau of Health Manpower of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Thomas Hatch, became interested in the project. To ensure that the commonalities between health educators across the spectrum of professions would be sufficient enough to create a set of standards, Dr. Cleary spent a great amount of time to create the first conference called the Bethesda Conference. In attendance were interested professionals who covered the possibility of creating credentialing within the profession.\n\nWith the success of the conference and the consensus that the standardization of the profession was vital, those who organized the conference created the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators. Funding for this endeavor became available in January 1979, and role delineation became a realistic vision for the future.  They presented the framework for the system in 1981 and published entry-level criteria in 1983. Seven areas of responsibility, 29 areas of competency and 79 sub-competencies were required of health education professionals for approximately 20 years for entry-level educators.\n\nIn 1986 a second conference was held in Bethesda, Maryland to further the credentialing process. In June 1988, the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators became the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC). Their mission was to improve development of the field by promoting, preparing and certifying health education specialists. The NCHEC has three division boards that included preparation, professional development and certification of health educator professionals. The third board, which is called the Division Board of Certification of Health Education Specialist (DBCHES), has the responsibility of developing and administering the CHES exam. An initial certification process allowed 1,558 individuals to be chartered into the program through a recommendation and application process. The first exam was given in 1990.\n\nIn order for a candidate to sit for an exam they must have either a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree from an accredited institution, and an official transcript that shows a major in health education, Community Health Education, Public Health Education, or [[school health education|School Health Education]], etc. The transcript will be accepted if it reflects 25 semester hours or 37 quarter hours in health education preparation and covers the 7 responsibilities covered in the framework.\n\nIn 1998 a project called the Competencies Update Project (CUP) began. The purpose of the CUP project was to up-date entry-level requirements and to develop advanced-level competences. Through research the CUP project created the requirements for three levels, which included entry-level, Advanced I and Advanced II educators.<ref>Cottrell, R. R., Girvan, J. T., & McKenzie, J. F. (2009). Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education. New York: Benjamin Cummings.</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Patterson S. M. |author2=Vitello E. M. | year = 2006 | title = Key Influences Shaping Health Education: Progress Toward Accreditation | url = | journal = The Health Education Monograph Series | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 14\u201319 }}</ref>\n\nRecently the Master Certified Health Education Specialist (MCHES) was created. The MCHES exam measures the knowledge of the advanced levels and sub levels of the Seven Areas of Responsibilities. The first MCHES exam was given in October 2011.\n\nIn order to be eligible to take the MCHES exam you must have at least a master's degree in health education or related discipline along with a least 25 credit hours related to health education.  In addition, five years of documented information of practice in health education and two recommendations of past/present supervisors must be provided. A vitae/resume must also be submitted.\n\nThe Competency Update Project (CUP), 1998-2004 revealed that there were higher levels of health education practitioners, which is the reasoning for the advancements for the MCHES. Many health educators felt that the current CHES credential was an entry-level exam.\n\n==Teaching==\n\nIn the [[United States]] some forty states require the teaching of health education. A comprehensive health education curriculum consists of planned learning experiences which will help students achieve desirable attitudes and practices related to critical health issues. Some of these are: [[emotional health]] and a positive [[self image]]; appreciation, respect for, and care of the [[human body]] and its [[vital organ]]s; [[physical fitness]]; health issues of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]]; health misconceptions and myths; effects of exercise on the body systems and on general well being; [[nutrition]] and [[weight control]]; [[sexual relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the scientific, social, and economic aspects of community and ecological health; [[communicable disease|communicable]] and [[degenerative disease]]s including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s; [[disaster preparedness]]; safety and driver education; factors in the environment and how those factors affect an individual's or population's [[Environmental health]] (ex: air quality, water quality, food sanitation); [[life skills]]; choosing professional medical and health services; and choices of health careers.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics share that 99% of public schools conduct some type of nutrition education. For each grade from kindergarten through eighth, 50 percent or more of all schools have district or state requirements for students to receive nutrition education. However, only 40 percent have these requirements for ninth and tenth grades; and about 20 percent for eleventh and twelfth grades.  The issue still lies with the content and thoroughness that is being taught.  Topics taught in a most all of the schools are: the relationship between diet and health, finding and choosing healthy foods, nutrients and their food sources, the Food Guide Pyramid, and the Dietary Guidelines and goals. However, with the exception of the Food Guide Pyramid, less than half of schools cover these topics thoroughly.  Overall, schools focus on increasing students\u2019 knowledge about what is meant by good nutrition, with less emphasis on influencing students\u2019 motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors. Four of the five topics covered by more than 90 percent of all schools are related to knowledge. With the exception of finding and choosing healthy foods, less than one-third of schools provide thorough coverage of topics related to motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors.  Not often are there teachers specific for nutrition.  Most of the time the nutrition content is taught by the primary teacher. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96852.pdf\n\n==National Health Education Standards==\n\nThe National Health Education Standards (NHES) are written expectations for what students should know and be able to do by grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to promote personal, family, and community health. The standards provide a framework for curriculum development and selection, instruction, and student assessment in health education.  The performance indicators articulate specifically what students should know or be able to do in support of each standard by the conclusion of each of the following grade spans: Pre-K\u2013Grade 12. The performance indicators serve as a blueprint for organizing student assessment.<ref>Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. (2007). National Health Education Standards.

Various Public Health and Health Education organizations such as the American Association of Health Education (AAHE), the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), SOPHE, and others collaborated year after year to devise a unified standard of ethics that health educators would be held accountable to professionally.  In 1995, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) proposed a profession-wide standard at the conference: Health Education Profession in the Twenty-First Century: Setting the Stage.  Post-conference, an ethics task force was developed with the purpose of solidifying and unifying proposed ethical standards.  The document was eventually unanimously approved and ratified by all involved organizations in November 1999 and has since then been used as the standard for practicing health educators.\n\n\"The Code of Ethics that has evolved from this long and arduous process is not seen as a completed project. Rather, it is envisioned as a living document that will continue to evolve as the practice of Health Education changes to meet the challenges of the new millennium.\" <ref>Coalition of National Health Education Organizations.

These individuals play a crucial role in many organizations in various settings to improve our nations health. Just as a Community health educator works work toward population health, a school Health educator generally teaches in our Schools. A community health educator is typically focused on their immediate community striving to serve the public.\n\n'''Health Care Settings''': these include hospitals (for-profit and public), medical care clinics, home health agencies, HMOs and PPOs. Here, a health educator teaches employees how to be healthy. [[Patient education]] positions are far and few between because insurance companies do not cover the costs. [1]\n\n'''Public Health Agencies''': are official, tax funded, government agencies. They provide police protection, educational systems, as well as clean air and water. Public health departments provide health services and are organized by a city, county, state, or federal government. [2]\n\n'''School Health Education''': involves all strategies, activities, and services offered by, in, or in association with schools that are designed to promote students' physical, emotional, and social development. School health involves teaching students about health and health related behaviors. Curriculum and programs are based on the school's expectations and health. [3]\n\n'''Non Profit Voluntary Health Agencies''': are created by concerned citizens to deal with health needs not met by governmental agencies. Missions include public education, professional education, patient education, research, direct services and support to or for people directly affected by a specific health or medical problem. Usually funded by such means as private donations, grants, and fund-raisers.[4]\n\n'''Higher Education''': typically two types of positions health educators hold including academic, or faculty or health educator in a student health service or wellness center. As a faculty member, the health educator typically has three major responsibilities: teaching, community and professional service, and scholarly research. As a health educator in a university health service or wellness center, the major responsibility is to plan, implement, and evaluate health promotion and education programs for program participants. [5]\n\n'''Work site Health Promotion''': is a combination of educational, organizational and environmental activities designed to improve the health and safety of employees and their families. These work site wellness programs offer an additional setting for health educators and allow them to reach segments of the population that are not easily reached through traditional community health programs. Some work site health promotion activities include: smoking cessation, stress management, bulletin boards, newsletters, and much more. [6]\n\n'''Independent Consulting and Government Contracting''': international, national, regional, state, and local organizations contract with independent consultants for many reasons. They may be hired to assess individual and community needs for health education; plan, implement, administer and evaluate health education strategies; conduct research; serve as health education resource person; and or communicate about and advocate for health and health education. Government contractors are often behind national health education programs, government reports, public information web sites and telephone lines, media campaigns, conferences, and health education materials.

She earned her bachelor's and master's degree at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] and received her Doctorate in educational psychology at Berkeley. She is a founder of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley. Dr. Nysawnder pursued her interest in public health at the Works Progress Administration during the depression. She served with the Federal Works Agency contributing to the establishment of nursery schools and child care centers to accommodate young mothers working in defense plants. She set up these centers in 15 northeastern states.  This did not happen quickly so she advocated all over the nation to train people to act as foster parents for the children of working women. Dr. Nyswander became the director of the City health Center in [[Astoria, Queens]] in 1939.  She spent her time as director promoting the idea of New York City keeping an eye on the health of children.  They would do this by keeping records that would follow them to whatever school they might move to.  She wrote \"Solving School Health Problems\" which is an analysis of the health issues in New York children.  This is still used in public health education courses today.<ref>{{cite web|author=RICHARD SEVEROPublished: December 29, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/29/us/dorothy-bird-nyswander-104-promoted-public-health-education.html?sec=&spon= |title=Dorothy Bird Nyswander, 104; Promoted Public Health Education - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1998-12-29 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref>\n\n'''Mayhew Derryberry'''\n\nDr. Derryberry was born December 25, 1902 and earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry and mathematics at the [[University of Tennessee]].  He began his career in 1926 with the American Child Health Association as the director of one of the first large-scale studies of the health status of the nation's schoolchildren.  A year after his work with the American Child Health Association he earned his master's degree in education and psychology at Columbia University.  He then went on to earn his doctorate and moved to the [[New York City]] Health Department as the secretary to the sanitary superintendent. He finally moved to Washington DC and joined the US Public Health Service as a senior public health analyst. He became chief of the Public Health Service and began assembling a team of behavioral scientists. They studied the nexus of behavior, social factors, and disease. Two scientists and Derryberry conducted the study of the role of health beliefs in explaining utilization of public health screening services. This work contributed to the development of the Health Belief Model. This provided an important theoretical foundation for modern health education. His legacy was very important because he engaged behavioral and social scientists in the problems of public health and gave importance to the role of that health education plays on human health.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mayhew Derryberry: Pioneer of Health Education |date=2003-08-27 |pmc=1448259 | pmid=14998797 |volume=94 |issue=3 |journal=Am J Public Health |pages=370\u20131 |doi=10.2105/ajph.94.3.370|last1=Allegrante |first1=John P. |last2=Sleet |first2=David A. |last3=McGinnis |first3=J.

After completing her schooling, Elena Sliepcevich worked at Ohio State University in 1961 as a professor of health education. There she helped direct the School Health Education Study from 1961 to 1969, and most health education curricula used in schools today are based on the ten conceptual areas identified by the School Health Education Study. These ten areas of focus include community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse.<ref>[[Elena Sliepcevich]]{{Elena Sliepcevich}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Helen Agnes Cleary]]'''\n\nHelen Cleary was born March 28, 1914, at Petersburg, South Australia. She trained as a nurse at the Broken Hill and District Hospital in New South Wales. She became a general nurse in 1941, and an obstetric nurse in 1942. She joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force Nursing Service]] as a sister on November 15, 1943. Along with other RAAF nurses, she would partake in evacuations throughout New Guinea and Borneo, which earned the nurses the nickname \"the flying angels\", and were also known as the \"glamor girls\" of the air force. In April 1945, she was ranked No. 2 Medical Air Evacuation Transport Unit, and began bringing thousands of Australian and British servicemen from prisoner-of-war camps after Japan had surrendered. She and other nurses cared for many patients who suffered from malnutrition and dysentery. During the Korean War, Cleary was charge sister on the RAAF, where she organized medical evacuations of Australians from Korea, fought for better treatment and conditions of the critically wounded, and nursed recently exchanged Prisoners of War.

Following the introduction of Western [[fast food]] in the late 20th century, the Japanese government mandated education in nutrition and food origins, starting with the Basic Law of Shokuiku in 2005, and followed with the School Health Law in 2008.

By the mid 1970s it was clear that reducing illness, death, and rising health care costs could best be achieved through a focus on health promotion and disease prevention.  At the heart of the new approach was the role of a health educator <ref name = \"Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education\">Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, 2009.</ref>  A health educator is \"a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive to the health of individuals, groups, and communities\" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p.&nbsp;100).  In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985). A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996). These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below. The Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis (HESPA II 2020) produced \"a new hierarchical model with 8 Areas of Responsibility, 35 Competencies, and 193 Sub-competencies\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nchec.org/news/posts/hespa2|title=Health Education Specialist Practice Analysis II 2020 Validates and Reveals Eight Areas of Responsibility for Health Education Specialists|website=www.nchec.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>. \n\n[[File:Healthed mindmap.jpg]]\n\n===Responsibility I: Assessing Individual and Community Needs for Health Education===\n*Provides the foundation for program planning\n*Determines what health problems might exist in any given groups\n*Includes determination of community resources available to address the problem\n*Community Empowerment encourages the population to take ownership of their health problems\n*Includes careful data collection and analysis\n*It is essential for healthy life\n*to find out the vital health statistics in community\n*The planned activity should be achievable and take into consideration the financial, personnel, and time constraints on the resources you have available. you should not plan unachievable activities.\n\n===Responsibility II: Plan Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs===\n\n*Actions are based on the needs assessment done for the community (see Responsibility I)\n*Involves the development of goals and objectives which are specific and measurable\n*Interventions are developed that will meet the goals and objectives\n*According to Rule of Sufficiency, strategies are implemented which are sufficiently robust, effective enough, and have a reasonable chance of meeting stated objectives\n\n===Responsibility III: Implement Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs===\n\n*Implementation is based on a thorough understanding of the priority population\n*Utilize a wide range of educational methods and techniques\n\n===Responsibility IV: Conduct Evaluation and Research Related to Health Education===\n\n*Depending on the setting, utilize tests, surveys, observations, tracking epidemiological data, or other methods of data collection\n*Health Educators make use of research to improve their practices.\n\n===Responsibility V: Administer Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs===\n\n*Administration is generally a function of the more experienced practitioner\n*Involves facilitating cooperation among personnel, both within and between programs\n\n===Responsibility VI: Serve as a Health Education Resource Person===\n*Involves skills to access needed resources, and establish effective consultative relationships.\n\n===Role VII: Communicate and Advocate for Health and Health Education===\n\n*Translates scientific language into understandable information\n*Address diverse audience in diverse settings\n*Formulates and support rules, policies and legislation\n*Advocate for the profession of health education\n\n==Motivation==\nEducation for health begins with people. It hopes to motivate them with whatever interests they may have in improving their [[living conditions]]. Its aim come is to develop in them a sense of responsibility for health conditions for themselves as individuals, as members of families, and as communities. In communicable disease control, health education commonly includes an appraisal of what is known by a population about a disease, an assessment of habits and attitudes of the people as they relate to spread and frequency of the disease, and the presentation of specific means to remedy observed deficiencies.<ref>[http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm Washington State Department of Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107002810/http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm |date=2010-01-07 }}</ref>\n\nHealth education is also an effective tool that helps improve health in developing nations. It not only teaches prevention and basic health knowledge but also conditions ideas that re-shape everyday habits of people with unhealthy lifestyles in developing countries. This type of conditioning not only affects the immediate recipients of such education but also future generations will benefit from an improved and properly cultivated ideas about health that will eventually be ingrained with widely spread health education. Moreover, besides physical health prevention, health education can also provide more aid and help people deal healthier with situations of extreme stress, anxiety, depression or other emotional disturbances to lessen the impact of these sorts of mental and emotional constituents, which can consequently lead to detrimental physical effects.,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bundy D. |author2=Guya H.L. | year = 1996 | title = Schools for health, education and the school-age child | url = | journal = Parasitology Today | volume = 12 | issue = 8| pages = 1\u201316 | doi=10.1016/0169-4758(96)30011-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kann L. |author2=Brener N.D. |author3=Allensworth D.D. | year = 2001 | title = Health education: Results from the School Health Policies and Programs Study 2000 | url = | journal = Journal of School Health | volume = 71 | issue = 7| pages = 266\u2013278 | doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2001.tb03504.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.307.2181 | pmid = 11822302 }}</ref>\n\n==Credentialing==\n\nCredentialing is the process by which the qualifications of licensed professionals, organizational members or an organization are determined by assessing the individuals or group background and legitimacy through a standardized process. Accreditation, licensure, or certifications are all forms of credentialing.\n\nIn 1978, Helen Cleary, the president of the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (SOPHE) started the process of certification of health educators. Prior to this, there was no certification for individual health educators, with exception to the licensing for school health educators.  The only accreditation available in this field was for school health and public health professional preparation programs.\n\nHer initial response was to incorporate experts in the field and to promote funding for the process. The director if the Division of Associated Health Professions in the Bureau of Health Manpower of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Thomas Hatch, became interested in the project. To ensure that the commonalities between health educators across the spectrum of professions would be sufficient enough to create a set of standards, Dr. Cleary spent a great amount of time to create the first conference called the Bethesda Conference. In attendance were interested professionals who covered the possibility of creating credentialing within the profession.\n\nWith the success of the conference and the consensus that the standardization of the profession was vital, those who organized the conference created the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators. Funding for this endeavor became available in January 1979, and role delineation became a realistic vision for the future.  They presented the framework for the system in 1981 and published entry-level criteria in 1983. Seven areas of responsibility, 29 areas of competency and 79 sub-competencies were required of health education professionals for approximately 20 years for entry-level educators.\n\nIn 1986 a second conference was held in Bethesda, Maryland to further the credentialing process. In June 1988, the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators became the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC). Their mission was to improve development of the field by promoting, preparing and certifying health education specialists. The NCHEC has three division boards that included preparation, professional development and certification of health educator professionals. The third board, which is called the Division Board of Certification of Health Education Specialist (DBCHES), has the responsibility of developing and administering the CHES exam. An initial certification process allowed 1,558 individuals to be chartered into the program through a recommendation and application process. The first exam was given in 1990.\n\nIn order for a candidate to sit for an exam they must have either a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree from an accredited institution, and an official transcript that shows a major in health education, Community Health Education, Public Health Education, or [[school health education|School Health Education]], etc. The transcript will be accepted if it reflects 25 semester hours or 37 quarter hours in health education preparation and covers the 7 responsibilities covered in the framework.\n\nIn 1998 a project called the Competencies Update Project (CUP) began. The purpose of the CUP project was to up-date entry-level requirements and to develop advanced-level competences. Through research the CUP project created the requirements for three levels, which included entry-level, Advanced I and Advanced II educators.<ref>Cottrell, R. R., Girvan, J. T., & McKenzie, J. F. (2009). Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education. New York: Benjamin Cummings.</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Patterson S. M. |author2=Vitello E.

The MCHES exam measures the knowledge of the advanced levels and sub levels of the Seven Areas of Responsibilities. The first MCHES exam was given in October 2011.\n\nIn order to be eligible to take the MCHES exam you must have at least a master's degree in health education or related discipline along with a least 25 credit hours related to health education.  In addition, five years of documented information of practice in health education and two recommendations of past/present supervisors must be provided. A vitae/resume must also be submitted.\n\nThe Competency Update Project (CUP), 1998-2004 revealed that there were higher levels of health education practitioners, which is the reasoning for the advancements for the MCHES. Many health educators felt that the current CHES credential was an entry-level exam.\n\n==Teaching==\n\nIn the [[United States]] some forty states require the teaching of health education. A comprehensive health education curriculum consists of planned learning experiences which will help students achieve desirable attitudes and practices related to critical health issues. Some of these are: [[emotional health]] and a positive [[self image]]; appreciation, respect for, and care of the [[human body]] and its [[vital organ]]s; [[physical fitness]]; health issues of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]]; health misconceptions and myths; effects of exercise on the body systems and on general well being; [[nutrition]] and [[weight control]]; [[sexual relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the scientific, social, and economic aspects of community and ecological health; [[communicable disease|communicable]] and [[degenerative disease]]s including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s; [[disaster preparedness]]; safety and driver education; factors in the environment and how those factors affect an individual's or population's [[Environmental health]] (ex: air quality, water quality, food sanitation); [[life skills]]; choosing professional medical and health services; and choices of health careers.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics share that 99% of public schools conduct some type of nutrition education. For each grade from kindergarten through eighth, 50 percent or more of all schools have district or state requirements for students to receive nutrition education. However, only 40 percent have these requirements for ninth and tenth grades; and about 20 percent for eleventh and twelfth grades.  The issue still lies with the content and thoroughness that is being taught.  Topics taught in a most all of the schools are: the relationship between diet and health, finding and choosing healthy foods, nutrients and their food sources, the Food Guide Pyramid, and the Dietary Guidelines and goals. However, with the exception of the Food Guide Pyramid, less than half of schools cover these topics thoroughly.  Overall, schools focus on increasing students\u2019 knowledge about what is meant by good nutrition, with less emphasis on influencing students\u2019 motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors. Four of the five topics covered by more than 90 percent of all schools are related to knowledge. With the exception of finding and choosing healthy foods, less than one-third of schools provide thorough coverage of topics related to motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors.  Not often are there teachers specific for nutrition.  Most of the time the nutrition content is taught by the primary teacher. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96852.pdf\n\n==National Health Education Standards==\n\nThe National Health Education Standards (NHES) are written expectations for what students should know and be able to do by grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to promote personal, family, and community health. The standards provide a framework for curriculum development and selection, instruction, and student assessment in health education.  The performance indicators articulate specifically what students should know or be able to do in support of each standard by the conclusion of each of the following grade spans: Pre-K\u2013Grade 12. The performance indicators serve as a blueprint for organizing student assessment.<ref>Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. (2007). National Health Education Standards.

Various Public Health and Health Education organizations such as the American Association of Health Education (AAHE), the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), SOPHE, and others collaborated year after year to devise a unified standard of ethics that health educators would be held accountable to professionally.  In 1995, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) proposed a profession-wide standard at the conference: Health Education Profession in the Twenty-First Century: Setting the Stage.  Post-conference, an ethics task force was developed with the purpose of solidifying and unifying proposed ethical standards.  The document was eventually unanimously approved and ratified by all involved organizations in November 1999 and has since then been used as the standard for practicing health educators.\n\n\"The Code of Ethics that has evolved from this long and arduous process is not seen as a completed project. Rather, it is envisioned as a living document that will continue to evolve as the practice of Health Education changes to meet the challenges of the new millennium.\" <ref>Coalition of National Health Education Organizations.

These individuals play a crucial role in many organizations in various settings to improve our nations health. Just as a Community health educator works work toward population health, a school Health educator generally teaches in our Schools. A community health educator is typically focused on their immediate community striving to serve the public.\n\n'''Health Care Settings''': these include hospitals (for-profit and public), medical care clinics, home health agencies, HMOs and PPOs. Here, a health educator teaches employees how to be healthy. [[Patient education]] positions are far and few between because insurance companies do not cover the costs. [1]\n\n'''Public Health Agencies''': are official, tax funded, government agencies. They provide police protection, educational systems, as well as clean air and water. Public health departments provide health services and are organized by a city, county, state, or federal government. [2]\n\n'''School Health Education''': involves all strategies, activities, and services offered by, in, or in association with schools that are designed to promote students' physical, emotional, and social development. School health involves teaching students about health and health related behaviors. Curriculum and programs are based on the school's expectations and health. [3]\n\n'''Non Profit Voluntary Health Agencies''': are created by concerned citizens to deal with health needs not met by governmental agencies. Missions include public education, professional education, patient education, research, direct services and support to or for people directly affected by a specific health or medical problem. Usually funded by such means as private donations, grants, and fund-raisers.[4]\n\n'''Higher Education''': typically two types of positions health educators hold including academic, or faculty or health educator in a student health service or wellness center. As a faculty member, the health educator typically has three major responsibilities: teaching, community and professional service, and scholarly research. As a health educator in a university health service or wellness center, the major responsibility is to plan, implement, and evaluate health promotion and education programs for program participants. [5]\n\n'''Work site Health Promotion''': is a combination of educational, organizational and environmental activities designed to improve the health and safety of employees and their families. These work site wellness programs offer an additional setting for health educators and allow them to reach segments of the population that are not easily reached through traditional community health programs. Some work site health promotion activities include: smoking cessation, stress management, bulletin boards, newsletters, and much more. [6]\n\n'''Independent Consulting and Government Contracting''': international, national, regional, state, and local organizations contract with independent consultants for many reasons. They may be hired to assess individual and community needs for health education; plan, implement, administer and evaluate health education strategies; conduct research; serve as health education resource person; and or communicate about and advocate for health and health education. Government contractors are often behind national health education programs, government reports, public information web sites and telephone lines, media campaigns, conferences, and health education materials.

Dr. Nysawnder pursued her interest in public health at the Works Progress Administration during the depression. She served with the Federal Works Agency contributing to the establishment of nursery schools and child care centers to accommodate young mothers working in defense plants. She set up these centers in 15 northeastern states.  This did not happen quickly so she advocated all over the nation to train people to act as foster parents for the children of working women. Dr. Nyswander became the director of the City health Center in [[Astoria, Queens]] in 1939.  She spent her time as director promoting the idea of New York City keeping an eye on the health of children.  They would do this by keeping records that would follow them to whatever school they might move to.  She wrote \"Solving School Health Problems\" which is an analysis of the health issues in New York children.  This is still used in public health education courses today.<ref>{{cite web|author=RICHARD SEVEROPublished: December 29, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/29/us/dorothy-bird-nyswander-104-promoted-public-health-education.html?sec=&spon= |title=Dorothy Bird Nyswander, 104; Promoted Public Health Education - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1998-12-29 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref>\n\n'''Mayhew Derryberry'''\n\nDr. Derryberry was born December 25, 1902 and earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry and mathematics at the [[University of Tennessee]].
