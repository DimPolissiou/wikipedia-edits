It was typified by the company's unveiling of new consoles or handhelds. Unlike most other video game trade events, Nintendo World was not held annually or at any other set interval; Nintendo made a decision regarding whether to hold the show any time in the year. It always took place in Japan, either in [[Kyoto]] where Nintendo's headquarters are located, or at the [[Makuhari Messe]] convention center in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]]. After the most recent Space World show in 2001, the company instead began to favor online publishing as well as industry-wide conferences such as E3.\n\n''[[Nintendo Power]]'' explains: \"Q: What is Famicom Space World?

He made two appearances for the [[England national football team]]. On 10 May 2015, Beasant became the oldest individual to be selected in the squad for a match in Football League history while representing Stevenage as a substitute against Southend in the League Two Play-Off semi-final second leg, at the age of 56.\n\n==Football career==\n\n===Wimbledon===\nBeasant entered the [[Football League]] in 1979 at the age of 20 when [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], newly promoted to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], signed him from his local non-league club [[Edgware Town F.C.|Edgware Town]]. He made his debut for Wimbledon against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 12 January 1980 and played once again that season, in which Wimbledon were relegated. He became a regular first team player the following campaign, when they were promoted and he stayed loyal to the club even when they were relegated again in 1982, being a key player in the side that then won the Fourth Division title in 1983, won promotion from the Third Division a year later, and completed a four-season rise to the First Division in 1986 when they gained promotion from the Second Division in only their ninth season as a [[Football League]] team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=38265 |title=Dave Beasant: Wimbledon FC 1979\u20131988|publisher=Football Heroes.net|accessdate=15 April 2010}}</ref> After their promotion in 1986, Wimbledon rose to the top of the First Division in early September before finishing sixth at the end of the [[1986-87 in English football|1986\u201387 season]].\n\nHe became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an [[FA Cup]] final when he blocked [[John Aldridge]]'s spot-kick for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in [[FA Cup Final 1988|1988]], and in doing so helped [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] secure a 1\u20130 win.

He made two appearances for the [[England national football team]]. On 10 May 2015, Beasant became the oldest individual to be selected in the squad for a match in Football League history while representing Stevenage as a substitute against Southend in the League Two Play-Off semi-final second leg, at the age of 56.\n\n==Football career==\n\n===Wimbledon===\nBeasant entered the [[Football League]] in 1979 at the age of 20 when [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], newly promoted to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], signed him from his local non-league club [[Edgware Town F.C.|Edgware Town]]. He made his debut for Wimbledon against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on 12 January 1980 and played once again that season, in which Wimbledon were relegated. He became a regular first team player the following campaign, when they were promoted and he stayed loyal to the club even when they were relegated again in 1982, being a key player in the side that then won the Fourth Division title in 1983, won promotion from the Third Division a year later, and completed a four-season rise to the First Division in 1986 when they gained promotion from the Second Division in only their ninth season as a [[Football League]] team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=38265 |title=Dave Beasant: Wimbledon FC 1979\u20131988|publisher=Football Heroes.net|accessdate=15 April 2010}}</ref> After their promotion in 1986, Wimbledon rose to the top of the First Division in early September before finishing sixth at the end of the [[1986-87 in English football|1986\u201387 season]].\n\nHe became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an [[FA Cup]] final when he blocked [[John Aldridge]]'s spot-kick for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in [[FA Cup Final 1988|1988]], and in doing so helped [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] secure a 1\u20130 win.

It is told in episodic diary style, moving from the start of the school year to the beginning of summer. It includes both Junior's written record of his life and his cartoon drawings, some of them comically commenting on his situations, and others more seriously depicting important people in his life.[[File:Wikipedia1.gif|thumb|346x346px|The current Spokane Indian reservation]]''The Absolutely True Diare'' begins by introducing Junior's birth defects, including the fact that he was born with [[hydrocephalus]] and therefore is small for his age and suffers from seizures, poor eyesight, stuttering, and a lisp. As a result, Junior has always been picked on by other people on the reservation. Junior\u2019s family is extremely poor and have limited access to opportunities. When Junior's dog Oscar gets heat stroke, his father must put him down because they cannot afford to take him to a veterinarian. Junior's only childhood friend is Rowdy, a classmate who is abused at home and is known as a bully on the reservation. Despite his intimidating role, Rowdy often stands up for Junior and they bond by enjoying kids' comics. Amalie skrev dette hihi...\nJunior's first day of high school is pivotal to the plot of the novel. When Mr. P, his geometry teacher, passes him his textbook, he sees his mother\u2019s name in it, realizing that the book must be at least 30 years old. Angered and saddened by the fact that the reservation is so poor that it cannot afford new textbooks, Junior violently throws the book, which hits Mr. P's face, breaking his nose. When he visits Junior at home, Mr. P convinces Junior to transfer to [[Reardan, Washington|Reardan]] High School, sensing a degree of precociousness in the young teenager. The town of Reardan is far wealthier than Wellpinit\u2014Junior is the only Indian at Reardan besides the team mascot.<ref name=\"Publishers Weekly\" /> Although Junior's family is poor, and although the school is 22 miles away and transportation is unreliable, they support him and do what they can to make it possible for him to stay in the new school. Rowdy, however, is upset by Junior's decision to transfer, and the once-best friends have very little contact during the year.\n\nJunior develops a crush on the school's most popular white girl, Penelope, and becomes study friends with an intelligent student named Gordy. His interactions with the white students give him a better perspective both on white culture and his own. He realizes how much stronger his family ties are than those of his white classmates, noticing that many of the white fathers never come to their children's school events. Junior also realizes that the white students have different rules than those he grew up with, which is evident when he reacts to an insult from the school's star athlete, Roger, by punching him in the face. Junior hit him, as he would have been expected to do on the reservation, and he expects Roger to get revenge. But Roger never does; in fact, Roger and his friends show Junior more respect. Junior also gets closer to Penelope, which makes him more popular with the other girls at the school.\n\nRoger suggests that Junior try out for the basketball team, and to Junior's surprise, he makes the varsity team, which pits him against his former school, Wellpinit, and specifically Rowdy, who is Wellpinit's star freshman. Their first match demonstrates to Junior just how angry the reservation people are at him for transferring: when he enters the court, they boo and insult him. During the game, Rowdy elbows Junior in the head and knocks him unconscious. While suffering some injuries from the game, Junior and his coach become closer as Coach tells him that he admires Junior's commitment to the team. Later on, his grandmother, who Junior looks up to the most on the reservation, is hit and killed by a drunk driver. After his grandmother's funeral, a family friend, Eugene, is shot in the face by his friend Bobby after fighting over alcohol. After grieving and reflecting on his loved ones' deaths, Junior plays in his basketball team's second match against Wellpinit. Reardan wins and Junior gets to block Rowdy. Junior feels triumphant until he sees the Wellpinit players' faces after their defeat and remembers the difficulties they face at home and their lack of hope for a future; ashamed, he runs to the locker room, where he vomits and then breaks down in tears. Later, Junior receives news of the death of his sister and her husband who were killed in a fire at their trailer.\n\nIn the course of the year, Junior and his family suffered many tragedies, many related to alcohol abuse. These events test Junior's sense of hope for a better future and make him wonder about the darker aspects of reservation culture. Furthermore, the protagonist is torn between the need to fit in his new, all-white school and holding on to his Indian heritage, leading him to face criticism from his own community. Despite these challenges, they also help him see how much his family and his new friends love him, and he learns to see himself as both Indian and American. Meanwhile, Rowdy realizes that Junior is the only nomad on the reservation, which makes him more of a \"traditional\" Indian than everyone else in town. In the end, Junior and Rowdy reconcile while playing basketball and resolve to correspond no matter where the future takes them.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Sherman alexie 2007.jpg|thumb|Author, [[Sherman Alexie]], at the Texas Book Festival in 2008]]\n''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian'' is semi-autobiographical.<ref>{{cite book|title=School Library Journal|date=2009-04-01|isbn = 978-0316013697|last1=Alexie|first1=Sherman}}</ref>  The novel started as a section of Sherman Alexie's family [[memoir]], but after the persistence of a young adult editor, he decided to use it as a basis for his first young adult novel.<ref name=\"Song of Myself\">{{cite journal|last=Margolis|first=Rick|year=2007|title=Song of Myself|url=http://www.slj.com|journal=School Library Journal|volume=53|issue=8|page=29|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>  Sherman Alexie commented, \"If I were to guess at the percentage, it would be about seventy-eight percent true.\" <ref name=\"Fiction And Poetry Award\" /> Like Arnold, Sherman Alexie grew up on the Spokane Reservation in Wellpinit with an alcoholic father.<ref name=\"About Alexie\">{{cite journal|last=Cline|first=Lynn|year=2000|title=About Sherman Alexie|journal=Ploughshares|volume=26|issue=4|page=197}}</ref><ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/books/review/Barcott3-t.html|title=Off the Rez|last=Barcott|first=Bruce|date=November 11, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref> He was also born with [[hydrocephalus]], but Alexie did not have any speech impediments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/11435616.html|title=StarTribune Books|date=|publisher=Startribune.com|accessdate=2013-09-23}}</ref> Alexie was also teased for his government-issued, horn-rimmed glasses and nicknamed \"The Globe\" by fellow students because of his giant head.<ref name=\"About Alexie\" /> Another similarity between Alexie and his character Arnold is that Alexie also left the reservation to attend high school at [[Reardan, Washington|Reardan High]], but Alexie chose to go to Reardan to achieve the required credits he needed to go to college.<ref name=\"About Alexie\" /> Alexie became the star player of Reardan's basketball team, and was the only Indian on the team besides the school's team mascot.<ref name=\"About Alexie\" /> The scene where Arnold finds that he is using the same textbook his mother did thirty years before him is drawn from Alexie's own experiences. The only difference from Alexie's life and the novel is that Alexie threw the book against the wall out of anger, and did not hit anyone like Junior did.<ref name=\"Fiction And Poetry Award\" />\n\nIn his own writing, Alexie unapologetically describes himself as \"kind of mixed up, kind of odd, not traditional. I'm a rez kid who's gone urban, and that's what I write about. I have never pretended to be otherwise.\"<ref>Peterson, Nancy J. (2009). ''Conversations with Sherman Alexie''. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. p. 58. {{ISBN|1604732806}}.</ref> \"A smart Indian is a dangerous person,\" Alexie states in a personal essay, \"[a smart Indian is] widely feared and ridiculed by Indians and non-Indians alike.\" <ref name=\"Sherman Alexie\" /> Junior encapsulates this type of experience when he receives strong censure both from his tribal community and from his peers and teachers at his new school, Reardan. In the personal story, Alexie's continued explanation of his own experience is reflected in Junior's.<ref name=\"Sherman Alexie\" /> Alexie recalls, \"I fought with my classmates on a daily basis. They wanted me to stay quiet when the non-Indian teacher asked for answers\u2026.[W]e were Indian children who were expected to be stupid. \u2026[W]e were expected to fail in the non-Indian world.\" <ref name=\"Sherman Alexie\" /> Through Junior's success at Reardan and his realizations about life on the reservation, Alexie represents a possibility for the success of Native American children\u2014by defeating the expectation that he is doomed to fail, Junior crosses social boundaries and defeats unfavorable odds.<ref name=\"Sherman Alexie\" /> Alexie's reflections again demonstrate that Junior's experiences are semi-autobiographical.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n;Agnes (Adams) Spirit (Junior's Mom):A [[Spokane Indian]], Agnes has lived on the reservation her entire life. She is a bad liar, likes to read books, and is considered to be very smart by her children. She is an ex-alcoholic and is seen as eccentric by Junior: \"She's a human tape recorder,\" Junior explains, \"Really, my mom can read the newspaper in fifteen minutes and tell me baseball scores, the location of every war, the latest guy to win the lottery, and the high temperature in [[Des Moines, Iowa]].\"<ref name=\"Alexie, p.13\" group=\"lower-alpha\">Alexie, p. 13.</ref><br />\n;Arnold Spirit  (Junior's Dad)\n:An alcoholic, but very supportive.

He could have been a jazz musician, given more time and money.<ref name=\"Alexie, p.13\" group=\"lower-alpha\" />\n;\n;Arnold Spirit Jr. AKA Junior\n: Nicknamed Junior, Arnold is a fourteen-year-old boy who lives on the [[Spokane Indian Reservation]]. He enjoys playing basketball and drawing cartoons in his free time. Junior and his family, along with the others on the reservation, feel the daily effects of poverty and financial shortcomings\u2014there is often not enough food to eat in their home or enough money to fill the gas tank in the car, forcing him to hitchhike to school or not go at all. He is incredibly smart; he transfers from the school on the reservation to Reardan, where almost all the students are white.\n\n:'''Coach''':The coach of the basketball team at Reardan High School. Unlike the teachers who are apprehensive of Junior's attendance at Reardan, the coach pays no attention to Junior's race. He is supportive of Junior both on and off the court.<ref name=\"Alexie, p.148\" group=\"lower-alpha\">Alexie, p. 148.</ref> The coach becomes a father figure for Junior in many ways, but also becomes an exemplary friend, helping Junior through difficult times dealing with playing against his home reservation. The novel never gives a name to him, as he is always referred to as coach.\n\n;Dawn:When Arnold Spirit was twealve years old, he loved this girl. He thought about Dawn when he said to Rowdy that he loved Penelope.\n\n:'''Eugene''':The best friend of Junior's father. \"Eugene was a nice guy, and like an uncle to me, but he was drunk all the time,\"<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Alexie, p. 70.</ref> Junior reveals. He becomes an Emergency Medical Technician(EMT) for the tribal ambulance service, and, for a brief time, drives a 1946 [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian Chief Roadmaster]]. Eugene dies after his close friend Bobby shoots him in the face during a dispute over alcohol. Bobby hangs himself in jail.\n\n;Gordy\n:Gordy is a student who attends Reardan, wears glasses, and does everything in the name of science. Gordy always speaks in a sophisticated and proper manner throughout the novel. He is one of the smartest students at the school and he eventually becomes Junior's first real friend at Reardan. Gordy also helps Junior with schoolwork and encourages his enjoyment of reading books.\n\n<br />\n\n;Grandmother Spirit\n:Junior's Grandma. She is Junior's source of advice and support, until she dies after being hit by a drunk driver while walking on the side of the road on her way home after a powwow. Her dying words were \"Forgive him,\" which meant that she wanted her family to forgive the drunk driver, Gerald, for hitting and killing her. Ironically, she never had a drink in her life. She was also extremely tolerant and loving of all people. Junior's grandma is his favorite person in the world. \"My grandmother's last act on earth was a call for forgiveness, love, and tolerance,\" Junior recalls on page 157.<ref name=\"Alexie, p.157\" group=\"lower-alpha\">Alexie, p. 157.</ref>\n\n;Mary\n:Junior's sister. Mary has long hair and is nicknamed \"Mary Runs Away\". She likes to write romance stories and is considered by Junior to be \"beautiful and strong and funny\". She was smart, but did not have the skills to get a job.<ref name=\"Alexie, p.28\" group=\"lower-alpha\">Alexie, p. 28.</ref> After high school, she did not go to college or get a job; instead, she moved to Montana with her new husband she met at the reservation casino. Mary and her new husband die of a fire in their trailer-home after a partygoer forgot about a boiling pot of soup. A curtain drifted onto the hot plate and the trailer was quickly engulfed. Junior was told that Mary never woke up because she was too drunk.\n\n;Melinda:Works in the office of Reardan High School. She is 50 years old.\n\n<br />\n\n;Mr. P:Junior's white geometry teacher at Wellpinit High School. He mentored Mary, Junior's older sister, and wants to help Junior leave the reservation. Mr. P regrets the way he treated his students when he was younger. He had been taught to beat the Indian out of the children. He is short and bald, and incredibly absent minded. He often forgets to come to school, but \"he doesn't expect much of [his students].\"<ref group=lower-alpha>Alexie, p. 32.</ref> A major turning point in ''Diary''{{'}}s plot occurs when Junior throws his math book at Mr. P after a realization about the reservation's poverty.\n\n;Penelope:Junior's crush and good friend from Reardan High. She has blonde hair and Junior thinks that she is very attractive. She enjoys helping others, is [[bulimic]], and has a racist father named Earl. She is popular and plays on the Reardan volleyball team. She is obsessed with leaving the small town behind and traveling the world. She initially decides to be close with Junior, fed up with the conformity of the town; but closer to the end of the novel, she ''does'' become Junior's girlfriend.\n\n;Roger\n:Roger is a [[Jock (stereotype)|jock]] at Reardan High School. Upon meeting Junior, Roger uses racial slurs to demean him, and eventually it gets so racist that Junior retaliates by punching him in the face. Contrary to Junior's expectations, Roger then begins to respect Junior, and the two gradually become friends. Furthermore, Roger obtains a role as a kind of advisor and protector of Junior, occasionally helping him monetarily and other times with advice.\n;\n;\n;Rowdy\n:Rowdy is Junior's best friend.<ref name=\"shmoop.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/absolutely-true-diary-part-time-indian/rowdy.html|title=Rowdy in The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-11-07}}</ref> He is \"long and lean & strong like a snake.\"<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Alexie, p. 15.</ref> Throughout the novel, Rowdy's father abuses him, which leads to his bully-like behavior. He likes reading comics, such as [[Archie Comics|Archie]]. The comics help him escape the troubles of the real world. Junior and Rowdy have been the best of friends since they were little, and Rowdy has often taken on the role of Junior's protector. However, as Junior leaves the reservation school, Rowdy feels betrayed by his best friend and turns into Junior's \"arch nemesis\" during the novel.<ref name=\"shmoop.com\" /> Even though Rowdy develops a passionate hatred for Junior through the betrayal he felt, they are able to eventually overcome their situation and become friends again by the end of the novel.\n\n;\n\n;Ted: This billionaire came to Grandmother Spirits funeral to give back a powwow dancing outfit. But nobody recognized the outfit so he drove away.\n\n;\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Reviews===\n[[Bruce Barcott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said in a 2007 review, \"For 15 years now, Sherman Alexie has explored the struggle to survive between the grinding plates of the Indian and white worlds.

The Spokane Indians, and tribes like them, face the trauma of searching for an identity in a world that attempts to envelop one's culture.

A textbook called ''Sherman Alexie in the Classroom'' was recently published in order to help teachers and educators explore how multicultural texts can impact the learning outcome of students\u2013\u2013especially for Native Americans in the modern times. This text explores the significance and the message behind the works of Sherman Alexie, including poetry, novels, films strips, and much more.\n\nSherman Alexie's novel, ''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian'', is a multicultural text that many English teachers use in order to educate their students about the Native American heritage. The author, Alexie, himself is of the Spokane heritage, and as a result, he uses his own background and personal experiences to write this specific novel in a semi-autobiographical format.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/author-puts-native-life-in-the-classroom/article_fb99a4a9-5cf5-543b-a9eb-59e157dd52e4.html|title=Author Puts Native Life in the Classroom|last=Rave|first=Jodi|date=September 27, 2008|website=Rapid City Journal|publisher=Tucows Domains Inc.|access-date=December 3, 2016}}</ref> Teachers refer to the textbook, ''Sherman Alexie in the Classroom'', to claim that the book provides an opportunity to educate non-Native American students to \"work through their white guilt and develop anti-racist perspectives.\" <ref name=\":9\" />\n\nIn an interview, Alexie stated that, \"The primary audience is college-educated white women, so that's who reads everything.

Thank God ... they seem to be the people most willing to ignore barriers and boundaries and to reach across, so that's who my audience is in reality.

It is told in episodic diary style, moving from the start of the school year to the beginning of summer. It includes both Junior's written record of his life and his cartoon drawings, some of them comically commenting on his situations, and others more seriously depicting important people in his life.[[File:Wikipedia1.gif|thumb|346x346px|The current Spokane Indian reservation]]''The Absolutely True Diary'' begins by introducing Junior's birth defects, including the fact that he was born with [[hydrocephalus]] and therefore is small for his age and suffers from seizures, poor eyesight, stuttering, and a lisp. As a result, Junior has always been picked on by other people on the reservation. Junior\u2019s family is extremely poor and have limited access to opportunities. When Junior's dog Oscar gets heat stroke, his father must put him down because they cannot afford to take him to a veterinarian. Junior's only childhood friend is Rowdy, a classmate who is abused at home and is known as a bully on the reservation. Despite his intimidating role, Rowdy often stands up for Junior and they bond by enjoying kids' comics.\nJunior's first day of high school is pivotal to the plot of the novel. When Mr. P, his geometry teacher, passes him his textbook, he sees his mother\u2019s name in it, realizing that the book must be at least 30 years old. Angered and saddened by the fact that the reservation is so poor that it cannot afford new textbooks, Junior violently throws the book, which hits Mr. P's face, breaking his nose. When he visits Junior at home, Mr. P convinces Junior to transfer to [[Reardan, Washington|Reardan]] High School, sensing a degree of precociousness in the young teenager. The town of Reardan is far wealthier than Wellpinit\u2014Junior is the only Indian at Reardan besides the team mascot.<ref name=\"Publishers Weekly\" /> Although Junior's family is poor, and although the school is 22 miles away and transportation is unreliable, they support him and do what they can to make it possible for him to stay in the new school. Rowdy, however, is upset by Junior's decision to transfer, and the once-best friends have very little contact during the year.\n\nJunior develops a crush on the school's most popular white girl, Penelope, and becomes study friends with an intelligent student named Gordy. His interactions with the white students give him a better perspective both on white culture and his own. He realizes how much stronger his family ties are than those of his white classmates, noticing that many of the white fathers never come to their children's school events. Junior also realizes that the white students have different rules than those he grew up with, which is evident when he reacts to an insult from the school's star athlete, Roger, by punching him in the face. Junior hit him, as he would have been expected to do on the reservation, and he expects Roger to get revenge. But Roger never does; in fact, Roger and his friends show Junior more respect. Junior also gets closer to Penelope, which makes him more popular with the other girls at the school.\n\nRoger suggests that Junior try out for the basketball team, and to Junior's surprise, he makes the varsity team, which pits him against his former school, Wellpinit, and specifically Rowdy, who is Wellpinit's star freshman. Their first match demonstrates to Junior just how angry the reservation people are at him for transferring: when he enters the court, they boo and insult him. During the game, Rowdy elbows Junior in the head and knocks him unconscious. While suffering some injuries from the game, Junior and his coach become closer as Coach tells him that he admires Junior's commitment to the team. Later on, his grandmother, who Junior looks up to the most on the reservation, is hit and killed by a drunk driver. After his grandmother's funeral, a family friend, Eugene, is shot in the face by his friend Bobby after fighting over alcohol. After grieving and reflecting on his loved ones' deaths, Junior plays in his basketball team's second match against Wellpinit. Reardan wins and Junior gets to block Rowdy. Junior feels triumphant until he sees the Wellpinit players' faces after their defeat and remembers the difficulties they face at home and their lack of hope for a future; ashamed, he runs to the locker room, where he vomits and then breaks down in tears. Later, Junior receives news of the death of his sister and her husband who were killed in a fire at their trailer.\n\nIn the course of the year, Junior and his family suffered many tragedies, many related to alcohol abuse. These events test Junior's sense of hope for a better future and make him wonder about the darker aspects of reservation culture. Furthermore, the protagonist is torn between the need to fit in his new, all-white school and holding on to his Indian heritage, leading him to face criticism from his own community. Despite these challenges, they also help him see how much his family and his new friends love him, and he learns to see himself as both Indian and American. Meanwhile, Rowdy realizes that Junior is the only nomad on the reservation, which makes him more of a \"traditional\" Indian than everyone else in town. In the end, Junior and Rowdy reconcile while playing basketball and resolve to correspond no matter where the future takes them.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Sherman alexie 2007.jpg|thumb|Author, [[Sherman Alexie]], at the Texas Book Festival in 2008]]\n''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian'' is semi-autobiographical.<ref>{{cite book|title=School Library Journal|date=2009-04-01|isbn = 978-0316013697|last1=Alexie|first1=Sherman}}</ref>  The novel started as a section of Sherman Alexie's family [[memoir]], but after the persistence of a young adult editor, he decided to use it as a basis for his first young adult novel.<ref name=\"Song of Myself\">{{cite journal|last=Margolis|first=Rick|year=2007|title=Song of Myself|url=http://www.slj.com|journal=School Library Journal|volume=53|issue=8|page=29|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>  Sherman Alexie commented, \"If I were to guess at the percentage, it would be about seventy-eight percent true.\" <ref name=\"Fiction And Poetry Award\" /> Like Arnold, Sherman Alexie grew up on the Spokane Reservation in Wellpinit with an alcoholic father.<ref name=\"About Alexie\">{{cite journal|last=Cline|first=Lynn|year=2000|title=About Sherman Alexie|journal=Ploughshares|volume=26|issue=4|page=197}}</ref><ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/books/review/Barcott3-t.html|title=Off the Rez|last=Barcott|first=Bruce|date=November 11, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref> He was also born with [[hydrocephalus]], but Alexie did not have any speech impediments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/11435616.html|title=StarTribune Books|date=|publisher=Startribune.com|accessdate=2013-09-23}}</ref> Alexie was also teased for his government-issued, horn-rimmed glasses and nicknamed \"The Globe\" by fellow students because of his giant head.<ref name=\"About Alexie\" /> Another similarity between Alexie and his character Arnold is that Alexie also left the reservation to attend high school at [[Reardan, Washington|Reardan High]], but Alexie chose to go to Reardan to achieve the required credits he needed to go to college.<ref name=\"About Alexie\" /> Alexie became the star player of Reardan's basketball team, and was the only Indian on the team besides the school's team mascot.<ref name=\"About Alexie\" /> The scene where Arnold finds that he is using the same textbook his mother did thirty years before him is drawn from Alexie's own experiences. The only difference from Alexie's life and the novel is that Alexie threw the book against the wall out of anger, and did not hit anyone like Junior did.<ref name=\"Fiction And Poetry Award\" />\n\nIn his own writing, Alexie unapologetically describes himself as \"kind of mixed up, kind of odd, not traditional. I'm a rez kid who's gone urban, and that's what I write about. I have never pretended to be otherwise.\"<ref>Peterson, Nancy J. (2009). ''Conversations with Sherman Alexie''.

In the personal story, Alexie's continued explanation of his own experience is reflected in Junior's.<ref name=\"Sherman Alexie\" /> Alexie recalls, \"I fought with my classmates on a daily basis. They wanted me to stay quiet when the non-Indian teacher asked for answers\u2026.[W]e were Indian children who were expected to be stupid. \u2026[W]e were expected to fail in the non-Indian world.\" <ref name=\"Sherman Alexie\" /> Through Junior's success at Reardan and his realizations about life on the reservation, Alexie represents a possibility for the success of Native American children\u2014by defeating the expectation that he is doomed to fail, Junior crosses social boundaries and defeats unfavorable odds.<ref name=\"Sherman Alexie\" /> Alexie's reflections again demonstrate that Junior's experiences are semi-autobiographical.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n;Agnes (Adams) Spirit (Junior's Mom):A [[Spokane Indian]], Agnes has lived on the reservation her entire life. She is a bad liar, likes to read books, and is considered to be very smart by her children. She is an ex-alcoholic and is seen as eccentric by Junior: \"She's a human tape recorder,\" Junior explains, \"Really, my mom can read the newspaper in fifteen minutes and tell me baseball scores, the location of every war, the latest guy to win the lottery, and the high temperature in [[Des Moines, Iowa]].\"<ref name=\"Alexie, p.13\" group=\"lower-alpha\">Alexie, p. 13.</ref><br />\n;Arnold Spirit  (Junior's Dad)\n:An alcoholic, but very supportive.

He is incredibly smart; he transfers from the school on the reservation to Reardan, where almost all the students are white.\n\n:'''Coach''':The coach of the basketball team at Reardan High School.

She is Junior's source of advice and support, until she dies after being hit by a drunk driver while walking on the side of the road on her way home after a powwow. Her dying words were \"Forgive him,\" which meant that she wanted her family to forgive the drunk driver, Gerald, for hitting and killing her. Ironically, she never had a drink in her life. She was also extremely tolerant and loving of all people. Junior's grandma is his favorite person in the world. \"My grandmother's last act on earth was a call for forgiveness, love, and tolerance,\" Junior recalls on page 157.<ref name=\"Alexie, p.157\" group=\"lower-alpha\">Alexie, p. 157.</ref>\n\n;Mary\n:Junior's sister.

Junior was told that Mary never woke up because she was too drunk.\n\n;Melinda:Works in the office of Reardan High School. She is 50 years old.\n\n<br />\n\n;Mr. P:Junior's white geometry teacher at Wellpinit High School. He mentored Mary, Junior's older sister, and wants to help Junior leave the reservation.

He often forgets to come to school, but \"he doesn't expect much of [his students].\"<ref group=lower-alpha>Alexie, p. 32.</ref> A major turning point in ''Diary''{{'}}s plot occurs when Junior throws his math book at Mr. P after a realization about the reservation's poverty.\n\n;Penelope:Junior's crush and good friend from Reardan High.

Upon meeting Junior, Roger uses racial slurs to demean him, and eventually it gets so racist that Junior retaliates by punching him in the face. Contrary to Junior's expectations, Roger then begins to respect Junior, and the two gradually become friends. Furthermore, Roger obtains a role as a kind of advisor and protector of Junior, occasionally helping him monetarily and other times with advice.\n;\n;\n;Rowdy\n:Rowdy is Junior's best friend.<ref name=\"shmoop.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/absolutely-true-diary-part-time-indian/rowdy.html|title=Rowdy in The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-11-07}}</ref> He is \"long and lean & strong like a snake.\"<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Alexie, p. 15.</ref> Throughout the novel, Rowdy's father abuses him, which leads to his bully-like behavior.

He's done it through various characters and genres, but ''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian'' may be his best work yet.

The Spokane Indians, and tribes like them, face the trauma of searching for an identity in a world that attempts to envelop one's culture.

A textbook called ''Sherman Alexie in the Classroom'' was recently published in order to help teachers and educators explore how multicultural texts can impact the learning outcome of students\u2013\u2013especially for Native Americans in the modern times. This text explores the significance and the message behind the works of Sherman Alexie, including poetry, novels, films strips, and much more.\n\nSherman Alexie's novel, ''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian'', is a multicultural text that many English teachers use in order to educate their students about the Native American heritage. The author, Alexie, himself is of the Spokane heritage, and as a result, he uses his own background and personal experiences to write this specific novel in a semi-autobiographical format.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/author-puts-native-life-in-the-classroom/article_fb99a4a9-5cf5-543b-a9eb-59e157dd52e4.html|title=Author Puts Native Life in the Classroom|last=Rave|first=Jodi|date=September 27, 2008|website=Rapid City Journal|publisher=Tucows Domains Inc.|access-date=December 3, 2016}}</ref> Teachers refer to the textbook, ''Sherman Alexie in the Classroom'', to claim that the book provides an opportunity to educate non-Native American students to \"work through their white guilt and develop anti-racist perspectives.\" <ref name=\":9\" />\n\nIn an interview, Alexie stated that, \"The primary audience is college-educated white women, so that's who reads everything.

Thank God ... they seem to be the people most willing to ignore barriers and boundaries and to reach across, so that's who my audience is in reality.

In the case of DOS, it is the default user interface as well. It has an additional role as the usual first program run after boot (root process), hence being responsible for setting up the system by running the [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] configuration file, and being the ancestor of all processes.\n\nCOMMAND.COM's successor on [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]] systems is [[cmd.exe]], although COMMAND.COM is available in [[virtual DOS machine]]s on [[IA-32]] versions of those operating systems as well.\n\nThe {{Mono|COMMAND.COM}} filename was also used by {{ill|Disk Control Program|de}} (DCP), an MS-DOS derivative by the former East German [[VEB Robotron]].<ref name=\"DCP_2016\"/>\n\nThe compatible command processor under [[FreeDOS]] is sometimes also named [[FreeCom]].\n\nCOMMAND.COM is a DOS program. Programs launched from COMMAND.COM are DOS programs that use the [[DOS API]] to communicate with the disk operating system.\n\n==Operating modes==\nAs a shell, COMMAND.COM has two distinct modes of operation. The first is [[Read-eval-print loop|interactive mode]], in which the user types commands which are then executed immediately. The second is [[Batch processing|batch mode]], which executes a predefined sequence of commands stored as a text file with the [[Batch file|.BAT]] extension.\n\n=={{anchor|Prompt}}Internal commands==\nInternal commands are commands stored directly inside the COMMAND.COM binary. Thus, they are always available but can only be executed directly from the command interpreter.\n\nAll commands are executed after the {{keypress|Enter}} key is pressed at the end of the line. COMMAND.COM is not case-sensitive, meaning commands can be typed in any mixture of upper and lower case.\n\n; [[BREAK (DOS command)|BREAK]]: Controls the handling of program interruption with {{keypress|Ctrl|C}} or {{keypress|Ctrl|Break}}.\n; [[CHCP (command)|CHCP]]: Displays or changes the current system [[code page]].\n; [[CHDIR|CHDIR, CD]]: Changes the current [[working directory]] or displays the current directory.\n; [[CLS (DOS command)|CLS]]: Clears the screen.\n; [[COPY (DOS command)|COPY]]: Copies one file to another (if the destination file already exists, MS-DOS asks whether to replace it). (See also [[XCOPY]], an external command that could also copy directory trees).\n; [[CTTY (DOS command)|CTTY]]: Defines the device to use for input and output.\n; [[DATE (command)|DATE]]: Display and set the date of the system.\n; [[DEL (command)|DEL, ERASE]]: Deletes a file. When used on a directory, deletes all files inside the directory only. In comparison, the external command [[DELTREE]] deletes all subdirectories and files inside a directory as well as the directory itself.\n; [[DIR (command)|DIR]]: Lists the files in the specified directory.\n; [[ECHO (command)|ECHO]]: Toggles whether text is displayed ({{codett|ECHO ON}}) or not ({{codett|ECHO OFF}}). Also displays text on the screen ({{codett|ECHO text}}).\n; [[EXIT (command)|EXIT]]: Exits from COMMAND.COM and returns to the program which launched it.\n; [[LFNFOR]]: Enables or disables the return of [[long filename]]s by the FOR command. ([[Windows 9x]]).\n; [[LOADHIGH|LOADHIGH, LH]]: Loads a program into [[Upper Memory Area|upper memory]] ({{codett|HILOAD}} in [[DR DOS]]).\n; [[LOCK (DOS command)|LOCK]]: Enables external programs to perform low-level disk access to a volume. ([[MS-DOS 7.1]] and [[Windows 9x]] only)\n; [[MKDIR|MKDIR, MD]]: Creates a new directory.\n; [[PATH (DOS command)|PATH]]: Displays or changes the value of the PATH [[environment variable]] which controls the places where COMMAND.COM will search for executable files.\n; [[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]]: Displays or change the value of the PROMPT environment variable which controls the appearance of the prompt.\n; [[REN (command)|RENAME, REN]]: Renames a file or directory.\n; [[RMDIR|RMDIR, RD]]: Removes an empty directory.\n; [[SET (DOS command)|SET]]: Sets the value of an [[environment variable]]; without arguments, shows all defined environment variables.\n; [[TIME (command)|TIME]]: Display and set the time of the system.\n; [[TRUENAME]]: Display the fully expanded physical name of a file, resolving [[ASSIGN (DOS command)|ASSIGN]], [[JOIN (DOS command)|JOIN]] and [[SUBST]] logical filesystem mappings.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n; [[TYPE (DOS command)|TYPE]]: Display the content of a file on the console.\n; [[UNLOCK (DOS command)|UNLOCK]]: Disables low-level disk access. (MS-DOS 7.1 and [[Windows 9x]] only)\n; [[VER (command)|VER]]: Displays the version of the [[operating system]].\n; [[VERIFY (DOS command)|VERIFY]]: Enable or disable verification of writing for files.\n; [[VOL (command)|VOL]]: Shows information about a volume.\n\n==Batch file commands==\nControl structures are mostly used inside batch files, although they can also be used interactively.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER_CH7\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n; <nowiki>:</nowiki>''label'': Defines a target for GOTO.\n; [[CALL (DOS command)|CALL]]: Executes another batch file and returns to the old one and continues.\n; [[FOR (DOS command)|FOR]]: Iteration: repeats a command for each out of a specified set of files.\n; [[GOTO]]: Moves execution to a specified label. Labels are specified at the beginning of a line, with a colon ({{codett|:likethis}}).\n; [[IF (DOS command)|IF]]: Conditional statement, allows branching of the program execution.\n; [[PAUSE (DOS command)|PAUSE]]: Halts execution of the program and displays a message asking the user to press [[any key]] to continue.\n; [[REM (DOS command)|REM]]: [[comment (computer programming)|comment]]: any text following this command is ignored.\n; [[SHIFT (DOS command)|SHIFT]]: Replaces each of the [[replacement parameter]]s with the subsequent one (e.g. {{codett|%0}} with {{codett|%1}}, {{codett|%1}} with {{codett|%2}}, etc.).\n\n==IF command==\nOn exit, all external commands submit a [[return code]] (a value between 0 and 255) to the calling program. Most programs have a certain convention for their return codes (for instance, 0 for a successful execution).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_BATTIPS\"/><ref name=\"FD_2003_Errorlevel\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2003_Exitcodes\"/><ref name=\"Allen_2005\"/>\n\nIf a program was invoked by COMMAND.COM, the internal IF command with its ERRORLEVEL conditional can be used to test on error conditions of the last invoked external program.\n\nUnder COMMAND.COM, internal commands do not establish a new value.\n\n==Variables==\nBatch files for COMMAND.COM can have four kinds of variables:\n* [[Environment variable]]s: These have the {{codett|%VARIABLE%}} form and are associated with values with the SET statement. Before DOS 3 COMMAND.COM will only expand environment variables in batch mode; that is, not interactively at the command prompt.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n* [[Replacement parameter]]s: These have the form {{codett|%0}}, {{codett|%1}}...{{codett|%9}}, and initially contain the command name and the first nine [[command line parameter]]s passed to the script (e.g., if the invoking command was \"{{codett|myscript.bat John Doe}}\", then {{codett|%0}} is \"myscript.bat\", {{codett|%1}} is \"John\" and {{codett|%2}} is \"Doe\").  The parameters to the right of the ninth can be mapped into range by using the SHIFT statement.\n* Loop variables: Used in loops, they have the {{codett|%%a}} format when run in batch files. These variables are defined solely within a specific FOR statement, and iterate over a certain set of values defined in that FOR statement.\n* Under [[Novell DOS 7]]<!-- 1993 -->, [[OpenDOS 7.01]], [[DR-DOS 7.02]] and higher, COMMAND.COM also supports a number of [[system information variable]]s,<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER_CH7\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> a feature earlier found in [[4DOS 3.00]]<!-- 1990 --> and higher<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> as well as in [[Multiuser DOS]],<!-- 1991 --><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><!-- not in CDOS 386 1.0 (1987), not sure about CDOS 386 3.0 (1989) --> although most of the supported variable names differ.\n\n==Redirection, piping, and chaining==\nBecause DOS is a single-tasking operating system, [[Pipeline (software)|piping]] is achieved by running commands sequentially, redirecting to and from a [[temporary file]]. COMMAND.COM makes no provision for redirecting the [[Standard streams#Standard error (stderr)|standard error]] channel.\n\n; <code>''command'' < ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]] from a file or device\n; <code>''command'' > ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]], overwriting target file if it exists.\n; <code>''command'' >> ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]], appending to target file if it exists.\n; <code>''command1'' | ''command2''</code> : Pipe [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] from ''command1'' to [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]] of ''command2''\n; <code>''command1'' \u00b6 ''command2''</code> : \n: Commands separated by ASCII-20 (\u00b6, invoked by {{keypress|Ctrl|T}}) are executed in sequence (chaining of commands).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> In other words, first ''command1'' is executed until termination, then ''command2''.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> This is an undocumented feature in COMMAND.COM of [[MS-DOS 5.0|MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS 5.0]]<!-- tested MS-DOS 6.2 and PC DOS 7 --> and higher.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> It is also supported by COMMAND.COM<!-- but not by CMD --> of the Windows NT family<!-- tested Windows XP --> as well as by DR-DOS 7.07. All versions of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM<!-- since 3.xx --> already supported a similar internal function utilizing an exclamation mark (!) instead (a feature originally derived from [[Concurrent DOS]] and [[Multiuser DOS]]) - however, in the single-user line this feature was only available internally (in built-in startup scripts like \"!DATE!TIME\") and indirectly through [[DOSKEY]]'s $T parameter to avoid problems with ! as a valid filename character.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> [[4DOS]] supports a configurable command line separator ([[4DOS.INI]] CommandSep= or SETDOS /C), which defaults to ^.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> COMMAND.COM in newer versions of Windows NT<!-- works for example in XP, but not in MS-DOS/PC DOS COMMAND.COM --> also supports an {{code|&}} separator for compatibility with the cmd syntax in OS/2 and the Windows NT family.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> (cmd, however, does not support the \u00b6 separator.)\n\n==Limitations==\nThe command line length in interactive mode is limited to 126 characters.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_MSDOS\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe message \"Loading COMMAND.COM\" can be seen on a [[Head-Up Display|HUD]] view of the [[T-800|Terminator]] and the internal viewport of [[RoboCop]] when he reboots.\n\nIn the CGI children's TV series ''[[ReBoot]]'', which takes place inside computers, the leader of a system (the equivalent of a city) is called the COMMAND.COM.\n\n==See also==\n* [[IBMBIO.COM]] / [[IO.SYS]] (starts the command processor as the first process)\n* [[SHELL (CONFIG.SYS directive)]] (to override default command processor)\n* [[COMSPEC (environment variable)]] (set by COMMAND.COM to reload transient portion of itself)\n* [[CMDLINE (environment variable)]] (set by COMMAND.COM to pass long command lines to external programs)\n* [[4DOS]] / [[NDOS]] (third-party replacement command processors)\n* [[DOSSHELL]] / [[ViewMAX]] (alternative DOS shells)\n<!-- * [[TASKMAX]] / [[TASKMGR]] (instances daughter processes) -->\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[Concurrent DOS]] / [[Multiuser DOS]] / [[REAL/32]] (have similar command processors not named COMMAND.COM)\n* [[PC-MOS/386]] (has a similar command processor)\n* [[Transient Program Area]] (TPA) (area availabe for use either by the running application or the transient portion of COMMAND.COM)\n* [[SpartaDOS X]] (a similar implementation for Atari computers)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Microsoft_COMMAND\">[https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS/blob/master/v2.0/source/COMMAND.ASM MS-DOS/COMMAND.ASM at master \u00b7 microsoft/MS-DOS \u00b7 GitHub]</ref>\n<ref name=\"Paul_1997_BATTIPS\">{{cite book |title=BATTIPs &mdash; Tips & Tricks zur Programmierung von Batchjobs |at=Kapitel 7: ERRORLEVEL abfragen |work=MPDOSTIP |author-first=Matthias R. |author-last=Paul |date=1997-05-01 |orig-year=1993-10-01 |language=de |url=http://www.antonis.de/dos/batchtut/battips/index.htm#7 |access-date=2017-08-23 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823191411/http://www.antonis.de/dos/batchtut/battips/index.htm |archive-date=2017-08-23}} (NB.

For example, if you know you want to copy all of your .TXT files to drive A: and then run CHKDSK to be sure that drive A's file structure is in good shape, you could enter the following command: <code>C:\\>COPY *.TXT A: ^ CHKDSK A:</code> You may put as many commands on the command line as you wish, as long as the total length of the command line does not exceed 511 characters. You can use multiple commands in aliases and batch files as well as at the command line. If you don't like using the default command separator, you can pick another character using the SETDOS /C command or the CommandSep directive in [[4DOS.INI]]. [\u2026] SETDOS /C: (Compound character) This option sets the character used for separating multiple commands on the same line. The default is the caret [^]. You cannot use any of the redirection characters [<>{{!}}], or the blank, tab, comma, or equal sign as the command separator. The command separator is saved by SETLOCAL and restored by ENDLOCAL. This example changes the separator to a tilde [~]: <code>C:\\>SETDOS /C~</code> (You can specify either the character itself, or its ASCII code as a decimal number, or a hexadecimal number preceded by 0x.) [\u2026] CommandSep = c (^): This is the character used to separate multiple commands on the same line. [\u2026] Special Character Compatibility: If you use two or more of our products, or if you want to share aliases and batch files with users of different products, you need to be aware of the differences in three important characters: the Command Separator [\u2026], the Escape Character [\u2026], and the Parameter Character [\u2026]. The default values of each of these characters in each product is shown in the following chart: [\u2026] Product, Separator, Escape Parameter [\u2026] 4DOS: ^, \u2191, & [\u2026] 4OS2, 4NT, Take Command: &, ^, $ [\u2026] (The up-arrow [\u2191] represents the ASCII Ctrl-X character, numeric value 24.)

In the case of DOS, it is the default user interface as well. It has an additional role as the usual first program run after boot (root process), hence being responsible for setting up the system by running the [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] configuration file, and being the ancestor of all processes.\n\nCOMMAND.COM's successor on [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]] systems is [[cmd.exe]], although COMMAND.COM is available in [[virtual DOS machine]]s on [[IA-32]] versions of those operating systems as well.\n\nThe {{Mono|COMMAND.COM}} filename was also used by {{ill|Disk Control Program|de}} (DCP), an MS-DOS derivative by the former East German [[VEB Robotron]].<ref name=\"DCP_2016\"/>\n\nThe compatible command processor under [[FreeDOS]] is sometimes also named [[FreeCom]].\n\nCOMMAND.COM is a DOS program. Programs launched from COMMAND.COM are DOS programs that use the [[DOS API]] to communicate with the disk operating system.\n\n==Operating modes==\nAs a shell, COMMAND.COM has two distinct modes of operation. The first is [[Read-eval-print loop|interactive mode]], in which the user types commands which are then executed immediately. The second is [[Batch processing|batch mode]], which executes a predefined sequence of commands stored as a text file with the [[Batch file|.BAT]] extension.\n\n=={{anchor|Prompt}}Internal commands==\nInternal commands are commands stored directly inside the COMMAND.COM binary. Thus, they are always available but can only be executed directly from the command interpreter.\n\nAll commands are executed after the {{keypress|Enter}} key is pressed at the end of the line. COMMAND.COM is not case-sensitive, meaning commands can be typed in any mixture of upper and lower case.\n\n; [[BREAK (DOS command)|BREAK]]: Controls the handling of program interruption with {{keypress|Ctrl|C}} or {{keypress|Ctrl|Break}}.\n; [[CHCP (command)|CHCP]]: Displays or changes the current system [[code page]].\n; [[CHDIR|CHDIR, CD]]: Changes the current [[working directory]] or displays the current directory.\n; [[CLS (DOS command)|CLS]]: Clears the screen.\n; [[COPY (DOS command)|COPY]]: Copies one file to another (if the destination file already exists, MS-DOS asks whether to replace it). (See also [[XCOPY]], an external command that could also copy directory trees).\n; [[CTTY (DOS command)|CTTY]]: Defines the device to use for input and output.\n; [[DATE (command)|DATE]]: Display and set the date of the system.\n; [[DEL (command)|DEL, ERASE]]: Deletes a file. When used on a directory, deletes all files inside the directory only. In comparison, the external command [[DELTREE]] deletes all subdirectories and files inside a directory as well as the directory itself.\n; [[DIR (command)|DIR]]: Lists the files in the specified directory.\n; [[ECHO (command)|ECHO]]: Toggles whether text is displayed ({{codett|ECHO ON}}) or not ({{codett|ECHO OFF}}). Also displays text on the screen ({{codett|ECHO text}}).\n; [[EXIT (command)|EXIT]]: Exits from COMMAND.COM and returns to the program which launched it.\n; [[LFNFOR]]: Enables or disables the return of [[long filename]]s by the FOR command. ([[Windows 9x]]).\n; [[LOADHIGH|LOADHIGH, LH]]: Loads a program into [[Upper Memory Area|upper memory]] ({{codett|HILOAD}} in [[DR DOS]]).\n; [[LOCK (DOS command)|LOCK]]: Enables external programs to perform low-level disk access to a volume. ([[MS-DOS 7.1]] and [[Windows 9x]] only)\n; [[MKDIR|MKDIR, MD]]: Creates a new directory.\n; [[PATH (DOS command)|PATH]]: Displays or changes the value of the PATH [[environment variable]] which controls the places where COMMAND.COM will search for executable files.\n; [[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]]: Displays or change the value of the PROMPT environment variable which controls the appearance of the prompt.\n; [[REN (command)|RENAME, REN]]: Renames a file or directory.\n; [[RMDIR|RMDIR, RD]]: Removes an empty directory.\n; [[SET (DOS command)|SET]]: Sets the value of an [[environment variable]]; without arguments, shows all defined environment variables.\n; [[TIME (command)|TIME]]: Display and set the time of the system.\n; [[TRUENAME]]: Display the fully expanded physical name of a file, resolving [[ASSIGN (DOS command)|ASSIGN]], [[JOIN (DOS command)|JOIN]] and [[SUBST]] logical filesystem mappings.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n; [[TYPE (DOS command)|TYPE]]: Display the content of a file on the console.\n; [[UNLOCK (DOS command)|UNLOCK]]: Disables low-level disk access. (MS-DOS 7.1 and [[Windows 9x]] only)\n; [[VER (command)|VER]]: Displays the version of the [[operating system]].\n; [[VERIFY (DOS command)|VERIFY]]: Enable or disable verification of writing for files.\n; [[VOL (command)|VOL]]: Shows information about a volume.\n\n==Batch file commands==\nControl structures are mostly used inside batch files, although they can also be used interactively.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER_CH7\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n; <nowiki>:</nowiki>''label'': Defines a target for GOTO.\n; [[CALL (DOS command)|CALL]]: Executes another batch file and returns to the old one and continues.\n; [[FOR (DOS command)|FOR]]: Iteration: repeats a command for each out of a specified set of files.\n; [[GOTO]]: Moves execution to a specified label. Labels are specified at the beginning of a line, with a colon ({{codett|:likethis}}).\n; [[IF (DOS command)|IF]]: Conditional statement, allows branching of the program execution.\n; [[PAUSE (DOS command)|PAUSE]]: Halts execution of the program and displays a message asking the user to press [[any key]] to continue.\n; [[REM (DOS command)|REM]]: [[comment (computer programming)|comment]]: any text following this command is ignored.\n; [[SHIFT (DOS command)|SHIFT]]: Replaces each of the [[replacement parameter]]s with the subsequent one (e.g. {{codett|%0}} with {{codett|%1}}, {{codett|%1}} with {{codett|%2}}, etc.).\n\n==IF command==\nOn exit, all external commands submit a [[return code]] (a value between 0 and 255) to the calling program. Most programs have a certain convention for their return codes (for instance, 0 for a successful execution).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_BATTIPS\"/><ref name=\"FD_2003_Errorlevel\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2003_Exitcodes\"/><ref name=\"Allen_2005\"/>\n\nIf a program was invoked by COMMAND.COM, the internal IF command with its ERRORLEVEL conditional can be used to test on error conditions of the last invoked external program.\n\nUnder COMMAND.COM, internal commands do not establish a new value.\n\n==Variables==\nBatch files for COMMAND.COM can have four kinds of variables:\n* [[Environment variable]]s: These have the {{codett|%VARIABLE%}} form and are associated with values with the SET statement. Before DOS 3 COMMAND.COM will only expand environment variables in batch mode; that is, not interactively at the command prompt.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n* [[Replacement parameter]]s: These have the form {{codett|%0}}, {{codett|%1}}...{{codett|%9}}, and initially contain the command name and the first nine [[command line parameter]]s passed to the script (e.g., if the invoking command was \"{{codett|myscript.bat John Doe}}\", then {{codett|%0}} is \"myscript.bat\", {{codett|%1}} is \"John\" and {{codett|%2}} is \"Doe\").  The parameters to the right of the ninth can be mapped into range by using the SHIFT statement.\n* Loop variables: Used in loops, they have the {{codett|%%a}} format when run in batch files. These variables are defined solely within a specific FOR statement, and iterate over a certain set of values defined in that FOR statement.\n* Under [[Novell DOS 7]]<!-- 1993 -->, [[OpenDOS 7.01]], [[DR-DOS 7.02]] and higher, COMMAND.COM also supports a number of [[system information variable]]s,<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER_CH7\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> a feature earlier found in [[4DOS 3.00]]<!-- 1990 --> and higher<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> as well as in [[Multiuser DOS]],<!-- 1991 --><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><!-- not in CDOS 386 1.0 (1987), not sure about CDOS 386 3.0 (1989) --> although most of the supported variable names differ.\n\n==Redirection, piping, and chaining==\nBecause DOS is a single-tasking operating system, [[Pipeline (software)|piping]] is achieved by running commands sequentially, redirecting to and from a [[temporary file]]. COMMAND.COM makes no provision for redirecting the [[Standard streams#Standard error (stderr)|standard error]] channel.\n\n; <code>''command'' < ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]] from a file or device\n; <code>''command'' > ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]], overwriting target file if it exists.\n; <code>''command'' >> ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]], appending to target file if it exists.\n; <code>''command1'' | ''command2''</code> : Pipe [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] from ''command1'' to [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]] of ''command2''\n; <code>''command1'' \u00b6 ''command2''</code> : \n: Commands separated by ASCII-20 (\u00b6, invoked by {{keypress|Ctrl|T}}) are executed in sequence (chaining of commands).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> In other words, first ''command1'' is executed until termination, then ''command2''.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> This is an undocumented feature in COMMAND.COM of [[MS-DOS 5.0|MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS 5.0]]<!-- tested MS-DOS 6.2 and PC DOS 7 --> and higher.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> It is also supported by COMMAND.COM<!-- but not by CMD --> of the Windows NT family<!-- tested Windows XP --> as well as by DR-DOS 7.07. All versions of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM<!-- since 3.xx --> already supported a similar internal function utilizing an exclamation mark (!) instead (a feature originally derived from [[Concurrent DOS]] and [[Multiuser DOS]]) - however, in the single-user line this feature was only available internally (in built-in startup scripts like \"!DATE!TIME\") and indirectly through [[DOSKEY]]'s $T parameter to avoid problems with ! as a valid filename character.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> [[4DOS]] supports a configurable command line separator ([[4DOS.INI]] CommandSep= or SETDOS /C), which defaults to ^.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> COMMAND.COM in newer versions of Windows NT<!-- works for example in XP, but not in MS-DOS/PC DOS COMMAND.COM --> also supports an {{code|&}} separator for compatibility with the cmd syntax in OS/2 and the Windows NT family.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> (cmd, however, does not support the \u00b6 separator.)\n\n==Limitations==\nThe command line length in interactive mode is limited to 126 characters.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_MSDOS\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe message \"Loading COMMAND.COM\" can be seen on a [[Head-Up Display|HUD]] view of the [[T-800|Terminator]] and the internal viewport of [[RoboCop]] when he reboots.\n\nIn the CGI children's TV series ''[[ReBoot]]'', which takes place inside computers, the leader of a system (the equivalent of a city) is called the COMMAND.COM.\n\n==See also==\n* [[IBMBIO.COM]] / [[IO.SYS]] (starts the command processor as the first process)\n* [[SHELL (CONFIG.SYS directive)]] (to override default command processor)\n* [[COMSPEC (environment variable)]] (set by COMMAND.COM to reload transient portion of itself)\n* [[CMDLINE (environment variable)]] (set by COMMAND.COM to pass long command lines to external programs)\n* [[4DOS]] / [[NDOS]] (third-party replacement command processors)\n* [[DOSSHELL]] / [[ViewMAX]] (alternative DOS shells)\n<!-- * [[TASKMAX]] / [[TASKMGR]] (instances daughter processes) -->\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[Concurrent DOS]] / [[Multiuser DOS]] / [[REAL/32]] (have similar command processors not named COMMAND.COM)\n* [[PC-MOS/386]] (has a similar command processor)\n* [[Transient Program Area]] (TPA) (area availabe for use either by the running application or the transient portion of COMMAND.COM)\n* [[SpartaDOS X]] (a similar implementation for Atari computers)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Microsoft_COMMAND\">[https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS/blob/master/v2.0/source/COMMAND.ASM MS-DOS/COMMAND.ASM at master \u00b7 microsoft/MS-DOS \u00b7 GitHub]</ref>\n<ref name=\"Paul_1997_BATTIPS\">{{cite book |title=BATTIPs &mdash; Tips & Tricks zur Programmierung von Batchjobs |at=Kapitel 7: ERRORLEVEL abfragen |work=MPDOSTIP |author-first=Matthias R. |author-last=Paul |date=1997-05-01 |orig-year=1993-10-01 |language=de |url=http://www.antonis.de/dos/batchtut/battips/index.htm#7 |access-date=2017-08-23 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823191411/http://www.antonis.de/dos/batchtut/battips/index.htm |archive-date=2017-08-23}} (NB.

For example, if you know you want to copy all of your .TXT files to drive A: and then run CHKDSK to be sure that drive A's file structure is in good shape, you could enter the following command: <code>C:\\>COPY *.TXT A: ^ CHKDSK A:</code> You may put as many commands on the command line as you wish, as long as the total length of the command line does not exceed 511 characters. You can use multiple commands in aliases and batch files as well as at the command line. If you don't like using the default command separator, you can pick another character using the SETDOS /C command or the CommandSep directive in [[4DOS.INI]]. [\u2026] SETDOS /C: (Compound character) This option sets the character used for separating multiple commands on the same line. The default is the caret [^]. You cannot use any of the redirection characters [<>{{!}}], or the blank, tab, comma, or equal sign as the command separator. The command separator is saved by SETLOCAL and restored by ENDLOCAL. This example changes the separator to a tilde [~]: <code>C:\\>SETDOS /C~</code> (You can specify either the character itself, or its ASCII code as a decimal number, or a hexadecimal number preceded by 0x.) [\u2026] CommandSep = c (^): This is the character used to separate multiple commands on the same line. [\u2026] Special Character Compatibility: If you use two or more of our products, or if you want to share aliases and batch files with users of different products, you need to be aware of the differences in three important characters: the Command Separator [\u2026], the Escape Character [\u2026], and the Parameter Character [\u2026]. The default values of each of these characters in each product is shown in the following chart: [\u2026] Product, Separator, Escape Parameter [\u2026] 4DOS: ^, \u2191, & [\u2026] 4OS2, 4NT, Take Command: &, ^, $ [\u2026] (The up-arrow [\u2191] represents the ASCII Ctrl-X character, numeric value 24.)
