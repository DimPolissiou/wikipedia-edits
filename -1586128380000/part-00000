It was founded in 1782 with the [[History of Bangkok#Rattanakosin|establishment of Rattanakosin]] as the capital city. This article covers the period until the [[Siamese revolution of 1932]].\n\nThe maximum zone of influence of Rattanakosin included the [[vassal state]]s of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Shan States]], and some [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] kingdoms. The kingdom was founded by [[Rama I]] of the [[Chakri Dynasty|Chakri]]. The first half of this period was characterized by the consolidation of the kingdom's power and was punctuated by periodic conflicts with [[Myanmar]], [[Vietnam]] and Laos. The second period was one of engagements with the [[colonialism|colonial]] powers of Britain and France in which Siam remained the only [[Southeast Asia]]n state to maintain its independence.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/history-rattanakosin.htm\n |title        = Rattanakosin Period (1782 -present)\n |publisher    = GlobalSecurity.org\n |accessdate   = 1 November 2015\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151107223323/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/thailand/history-rattanakosin.htm\n |archive-date = 7 November 2015\n |url-status     = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nInternally the kingdom developed into a modern centralized [[nation state]] with borders defined by interactions with Western powers. Economic and social progress was made, marked by an increase in foreign trade, the abolition of [[slavery]] and the expansion of formal education to the emerging [[middle class]]. However, the failure to implement substantial political reforms culminated in the [[1932 revolution]] and the abandonment of absolute monarchy in favor of a constitutional monarchy.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chao Phraya Chakri, later Phutthayotfa Chulalok or [[Rama I]].]]\n[[File:Bangkok (early Rattanakosin) map.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map of [[Bangkok]] in the early Rattanakosin period.]]\n[[File:Old Bangkok canals.gif|thumb|right|View of 19th-century Bangkok with the [[Wat Saket|Golden Mount]] in the background.|250px]]\n{{Main|History of Bangkok|Thonburi Kingdom}}\nIn 1767, after dominating Southeast Asia for almost four centuries, [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] was [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)|brought down]] by invading Myanmarese armies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|title=Historic City of Ayutthaya|publisher=\u00a9 UNESCO World Heritage Center|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023061657/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|archive-date=23 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDespite its complete defeat and subsequent occupation by the [[Konbaung dynasty]], Siam made a rapid recovery. The resistance to Myanmarese rule was led by a noble of [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descent]], [[Taksin]], a military leader. Initially based at [[Chanthaburi]] in the southeast, within a year, he had defeated the Myanmarese occupation army and reestablished a Siamese state with its capital at [[Thonburi]] on the west bank of the Chao Phraya, 20&nbsp;km from the sea. In 1768 he was crowned as Taksin. He re-united the [[central Thailand|central Thai]] heartlands under his rule, and in 1769 he also occupied western [[Cambodia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|title=The Thon Buri and Early Bangkok periods|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160210/http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe then marched south and reestablished Siamese rule over the [[Malay Peninsula]] as far as [[Penang]] and [[Terengganu]]. Having secured his base in Siam, [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1775\u201376)|Taksin attacked the Myanmarese in the north in 1774]] and captured [[Chiang Mai]] in 1776, permanently uniting Siam and [[Lannathai|Lanna]]. Taksin's leading general in this campaign was [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok|Thong Duang]], known by the title ''Chaophraya'' or Lord Chakri was himself a descendant of [[Mon people]]. In 1778 Chakri led a Siamese army which captured [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], also [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Phrabang]], a northern Lao kingdom submitted, and eventually established Siamese domination over Laotian kingdoms.\n\nDespite these successes, by 1779 Taksin was in political trouble at home. He seems to have developed a religious mania, alienating the powerful Buddhist monk-hood by claiming to be a ''[[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|sotapanna]]'' or divine figure. He was also in troubles with the court officials, Chinese merchants, and missionaries. The foreign observers began to speculate that he would soon be overthrown. In 1782 Taksin sent his armies under Chakri, the future [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama]] I of Rattanakosin, to invade Cambodia, but while they were away a rebellion broke out in the area around the capital. The rebels, who had popular support, offered the throne to General Chakri, the 'supreme general'. Chakri who was on war duty marched back from Cambodia and deposed Taksin, who was purportedly 'secretly executed' shortly after.\n\nChakri ruled under the name Ramathibodi (he was posthumously given the name Phutthayotfa Chulalok), but is now generally known as [[Rama I]], first king of the later known [[Chakri dynasty]]. One of his first decisions was to move the capital across the river to the village of Bang Makok (meaning \"place of [[Spondias|olive plum]]s\").  The new capital was located on the [[Rattanakosin Island|island of Rattanakosin]], protected from attack by the river to the west and by a series of [[Khlong|canals]] to the north, east and south. Siam thus acquired both its current dynasty and its current capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|title=THE EARLY CHAKRI KINGS AND A RESURGENT SIAM|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160210/http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Foundation (1782\u20131809) ===\n{{Main|Rama I}}\nRama I who was himself of [[Mon people|Mon]], Thai and [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descent]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_098_0i_VanRoy_ProminentMonLineages.pdf |title=Prominent Mon Lineages from Late Ayutthaya to Early Bangkok |publisher=Siamese-heritage.org |accessdate=27 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052427/http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_098_0i_VanRoy_ProminentMonLineages.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Dilokwanich/> restored most of the social and political system of the Ayutthaya kingdom, promulgating new law codes, reinstating court ceremonies<ref name = \"Wales\">{{cite book |last= Wales |first= H.

His government was carried out by six great ministries ([[Thai royal and noble titles#Krom|Krom]]) headed by royal princes. Four of these administered particular territories: the [[Kalahom]] the south; the [[Mahatthai]] the north and east; the [[Phrakhlang]] the area immediately south of the capital; and the Krom [[Mueang]], the area around Bangkok. The other two were the ministry of lands (Krom Na) and the ministry of the royal court (Krom Wang). The army was controlled by the King's deputy and brother, the [[Uparat]].\n\nThe Myanmarese, seeing the disorder accompanying the overthrow of Taksin, invaded Siam again in 1785. Rama allowed them to occupy both the north and the south, but the ''Uparat'', ''vice-king'', his brother, led the Siamese army into western Siam and crushed the Myanmarese forces in a battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. This was the last major Myanmarese invasion of Siam, although as late as 1802 Myanmarese forces had to be driven out of Lanna. In 1792 the Siamese occupied [[Luang Prabang]] and brought most of Laos under indirect Siamese rule. Cambodia was also effectively ruled by Siam. By the time of his death in 1809 Rama I had created a Siamese overlordship dominating an area considerably larger than modern Thailand.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FMJ8KP8i3v0C&pg=PA1653&lpg=PA1653&dq=invaded+Siam+again+in+1785#v=onepage |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations: S-Z by Cathal J.

[[Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh]], the only member of the Nguy\u1ec5n family still alive, managed to escape across the river to Siam. While in exile Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh wished to retake Gia Dinh and push the Tay-Son rebels out.  He convinced the neutral King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] of [[Siam]] to provide him with support troops and a small invasion force.\n\nIn mid-1784 Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh, with 50,000 [[Siam]]ese troops and 300 ships, moved through Cambodia, then East of Tonl\u00e9 Sap and penetrated the recently annexed provinces of Annam. 20,000 Siamese troops reached Kien Giang and another 30,000 landed in Chap Lap, as the Siamese advanced towards [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]]. Later that year the Siamese captured the former Cambodian province of Gia Dinh where, it was claimed, they committed atrocities against the population of Viet settlers.\n\n[[Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7]] anticipating a move from the Siamese, had secretly positioned his infantry along the [[Ti\u1ec1n river]] near present-day [[M\u1ef9 Tho]], and on some islands in the middle, facing other troops on the northern banks with naval reinforcements on both sides of the infantry positions.\n\nOn the morning of 19 January Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 sent a small naval force, under a banner of truce, to lure the Siamese into his trap. After so many victories, the Siamese army and naval forces were confident of a surrender.  So, they went to the parley, unaware of the trap. Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's troops dashed into the Siamese formation, slaughtered the unarmed emissaries and turned on the unprepared troops. The battle ended with a near annihilation of the Siamese force.  All the ships of the Siamese navy were destroyed and only 1,000 of the original expedition survived to escape back across the river into Siam.\n\n====Wars with Myanmar====\n{{main|Nine Armies War}}\nSoon King [[Bodawpaya]] of Myanmar started to pursue his ambitious campaigns to expand his dominions over Siam. The [[Burmese-Siamese War (1785\u20131786)]], also known in Siam as the \"Nine Armies War\" because the Myanmarese came in nine armies, thus broke out. The Myanmarese soldiers poured into Lanna and Northern Siam. Siamese forces, commanded by [[Kawila]], Prince of [[Lampang]], put up a brave fight and delayed the Myanmarese advance, all the while waiting for reinforcements from Bangkok. When [[Phitsanulok]] was captured, [[Anurak Devesh]] the ''Rear Palace'', and Rama I himself led Siamese forces to the north. The Siamese relieved Lampang from the Myanmarese siege.\n\nIn the south, Bodawpaya was waiting at [[Three Pagodas Pass|Chedi Sam Ong]] ready to attack. The Front Palace was ordered to lead his troops to the south and counter-attack the Myanmarese coming to [[Ranong]] through [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. He brought the Myanmarese to battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. The Myanmarese also attacked Thalang ([[Phuket city|Phuket]]), where the governor had just died. His wife Chan, and her sister Mook, gathered the local people and successfully defended Thalang against the Myanmarese. Today, Chan and Mook are revered as heroines because of their opposition to the Myanmarese invasions. In their own lifetimes, Rama I bestowed on them the titles [[Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Sri Sunthon]].\n\nThe Myanmarese proceeded to capture [[Songkhla]]. Upon hearing the news, the governors of [[Phatthalung]] fled. However, a monk named Phra Maha encouraged the citizens of the area to take up arms against the Myanmarese, his campaign was also successful. Phra Maha was later raised to the nobility by Rama I.\n\nAs his armies were destroyed, Bodawpaya retreated. The next year, he attacked again, this time constituting his troops as a single army. With this force Bodawpaya passed through the Three Pagoda Pass and settled in Ta Din Dang (Three Pagoda Pass.) The Front Palace marched the Siamese forces to face Bodawpaya. The fighting was very short and Bodawpaya was quickly defeated. This short war was called the \"[[Ta Din Dang campaign]]\".\n\n====Economics, culture and religion====\n[[File:Temple of the Emerald Buddha 2012.JPG|280px|thumb|right|[[Wat Phra Kaew]] seen from the Outer Court of [[Grand Palace]].]]\nChinese immigration increased during Rama I's reign, as he maintained Taksin's policy of allowing Chinese immigration to sustain the country's economy. The Chinese were found mainly in the trading and mercantile sector, and by the time his son and grandson came to the throne, European explorers noted that Bangkok was filled with Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] of all sizes.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Thailand|year=2005|author=[[Chris Baker (writer)|Chris Baker]], [[Pasuk Phongpaichit]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofthailan00bake/page/32 32\u201333]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-81615-7|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthailan00bake/page/32}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PB Grand Palace Bangkok.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Temple of the Emerald Buddha]], one of the king's many construction projects.]]\nRama I moved the capital from Thonburi, which was founded by his predecessor Taksin, and built the new capital, [[Bangkok]]. During the first few years prior to the founding of the capital, he oversaw the construction of the palaces and the Chapel Royal.

Monks had already dabbled in superstitions when he first came to power, and Rama I implemented a law which required a monk who wished to travel to another principality for further education to present a certificate bearing his personal particulars, which would establish a monk ''[[wikt:bona fides|bona fides]]'' and that he had been properly ordained. The king also repeatedly emphasized devotion to the Buddha, not to guardian spirits and past rulers, vestiges of ancient [[Animism|animist]] worship which persisted among Thais prior to his rule.<ref name=Tarling-1999>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia|url=https://archive.org/details/chronologyorigi01munsgoog|author=Nicholas Tarling|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-35505-2|author-link=Nicholas Tarling}}</ref>{{RP|221-222}}\n\nThe king also appointed the first [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand|Supreme Patriarch]] of [[Thai Buddhism]], whose responsibilities included ensuring that Rama I's laws were maintained within the Buddhist [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].<ref name=Tarling-1999 />{{RP|222}} Rama I encouraged the translation of ancient [[Pali]] works and Buddhist texts lost in the chaos after the sacking of Ayutthaya by the Myanmarese in 1767.

The Chakri family now controlled all branches of Siamese government \u2014 since Rama I had 42 children, his brother the Uparat had 43, and Rama II had 73, there was no shortage of royal princes to staff the bureaucracy, the army, the senior monk-hood, and the provincial governments. (Most of these were the children of concubines and thus not eligible to inherit the throne.) There was a confrontation with Vietnam, now becoming a major power in the region, over control of Cambodia in 1813, ending with the ''status quo ante'' restored. But during Rama II's reign Western influences again began to be felt in Siam.\n\nIn 1786 the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] occupied [[Penang]], and in 1819 they founded [[Singapore]]. Soon the British displaced the Dutch and Portuguese as the main Western economic and political influence in Siam. The British objected to the Siamese economic system, in which trading monopolies were held by royal princes and businesses were subject to arbitrary taxation. In 1821, the [[East India Company]]'s [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings]], then [[Governor-General of India]], sent company agent [[John Crawfurd#Siam mission|John Crawfurd on a mission]] to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam \u2014 the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|title=The Crawford Papers \u2014 A Collection of Official Records relating to the Mission of Dr. John Crawfurd sent to Siam by the Government of India in the year 1821|date=1971|page=285|publisher=Cambridge Journals Online|work=Cambridge.org|accessdate=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927143143/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|archive-date=27 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Art and literature====\n[[File:Sunrise on Hat Saikaew, Koh Samet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Phra Aphai Mani]] statue on [[Ko Samet]]]]\n{{see also|Sunthon Phu}}\n\nRama II was a lover of the arts and in particular the literary arts. He was an accomplished poet and anyone with the ability to write a refined piece of poetry would gain the favor of the king. This led to his being dubbed the \"poet king\". Due to his patronage, the poet Sunthon Phu was able to raise his [[Thai royal and noble titles|noble title]] from \"phrai\" to \"khun\" and later \"phra\". Sunthon \u2013 also known as the drunken writer \u2013 wrote numerous works, including the epic poem ''[[Phra Aphai Mani]]''.\n\nRama II rewrote much of the great literature from the reign of Rama I in a modern style. He is credited with writing a popular version of the Thai folk tale [[Ramakien]] and wrote a number of dance dramas such as [[Sang Thong]]. The king was an accomplished musician, playing and composing for the fiddle and introducing new instrumental techniques. He was also a sculptor and is said to have sculpted the face of the Niramitr Buddha in [[Wat Arun]]. Because of his artistic achievements, Rama II's birthday is now celebrated as National Artists' Day (Wan Sinlapin Haeng Chat), held in honor of artists who have contributed to the cultural heritage of the kingdom.\n\n===Consolidation (1824\u20131851) ===\n[[File:Tail\u00e0ndia_-_Annadas_1830.png|thumb|Zone of influence of the early Rattanakosin Kingdom (King Rama III)]]\n[[File:Rama III.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of King [[Nangklao]] (Rama III). The king fought massive wars against Cambodia and Vietnam.]]\n{{Main|Rama III}}\nRama II died in 1824 and was peacefully succeeded by his son Prince Jessadabondindra, who reigned as King Phra Nangklao, now known as [[Rama III]]. Rama II's younger son, [[Mongkut]], was \"encouraged\" to become a monk, removing him from politics.\n\nIn 1825 the British sent another mission to Bangkok led by [[East India Company]] emissary [[Henry Burney]]. They had by now annexed southern Myanmar and were thus Siam's neighbors to the west, and they were also extending their control over [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. The king was reluctant to give in to British demands,<!--What were the British demands?--> but his advisors warned him that Siam would meet the same fate as Myanmar unless the British were accommodated. In 1826, therefore, Siam concluded its first commercial treaty with a Western power, the [[Burney Treaty]]. Under the treaty, Siam agreed to establish a uniform taxation system, to reduce taxes on foreign trade, and to abolish some royal monopolies. As a result, Siam's trade increased rapidly, many more foreigners settled in Bangkok, and Western cultural influences began to spread. The kingdom became wealthier and its army better armed.\n\nA Lao rebellion led by [[Anouvong]] was defeated in 1827, following which Siam destroyed [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], carried out massive forced population transfers from Laos to the more securely held area of [[Isan]], and divided the Lao mueang into smaller units to prevent another uprising. In 1842\u20131845 Siam waged a successful war with Vietnam, which tightened Siamese rule over Cambodia. Rama III's most visible legacy in Bangkok is the [[Wat Pho]] temple complex, which he enlarged and endowed with new temples.\n\nRama III regarded his brother Mongkut, who was said to be very popular among the British, as his heir, although as a monk, Mongkut could not openly assume this role. He used his long sojourn as a monk to acquire a Western education from French and American missionaries and British merchants, one of the first Siamese to do so. He learned English and Latin, and studied science and mathematics. The missionaries no doubt hoped to convert him to Christianity, but he was a strict Buddhist and a Siamese nationalist. He intended using this Western knowledge to strengthen and modernize Siam when he came to the throne, which he did in 1851.\n\nBy the 1840s it was obvious that Siamese independence was in danger from the colonial powers: this was shown dramatically by the British [[First Opium War]] with China in 1839\u20131842. In 1850 the British and Americans sent missions to Bangkok demanding the end of all restrictions on trade, the establishment of a Western-style government and immunity for their citizens from Siamese law ([[extraterritoriality]]). Rama III's government refused these demands, leaving his successor with a dangerous situation. Rama III reportedly said on his deathbed: \"[T]here will be no more wars with Myanmar and Vietnam. We will have them only with the West.\"<ref>{{Cite book |author=David K.

Rattanakosin's rulers welcomed the Chinese economic stimulus. Some ethnic Chinese merchants became court officials. Chinese culture was accepted and promoted. Many Chinese works were translated by ethnic Chinese court dignitaries. Siam's relationship with the Chinese Empire was strong. Rama I claimed his blood-relation with Taksin, worrying that the Chinese court might reject his approval.<!--??--> The relationship was guaranteed by the tributary missions, continuing until the [[Rama IV]]'s reign.\n\n===Enlightenment (1851\u20131868) ===\n[[File:Thomson, King Mongkut of Siam.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Photograph of King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) in western style uniform]]\n{{Main|Mongkut}}\n\n[[File:Flag of Siam (1855).svg|thumb|left|A white elephant, facing the hoist, centered on a red field. National ensign decreed by King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV)|186x186px]]\n\nMongkut came to the throne as [[Rama IV]] in 1851, determined to prevent Siam from falling under colonial domination by forcing modernization on his reluctant subjects. But although he was in theory an absolute monarch, his power was limited. Having been a monk for 27 years, he lacked a base among the powerful royal princes, and did not have a modern state apparatus to carry out his wishes. His first attempts at reform, to establish a modern system of administration and to improve the status of debt-slaves and women, were frustrated.\n\nRama IV came to welcome Western intrusion in Siam. The king himself and his entourages were actively pro-British. This became evident in 1855 when a mission led by the Governor of [[Hong Kong]], [[John Bowring|Sir John Bowring]], arrived in Bangkok with demands for immediate changes, backed by the threat of force. The king readily agreed to demands for a new treaty, called the [[Bowring Treaty]], which restricted import duties to three percent, abolished royal trade monopolies, and granted extraterritoriality to British subjects. Other Western powers soon demanded and got similar concessions.\n\nThe king came to believe that the real threat to Siam came from the French, not the British. The British were interested in commercial advantage, the French in building a colonial empire. They occupied [[Saigon]] in 1859, and 1867 established a [[protectorate]] over southern Vietnam and eastern Cambodia. Rama IV hoped that the British would defend Siam if he gave them the economic concessions they demanded. In the next reign this would prove to be an illusion, but it is true that the British saw Siam as a useful buffer state between British Burma and [[French Indochina]].\n\n====Dhammayuttika Nikaya====\n[[File:Old_dhammayut_seal.jpg|upright|thumb|Old Dhammayuttika seal]]\n[[File:Mongkut in the Sangha.jpeg|upright|thumb|Mongkut observing precepts]]\n{{Main|Dhammayuttika Nikaya}}\n\nThe instrument of Mongkut's religious reformation was a new Buddhist order, the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]].

Rama V was the first Siamese king to have a full Western education, having been taught by a British governess, [[Anna Leonowens]] \u2013 whose place in Siamese history has been fictionalized as ''[[The King and I]]''.  At first Rama V's reign was dominated by the conservative regent, Chaophraya [[Si Suriyawongse]], but when the king came of age in 1873 he soon took control. He created a Privy Council and a Council of State, a formal court system and budget office. He announced that slavery would be gradually abolished and debt-bondage restricted.\n\n{{listen\n|filename=\n|title=\"Sansoen Phra Barami\" (Glorify his prestige)\n|description= \"[[Sansoen Phra Barami]]\"  ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e0d\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e23\u0e21\u0e35}}, lit: glorify his prestige) the [[Royal anthem]] of Siam, beginning in Rama V reign.\n}}\nAt first the princes and conservatives successfully resisted the king's reform agenda, but as the older generation was replaced by younger, Western-educated princes, resistance faded. He found powerful allies in his brothers Prince [[Chakkraphat]], whom he made finance minister, Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Damrong]], who organized interior government and education, and his brother-in-law Prince [[Devrawongse]], foreign minister for 38 years. In 1887 Devrawonge visited Europe to study governmental systems. On his recommendation the king established cabinet government, an audit office, and an education department. The semi-autonomous status of Chiang Mai was ended and the army was reorganized and modernized.\n\nIn 1893 French authorities in Indochina used a minor border dispute to provoke a crisis. French gunboats appeared at Bangkok and demanded the cession of Lao territories east of the [[Mekong]]. The king appealed to the British, but the British minister told the king to settle on whatever terms he could get. The king had no choice but to comply. Britain's only gesture was an agreement with France guaranteeing the integrity of the rest of Siam. In exchange, Siam had to give up its claim to the Tai-speaking Shan region of northeastern Myanmar to the British.\n\nThe French, however, continued to pressure Siam, and in 1906\u20131907 they manufactured another crisis. This time Siam had to concede French control of territory on the west bank of the Mekong opposite Luang Prabang and around [[Champasak (town)|Champasak]] in southern Laos, as well as western Cambodia. The British interceded to prevent more French pressure on Siam, but their price, in 1909 was the acceptance of British sovereignty over of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Perlis]], and [[Terengganu]] under [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]].  All of these \"lost territories\" were on the fringes of the Siamese sphere of influence and had never been securely under their control, but being compelled to abandon all claim to them was a substantial humiliation to both king and country. Historian [[David K. Wyatt]] describes Chulalongkorn as \"broken in spirit and health\" following the 1893 crisis. It became the basis for the country's name change: with the loss of these territories ''Great Siam'' was no more, the king now ruled only the core \"Thai lands\".\n\nMeanwhile, reform continued unabated, transforming an absolute monarchy based on traditional relationships of power into a modern, centralized nation state. The process was increasingly under the control of Rama V's European-educated sons. Railways and telegraph lines united previously remote and semi-autonomous provinces. The currency was tied to the [[gold standard]] and a modern system of taxation replaced the arbitrary levies and corvee labor of the past. The biggest problem was the shortage of trained civil servants, and many foreigners had to be employed until new schools could be built and Siamese graduates produced. By 1910, when the king died, Siam had become a semi-modern country and continued to escape colonial rule.\n\n===From kingdom to modern nation (1910\u20131925) ===\n[[File:King Vajiravudh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI), supported nationalism and modernization]]\n{{Main|Vajiravudh}}\n\nOne of Rama V's reforms was to introduce a Western-style law of royal succession, so in 1910 he was peacefully succeeded by his son Vajiravudh, who reigned as [[Rama VI]]. He had been educated at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] military academy and at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was an anglicized Edwardian gentleman. Indeed, one of Siam's problems was the widening gap between the Westernized royal family and upper aristocracy and the rest of the country. It took another 20 years for Western education to permeate the bureaucracy and the army.\n\nThere had been some political reform under Rama V, but the king was still an absolute monarch, who acted as the head of the cabinet and staffed all the agencies of the state with his own relatives. The new king [[Vajiravudh]], the son of Rama V, with his British education, knew that the rest of the \"new\" nation could not be excluded from government forever, but he had no faith in Western-style democracy. He applied his observations of the success of the British monarchy ruling India, appearing more in public and instituting more royal ceremonies. However Rama VI also carried on his father's modernization plan.\n\nBangkok became more and more the capital of the new nation of Siam. Rama VI's government began several nationwide development projects, despite financial hardship. New roads, bridges, [[State Railway of Thailand|railways]], [[Royal Thai Army#Army Medical Department|hospitals]] and schools mushroomed throughout the country with funds from Bangkok. Newly created \"viceroys\" were appointed to the newly restructured \"Region\", or ''[[Monthon]]'' (Circle), as king's agents supervising administrative affairs in the provinces.\n\nThe king established the ''Wild Tiger Corps'', or ''Kong Suea Pa'' ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32}}), a [[paramilitary]] organization of Siamese of \"good character\" united to further the nation's cause. He also created a junior branch which continues today as the [[National Scout Organization of Thailand]]. The king spent much time on the development of the movements as he saw it as an opportunity to create a bond between himself and loyal citizens. It was also a way to single out and honor his favorites. At first the Wild Tigers were drawn from the king's personal entourage (it is likely that many joined to gain favor with Vajiravudh), but an enthusiasm among the population arose later.\n\nOf the adult movement, a German observer wrote in September 1911: \"This is a troop of volunteers in black uniform, drilled in a more or less military fashion, but without weapons. The British [[Scouting|Scouts]] are apparently the paradigm for the Tiger Corps. In the whole country, at the most far-away places, units of this corps are being set up. One would hardly recognize the quiet and phlegmatic Siamese.\"\n\nThe paramilitary movement largely disappeared by 1927, but was revived and evolved into the [[Village Scouts|Volunteer Defense Corps]], also called the Village Scouts. ({{lang|th|\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|title=Southern Thailand: The Problem with Paramilitaries|publisher=Asia Report|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=27 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229092046/http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]] in Bangkok]]\n\nVajiravudh's style of government differed from that of his father. In the beginning of the sixth reign, the king continued to use his father's team and there was no sudden break in the daily routine of government. Much of the running of daily affairs was therefore in the hands of experienced and competent men. To them and their staff Siam owed many progressive steps, such as the development of a national plan for the education of the whole populace, the setting up of clinics where free vaccination was given against smallpox, and the continuing expansion of railways.\n\nHowever, senior posts were gradually filled with members of the king's coterie when a vacancy occurred through death, retirement, or resignation. By 1915, half the cabinet consisted of new faces. Most notable was Chao Phraya Yomarat's presence and Prince Damrong's absence. He resigned from his post as Minister of the Interior officially because of ill health, but in actuality because of friction between himself and the king.\n\n====Educational reform====\nRama VI was the first king of Siam to set up a model of the constitution at Dusit Palace.  He wanted first to see how things could be managed under this Western system. He saw advantages in the system, and thought that Siam could move slowly towards it, but could not be adopted right away as the majority of the Siamese people did not have enough education to understand such a change just yet. In 1916 [[higher education]] came to Siam. Rama VI set up [[Vajiravudh College]], modeled after the British [[Eton College]], as well as the first Thai university, [[Chulalongkorn University]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Bing Soravij BhiromBhakdi|url=http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama6/rama6.html|title=Rama VI of the Chakri Dynasty|publisher=The Siamese Collection|accessdate=18 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027093258/http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama6/rama6.html|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> modeled after [[Oxbridge]].\n\n<gallery class=\"central\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Vajiravudh College, Thailand, main school building.jpg|Vajiramonkut Building, [[Vajiravudh College]].\nFile:\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e38\u0e18\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e14\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e15 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 (4).JPG|Vajiravudh College.\nFile:Maha Chulalongkorn B.jpg|Maha Chulalongkorn Building, [[Chulalongkorn University]].\n</gallery>\n\n====World War I====\n\n{{Main|Siam during World War I}}\n{| style=\"float:left; width:170px; border:solid #ccc 1px; margin:5px;\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:State Flag of Thailand (1916).svg|170px]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Flag of Thailand.svg|170px]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 5px 0 5px; font-size:85%; line-height:14px;\"|King Rama VI by royal command changed the national flag of Siam in 1917 from the white elephant on a red background to a design with colors inspired by those of the Allies.<br>\n|}\n[[File:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|The Siamese Expeditionary Force during [[World War I]] in Paris, 1919.]]\n\nIn 1917 Siam declared war on [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], mainly to curry favor with the British and the French. Siam's token participation in World War I secured it a seat at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], and Foreign Minister [[Devawongse]] used this opportunity to argue for the repeal of  19th century treaties and the restoration of full Siamese sovereignty. The United States obliged in 1920, while France and Britain delayed until 1925. This victory gained the king some popularity, but it was soon undercut by discontent over other issues, such as his extravagance, which became more noticeable when a sharp postwar recession hit Siam in 1919. There was also concern that the king had no son. He obviously preferred the company of men to women (which did not offend Siamese sensibilities so much as undermine the stability of the monarchy due to the absence of heirs){{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}.\n\nThus when Rama VI died suddenly in 1925, aged only 44, the monarchy was in a weakened state. He was succeeded by his younger brother [[Prajadhipok]].\n\n===The end of absolute rule (1925\u20131932) ===\n[[File:King Prajadhipok portrait photograph.jpg|thumb|right|upright|King [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII), unexpectedly came to the throne in 1925.]]\n{{Main|Prajadhipok}}\n\nUnprepared for his new responsibilities, all Prajadhipok had in his favor was a lively intelligence, a charming diplomacy in his dealings with others, modesty and industrious willingness to learn, and the somewhat tarnished, but still potent, allure of the crown.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, the king diligently read virtually all state papers that came his way, from ministerial submissions to petitions by citizens. Within half a year, only three of Vajiravhud's twelve ministers stayed put, the rest having been replaced by members of the royal family. On the one hand, these appointments brought back men of talent and experience; on the other, it signaled a return to royal oligarchy. The king obviously wanted to demonstrate a clear break with the discredited sixth reign, and the choice of men to fill the top positions appeared to be guided largely by a wish to restore a Chulalongkorn-type government.\n\nThe legacy that Prajadhipok received from his elder brother were problems of the sort that had become chronic in the Sixth Reign. The most urgent of these was the economy: the finances of the state were in chaos, the budget heavily in deficit, and the royal accounts a nightmare of debts and questionable transactions. That the rest of the world was deep in the [[Great Depression]] following World War I did not help the situation either.\n\nVirtually the first act of Prajadipok as king entailed an institutional innovation intended to restore confidence in the monarchy and government, the creation of the [[Supreme Council of State of Siam|Supreme Council of the State]]. This privy council was made up of a number of experienced and extremely competent members of the royal family, including the longtime Minister of the Interior (and  Chulalongkorn's right-hand man) Prince Damrong. Gradually these princes arrogated increasing power by monopolizing all the main ministerial positions. Many of them felt it their duty to make amends for the mistakes of the previous reign, but it was not generally appreciated.\n\nWith the help of this council, the king managed to restore stability to the economy, although at a price of making a significant number of the civil servants redundant and cutting the salary of those that remained. This was obviously unpopular among the officials, and was one of the trigger events for the coup of 1932.\n\nPrajadhipok then turned his attention to the question of future politics in Siam. Inspired by the British example, the king wanted to allow the common people to have a say in the country's affair by the creation of a parliament. A proposed constitution was ordered to be drafted, but the king's wishes were rejected by his advisers, who felt that the population was not yet ready for democracy.\n\n====Revolution====\n[[File:Soldiers Siam 1932.gif|thumb|left|Group of soldiers standing on [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] waiting for orders during the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932|Revolution, 24 June 1932]]]]\n{{Main|Siamese revolution of 1932}}\n\nIn 1932, with the country deep in depression, the Supreme Council opted to introduce cuts in spending, including the military budget. The king foresaw that these policies might create discontent, especially in the army, and he therefore convened a special meeting of officials to explain why the cuts were necessary. In his address he stated the following, \"I myself know nothing at all about finances, and all I can do is listen to the opinions of others and choose the best... If I have made a mistake, I really deserve to be excused by the people of Siam.\"\n\nNo previous monarch of Siam had ever spoken in such terms. Many interpreted the speech not as Prajadhipok apparently intended, namely as a frank appeal for understanding and cooperation. They saw it as a sign of his weakness and evidence that a system which perpetuated the rule of fallible autocrats should be abolished. Serious political disturbances were threatened in the capital, and in April the king agreed to introduce a constitution under which he would share power with a prime minister. This was not enough for the radical elements in the army, however. On 24 June 1932, while the king was at the seaside, the Bangkok garrison mutinied and seized power, led by a group of 49 officers known as \"[[Khana Ratsadon]]\". Thus ended 800 years of [[Monarchy of Thailand#Origin|absolute monarchy]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|History of Thai clothing#Rattanakosin}}\n[[File:King Chulalongkorn wearing raj pattern.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of King Chulalongkorn wearing the ''raj pattern'' costume]]\n\n====Old Rattanakosin====\nAs same as Ayutthaya period, both Thai males and females dressed themselves with a loincloth wrap called ''[[Chang kben|chong kraben]]''.

The kingdom was founded by [[Rama I]] of the [[Chakri Dynasty|Chakri]].

Economic and social progress was made, marked by an increase in foreign trade, the abolition of [[slavery]] and the expansion of formal education to the emerging [[middle class]]. However, the failure to implement substantial political reforms culminated in the [[1932 revolution]] and the abandonment of absolute monarchy in favor of a constitutional monarchy.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chao Phraya Chakri, later Phutthayotfa Chulalok or [[Rama I]].]]\n[[File:Bangkok (early Rattanakosin) map.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map of [[Bangkok]] in the early Rattanakosin period.]]\n[[File:Old Bangkok canals.gif|thumb|right|View of 19th-century Bangkok with the [[Wat Saket|Golden Mount]] in the background.|250px]]\n{{Main|History of Bangkok|Thonburi Kingdom}}\nIn 1767, after dominating Southeast Asia for almost four centuries, [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] was [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u20131767)|brought down]] by invading Myanmarese armies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|title=Historic City of Ayutthaya|publisher=\u00a9 UNESCO World Heritage Center|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023061657/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/576|archive-date=23 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDespite its complete defeat and subsequent occupation by the [[Konbaung dynasty]], Siam made a rapid recovery. The resistance to Myanmarese rule was led by a noble of [[Thai Chinese|Chinese descent]], [[Taksin]], a military leader. Initially based at [[Chanthaburi]] in the southeast, within a year, he had defeated the Myanmarese occupation army and reestablished a Siamese state with its capital at [[Thonburi]] on the west bank of the Chao Phraya, 20&nbsp;km from the sea. In 1768 he was crowned as Taksin. He re-united the [[central Thailand|central Thai]] heartlands under his rule, and in 1769 he also occupied western [[Cambodia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|title=The Thon Buri and Early Bangkok periods|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160210/http://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/History#ref509771|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHe then marched south and reestablished Siamese rule over the [[Malay Peninsula]] as far as [[Penang]] and [[Terengganu]]. Having secured his base in Siam, [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1775\u201376)|Taksin attacked the Myanmarese in the north in 1774]] and captured [[Chiang Mai]] in 1776, permanently uniting Siam and [[Lannathai|Lanna]]. Taksin's leading general in this campaign was [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok|Thong Duang]], known by the title ''Chaophraya'' or Lord Chakri was himself a descendant of [[Mon people]]. In 1778 Chakri led a Siamese army which captured [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], also [[Kingdom of Luang Phrabang|Luang Phrabang]], a northern Lao kingdom submitted, and eventually established Siamese domination over Laotian kingdoms.\n\nDespite these successes, by 1779 Taksin was in political trouble at home. He seems to have developed a religious mania, alienating the powerful Buddhist monk-hood by claiming to be a ''[[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|sotapanna]]'' or divine figure. He was also in troubles with the court officials, Chinese merchants, and missionaries. The foreign observers began to speculate that he would soon be overthrown. In 1782 Taksin sent his armies under Chakri, the future [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama]] I of Rattanakosin, to invade Cambodia, but while they were away a rebellion broke out in the area around the capital. The rebels, who had popular support, offered the throne to General Chakri, the 'supreme general'. Chakri who was on war duty marched back from Cambodia and deposed Taksin, who was purportedly 'secretly executed' shortly after.\n\nChakri ruled under the name Ramathibodi (he was posthumously given the name Phutthayotfa Chulalok), but is now generally known as [[Rama I]], first king of the later known [[Chakri dynasty]]. One of his first decisions was to move the capital across the river to the village of Bang Makok (meaning \"place of [[Spondias|olive plum]]s\").  The new capital was located on the [[Rattanakosin Island|island of Rattanakosin]], protected from attack by the river to the west and by a series of [[Khlong|canals]] to the north, east and south.

His government was carried out by six great ministries ([[Thai royal and noble titles#Krom|Krom]]) headed by royal princes. Four of these administered particular territories: the [[Kalahom]] the south; the [[Mahatthai]] the north and east; the [[Phrakhlang]] the area immediately south of the capital; and the Krom [[Mueang]], the area around Bangkok. The other two were the ministry of lands (Krom Na) and the ministry of the royal court (Krom Wang). The army was controlled by the King's deputy and brother, the [[Uparat]].\n\nThe Myanmarese, seeing the disorder accompanying the overthrow of Taksin, invaded Siam again in 1785. Rama allowed them to occupy both the north and the south, but the ''Uparat'', ''vice-king'', his brother, led the Siamese army into western Siam and crushed the Myanmarese forces in a battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. This was the last major Myanmarese invasion of Siam, although as late as 1802 Myanmarese forces had to be driven out of Lanna. In 1792 the Siamese occupied [[Luang Prabang]] and brought most of Laos under indirect Siamese rule. Cambodia was also effectively ruled by Siam. By the time of his death in 1809 Rama I had created a Siamese overlordship dominating an area considerably larger than modern Thailand.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FMJ8KP8i3v0C&pg=PA1653&lpg=PA1653&dq=invaded+Siam+again+in+1785#v=onepage |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations: S-Z by Cathal J.

[[Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh]], the only member of the Nguy\u1ec5n family still alive, managed to escape across the river to Siam. While in exile Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh wished to retake Gia Dinh and push the Tay-Son rebels out.  He convinced the neutral King [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]] of [[Siam]] to provide him with support troops and a small invasion force.\n\nIn mid-1784 Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh, with 50,000 [[Siam]]ese troops and 300 ships, moved through Cambodia, then East of Tonl\u00e9 Sap and penetrated the recently annexed provinces of Annam. 20,000 Siamese troops reached Kien Giang and another 30,000 landed in Chap Lap, as the Siamese advanced towards [[C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1]]. Later that year the Siamese captured the former Cambodian province of Gia Dinh where, it was claimed, they committed atrocities against the population of Viet settlers.\n\n[[Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7]] anticipating a move from the Siamese, had secretly positioned his infantry along the [[Ti\u1ec1n river]] near present-day [[M\u1ef9 Tho]], and on some islands in the middle, facing other troops on the northern banks with naval reinforcements on both sides of the infantry positions.\n\nOn the morning of 19 January Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 sent a small naval force, under a banner of truce, to lure the Siamese into his trap. After so many victories, the Siamese army and naval forces were confident of a surrender.  So, they went to the parley, unaware of the trap. Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's troops dashed into the Siamese formation, slaughtered the unarmed emissaries and turned on the unprepared troops. The battle ended with a near annihilation of the Siamese force.  All the ships of the Siamese navy were destroyed and only 1,000 of the original expedition survived to escape back across the river into Siam.\n\n====Wars with Myanmar====\n{{main|Nine Armies War}}\nSoon King [[Bodawpaya]] of Myanmar started to pursue his ambitious campaigns to expand his dominions over Siam. The [[Burmese-Siamese War (1785\u20131786)]], also known in Siam as the \"Nine Armies War\" because the Myanmarese came in nine armies, thus broke out. The Myanmarese soldiers poured into Lanna and Northern Siam. Siamese forces, commanded by [[Kawila]], Prince of [[Lampang]], put up a brave fight and delayed the Myanmarese advance, all the while waiting for reinforcements from Bangkok. When [[Phitsanulok]] was captured, [[Anurak Devesh]] the ''Rear Palace'', and Rama I himself led Siamese forces to the north. The Siamese relieved Lampang from the Myanmarese siege.\n\nIn the south, Bodawpaya was waiting at [[Three Pagodas Pass|Chedi Sam Ong]] ready to attack. The Front Palace was ordered to lead his troops to the south and counter-attack the Myanmarese coming to [[Ranong]] through [[Nakhon Si Thammarat]]. He brought the Myanmarese to battle near [[Kanchanaburi]]. The Myanmarese also attacked Thalang ([[Phuket city|Phuket]]), where the governor had just died. His wife Chan, and her sister Mook, gathered the local people and successfully defended Thalang against the Myanmarese. Today, Chan and Mook are revered as heroines because of their opposition to the Myanmarese invasions. In their own lifetimes, Rama I bestowed on them the titles [[Thao Thep Kasattri and Thao Sri Sunthon]].\n\nThe Myanmarese proceeded to capture [[Songkhla]]. Upon hearing the news, the governors of [[Phatthalung]] fled. However, a monk named Phra Maha encouraged the citizens of the area to take up arms against the Myanmarese, his campaign was also successful. Phra Maha was later raised to the nobility by Rama I.\n\nAs his armies were destroyed, Bodawpaya retreated. The next year, he attacked again, this time constituting his troops as a single army. With this force Bodawpaya passed through the Three Pagoda Pass and settled in Ta Din Dang (Three Pagoda Pass.) The Front Palace marched the Siamese forces to face Bodawpaya. The fighting was very short and Bodawpaya was quickly defeated. This short war was called the \"[[Ta Din Dang campaign]]\".\n\n====Economics, culture and religion====\n[[File:Temple of the Emerald Buddha 2012.JPG|280px|thumb|right|[[Wat Phra Kaew]] seen from the Outer Court of [[Grand Palace]].]]\nChinese immigration increased during Rama I's reign, as he maintained Taksin's policy of allowing Chinese immigration to sustain the country's economy. The Chinese were found mainly in the trading and mercantile sector, and by the time his son and grandson came to the throne, European explorers noted that Bangkok was filled with Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] of all sizes.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Thailand|year=2005|author=[[Chris Baker (writer)|Chris Baker]], [[Pasuk Phongpaichit]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofthailan00bake/page/32 32\u201333]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-81615-7|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthailan00bake/page/32}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PB Grand Palace Bangkok.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Temple of the Emerald Buddha]], one of the king's many construction projects.]]\nRama I moved the capital from Thonburi, which was founded by his predecessor Taksin, and built the new capital, [[Bangkok]]. During the first few years prior to the founding of the capital, he oversaw the construction of the palaces and the Chapel Royal.

Monks had already dabbled in superstitions when he first came to power, and Rama I implemented a law which required a monk who wished to travel to another principality for further education to present a certificate bearing his personal particulars, which would establish a monk ''[[wikt:bona fides|bona fides]]'' and that he had been properly ordained. The king also repeatedly emphasized devotion to the Buddha, not to guardian spirits and past rulers, vestiges of ancient [[Animism|animist]] worship which persisted among Thais prior to his rule.<ref name=Tarling-1999>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia|url=https://archive.org/details/chronologyorigi01munsgoog|author=Nicholas Tarling|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-35505-2|author-link=Nicholas Tarling}}</ref>{{RP|221-222}}\n\nThe king also appointed the first [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand|Supreme Patriarch]] of [[Thai Buddhism]], whose responsibilities included ensuring that Rama I's laws were maintained within the Buddhist [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].<ref name=Tarling-1999 />{{RP|222}} Rama I encouraged the translation of ancient [[Pali]] works and Buddhist texts lost in the chaos after the sacking of Ayutthaya by the Myanmarese in 1767.

The Chakri family now controlled all branches of Siamese government \u2014 since Rama I had 42 children, his brother the Uparat had 43, and Rama II had 73, there was no shortage of royal princes to staff the bureaucracy, the army, the senior monk-hood, and the provincial governments. (Most of these were the children of concubines and thus not eligible to inherit the throne.) There was a confrontation with Vietnam, now becoming a major power in the region, over control of Cambodia in 1813, ending with the ''status quo ante'' restored. But during Rama II's reign Western influences again began to be felt in Siam.\n\nIn 1786 the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] occupied [[Penang]], and in 1819 they founded [[Singapore]]. Soon the British displaced the Dutch and Portuguese as the main Western economic and political influence in Siam. The British objected to the Siamese economic system, in which trading monopolies were held by royal princes and businesses were subject to arbitrary taxation. In 1821, the [[East India Company]]'s [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Hastings]], then [[Governor-General of India]], sent company agent [[John Crawfurd#Siam mission|John Crawfurd on a mission]] to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam \u2014 the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th century Siamese politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|title=The Crawford Papers \u2014 A Collection of Official Records relating to the Mission of Dr. John Crawfurd sent to Siam by the Government of India in the year 1821|date=1971|page=285|publisher=Cambridge Journals Online|work=Cambridge.org|accessdate=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927143143/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|archive-date=27 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Art and literature====\n[[File:Sunrise on Hat Saikaew, Koh Samet.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Phra Aphai Mani]] statue on [[Ko Samet]]]]\n{{see also|Sunthon Phu}}\n\nRama II was a lover of the arts and in particular the literary arts. He was an accomplished poet and anyone with the ability to write a refined piece of poetry would gain the favor of the king. This led to his being dubbed the \"poet king\". Due to his patronage, the poet Sunthon Phu was able to raise his [[Thai royal and noble titles|noble title]] from \"phrai\" to \"khun\" and later \"phra\". Sunthon \u2013 also known as the drunken writer \u2013 wrote numerous works, including the epic poem ''[[Phra Aphai Mani]]''.\n\nRama II rewrote much of the great literature from the reign of Rama I in a modern style. He is credited with writing a popular version of the Thai folk tale [[Ramakien]] and wrote a number of dance dramas such as [[Sang Thong]]. The king was an accomplished musician, playing and composing for the fiddle and introducing new instrumental techniques. He was also a sculptor and is said to have sculpted the face of the Niramitr Buddha in [[Wat Arun]]. Because of his artistic achievements, Rama II's birthday is now celebrated as National Artists' Day (Wan Sinlapin Haeng Chat), held in honor of artists who have contributed to the cultural heritage of the kingdom.\n\n===Consolidation (1824\u20131851) ===\n[[File:Map of the Rattanakosin Kingdom.svg|thumb|Zone of influence of the early Rattanakosin Kingdom (King Rama III)]]\n[[File:Rama III.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of King [[Nangklao]] (Rama III). The king fought massive wars against Cambodia and Vietnam.]]\n{{Main|Rama III}}\nRama II died in 1824 and was peacefully succeeded by his son Prince Jessadabondindra, who reigned as King Phra Nangklao, now known as [[Rama III]]. Rama II's younger son, [[Mongkut]], was \"encouraged\" to become a monk, removing him from politics.\n\nIn 1825 the British sent another mission to Bangkok led by [[East India Company]] emissary [[Henry Burney]]. They had by now annexed southern Myanmar and were thus Siam's neighbors to the west, and they were also extending their control over [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. The king was reluctant to give in to British demands,<!--What were the British demands?--> but his advisors warned him that Siam would meet the same fate as Myanmar unless the British were accommodated. In 1826, therefore, Siam concluded its first commercial treaty with a Western power, the [[Burney Treaty]]. Under the treaty, Siam agreed to establish a uniform taxation system, to reduce taxes on foreign trade, and to abolish some royal monopolies. As a result, Siam's trade increased rapidly, many more foreigners settled in Bangkok, and Western cultural influences began to spread. The kingdom became wealthier and its army better armed.\n\nA Lao rebellion led by [[Anouvong]] was defeated in 1827, following which Siam destroyed [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], carried out massive forced population transfers from Laos to the more securely held area of [[Isan]], and divided the Lao mueang into smaller units to prevent another uprising. In 1842\u20131845 Siam waged a successful war with Vietnam, which tightened Siamese rule over Cambodia. Rama III's most visible legacy in Bangkok is the [[Wat Pho]] temple complex, which he enlarged and endowed with new temples.\n\nRama III regarded his brother Mongkut, who was said to be very popular among the British, as his heir, although as a monk, Mongkut could not openly assume this role. He used his long sojourn as a monk to acquire a Western education from French and American missionaries and British merchants, one of the first Siamese to do so. He learned English and Latin, and studied science and mathematics. The missionaries no doubt hoped to convert him to Christianity, but he was a strict Buddhist and a Siamese nationalist. He intended using this Western knowledge to strengthen and modernize Siam when he came to the throne, which he did in 1851.\n\nBy the 1840s it was obvious that Siamese independence was in danger from the colonial powers: this was shown dramatically by the British [[First Opium War]] with China in 1839\u20131842. In 1850 the British and Americans sent missions to Bangkok demanding the end of all restrictions on trade, the establishment of a Western-style government and immunity for their citizens from Siamese law ([[extraterritoriality]]). Rama III's government refused these demands, leaving his successor with a dangerous situation. Rama III reportedly said on his deathbed: \"[T]here will be no more wars with Myanmar and Vietnam. We will have them only with the West.\"<ref>{{Cite book |author=David K.

Rattanakosin's rulers welcomed the Chinese economic stimulus. Some ethnic Chinese merchants became court officials. Chinese culture was accepted and promoted. Many Chinese works were translated by ethnic Chinese court dignitaries. Siam's relationship with the Chinese Empire was strong. Rama I claimed his blood-relation with Taksin, worrying that the Chinese court might reject his approval.<!--??--> The relationship was guaranteed by the tributary missions, continuing until the [[Rama IV]]'s reign.\n\n===Enlightenment (1851\u20131868) ===\n[[File:Thomson, King Mongkut of Siam.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Photograph of King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) in western style uniform]]\n{{Main|Mongkut}}\n\n[[File:Flag of Siam (1855).svg|thumb|left|A white elephant, facing the hoist, centered on a red field. National ensign decreed by King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV)|186x186px]]\n\nMongkut came to the throne as [[Rama IV]] in 1851, determined to prevent Siam from falling under colonial domination by forcing modernization on his reluctant subjects. But although he was in theory an absolute monarch, his power was limited. Having been a monk for 27 years, he lacked a base among the powerful royal princes, and did not have a modern state apparatus to carry out his wishes. His first attempts at reform, to establish a modern system of administration and to improve the status of debt-slaves and women, were frustrated.\n\nRama IV came to welcome Western intrusion in Siam. The king himself and his entourages were actively pro-British. This became evident in 1855 when a mission led by the Governor of [[Hong Kong]], [[John Bowring|Sir John Bowring]], arrived in Bangkok with demands for immediate changes, backed by the threat of force. The king readily agreed to demands for a new treaty, called the [[Bowring Treaty]], which restricted import duties to three percent, abolished royal trade monopolies, and granted extraterritoriality to British subjects. Other Western powers soon demanded and got similar concessions.\n\nThe king came to believe that the real threat to Siam came from the French, not the British. The British were interested in commercial advantage, the French in building a colonial empire. They occupied [[Saigon]] in 1859, and 1867 established a [[protectorate]] over southern Vietnam and eastern Cambodia. Rama IV hoped that the British would defend Siam if he gave them the economic concessions they demanded. In the next reign this would prove to be an illusion, but it is true that the British saw Siam as a useful buffer state between British Burma and [[French Indochina]].\n\n====Dhammayuttika Nikaya====\n[[File:Old_dhammayut_seal.jpg|upright|thumb|Old Dhammayuttika seal]]\n[[File:Mongkut in the Sangha.jpeg|upright|thumb|Mongkut observing precepts]]\n{{Main|Dhammayuttika Nikaya}}\n\nThe instrument of Mongkut's religious reformation was a new Buddhist order, the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]].

Rama V was the first Siamese king to have a full Western education, having been taught by a British governess, [[Anna Leonowens]] \u2013 whose place in Siamese history has been fictionalized as ''[[The King and I]]''.  At first Rama V's reign was dominated by the conservative regent, Chaophraya [[Si Suriyawongse]], but when the king came of age in 1873 he soon took control. He created a Privy Council and a Council of State, a formal court system and budget office. He announced that slavery would be gradually abolished and debt-bondage restricted.\n\n{{listen\n|filename=\n|title=\"Sansoen Phra Barami\" (Glorify his prestige)\n|description= \"[[Sansoen Phra Barami]]\"  ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e0d\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e23\u0e21\u0e35}}, lit: glorify his prestige) the [[Royal anthem]] of Siam, beginning in Rama V reign.\n}}\nAt first the princes and conservatives successfully resisted the king's reform agenda, but as the older generation was replaced by younger, Western-educated princes, resistance faded. He found powerful allies in his brothers Prince [[Chakkraphat]], whom he made finance minister, Prince [[Damrong Rajanubhab|Damrong]], who organized interior government and education, and his brother-in-law Prince [[Devrawongse]], foreign minister for 38 years. In 1887 Devrawonge visited Europe to study governmental systems. On his recommendation the king established cabinet government, an audit office, and an education department. The semi-autonomous status of Chiang Mai was ended and the army was reorganized and modernized.\n\n[[File:Map of Siam (territorial cessions).svg|thumb|Territorial claims abandoned by Siam in the late-19th and early-20th centuries]]\n\nIn 1893 French authorities in Indochina used a minor border dispute to provoke a crisis. French gunboats appeared at Bangkok and demanded the cession of Lao territories east of the [[Mekong]]. The king appealed to the British, but the British minister told the king to settle on whatever terms he could get. The king had no choice but to comply. Britain's only gesture was an agreement with France guaranteeing the integrity of the rest of Siam. In exchange, Siam had to give up its claim to the Tai-speaking Shan region of northeastern Myanmar to the British.\n\nThe French, however, continued to pressure Siam, and in 1906\u20131907 they manufactured another crisis. This time Siam had to concede French control of territory on the west bank of the Mekong opposite Luang Prabang and around [[Champasak (town)|Champasak]] in southern Laos, as well as western Cambodia. The British interceded to prevent more French pressure on Siam, but their price, in 1909 was the acceptance of British sovereignty over of [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Perlis]], and [[Terengganu]] under [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]].  All of these \"lost territories\" were on the fringes of the Siamese sphere of influence and had never been securely under their control, but being compelled to abandon all claim to them was a substantial humiliation to both king and country. Historian [[David K. Wyatt]] describes Chulalongkorn as \"broken in spirit and health\" following the 1893 crisis. It became the basis for the country's name change: with the loss of these territories ''Great Siam'' was no more, the king now ruled only the core \"Thai lands\".\n\nMeanwhile, reform continued unabated, transforming an absolute monarchy based on traditional relationships of power into a modern, centralized nation state. The process was increasingly under the control of Rama V's European-educated sons. Railways and telegraph lines united previously remote and semi-autonomous provinces. The currency was tied to the [[gold standard]] and a modern system of taxation replaced the arbitrary levies and corvee labor of the past. The biggest problem was the shortage of trained civil servants, and many foreigners had to be employed until new schools could be built and Siamese graduates produced. By 1910, when the king died, Siam had become a semi-modern country and continued to escape colonial rule.\n\n===From kingdom to modern nation (1910\u20131925) ===\n[[File:King Vajiravudh.jpg|thumb|upright|right|King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI), supported nationalism and modernization]]\n{{Main|Vajiravudh}}\n\nOne of Rama V's reforms was to introduce a Western-style law of royal succession, so in 1910 he was peacefully succeeded by his son Vajiravudh, who reigned as [[Rama VI]]. He had been educated at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] military academy and at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was an anglicized Edwardian gentleman. Indeed, one of Siam's problems was the widening gap between the Westernized royal family and upper aristocracy and the rest of the country. It took another 20 years for Western education to permeate the bureaucracy and the army.\n\nThere had been some political reform under Rama V, but the king was still an absolute monarch, who acted as the head of the cabinet and staffed all the agencies of the state with his own relatives. The new king [[Vajiravudh]], the son of Rama V, with his British education, knew that the rest of the \"new\" nation could not be excluded from government forever, but he had no faith in Western-style democracy. He applied his observations of the success of the British monarchy ruling India, appearing more in public and instituting more royal ceremonies. However Rama VI also carried on his father's modernization plan.\n\nBangkok became more and more the capital of the new nation of Siam. Rama VI's government began several nationwide development projects, despite financial hardship. New roads, bridges, [[State Railway of Thailand|railways]], [[Royal Thai Army#Army Medical Department|hospitals]] and schools mushroomed throughout the country with funds from Bangkok. Newly created \"viceroys\" were appointed to the newly restructured \"Region\", or ''[[Monthon]]'' (Circle), as king's agents supervising administrative affairs in the provinces.\n\nThe king established the ''Wild Tiger Corps'', or ''Kong Suea Pa'' ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32}}), a [[paramilitary]] organization of Siamese of \"good character\" united to further the nation's cause. He also created a junior branch which continues today as the [[National Scout Organization of Thailand]]. The king spent much time on the development of the movements as he saw it as an opportunity to create a bond between himself and loyal citizens. It was also a way to single out and honor his favorites. At first the Wild Tigers were drawn from the king's personal entourage (it is likely that many joined to gain favor with Vajiravudh), but an enthusiasm among the population arose later.\n\nOf the adult movement, a German observer wrote in September 1911: \"This is a troop of volunteers in black uniform, drilled in a more or less military fashion, but without weapons. The British [[Scouting|Scouts]] are apparently the paradigm for the Tiger Corps. In the whole country, at the most far-away places, units of this corps are being set up. One would hardly recognize the quiet and phlegmatic Siamese.\"\n\nThe paramilitary movement largely disappeared by 1927, but was revived and evolved into the [[Village Scouts|Volunteer Defense Corps]], also called the Village Scouts. ({{lang|th|\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|title=Southern Thailand: The Problem with Paramilitaries|publisher=Asia Report|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=27 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229092046/http://www.seasite.niu.edu:85/Thai/Islam_in_Thailand/140_southern_thailand___the_problem_with_paramilitaries.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall]] in Bangkok]]\n\nVajiravudh's style of government differed from that of his father. In the beginning of the sixth reign, the king continued to use his father's team and there was no sudden break in the daily routine of government. Much of the running of daily affairs was therefore in the hands of experienced and competent men. To them and their staff Siam owed many progressive steps, such as the development of a national plan for the education of the whole populace, the setting up of clinics where free vaccination was given against smallpox, and the continuing expansion of railways.\n\nHowever, senior posts were gradually filled with members of the king's coterie when a vacancy occurred through death, retirement, or resignation. By 1915, half the cabinet consisted of new faces. Most notable was Chao Phraya Yomarat's presence and Prince Damrong's absence. He resigned from his post as Minister of the Interior officially because of ill health, but in actuality because of friction between himself and the king.\n\n====Educational reform====\nRama VI was the first king of Siam to set up a model of the constitution at Dusit Palace.  He wanted first to see how things could be managed under this Western system. He saw advantages in the system, and thought that Siam could move slowly towards it, but could not be adopted right away as the majority of the Siamese people did not have enough education to understand such a change just yet. In 1916 [[higher education]] came to Siam. Rama VI set up [[Vajiravudh College]], modeled after the British [[Eton College]], as well as the first Thai university, [[Chulalongkorn University]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Bing Soravij BhiromBhakdi|url=http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama6/rama6.html|title=Rama VI of the Chakri Dynasty|publisher=The Siamese Collection|accessdate=18 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027093258/http://www.soravij.com/royalty/rama6/rama6.html|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> modeled after [[Oxbridge]].\n\n<gallery class=\"central\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Vajiravudh College, Thailand, main school building.jpg|Vajiramonkut Building, [[Vajiravudh College]].\nFile:\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e27\u0e38\u0e18\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e14\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e15 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 (4).JPG|Vajiravudh College.\nFile:Maha Chulalongkorn B.jpg|Maha Chulalongkorn Building, [[Chulalongkorn University]].\n</gallery>\n\n====World War I====\n\n{{Main|Siam during World War I}}\n{| style=\"float:left; width:170px; border:solid #ccc 1px; margin:5px;\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:State Flag of Thailand (1916).svg|170px]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:Flag of Thailand.svg|170px]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 5px 0 5px; font-size:85%; line-height:14px;\"|King Rama VI by royal command changed the national flag of Siam in 1917 from the white elephant on a red background to a design with colors inspired by those of the Allies.<br>\n|}\n[[File:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|The Siamese Expeditionary Force during [[World War I]] in Paris, 1919.]]\n\nIn 1917 Siam declared war on [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], mainly to curry favor with the British and the French. Siam's token participation in World War I secured it a seat at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], and Foreign Minister [[Devawongse]] used this opportunity to argue for the repeal of  19th century treaties and the restoration of full Siamese sovereignty. The United States obliged in 1920, while France and Britain delayed until 1925. This victory gained the king some popularity, but it was soon undercut by discontent over other issues, such as his extravagance, which became more noticeable when a sharp postwar recession hit Siam in 1919. There was also concern that the king had no son. He obviously preferred the company of men to women (which did not offend Siamese sensibilities so much as undermine the stability of the monarchy due to the absence of heirs){{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}.\n\nThus when Rama VI died suddenly in 1925, aged only 44, the monarchy was in a weakened state. He was succeeded by his younger brother [[Prajadhipok]].\n\n===The end of absolute rule (1925\u20131932) ===\n[[File:King Prajadhipok portrait photograph.jpg|thumb|right|upright|King [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII), unexpectedly came to the throne in 1925.]]\n{{Main|Prajadhipok}}\n\nUnprepared for his new responsibilities, all Prajadhipok had in his favor was a lively intelligence, a charming diplomacy in his dealings with others, modesty and industrious willingness to learn, and the somewhat tarnished, but still potent, allure of the crown.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, the king diligently read virtually all state papers that came his way, from ministerial submissions to petitions by citizens. Within half a year, only three of Vajiravhud's twelve ministers stayed put, the rest having been replaced by members of the royal family. On the one hand, these appointments brought back men of talent and experience; on the other, it signaled a return to royal oligarchy. The king obviously wanted to demonstrate a clear break with the discredited sixth reign, and the choice of men to fill the top positions appeared to be guided largely by a wish to restore a Chulalongkorn-type government.\n\nThe legacy that Prajadhipok received from his elder brother were problems of the sort that had become chronic in the Sixth Reign. The most urgent of these was the economy: the finances of the state were in chaos, the budget heavily in deficit, and the royal accounts a nightmare of debts and questionable transactions. That the rest of the world was deep in the [[Great Depression]] following World War I did not help the situation either.\n\nVirtually the first act of Prajadipok as king entailed an institutional innovation intended to restore confidence in the monarchy and government, the creation of the [[Supreme Council of State of Siam|Supreme Council of the State]]. This privy council was made up of a number of experienced and extremely competent members of the royal family, including the longtime Minister of the Interior (and  Chulalongkorn's right-hand man) Prince Damrong. Gradually these princes arrogated increasing power by monopolizing all the main ministerial positions. Many of them felt it their duty to make amends for the mistakes of the previous reign, but it was not generally appreciated.\n\nWith the help of this council, the king managed to restore stability to the economy, although at a price of making a significant number of the civil servants redundant and cutting the salary of those that remained. This was obviously unpopular among the officials, and was one of the trigger events for the coup of 1932.\n\nPrajadhipok then turned his attention to the question of future politics in Siam. Inspired by the British example, the king wanted to allow the common people to have a say in the country's affair by the creation of a parliament. A proposed constitution was ordered to be drafted, but the king's wishes were rejected by his advisers, who felt that the population was not yet ready for democracy.\n\n====Revolution====\n[[File:Soldiers Siam 1932.gif|thumb|left|Group of soldiers standing on [[Royal Plaza (Thailand)|Royal Plaza]] waiting for orders during the [[Siamese Revolution of 1932|Revolution, 24 June 1932]]]]\n{{Main|Siamese revolution of 1932}}\n\nIn 1932, with the country deep in depression, the Supreme Council opted to introduce cuts in spending, including the military budget. The king foresaw that these policies might create discontent, especially in the army, and he therefore convened a special meeting of officials to explain why the cuts were necessary. In his address he stated the following, \"I myself know nothing at all about finances, and all I can do is listen to the opinions of others and choose the best... If I have made a mistake, I really deserve to be excused by the people of Siam.\"\n\nNo previous monarch of Siam had ever spoken in such terms. Many interpreted the speech not as Prajadhipok apparently intended, namely as a frank appeal for understanding and cooperation. They saw it as a sign of his weakness and evidence that a system which perpetuated the rule of fallible autocrats should be abolished. Serious political disturbances were threatened in the capital, and in April the king agreed to introduce a constitution under which he would share power with a prime minister. This was not enough for the radical elements in the army, however. On 24 June 1932, while the king was at the seaside, the Bangkok garrison mutinied and seized power, led by a group of 49 officers known as \"[[Khana Ratsadon]]\". Thus ended 800 years of [[Monarchy of Thailand#Origin|absolute monarchy]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Clothing===\n{{Main|History of Thai clothing#Rattanakosin}}\n[[File:King Chulalongkorn wearing raj pattern.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of King Chulalongkorn wearing the ''raj pattern'' costume]]\n\n====Old Rattanakosin====\nAs same as Ayutthaya period, both Thai males and females dressed themselves with a loincloth wrap called ''[[Chang kben|chong kraben]]''.

From 1862 to 1865, Quimby and Eddy engaged in lengthy discussions about healing methods practiced by Quimby and others. The extent to which he influenced her is much debated. Originally, Eddy gave Quimby much credit for his hypnotic treatments of her nervous and physical conditions and initially thought his brand of [[mesmerism]] entirely benign.<ref>Robert Peel, ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, Chapter 6, Sections I, II.<!--page?--></ref>\n\nQuimby wrote in 1864, \"The wise man, in like measure&nbsp;... knows that the light of the body or natural man is but the reflection of the scientific man.

But we also know that light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.<ref>Cather and Milmine 1909, 60.</ref>}}\n\nQuimby had his own notions concerning the nature of these unseen forces which Eddy accepted early on, but she later drew decidedly different opinions on the nature of thought on the body and rejected any form of [[hypnotism]]. It is evident that Eddy and Quimby worked together, appreciated one another, and learned from one another. Quimby reportedly later said that he learned more from Eddy than she did from him. Eddy clearly respected him and, at one point, referred to him as an \"advanced thinker\" with a \"high and noble character\".<ref>Peel 1971, 172, 183.</ref> She later disavowed the hypnotic aspect of Quimby's methods. In ''Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,'' she calls hypnotism mere deception practiced by those who aim to control the patient: \"The Christian Scientist demonstrates that divine Mind heals, while the hypnotist dispossesses the patient of his individuality in order to control him.\"<ref>Mary Baker Eddy, \"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,\" 375.</ref>\n\n==Fall in Lynn==\nOn February 1, 1866, Eddy slipped and fell on ice while walking in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], causing a spinal injury:\n\n{{quote|On the third day thereafter, I called for my Bible, and opened it at Matthew, 9:2 [And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.<small>(King James Bible) </small>].

He also called his method of healing the \"science of health\" and the \"science of Christ,\" and had used the term \"Christian Science\" to describe his work.<ref>Walter Martin, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', Bethany House Publishers, 2003, 151.</ref> According to the historian of science James C. Whorton, \"In Quimby's mind, Christ and science were synonymous; his method of healing he thus called the Science of Christ and even, toward the close of his life, \"Christian Science.\"<ref>James C. Whorton, ''Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=RU0DndWVSPoC&pg=PA119 119].</ref>\n\nSeveral writers, including [[Willa Cather]] and [[Georgine Milmine]] in ''[[McClure's]]'', and [[Martin Gardner]], have written that Eddy took many of her ideas from Quimby without giving him any kind of credit. Todd Jay Leonard summarized the controversy:\n\n{{quote|Many critics of Eddy maintained that she basically stole all of her ideas from her longtime teacher, Phineas P. Quimby. It was he who had worked to develop the healing system that she adopted to be used as the base-doctrine in Christian Science. If she did not take all of his ideas, she, at the very least, based her system of healing on his basic treatises about mental healing.<ref>Todd 2005, 32.</ref>}}\n\nEddy found that while at first hypnotism seemed to benefit the patient, it later created more problems than the original sickness. Ultimately she rejected any form of hypnotism or mesmerism, stating: \"The hypnotizer employs one error to destroy another. If he heals sickness through a belief, and a belief originally caused the sickness, it is a case of the greater error overcoming the lesser.  This greater error thereafter occupies the ground, leaving the case worse than before it was grasped by the stronger error.\"<ref>Eddy, ''Science and Health'', 104:22\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Hinduism===\nIn the 24th edition of ''Science and Health'', up to the 33rd edition, Eddy admitted the harmony between [[Vedanta|Vedanta philosophy]] and Christian Science. She also quoted certain passages from an English translation of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], but they were later removed. According to Gill, in the 1891 revision Eddy removed from her book all the references to [[Eastern religions]] which her editor, Reverend [[James Henry Wiggin]], had introduced.<ref>Gill 1998, 332\u2013333.</ref> On this issue [[Swami Abhedananda]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|Mrs. Eddy quoted certain passages from the English edition of the Bhagavad-Gita, but unfortunately, for some reason, those passages of the Gita were omitted in the 34th edition of the book, Science and Health ... if we closely study Mrs. Eddy's book, we find that Mrs. Eddy has incorporated in her book most of the salient features of Vedanta philosophy, but she denied the debt flatly.<ref>Swami Prajnanananda, ''The Philosophical Ideas of Swami Abhedananada'', Calcutta: Ramakrishna Vedanta Math, 1971, 164.</ref>}}\n\nOther writers, such as [[Jyotirmayananda Saraswati]], have said that Eddy may have been influenced by ancient [[Hindu]] philosophy.<ref>Maya Nanda, ''Vivekananda: His Gospel of Man-making with a Garland of Tributes and a Chronicle of his Life and Times, with Pictures'', Swami Jyotirmayananda, 1993, 480; Timothy Miller, ''America's Alternative Religions'', State University of New York, 1995, 174.</ref> The [[historian]] Damodar Singhal wrote:\n\n{{quote|The Christian Science movement in America was possibly influenced by India. The founder of this movement, Mary Baker Eddy, in common with the Vedantins, believed that matter and suffering were unreal, and that a full realization of this fact was essential for relief from ills and pains ... The Christian Science doctrine has naturally been given a Christian framework, but the echoes of Vedanta in its literature are often striking.<ref>Damodar Singhal, ''Modern Indian Society and Culture'', Meenakshi Prakashan, 1980, 136.</ref>}}\n\nWendell Thomas in ''[[Hinduism Invades America]]'' (1930) suggested that Eddy may have discovered [[Hinduism]] through the teachings of the [[Transcendentalism|New England Transcendentalists]] such as [[Bronson Alcott]].<ref>Wendell Thomas, ''Hinduism Invades America'', The Beacon Press, Inc., 1930, 228\u2013234 ([https://archive.org/stream/hinduisminvadesa013865mbp#page/n227/mode/2up archive.org]).</ref> [[Stephen Gottschalk]], in his ''The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life'' (1973), wrote:\n\n{{quote|The association of Christian Science with Eastern religion would seem to have had some basis in Mrs Eddy's own writings. For in some early editions of ''Science and Health'' she had quoted from and commented favorably upon a few Hindu and Buddhist texts ... None of these references, however, was to remain a part of Science and Health as it finally stood ... Increasingly from the mid-1880s on, Mrs Eddy made a sharp distinction between Christian Science and Eastern religions.<ref>[[Stephen Gottschalk]], ''The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life'', University of California Press, 1973, 152\u2013153.</ref>}}\n\nIn regards to the influence of Eastern religions on her discovery of Christian Science, Eddy states in ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist and Miscellany'': \"Think not that Christian Science tends towards [[Buddhism]] or any other 'ism'.

By the 1870s she was telling her students, \"Some day I will have a church of my own.\"<ref>Robert Peel, ''Mary Baker Eddy, The Years of Trial'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, 62.</ref> In 1879 she and her students established the Church of Christ, Scientist, \"to commemorate the word and works of our Master [Jesus], which should reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing.\"<ref>Eddy, ''Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist'', 1910, 17\u201318.</ref> In 1892 at Eddy's direction, the church reorganized as The First Church of Christ, Scientist,  \"designed to be built on the Rock, Christ. ... \"<ref>Eddy, ''Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist'', 1910, 18\u201319.</ref> In 1881, she founded the [[Massachusetts Metaphysical College]],<ref>Peel 1971, 81\u201382.</ref> where she taught approximately 800 students between the years 1882 and 1889, when she closed it.<ref>Peel 1977, 483, n. 104.</ref> Eddy charged her students $300 each for tuition. This was a large sum for the period and generated considerable controversy.<ref>Eric Caplan, ''Mind Games: American Culture and the Birth of Psychotherapy'', University of California Press, 2001, 75.</ref>\n\nHer students spread across the country practicing healing, and instructing others. Eddy authorized these students to list themselves as [[Christian Science Practitioner]]s in the church's periodical, ''[[The Christian Science Journal]]''. She also founded the ''[[Christian Science Sentinel]]'', a weekly magazine with articles about how to heal and testimonies of healing.\n\nIn 1888, a reading room selling Bibles, her writings and other publications opened in Boston.<ref>A New Home,\" ''The Christian Science Journal'', September 1888, 317.</ref> This model would soon be replicated, and branch churches worldwide maintain more than 1,200 Christian Science Reading Rooms today.<ref>See Christian Science Reading Room listings in current edition of the Christian Science Journal.</ref>\n\nIn 1894 an edifice for The First Church of Christ, Scientist was completed in Boston (The Mother Church).

In 1895 she ordained the Bible and ''Science and Health'' as the pastor.<ref>NOTES: Eddy, Manual of the Mother Church, 58.</ref>\n\nEddy founded The Christian Science Publishing Society in 1898, which became the publishing home for numerous publications launched by her and her followers.<ref>Peel 1977, 372.</ref> In 1908, at the age of 87, she founded ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', a daily newspaper.<ref>Gill 1998, xv.</ref> She also founded the ''Christian Science Journal'' in 1883,<ref>Gill 1998, 325.</ref> a monthly magazine aimed at the church's members and, in 1898,<ref>Gill 1998, 410.</ref> the ''Christian Science Sentinel'', a weekly religious periodical written for a more general audience, and the ''[[Herald of Christian Science]]'', a religious magazine with editions in many languages.<ref>Peel 1977, 415, n. 121.</ref>\n\n==Malicious animal magnetism==\nThe converse of [[mental healing]] was the use of mental powers to destroy people's health \u2013 what Eddy termed \"malicious animal magnetism.\" She was concerned that a new practitioner could inadvertently harm a patient through unenlightened use of their mental powers, and that less scrupulous individuals could use such powers as a weapon.<ref>Laurence Moore, ''Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans'', Oxford University Press, 1986.</ref>\n\nIn 1872 Eddy had an argument with her student Richard Kennedy and he was expelled from Christian Science. Later she came to believe that he was using mental powers to destroy her so she ordered her students to \"mobilize all their mental energy to combat him\".<ref>Ruth A. Tucker, ''Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzHsXbXOab0C&pg=PA157 157].</ref> Eddy also ordered her students to stand outside her bedroom door to protect her from any mental attacks directed at her. In 1882 Eddy publicly claimed that her last husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy, had died of \"mental assassination\".<ref>Miller 1995, 62.</ref> Daniel Spofford was another Christian Scientist expelled by Eddy after she accused him of practicing malicious animal magnetism.<ref>John S.

Like most life experiences, it formed her lifelong, diligent research for a remedy from almost constant suffering. Eddy writes in her autobiography, \"From my very childhood I was impelled by a hunger and thirst after divine things, - a desire for something higher and better than matter, and apart from it, - to seek diligently for the knowledge of God as the one great and ever-present relief from human woe.\" She also writes on page 33 of the chapter, \"Medical Experiments,\" in her autobiography, \"I wandered through the dim mazes of 'materia medica,' till I was weary of 'scientific guessing,' as it has been well called.

Eddy had written in her autobiography in 1891 that she was 12 when this happened, and that she had discussed the idea of [[predestination]] with the pastor during the examination for her membership; this may have been an attempt to reflect the story of a 12-year-old [[Finding in the Temple|Jesus in the Temple]].<ref>Eddy, ''Retrospection and Introspection'', 14\u201315; Cather and Milmine, ''McClure's'', January 1907, 237.</ref> She wrote in response to the ''McClure's'' article that the date of her church membership may have been mistaken by her.<ref>Eddy, ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany'', 311: \"My reply to the statement that the clerk's book shows that I joined the Tilton Congregational Church at the age of seventeen is that my religious experience seemed to culminate at twelve years of age.

They had married in December 1843 and set up home in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where Glover had business, but he died of [[yellow fever]] in June 1844 while living in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. Eddy was with him in Wilmington, six months pregnant. She had to make her way back to New Hampshire, 1,400 miles by train and steamboat, where her only child George Washington II was born on 12 September in her father's home.<ref>Gottschalk 2006, 62\u201363; Gill 1998, xxix, 68\u201369</ref>\n\nHer husband's death, the journey back, and the birth left her physically and mentally exhausted, and she ended up bedridden for months.<ref>Gottschalk 2006, 63.</ref> She tried to earn a living by writing articles for the New Hampshire ''Patriot'' and various [[Odd Fellows]] and [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] publications.
