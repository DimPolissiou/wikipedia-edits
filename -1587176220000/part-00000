{"title_page": "List of state and territorial universities in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2013}}\n<span class=\"plainlinks\"></span>\nIn the [[United States]], a '''state college''' or '''state university''' is one of the [[Public university|public]] [[List of colleges and universities|colleges or universities]] funded by or associated with the [[State governments of the United States|state government]]. In some cases, these institutions of [[higher education|higher learning]] are part of a [[state university]] system, while in other cases they are not. Several [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] also administer public colleges and universities.\n\nAlthough most of these institutions are associated with state governments, a small number of public institutions are directly funded and governed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], including the [[United States Service academies|service academies]], the [[Community College of the Air Force]], the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], the [[Air Force Institute of Technology]], the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]], military [[War College (disambiguation)|war college]]s and [[staff college]]s, and [[Haskell Indian Nations University]]. A few universities - [[Georgetown University]], [[Gallaudet University]], [[Howard University]], and [[American University]] - are private universities in the District of Columbia that are federally chartered by the United States Government. \n\nThese state, as well as private, universities are accredited by different regional, not national, accreditation agencies, including the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]], the [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]], the [[Higher Learning Commission]], the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], and the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]], depending on which region of the United States the university is located in. These accreditation agencies' approvals are critical to a university's operations and public reputation. If a university loses accreditation or is not accredited in the first place, students will be reluctant to either continue or enroll at the school because the degree will be seen as being worthless. In a worst-case scenario, a university can shut down completely. The aforementioned agencies are all recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]].\n\nMost state universities receive at least part of their funding from the state, although many have substantial income from [[tuition]] and fees, [[Financial endowment|endowment]] proceeds, donations (such as from alumni or philanthropists), and revenue from [[royalties]]. State universities usually offer lower tuition costs to in-state residents. According to the [[College Board]], public four-year colleges charge on average $7,605 per year in tuition and fees for full-time in-state students and $11,990 for out-of-state students.<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/pay/add-it-up/4494.html]</ref> Substantial financial support is also provided by the federal government, particularly through federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]].\n\nIn some states, e.g. [[Maryland]], [[Tennessee]], [[Indiana]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], there is a campus designated as the \"flagship\" campus in the state's university system, which generally is the most prestigious campus and the largest campus in student population, e.g. the [[University of Maryland College Park]] campus in the [[University System of Maryland]], the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] campus in the [[Indiana University (system)|Indiana University System]], the [[University of Tennessee Knoxville]] campus in the [[University of Tennessee System]], and the [[University of Washington]]'s Seattle campus in the University of Washington System.\n\nHowever, in some other states, the state universities are treated as equal partners; therefore there is no officially recognized flagship campus in the state's university system.<ref>[http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl Idaho] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411025340/http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl |date=2013-04-11 }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of states that have more than one university system, e.g. [[California]] with 2; [[Colorado]] with 2; [[Indiana]] with 2; [[New York (state)|New York]] with 2; [[Tennessee]] with 2; and [[Texas]] with 6 (the most).\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\n'''Notes:'''\n*As a general rule, schools are not alphabetized by their complete names, but rather by the names by which they are normally called. For example, in a list alphabetized by normal rules, \"Auburn University\" would precede \"University of Alabama,\" but the schools are virtually always referred to in popular conversation as \"Auburn\" and \"Alabama\" (followed by a campus identifier if required by the context). Therefore, in this article, \"Alabama\" precedes \"Auburn\".\n*The list includes some of the more common academic nicknames or acronyms used for certain colleges or universities, e.g. \"Ole Miss\" for the University of Mississippi, \"Idaho State\" for Idaho State University, or \"UNF\" for the University of North Florida, not the \"Rebels\", \"Bengals\", or \"Ospreys\", respectively. \n**To minimize any confusion regarding acronyms, either the first school listed or the school that is more nationally known having an acronym the same as another has the acronym provided, e.g. San Diego State University has the acronym \"SDSU\" included because it is listed before South Dakota State University, and Arizona State University has the acronym \"ASU\" given because it is better known nationally than Alabama State. In addition, only acronyms that are unique are given, e.g. \"UW Tacoma\" for the University of Washington's Tacoma campus or \"UNH\" for the University of New Hampshire. \n*The list also includes schools that grant first-professional doctorates only (e.g., [[medical school]]s, [[law school]]s, or [[Schools of veterinary medicine|veterinary schools]]) that are independent of any other school in a state system.\n*Satellite campuses that do not have accreditation separate from the mother institution are not included in the list, e.g. [[University of Washington Tacoma]] remains an integral part of the [[University of Washington]], which is based in Seattle. On the other hand, institutions like [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] and [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] are provided separate entries as they are considered independent, autonomous institutions. \n*To see a list of community colleges and technical centers in the United States that offer only [[associate's degrees]], visit the [[List of community colleges|community colleges list]].\n*To see a list of tribal colleges and universities in the United States, visit the [[List of tribal colleges and universities|tribal colleges and universities list]].\n*Non-[[bachelor's degree]]-granting institutions, such as [[graduate school]]s, are listed in ''italics''.\n\n<!---This list is for public 4 year regionally accredited state universities only, not for private or for-profit schools nor for community colleges. Technical institutions are to be listed here only if they either have 4 year degree programs or ''are'' 4 year colleges. Also, satellite campuses that do not have separate regional accreditation from the mother institution should NOT be included in the list. Tribal colleges and universities are on their own page due to the fact that tribal institutions are controlled and operated by various American Indian tribes (who have dual sovereignty in the United States), not states.!--->\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Alabama==\n*[[Alabama A&M University]] (Alabama A&M)\n*[[Alabama State University]] (Alabama State)\n*[[Athens State University]]\n*Auburn University system\n**[[Auburn University]] (Auburn) ([[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[Auburn University at Montgomery]]\n*[[Jacksonville State University]]\n*[[Troy University]]\n*[[University of Alabama System]]\n**[[University of Alabama]] (Alabama) ([[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB)\n**[[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH)\n*[[University of Montevallo]]\n*[[University of North Alabama]] (UNA)\n*[[University of South Alabama]] (USA)\n*[[University of West Alabama]] (UWA)\n\n==Alaska==\n*[[University of Alaska System]]\n**[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] (UAF) ([[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alaska Anchorage]] (UAA)\n**[[University of Alaska Southeast]] (UAS)\n\n==Arizona==\n\n* [[Arizona Board of Regents]]\n**[[Arizona State University]] (ASU)\n**[[Northern Arizona University]] (NAU)\n**[[University of Arizona]]\n\n==Arkansas==\n*[[University of Arkansas System]]\n**[[University of Arkansas]] (Arkansas) ([[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Arkansas\u2013Fort Smith]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]\n**''[[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]]''\n**[[University of Arkansas at Monticello]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]]\n*[[Arkansas State University System]]\n**[[Arkansas State University]]\n*[[Arkansas Tech University]]\n*[[University of Central Arkansas]] (UCA, Central Arkansas)\n*[[Henderson State University]]\n*[[Southern Arkansas University]] (SAU)\n\n==California==\n*[[University of California]] system\n**[[University of California, Berkeley]] (UC Berkeley) \n**[[University of California, Davis]] (UC Davis)\n**[[University of California, Irvine]] (UC Irvine)\n**[[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA)\n**[[University of California, Merced]] (UC Merced)\n**[[University of California, Riverside]] (UC Riverside)\n**[[University of California, San Diego]] (UC San Diego)\n**''[[University of California, San Francisco]]''  (UCSF)\n**[[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB)\n**[[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UC Santa Cruz)\n**''[[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]]'' (law school;

In some cases, these institutions of [[higher education|higher learning]] are part of a [[state university]] system, while in other cases they are not. Several [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] also administer public colleges and universities.\n\nAlthough most of these institutions are associated with state governments, a small number of public institutions are directly funded and governed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], including the [[United States Service academies|service academies]], the [[Community College of the Air Force]], the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], the [[Air Force Institute of Technology]], the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]], military [[War College (disambiguation)|war college]]s and [[staff college]]s, and [[Haskell Indian Nations University]]. A few universities - [[Georgetown University]], [[Gallaudet University]], [[Howard University]], and [[American University]] - are private universities in the District of Columbia that are federally chartered by the United States Government. \n\nThese state, as well as private, universities are accredited by different regional, not national, accreditation agencies, including the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]], the [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]], the [[Higher Learning Commission]], the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], and the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]], depending on which region of the United States the university is located in. These accreditation agencies' approvals are critical to a university's operations and public reputation. If a university loses accreditation or is not accredited in the first place, students will be reluctant to either continue or enroll at the school because the degree will be seen as being worthless. In a worst-case scenario, a university can shut down completely. The aforementioned agencies are all recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]].\n\nMost state universities receive at least part of their funding from the state, although many have substantial income from [[tuition]] and fees, [[Financial endowment|endowment]] proceeds, donations (such as from alumni or philanthropists), and revenue from [[royalties]]. State universities usually offer lower tuition costs to in-state residents. According to the [[College Board]], public four-year colleges charge on average $7,605 per year in tuition and fees for full-time in-state students and $11,990 for out-of-state students.<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/pay/add-it-up/4494.html]</ref> Substantial financial support is also provided by the federal government, particularly through federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]].\n\nIn some states, e.g. [[Maryland]], [[Tennessee]], [[Indiana]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], there is a campus designated as the \"flagship\" campus in the state's university system, which generally is the most prestigious campus and the largest campus in student population, e.g. the [[University of Maryland College Park]] campus in the [[University System of Maryland]], the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] campus in the [[Indiana University (system)|Indiana University System]], the [[University of Tennessee Knoxville]] campus in the [[University of Tennessee System]], and the [[University of Washington]]'s Seattle campus in the University of Washington System.\n\nHowever, in some other states, the state universities are treated as equal partners; therefore there is no officially recognized flagship campus in the state's university system.<ref>[http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl Idaho] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411025340/http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl |date=2013-04-11 }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of states that have more than one university system, e.g. [[California]] with 2; [[Colorado]] with 2; [[Indiana]] with 2; [[New York (state)|New York]] with 2; [[Tennessee]] with 2; and [[Texas]] with 6 (the most).\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\n'''Notes:'''\n*As a general rule, schools are not alphabetized by their complete names, but rather by the names by which they are normally called. For example, in a list alphabetized by normal rules, \"Auburn University\" would precede \"University of Alabama,\" but the schools are virtually always referred to in popular conversation as \"Auburn\" and \"Alabama\" (followed by a campus identifier if required by the context). Therefore, in this article, \"Alabama\" precedes \"Auburn\".\n*The list includes some of the more common academic nicknames or acronyms used for certain colleges or universities, e.g. \"Ole Miss\" for the University of Mississippi, \"Idaho State\" for Idaho State University, or \"UNF\" for the University of North Florida, not the \"Rebels\", \"Bengals\", or \"Ospreys\", respectively. \n**To minimize any confusion regarding acronyms, either the first school listed or the school that is more nationally known having an acronym the same as another has the acronym provided, e.g. San Diego State University has the acronym \"SDSU\" included because it is listed before South Dakota State University, and Arizona State University has the acronym \"ASU\" given because it is better known nationally than Alabama State. In addition, only acronyms that are unique are given, e.g. \"UW Tacoma\" for the University of Washington's Tacoma campus or \"UNH\" for the University of New Hampshire. \n*The list also includes schools that grant first-professional doctorates only (e.g., [[medical school]]s, [[law school]]s, or [[Schools of veterinary medicine|veterinary schools]]) that are independent of any other school in a state system.\n*Satellite campuses that do not have accreditation separate from the mother institution are not included in the list, e.g. [[University of Washington Tacoma]] remains an integral part of the [[University of Washington]], which is based in Seattle. On the other hand, institutions like [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] and [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] are provided separate entries as they are considered independent, autonomous institutions. \n*To see a list of community colleges and technical centers in the United States that offer only [[associate's degrees]], visit the [[List of community colleges|community colleges list]].\n*To see a list of tribal colleges and universities in the United States, visit the [[List of tribal colleges and universities|tribal colleges and universities list]].\n*Non-[[bachelor's degree]]-granting institutions, such as [[graduate school]]s, are listed in ''italics''.\n\n<!---This list is for public 4 year regionally accredited state universities only, not for private or for-profit schools nor for community colleges. Technical institutions are to be listed here only if they either have 4 year degree programs or ''are'' 4 year colleges. Also, satellite campuses that do not have separate regional accreditation from the mother institution should NOT be included in the list. Tribal colleges and universities are on their own page due to the fact that tribal institutions are controlled and operated by various American Indian tribes (who have dual sovereignty in the United States), not states.!--->\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Alabama==\n*[[Alabama A&M University]] (Alabama A&M)\n*[[Alabama State University]] (Alabama State)\n*[[Athens State University]]\n*Auburn University system\n**[[Auburn University]] (Auburn) ([[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[Auburn University at Montgomery]]\n*[[Jacksonville State University]]\n*[[Troy University]]\n*[[University of Alabama System]]\n**[[University of Alabama]] (Alabama) ([[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB)\n**[[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH)\n*[[University of Montevallo]]\n*[[University of North Alabama]] (UNA)\n*[[University of South Alabama]] (USA)\n*[[University of West Alabama]] (UWA)\n\n==Alaska==\n*[[University of Alaska System]]\n**[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] (UAF) ([[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alaska Anchorage]] (UAA)\n**[[University of Alaska Southeast]] (UAS)\n\n==Arizona==\n\n* [[Arizona Board of Regents]]\n**[[Arizona State University]] (ASU)\n**[[Northern Arizona University]] (NAU)\n**[[University of Arizona]]\n\n==Arkansas==\n*[[University of Arkansas System]]\n**[[University of Arkansas]] (Arkansas) ([[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Arkansas\u2013Fort Smith]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]\n**''[[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]]''\n**[[University of Arkansas at Monticello]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]]\n*[[Arkansas State University System]]\n**[[Arkansas State University]]\n*[[Arkansas Tech University]]\n*[[University of Central Arkansas]] (UCA, Central Arkansas)\n*[[Henderson State University]]\n*[[Southern Arkansas University]] (SAU)\n\n==California==\n*[[University of California]] system\n**[[University of California, Berkeley]] (UC Berkeley) \n**[[University of California, Davis]] (UC Davis)\n**[[University of California, Irvine]] (UC Irvine)\n**[[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA)\n**[[University of California, Merced]] (UC Merced)\n**[[University of California, Riverside]] (UC Riverside)\n**[[University of California, San Diego]] (UC San Diego)\n**''[[University of California, San Francisco]]''  (UCSF)\n**[[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB)\n**[[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UC Santa Cruz)\n**''[[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]]'' (law school;

The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

volleyball team|Brazil]], [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]], and the former [[Soviet Union men's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], are the only teams to win multiple gold medals at the men's tournament since its introduction. The remaining five editions of the Men's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won each by a different country including [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] and the defunct [[FR Yugoslavia men's national volleyball team|Yugoslavia]].\n\nGold medals are less evenly distributed in women's volleyball than in men's; the fourteen editions of the Women's Olympic Volleyball Tournament were won by only five different countries: [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]], [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and the former [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. Its addition to the Olympic program, however, was given only after [[World War II]], with the foundation of the [[FIVB]] and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held during the [[List of IOC meetings|53rd IOC session]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]], meeting protests.<ref>{{cite book|title=Black Belt Vol. 2, No. 2|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|year=Mar 1964|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ|quote=Sone Kaminaga black belt.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_QdkDAAAAMBAJ/page/n26 27]}}</ref>\n\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament was originally a simple competition, whose format paralleled the one still employed in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|World Cup]]: all teams played against each other team and then were ranked by number of wins, set average and point average. One disadvantage of this round-robin system is that medal winners could be determined before the end of the games, making the audience lose interest in the outcome of the remaining matches.\n\nTo cope with this situation, the competition was split into two phases: a \"final round\" was introduced, consisting of quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Since its creation in [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]], this new system has become the standard for the volleyball Olympic tournament, and is usually referred to as the \"Olympic format\".\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has grown steadily since 1964. Since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], both men's and women's indoor events count 12 participant nations. Each of the five continental volleyball confederations has at least one affiliated national federation involved in the Olympic Games.\n\n===Events===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Bronze in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and silver in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Japan men's national volleyball team|Japan]] won gold in [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. In [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], the introduction of a new offensive skill, the back row attack, helped [[Poland men's national volleyball team|Poland]] win the competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-setter.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], many of the strongest teams in men's volleyball belonged to the [[Eastern Bloc]], so the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]] did not have as great an effect on these events as it had on the women's. The Soviet Union collected their third Olympic gold medal with a 3\u20131 victory over [[Bulgaria men's national volleyball team|Bulgaria]]. With a Soviet-led boycott in [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[United States men's national volleyball team|United States]] confirmed their new volleyball leadership in the Western World by sweeping smoothly over [[Brazil men's national volleyball team|Brazil]] at the finals. In that edition a minor nation, [[Italy men's national volleyball team|Italy]], won their first medal, but Italy would rise to prominence in volleyball in later decades. A long-awaited confrontation between the US and Soviet volleyball teams came in the [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] final: powerplayers [[Karch Kiraly]] and [[Steve Timmons]] pushed the United States to a second gold medal setting the issue in favor of the Americans.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], Brazil upset favorites [[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]], [[Netherlands men's national volleyball team|Netherlands]], and Italy for their first Olympic championship. Runners-up Netherlands, with [[Ron Zwerver]] and [[Olof van der Meulen]], came back in the [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|following edition]] for a five-set win over Italy. In spite of their success in other major volleyball competitions in the 1990s, Italy did not fare well at the Olympics. After winning bronze in Atlanta, [[Serbia and Montenegro men's national volleyball team|Serbia and Montenegro]], led by [[Vladimir Grbi\u0107|Vladimir]] and [[Nikola Grbi\u0107]], beat [[Russia men's national volleyball team|Russia]] at the final in [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] to secure the gold (in 1996 and 2000 they played under the name [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]).\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], Brazil beat Italy in the final, adding a second gold medal to their record and confirming their role as the men's volleyball superpowers of the 2000s. In [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], United States beat Brazil in the final, winning their third gold medal. Russia won the bronze for the second time by defeating Italy. In the [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] final, Russia came back from a 0\u20132 set deficit, not letting the Brazilians take advantage of any of their 2 match points in the third set. [[Dmitriy Muserskiy]] scored 31 points, which is an Olympic Games record in a final. Italy defeated Bulgaria and took Bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivb.org/EN/Olympics/London2012/viewPressRelease.asp?No=36516&Language=en|title=FIVB - London 2012 Olympic Games|author=|date=|website=www.fivb.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter coming up short in the previous two editions of the Olympics as runners-up, the Brazilians captured their third gold medal in the history of the competition playing home in [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]] after their straight-set victory against Italy in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/brazil-make-triumphant-return-to-the-top?id=64552|title=Brazil make triumphant return to the top of the podium|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> The United States pulled off a comeback from a 0\u20132 deficit to claim the bronze medal with a victory over Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/usa-grab-mens-bronze-with-fantastic-comeback?id=64545|title=USA grab men's bronze with fantastic comeback|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nGold medals appear to be more evenly distributed in men's volleyball than in women's: former Soviet Union (three titles), United States (three) and Brazil (three) are the only teams to have won the tournament more than once. The remaining four editions were won each by a different country. Despite being a major force in men's volleyball since the 1990s, Italy are still the only volleyball powerhouses that lack a gold medal at the Olympic Games.\n\n===Women's winners===\n[[File:Women's Volleyball semifinals - 6.jpg|thumbnail|right|Women's volleyball semifinals match between [[United States women's national volleyball team|USA]] and [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nThe opening edition of the volleyball Olympic tournament, in [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]], was won by the host nation [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]]. There followed two victories in a row by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]], in [[Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] and [[Volleyball at the 1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]. [[South Korea women's national volleyball team|South Korea]] were expected to get their first gold after beating Japan in the 1975 Pre-Olympic Games, but Japan came back again in [[Volleyball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]] for one last Olympic gold before losing their status of women's volleyball superpowers.\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott]] of the [[Volleyball at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Games]] left many strong volleyball nations like Japan and South Korea out of the games. As a result, the Soviet Union easily secured a third Olympic gold medal. In [[Volleyball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], the [[Eastern bloc]] was, in its turn, boycotting the games, and the Soviet Union did not participate. As a result, host nation [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] won its first medals in volleyball, losing the finals to [[China women's national volleyball team|China]]. With eastern and western nations again involved in the Olympics, the Soviet Union obtained a remarkable victory over [[Peru women's national volleyball team|Peru]] after trailing 0\u20132 in [[Volleyball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988's]] marking one of the most dramatic female matches of the 20th century. The 1988 games were, however, boycotted by Cuba.\n\n[[Volleyball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] saw a new force go down in Olympic history: organized under the name [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], the nations of the former Soviet Union that chose to form a combined team easily reached the gold medal game, but did not resist the power play of the young, rising Cuban squad. Led by superstars [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Torres]], Cuba would eventually set the record for consecutive wins in the Olympic Games by also taking the gold in [[Volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[Volleyball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]] against China and [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]], respectively.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the winners were once again China. Second were Russia who beat [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a very tough and dramatic semifinal match after being down 1\u20132, 19\u201324 in the fourth set.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]], Brazil finally won the gold, beating the United States in the final and losing only one set in the competition. China were awarded the bronze by beating Cuba. After a troubled start, Brazil secured the double gold in [[Volleyball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012]] after beating the United States once again in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/volleyball/story/_/id/8259676/2012-london-olympics-brazil-shocks-us-women-volleyball-gold|title=Brazil wins women's volleyball gold|work=espn.go.com|accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref> Japan won the bronze medal after defeating South Korea.\n\nIn [[Volleyball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016]], home team Brazil were favorites to once again win the title, thus equalling Cuba's three consecutive gold medals between 1992 and 2000. After winning all of their preliminary round matches without dropping a set, the team was, however, stunned by a young Chinese squad in a tiebreaker in the quarterfinals. China went on to win the title, their third in Olympic history, by beating [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]] in four sets in the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/china-crowned-champions-in-rio-de-janeiro?id=64539|title=China crowned champions in Rio de Janeiro|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> In the process, [[Lang Ping]] became the first person to win a gold medal as a player in Los Angeles 1984 and repeat the feat now as a coach in Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rio2016.fivb.com/en/volleyball/news/lang-ping-becomes-first-person-in-volleyball?id=64550|title=Lang Ping became the first person in volleyball to win Olympic gold as player and coach|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB.org]]|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref> China also became the first team to win the Olympics after losing three matches in the preliminary round.

Despite becoming a women's volleyball powerhouse in the 21st century, United States still lack an Olympic gold.\n\n==Competition formula==\nThe volleyball Olympic tournament has a very stable competition formula. The following rules apply:\n\n; Qualification\n\n*Twelve teams participate in each event.\n*Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n*Two teams qualify through the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup|Men's]] and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] (this number was reduced from three prior to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]).\n*Five teams qualify as winners of continental qualification tournaments.\n*The four remaining berths are decided in world qualification tournaments.\n\n; Competition format\n\n*For the first phase, called qualification round, teams are ranked by the [[FIVB World Rankings]] and then divided in two pools of six teams using the [[serpentine system]]. The host nation is always ranked 1.\n*At the qualification round, each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. Top four teams in each pool advance, the remaining two leave the competition.\n*At the second phase, usually called final round, teams play quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\n*For the final round, matches are organized according to the results obtained in the qualification round. Let the top four teams in each pool be A1, A2, A3, A4 (group A); and B1, B2, B3, B4 (group B). Quarterfinals would then be: A1xB4; A2xB3; A3xB2; A4xB1.\n*Winners of quarterfinals play semifinals as follows: (A1/B4) x (A3/B2) ; (A2/B3) x (A4xB1).\n*At the finals, winners of semifinals play for the gold, and losers for the bronze.\n*The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Men's

During his visit to Singapore, Karimov signed various documents which were aimed to deepen the two nations' cooperation in different spheres. One of the most important issues of the visit was discussion of education in Uzbekistan. The visit led to the establishment of Management Development Institute of Singapore in Tashkent on 5 September 2007, by Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, edict number PD-691.\n\nMDIS Tashkent is currently serving students of [[Uzbekistan]] and other [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries.\n\nAcademic processes, subjects and textbooks are fully organized in accordance with the principles and standards of the [[Management Development Institute of Singapore]], and by the educational standards of the Republic of Uzbekistan. MDIS Tashkent offers [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] programs, and they are recognized as documents of higher education in Uzbekistan, in Singapore, and in the rest of the world.
