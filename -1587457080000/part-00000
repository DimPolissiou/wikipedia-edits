He was an able and entrepreneurial man and over the next 25 years laid strong foundations for the business.\n\nUnder his aegis, his first racing calendar was published in 1773, followed, in 1791, by the publication of [[The General Stud Book]], a definitive record of the pedigrees of approximately 400 horses which became the foundation for all thoroughbred bloodstock worldwide.<ref name=Barrett1995>{{cite book |title=The Daily Telegraph Chronicle of Horse Racing |editor-last=Barrett |editor-first=Norman |location=Enfield, Middlesex |publisher=Guinness Publishing |year=1995 }}</ref> He was assisted in this by his nephew, whose work on racehorse pedigrees dovetailed neatly with James's racing work.\n\nFor the next 250 years, Weatherbys has continued in the role of administrators to the Jockey Club. Today, every data detail relating to horses, owners, trainers, jockeys, stable employees and races is processed through Weatherbys. All of the 10,500 Thoroughbred races held in Britain each year are drawn together at the company's Northamptonshire HQ. The firm still owns and publishes the General Stud Book, recording the production of thoroughbred bloodstock in Britain and Ireland.\n\nThere has been diversification. \n\nInto printing \u2013 the Racing Calendar, racecourse racecards and even publications entirely divorced from racing and breeding form an impressive portfolio. Into laboratory testing - with Weatherbys owning one of Europe's most prestigious genomic-testing facilities for equine and agricultural stock.\n\nAnd into banking.\n\nThere was always the handling of money. From the guineas of 18th century aristocrats to more than \u00a3160m of prize money in 2018, the role of \u201cStakeholder\u201d has always remained vested in Weatherbys. \n\nFor the principal participants in the sport, Weatherbys offered accounting facilities. Holding their winnings to fund their future race entries. By the 1980s, the firm was effectively offering racehorse owners a current account alongside an option for short-term borrowing. \nDiscussions with the Bank of England in 1994 resulted in Weatherbys acquiring a banking licence and the founding of their banking division. \n\nFor the first few years, Weatherbys Bank served its traditional client cohort \u2013 racehorse owners, breeders, trainers and a payroll office for jockeys. The banking licence enabled a full suite of financial offerings. Clients had chequebooks, debit cards, loans, term deposits and foreign exchange services. \n\nIn 1997, Arkle Asset Finance, a 100% subsidiary of Weatherbys Bank, was established to provide commercial asset finance services. \nBy 2006, Weatherbys Bank was ready to develop into Weatherbys Private bank and Weatherbys Racing Bank. An office was opened in central London, and Weatherbys Private Bank was devised with wealth criteria applying, but Thoroughbred connection for clients removed. Weatherbys Bank continued to provide services for those engaged in racing and breeding, with approximately 10,000 owners, trainers and jockeys on the books today.  The majority of Weatherbys Private Bank's clients are now unconnected to racing.\n\nIn 2012, the insurance broking business, Weatherbys Hamilton was constituted as a partnership with a number of partners providing brokerage services for bloodstock, property and liability insurance.\n\nIn 2020, it will be 250 years since the Jockey Club appointed James Weatherby effectively as its secretary The firm has prospered since and remains in family ownership.
