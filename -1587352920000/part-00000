In particular, any linear map <math>L : X \\to Y</math> can be canonically decomposed as follows: <math>X \\to X / \\operatorname{ker} L \\overset{L_0}{\\rightarrow} \\operatorname{Im} L \\to Y</math> where <math>L_0\\left( x + \\operatorname{ker} L \\right) := L (x)</math> defines a bijection. \n* The set of continuous linear maps <math>X \\to Z</math> (resp. continuous bilinear maps <math>X \\times Y \\to Z</math>) will be denoted by ''L(X, Z)'' (resp. ''B(X, Y; Z)'') where if ''Z'' is the scalar field then we may instead write ''L(X)'' (resp. ''B(X, Y)''). \n* The set of separately continuous bilinear maps <math>X \\times Y \\to Z</math> (i.e. continuous in each variable when the other variable is fixed) will be denoted by <math>\\mathcal{B}(X, Y; Z)</math> where if <math>Z</math> is the scalar field then we may instead write <math>\\mathcal{B}(X, Y)</math>. \n* We will denote the continuous dual space of ''X'' by X* or <math>X^{\\prime}</math> and the algebraic dual space (which is the vector space of all linear functionals on ''X'', whether continuous or not) by <math>X^{\\#}</math>. \n** To increase the clarity of the exposition, we use the common convention of writing elements of <math>X^{\\prime}</math> with a prime following the symbol (e.g. <math>x^{\\prime}</math> denotes an element of <math>X^{\\prime}</math> and not, say, a derivative and the variables ''x'' and <math>x^{\\prime}</math> need not be related in any way). \n\n=== Notation for topologies ===\n{{Main|Topology of uniform convergence|Mackey topology}}\n* [[Topology of uniform convergence#The weak topology \u03c3(X, X*)|\u03c3(X, X\u2032)]] denotes the [[coarsest topology]] on ''X'' making every map in X\u2032 continuous and <math>X_{\\sigma\\left(X, X^{\\prime}\\right)}</math> or  <math>X_{\\sigma}</math> denotes [[Topology of uniform convergence#The weak topology \u03c3(X, X*)|''X'' endowed with this topology]]. \n* [[Topology of uniform convergence#The weak topology \u03c3(X*, X) or the weak* topology|\u03c3(X\u2032, X)]] denotes [[weak-* topology]] on X* and <math>X_{\\sigma\\left(X^{\\prime}, X\\right)}</math> or  <math>X^{\\prime}_{\\sigma}</math> denotes [[Topology of uniform convergence#The weak topology \u03c3(X\u2032, X) or the weak* topology|X\u2032 endowed with this topology]]. \n** Note that every <math>x_0 \\in X</math> induces a map <math>X^{\\prime} \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> defined by <math>\\lambda \\mapsto \\lambda \\left( x_0 \\right)</math>. \u03c3(X\u2032, X) is the coarsest topology on X\u2032 making all such maps continuous.\n* [[Topology of uniform convergence#Bounded convergence b(X, X*)|b(X, X\u2032)]] denotes the '''topology of bounded convergence on ''X''''' and <math>X_{b\\left(X, X^{\\prime}\\right)}</math> or <math>X_{b}</math> denotes [[Topology of uniform convergence#Bounded convergence b(X, X*)|''X'' endowed with this topology]]. \n* [[Topology of uniform convergence#Strong dual topology b(X*, X)|b(X\u2032, X)]] denotes the '''topology of bounded convergence on X\u2032''' or the '''strong dual topology on X\u2032''' and <math>X_{b\\left(X^{\\prime}, X\\right)}</math> or <math>X^{\\prime}_{b}</math> denotes [[Topology of uniform convergence#Strong dual topology b(X*, X)|X\u2032 endowed with this topology]]. \n** As usual, if X* is considered as a topological vector space but it has not been made clear what topology it is endowed with, then the topology will be assumed to be b(X\u2032, X). \n* [[Topology of uniform convergence#Mackey topology \u03c4(X, X*)|\ud835\udf0f(X, X\u2032)]] denotes the '''[[Mackey topology]]''' on ''X'' or the '''[[Topology of uniform convergence#Mackey topology \u03c4(X, X*)|topology of uniform convergence on the convex balanced weakly compact subsets of ''X\u2032'']]''' and <math>X_{\\tau\\left(X, X^{\\prime}\\right)}</math> or <math>X_{\\tau}</math> denotes ''X'' endowed with this topology. <math>\\tau(X, X^{\\prime})</math> is the finest locally convex TVS topology on ''X'' whose continuous dual space is equal to <math>X^{\\prime}</math>. \n* [[Topology of uniform convergence#Mackey topology \u03c4(X*, X)|\ud835\udf0f(X\u2032, X)]] denotes the '''[[Mackey topology]]''' on ''X\u2032'' or the '''[[Topology of uniform convergence#Mackey topology \u03c4(X*, X)|topology of uniform convergence on the convex balanced weakly compact subsets of ''X'']]''' and <math>X_{\\tau\\left(X^{\\prime}, X\\right)}</math> or  <math>X^{\\prime}_{\\tau}</math> denotes ''X'' endowed with this topology. \n** Note that <math>\\tau\\left( X^{\\prime}, X \\right) \\subseteq b\\left( X^{\\prime}, X \\right) \\subseteq \\tau \\left( X^{\\prime}, X^{\\prime\\prime} \\right)</math>.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | pp=432-434}} \n* [[Topology of uniform convergence#Convergence on equicontinuous sets \u03b5(X, X*)|\u03b5(X, X\u2032)]] denotes the '''topology of uniform convergence on equicontinuous subsets of X\u2032''' and <math>X_{\\epsilon\\left(X, X^{\\prime}\\right)}</math> or  <math>X_{\\epsilon}</math> denotes [[Topology of uniform convergence#Convergence on equicontinuous sets \u03b5(X, X\u2032)|''X'' endowed with this topology]]. \n** If ''H'' is a set of linear mappings <math>X \\to Y</math> then ''H'' is [[equicontinuous]] if and only if it is equicontinuous at the origin; that is, if and only if for every neighborhood ''V'' of ''0'' in ''Y'', there exists a neighborhood ''U'' of ''0'' in ''X'' such that <math>\\lambda (U) \\subseteq V</math> for every <math>\\lambda \\in H</math>.\n\n== Definition ==\nThroughout let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[topological vector space]]s with continuous dual spaces <math>X^*</math> and <math>Y^*</math>. Note that almost all results described are independent of whether these vector spaces are over <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> or <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> but to simplify the exposition we will assume that they are over the field <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>. \n\n=== Continuous bilinear maps as a tensor product ===\nNote that the question of whether or not one vector space is a [[tensor product]] of two other vector spaces is a purely algebraic one (i.e. the answer does not depend on the topologies of ''X'' or ''Y''). Nevertheless, the vector space <math>B\\left( X_{\\sigma}^{\\prime}, Y_{\\sigma}^{\\prime} \\right)</math> of continuous bilinear functionals is always a tensor product of ''X'' and ''Y'', as we now describe. \n\nFor every <math>(x, y) \\in X \\times Y</math> we now define bilinear form, denoted by the symbol ''x \u2297 y'', from <math>X^{\\prime} \\times Y^{\\prime}</math> into the underlying field (i.e. <math>x \\otimes y : X^{\\prime} \\times Y^{\\prime} \\to \\mathbb{C}</math>) by \n: <math>\\left(x \\otimes y\\right) \\left(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime} \\right) := x^{\\prime}(x) y^{\\prime}(y)</math>. \nThis induces a canonical map <math>\\cdot \\otimes \\cdot : X \\times Y \\to \\mathcal{B}\\left( X_{\\sigma}^{\\prime}, Y_{\\sigma}^{\\prime} \\right)</math> defined by sending <math>(x, y) \\in X \\times Y</math> to the bilinear form <math>x \\otimes y</math>. \nThe span of the range of this map is <math>B\\left( X_{\\sigma}^{\\prime}, Y_{\\sigma}^{\\prime} \\right)</math>. \nThe following theorem may be used to verify that <math>B\\left( X_{\\sigma}^{\\prime}, Y_{\\sigma}^{\\prime} \\right)</math> together with the above map \u2297 is a tensor product of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\n'''Theorem''' Let ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' be vector spaces and let <math>T : X \\times Y \\to Z</math> be a bilinear map. Then the following are equivalent:{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | pp=403-404}} \n# ''(Z, T)'' is a [[tensor product]] of ''X'' and ''Y'';\n# (a) the image of ''T'' spans all of ''Z'', and (b) ''X'' and ''Y'' are ''T''-linearly disjoint (this means that for all positive integers ''n'' and all elements <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in X</math> and <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\in Y</math> such that <math>\\sum_{i=1}^{n} T(x_i, y_i) = 0</math>, (i) if all <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n</math> are linearly independent then all <math>y_i</math> are 0, and (ii) if all <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n</math> are linearly independent then all <math>x_i</math> are 0).\n:* Equivalently, ''X'' and ''Y'' are ''T''-linearly disjoint if and only if for all linearly independent sequences <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_m</math> in ''X'' and all linearly independent sequences <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n</math> in ''Y'', the vectors <math>\\left\\{ T(x_i, y_j) : 1 \\leq i \\leq m, 1 \\leq j \\leq n \\right\\}</math> are linearly independent.\n\n=== Topology ===\n\nHenceforth, all topological vector spaces considered will be assumed to be locally convex. \nIf ''Z'' is any locally convex topological vector space, then for any [[equicontinuous]] subsets <math>G \\subseteq X^{\\prime}</math> and <math>H \\subseteq Y^{\\prime}</math>, and any neighborhood <math>N</math> in ''Z'', define \n:<math>\\mathcal{U}(G, H, N) = \\{b \\in \\mathcal{B}\\left( X^{\\prime}_{b}, Y^{\\prime}_{b}; Z \\right) : b(G, H) \\subseteq N\\}</math>\nIt can be shown that every set <math>b(G, H)</math> is bounded, which is necessary and sufficient for the collection of all such <math>\\mathcal{U}(G, H, N)</math> to form a locally convex TVS topology on <math>\\mathcal{B}\\left( X^{\\prime}_{b}, Y^{\\prime}_{b}; Z \\right)</math> called the '''\u03b5-topology'''.

The set of all such summable families is a vector subspace of <math>X^{A}</math> denoted by <math>S</math>. \n\nWe now define a topology on ''S'' in a very natural way. This topology turns out to be the injective topology taken from <math>l^1(A) \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\epsilon} X</math> and transferred to ''S'' via a canonical vector space isomorphism (the obvious one). This is a common occurrence when studying the injective and [[projective tensor product]]s of function/sequence spaces and TVSs: the \"natural way\" in which one would define (from scratch) a topology on such a tensor product is frequently equivalent to the injective or [[projective tensor product]] topology.  \n\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{U}</math> denote a base of convex balanced neighborhoods of 0 in ''X'' and for each <math>U \\in \\mathfrak{U}</math>, let <math>\\mu_U : X \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> denote its [[Minkowski functional]].

The set of all such summable families is a vector subspace of <math>X^{A}</math> denoted by <math>S</math>. \n\nWe now define a topology on ''S'' in a very natural way. This topology turns out to be the injective topology taken from <math>l^1(A) \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\epsilon} X</math> and transferred to ''S'' via a canonical vector space isomorphism (the obvious one). This is a common occurrence when studying the injective and [[projective tensor product]]s of function/sequence spaces and TVSs: the \"natural way\" in which one would define (from scratch) a topology on such a tensor product is frequently equivalent to the injective or [[projective tensor product]] topology.  \n\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{U}</math> denote a base of convex balanced neighborhoods of 0 in ''X'' and for each <math>U \\in \\mathfrak{U}</math>, let <math>\\mu_U : X \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> denote its [[Minkowski functional]].

The family of seminorms <math>\\{ q_U : U \\in \\mathfrak{U} \\}</math> generates a topology making ''S'' into a locally convex space.

Ten years later, Raghu's wife is shot dead by a landlord attempting to rape her and her young boy shoots the landlord in retaliation and absconds.\n\nSeveral years later, the boy has grown up to be Ashok, a rich, reputed philanthropist who runs \"Parvathi Nilayam\", a shelter and institute for orphaned destitute children, named after his mother. Unknown to all except his close friend and associate Mahesh is the fact that to support \"Parvathi Nilayam\", Ashok also masquerades as \"Guru\", an elusive criminal who carries out several heists and is being hunted by the police. Meanwhile, Ashok's grandfather has been raising an impostor, Ramesh as his grandson, who has turned out to be felonious.\n\nAshok meets and falls in love with a charming girl, Sujatha, the niece of a top police official, strives to win her affection and succeeds. Ashok, in the guise of Guru, also tangles with a notorious mob headed by an one-armed man, one of whose associates is Ramesh. Ashok also has a chance encounter with his lost father Raghu, who is now working as a professor, but Raghu conceals his identity to keep Ashok safe.\n\nIn a shocking twist, Ashok finds out that the landlord whom he had murdered as a boy was none other than Sujatha's father and he starts rebuking Sujatha without revealing her the truth, leaving her heart-broken. Distraught and despondent, Ashok plans one last big heist to support \"Parvathi Nilayam\" permanently, hand it over to his friend Mahesh and seclude himself forever. Whether his plans succeed forms the rest of the story.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--Don't change Cast order-->\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Guru / Ashok\n* [[Sridevi]] as Sujatha\n* [[R.

Ten years later, Raghu's wife is shot dead by a landlord attempting to rape her and her young boy shoots the landlord in retaliation and absconds.\n\nSeveral years later, the boy has grown up to be Ashok, a rich, reputed philanthropist who runs \"Parvathi Nilayam\", a shelter and institute for orphaned destitute children, named after his mother. Unknown to all except his close friend and associate Mahesh is the fact that to support \"Parvathi Nilayam\", Ashok also masquerades as \"Guru\", an elusive criminal who carries out several heists and is being hunted by the police. Meanwhile, Ashok's grandfather has been raising an impostor, Ramesh as his grandson, who has turned out to be felonious.\n\nAshok meets and falls in love with a charming girl, Sujatha, the niece of a top police official, strives to win her affection and succeeds. Ashok, in the guise of Guru, also tangles with a notorious mob headed by an one-armed man, one of whose associates is Ramesh. Ashok also has a chance encounter with his lost father Raghu, who is now working as a professor, but Raghu conceals his identity to keep Ashok safe.\n\nIn a shocking twist, Ashok finds out that the landlord whom he had murdered as a boy was none other than Sujatha's father and he starts rebuking Sujatha without revealing her the truth, leaving her heart-broken. Distraught and despondent, Ashok plans one last big heist to support \"Parvathi Nilayam\" permanently, hand it over to his friend Mahesh and seclude himself forever. Whether his plans succeed forms the rest of the story.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--Don't change Cast order-->\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Guru / Ashok\n* [[Sridevi]] as Sujatha\n* [[R.

But he is a dishonest person as he smuggles in sandalwood too, between cane business. Varuthunni ([[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]]) is the chief of workers and they believe Gopalan. Varuthunni's adopted son is Ramu ([[Kamal Hassan]]) and he is in love with Sreedevi, ([[Seema (actress)|Seema]]) daughter of Narayanan, ([[Jose Prakash]]) co-worker of Varuthunni. Annamma ([[Sheela]]) is a widow and she too likes Ramu, even though he is younger to her.\n\nGopalan gets caught in sandalwood smuggling, but escapes by blaming Varuthunni. The conflict between Varuthunni and Gopalan creates issues among the cane workers and most of them join hands with Varuthunni as he is an honest person. Workers decides to provide cane only to Varuthunni and not to Gopalan, which hurts Gopalan's business and his equation with his boss. In the meantime, Annamma, seduces Ramu and they became intimate.\n\nGopalan's team destroys Varuthunni's cane stacks and thus the issue between the two gets bigger. Sensing the danger of the situation, Gopalan decides to bump off Varuthunni, but this plan was informed to Ramu, who is down by fever by Varuthunni's friend ([[Sankaradi]]). At the same time, Annamma reveals to Ramu that she is pregnant.\n\nShattered, Ramu, unable to take a decision frantically goes in search of his father Varuthunni to save him from the death plot of Gopalan, but he is beaten to pulp by Gopalan's gang. He traces his father, but before he is informed of the plot, Gopalan shoots Varuthunni, but the bullet hits Ramu as he jumps in front of his father to save him. Shattered, Varuthunni kills Gopalan and Ramu in his last moments requests his father to take care of his child, now carried by Annamma, and dies in the lap of his loving father Varuthunni shattering many dreams and hopes.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kamal Hassan]] as Ramu\n* [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]] as Varuthunni\n* [[Sheela]] as Annamma\n* [[Seema (actress)|Seema]] as Sreedevi\n* [[M.

These are well developed in ground beetles, and produce noxious or even [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] secretions used to deter would-be [[predator]]s. In some, commonly known as [[bombardier beetle]]s, these secretions are mixed with [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] compounds and ejected by a small [[combustion]], producing a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas which can injure small [[mammal]]s, such as [[shrew]]s, and is liable to kill [[invertebrate]] predators outright. \n\nTo humans, getting \"bombed\" by a bombardier beetle is a decidedly unpleasant experience. This ability has [[evolution|evolved]] independently twice as it seems \u2013 in the [[flanged bombardier beetle]]s (Paussinae) which are among the most ancient ground beetles, and in the typical bombardier beetles ([[Brachininae]]) which are part of a more \"modern\" lineage. The [[Anthiinae (beetle)|Anthiini]], though, can mechanically squirt their defensive secretions for considerable distances and are able to aim with a startling degree of accuracy; in [[Afrikaans]], they are known as ''{{lang|ak|oogpisters}}'' (\"eye-pissers\"). In one of the very few known cases of a [[vertebrate]] [[mimicry|mimicking]] an [[arthropod]], juvenile ''[[Heliobolus lugubris]]'' [[lizard]]s are similar in color to the [[aposematic]] ''oogpister'' beetles, and move in a way that makes them look surprisingly similar to the insects at a casual glance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=R.

Unlike most Carabidae which are [[nocturnal]], the tiger beetles are active diurnal hunters and often brightly coloured; they have large eyes and hunt by sight. Ground beetles of the species ''[[Promecognathus laevissimus]]'' are specialised predators of the cyanide millipede ''[[Harpaphe haydeniana]]'', countering the [[hydrogen cyanide]] which makes these millipedes poisonous to most carnivores.\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nAs predators of invertebrates, including many [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, most ground beetles are considered beneficial organisms. The [[caterpillar hunter]]s (''Calosoma'') are famous for their habit of devouring prey in quantity, eagerly feeding on [[tussock moth]] (Lymantriidae) caterpillars, [[processionary caterpillar]]s (Thaumetopoeidae) and [[woolly worm]]s (Arctiidae), which due to their [[urticating hair]]s are avoided by most [[insectivore]]s. Large numbers of the [[forest caterpillar hunter]] (''C. sycophanta''), native to [[Europe]], were shipped to [[New England]] for [[biological pest control|biological control]] of the [[gypsy moth]] (''Lymantria dispar'') as early as 1905.\n\nA few species are nuisance pests. ''[[Zabrus]]'' is one of the few [[herbivorous]] ground beetle genera, and on rare occasions ''[[Zabrus tenebrioides]]'', for example, occurs abundantly enough to cause some damage to [[grain]] crops. Large species, usually [[Carabinae]], can become a nuisance if present in numbers, particularly during outdoor activities such as [[camping]]; they void their defensive secretions when threatened, and in hiding among provisions their presence may spoil food. Since ground beetles are generally reluctant or even unable to fly, mechanically blocking their potential routes of entry is usually easy. The use of insecticides specifically for Carabid intrusion may lead to unfortunate side effects, such as the release of their repugnatorial secretions, so it generally is not a good idea unless the same applications are intended to exclude ants, parasites or other crawling pests.\n\n[[File:Panagaeus cruxmajor bl.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Panagaeus cruxmajor|crucifix ground beetle]] (''Panagaeus cruxmajor'') got [[Charles Darwin]] into trouble in 1828.]]\nEspecially in the 19th century and to a lesser extent today, their large size and conspicuous coloration, as well as the odd [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of some (e.g. the [[Lebiini]]), made many ground beetles a popular object of collection and study for professional and amateur [[Coleopterology#Study and collection|coleopterologists]]. High prices were paid for rare and exotic specimens, and in the early to mid-19th century, a veritable \"beetle craze\" occurred in [[England]]. As mentioned above, Charles Darwin was an ardent collector of beetles when he was about 20 years old, to the extent that he would rather scour the countryside for rare specimens with [[William Darwin Fox]], [[John Stevens Henslow]], and [[Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet|Henry Thompson]] than to study [[theology]] as his father wanted him to do. In his autobiography, he fondly recalled his experiences with ''[[Licinus]]'' and ''[[Panagaeus]]'', and wrote:\n<blockquote>No poet ever felt more delight at seeing his first poem published than I did at seeing in Stephen's ''Illustrations of British Insects'' the magic words, \"captured by C. Darwin, Esq.\"<ref name=\"Barlow\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Evolution and systematics==\nThe [[Adephaga]] are documented since the end of the [[Permian]], about {{Ma|250}}. Ground beetles [[evolution|evolved]] in the latter [[Triassic]], having separated from their closest relatives by {{Ma|200}}. The family diversified throughout the [[Jurassic]], and the more advanced lineages, such as the [[Harpalinae]], underwent a vigorous radiation starting in the [[Cretaceous]]. The closest living relatives of the ground beetles are the [[false ground beetle]]s (Trachypachidae) and the [[wrinkled bark beetle]]s (Rhysodidae). They are sometimes even included in the Carabidae as subfamilies or as tribes ''[[incertae sedis]]'', but more preferably they are united with the ground beetles in the [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] [[Caraboidea]].\n\nMuch research has been done on elucidating the [[phylogeny]] of the ground beetles and adjusting [[systematics]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] accordingly. While no completely firm consensus exists, a few points are generally accepted: As it seems, the ground beetles consist of a number of more [[basal (evolution)|basal]] lineages and the extremely diverse [[Harpalinae]] which contain over half the described [[species]] and into which several formerly independent families had to be subsumed.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sh\u014dz\u014d \u014csawa, Zhi-Hui Su & Y\u016bki Inmura |year=2004 |title=Molecular Phylogeny and Evolution of Carabid Ground Beetles |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=4-431-00487-4}}</ref>\n\n===Subfamilies and selected genera===\n{{main|List of ground beetle genera}}\nThe taxonomy used here is based on the ''Catalogue of Palaearctic Coleoptera''<ref>{{cite book |editor=I.

These are well developed in ground beetles, and produce noxious or even [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] secretions used to deter would-be [[predator]]s. In some, commonly known as [[bombardier beetle]]s, these secretions are mixed with [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] compounds and ejected by a small [[combustion]], producing a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas which can injure small [[mammal]]s, such as [[shrew]]s, and is liable to kill [[invertebrate]] predators outright. \n\nTo humans, getting \"bombed\" by a bombardier beetle is a decidedly unpleasant experience. This ability has [[evolution|evolved]] independently twice as it seems \u2013 in the [[flanged bombardier beetle]]s (Paussinae) which are among the most ancient ground beetles, and in the typical bombardier beetles ([[Brachininae]]) which are part of a more \"modern\" lineage. The [[Anthiinae (beetle)|Anthiini]], though, can mechanically squirt their defensive secretions for considerable distances and are able to aim with a startling degree of accuracy; in [[Afrikaans]], they are known as ''{{lang|ak|oogpisters}}'' (\"eye-pissers\"). In one of the very few known cases of a [[vertebrate]] [[mimicry|mimicking]] an [[arthropod]], juvenile ''[[Heliobolus lugubris]]'' [[lizard]]s are similar in color to the [[aposematic]] ''oogpister'' beetles, and move in a way that makes them look surprisingly similar to the insects at a casual glance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=R.

Unlike most Carabidae which are [[nocturnal]], the tiger beetles are active diurnal hunters and often brightly coloured; they have large eyes and hunt by sight. Ground beetles of the species ''[[Promecognathus laevissimus]]'' are specialised predators of the cyanide millipede ''[[Harpaphe haydeniana]]'', countering the [[hydrogen cyanide]] which makes these millipedes poisonous to most carnivores.\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nAs predators of invertebrates, including many [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, most ground beetles are considered beneficial organisms. The [[caterpillar hunter]]s (''Calosoma'') are famous for their habit of devouring prey in quantity, eagerly feeding on [[tussock moth]] (Lymantriidae) caterpillars, [[processionary caterpillar]]s (Thaumetopoeidae) and [[woolly worm]]s (Arctiidae), which due to their [[urticating hair]]s are avoided by most [[insectivore]]s. Large numbers of the [[forest caterpillar hunter]] (''C. sycophanta''), native to [[Europe]], were shipped to [[New England]] for [[biological pest control|biological control]] of the [[gypsy moth]] (''Lymantria dispar'') as early as 1905.\n\nA few species are nuisance pests. ''[[Zabrus]]'' is one of the few [[herbivorous]] ground beetle genera, and on rare occasions ''[[Zabrus tenebrioides]]'', for example, occurs abundantly enough to cause some damage to [[grain]] crops. Large species, usually [[Carabinae]], can become a nuisance if present in numbers, particularly during outdoor activities such as [[camping]]; they void their defensive secretions when threatened, and in hiding among provisions their presence may spoil food. Since ground beetles are generally reluctant or even unable to fly, mechanically blocking their potential routes of entry is usually easy. The use of insecticides specifically for Carabid intrusion may lead to unfortunate side effects, such as the release of their repugnatorial secretions, so it generally is not a good idea unless the same applications are intended to exclude ants, parasites or other crawling pests.\n\n[[File:Panagaeus cruxmajor bl.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Panagaeus cruxmajor|crucifix ground beetle]] (''Panagaeus cruxmajor'') got [[Charles Darwin]] into trouble in 1828.]]\nEspecially in the 19th century and to a lesser extent today, their large size and conspicuous coloration, as well as the odd [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of some (e.g. the [[Lebiini]]), made many ground beetles a popular object of collection and study for professional and amateur [[Coleopterology#Study and collection|coleopterologists]]. High prices were paid for rare and exotic specimens, and in the early to mid-19th century, a veritable \"beetle craze\" occurred in [[England]]. As mentioned above, Charles Darwin was an ardent collector of beetles when he was about 20 years old, to the extent that he would rather scour the countryside for rare specimens with [[William Darwin Fox]], [[John Stevens Henslow]], and [[Sir Henry Thompson, 1st Baronet|Henry Thompson]] than to study [[theology]] as his father wanted him to do. In his autobiography, he fondly recalled his experiences with ''[[Licinus]]'' and ''[[Panagaeus]]'', and wrote:\n<blockquote>No poet ever felt more delight at seeing his first poem published than I did at seeing in Stephen's ''Illustrations of British Insects'' the magic words, \"captured by C. Darwin, Esq.\"<ref name=\"Barlow\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Evolution and systematics==\nThe [[Adephaga]] are documented since the end of the [[Permian]], about {{Ma|250}}. Ground beetles [[evolution|evolved]] in the latter [[Triassic]], having separated from their closest relatives by {{Ma|200}}. The family diversified throughout the [[Jurassic]], and the more advanced lineages, such as the [[Harpalinae]], underwent a vigorous radiation starting in the [[Cretaceous]]. The closest living relatives of the ground beetles are the [[false ground beetle]]s (Trachypachidae) and the [[wrinkled bark beetle]]s (Rhysodidae). They are sometimes even included in the Carabidae as subfamilies or as tribes ''[[incertae sedis]]'', but more preferably they are united with the ground beetles in the [[Taxonomic rank|superfamily]] [[Caraboidea]].\n\nMuch research has been done on elucidating the [[phylogeny]] of the ground beetles and adjusting [[systematics]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] accordingly. While no completely firm consensus exists, a few points are generally accepted: As it seems, the ground beetles consist of a number of more [[basal (evolution)|basal]] lineages and the extremely diverse [[Harpalinae]] which contain over half the described [[species]] and into which several formerly independent families had to be subsumed.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sh\u014dz\u014d \u014csawa, Zhi-Hui Su & Y\u016bki Inmura |year=2004 |title=Molecular Phylogeny and Evolution of Carabid Ground Beetles |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=4-431-00487-4}}</ref>\n\n===Subfamilies and selected genera===\n{{main|List of ground beetle genera}}\nThe taxonomy used here is based on the ''Catalogue of Palaearctic Coleoptera''<ref>{{cite book |editor=I.
