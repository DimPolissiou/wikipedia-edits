The line was an update of the predecessor [[Mercedes-Benz W111|W111]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W112|W112]] ''fintail'' sedans. The cars were successful in West Germany and in export markets including North America and Southeast Asia. During the seven-year run, a total of 383,361 units were manufactured.\n\nSince the W108 and W109 were only available as 4-door models, similarly squarish 2-door W111 and W112 coup\u00e9s and cabriolets filled those niches and are frequently mistaken for them.  \n\n==Model History==\n{{multiple image\n|width = 220\n|direction = vertical\n|image1 = Mercedes Benz W108 front 20070402.jpg\n|image2 = Mercedes Benz W108 rear 20070402.jpg\n|caption2 = Mercedes-Benz 280 SE W108\n|image3 = 3-4 dalas 12 pie zoga.JPG\n|caption3 = Since the W108 and W109 were only available as 4-door models, 2-door [[Mercedes-Benz W111|W111]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W112|W112]] coup\u00e9s and cabriolets, like this 1969 280 SE, are frequently mistaken for them\n}}\n\nThe car's predecessors, the [[Mercedes-Benz W111]] (1959\u201371)  and [[Mercedes-Benz W112|W112]] (1961-67), helped Mercedes-Benz develop greater sales and achieve [[economy of scale]] production, reducing both manufacture time and cost. Throughout the 1950s, Mercedes-Benz had been producing the coachwork [[Mercedes-Benz W188|300 S]] and [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL|300 SL]] and all but hand-built [[Mercedes-Benz W186|300 Adenauers]] alongside conveyor assembled Pontons (190, 190 SL and 220) etc. Unifying the entire Mercedes-Benz range into the [[Car tailfin|fintail]] ({{lang-de|Heckflosse}}) reduced production onto a single [[automobile platform]]. \n\nHowever, fashion trends in the early 1960s changed rapidly. By the time the [[Paul Bracq]]-designed 2-door coup\u00e9 and cabriolet W111s were launched, the predecessor W111 sedan's fins lost their chrome trim and sharp appearance.  The arrival of the [[Mercedes-Benz W113|W113]] 'Pagoda' coup\u00e9 and cabriolet in 1963 saw them further buried into the trunk's contour.  Finally, they disappeared completely on the [[Mercedes-Benz 600|W100 600]] in 1963.\n\nThe evolution of the W111 began under the leadership of Bracq in 1961 and ended in 1963. Although the fins' departure was the most visible change, the W108 had a lower body waist line and increased glass area - the windscreen alone was 17% larger than W111's - prominent enough to be referred to as a \"greenhouse\". The cars had a 60&nbsp;mm lower ride and 15&nbsp;mm wider doors. The result was a visibly newer-looking, sleeker car with an open and spacious interior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://benz-books.com/blog/542/mercedes-250s-se-w108/ |title=Mercedes 250S, SE W108: Mercedes elegance at its best |website=Benz Books |author=Bernd |accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Differences between W108 and W109===\nDue to the success of long wheelbase [[Mercedes-Benz W112|300 SE Lang (W112)]], which was intended as an interim car between [[Mercedes-Benz_W189|300 \"Adenauer\" (W189)]] and [[Mercedes-Benz_600|\"Grosser Mercedes\" 600 (W100)]], Mercedes-Benz continued to offer two wheelbase lengths for W108/W109. Initially, the wheelbase lengths denoted W108 (standard) and W109 (long). For 1968 model year, this distinction changed with the introduction of 280 SEL that retained W108, rather than W109, chassis designation.\n\nThe larger 3-litre six-cylinder inline engine (300 SEL) were exclusive to W109 with odd exception of standard wheelbase 300 SEb (1965\u20131967), which was designated as W108. The smaller six-cylinder inline engines (250 S/SE and 280 S/SE/SEL) were assigned to W108 only. Both eventually received the V8 engines in 1967 (W109) and 1970 (W108).\n\nW109 was more luxuriously appointed than W108, featuring burled walnut dashboards, automatic transmission, and power windows along with optional air conditioning system.\n\nThe W108 and W109 had different types of suspension systems: W108 retained the steel coil springs and oil-filled shock absorbers while W109 used the [[self-levelling suspension|self-levelling]] [[air suspension]].\n\n\n\n{{-}}\n\n==First Series, 1965\u20131967==\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz 300SEL-W108 Rear-view.JPG|thumb|right|W109 300 SEL]]\n[[File:Mercedes Benz W108.jpg|thumb|The simple elegance, large greenhouse, and practicality of the W108/W109 design is regarded by many as iconic]]\n\nThe W108/W109 premiered at the [[Frankfurt Auto Show#1965|Frankfurt Auto Show]] in 1965. The initial model range consisted of three W108s (250 S, 250 SE, and 300 SEb) and a sole W109 (300 SEL). The six-inline engines were carried over from the previous generation with mechanical refinements. The 2.2-litre [[Mercedes-Benz_M180_engine|M180]] engine was enlarged to 2.5 litres while the fuel-injected 3-litre [[Mercedes-Benz_M189_engine|M189]] version was carried over from \"300 Adenauer\".\n\nThe 250 S was fitted with 2,496 cc [[Mercedes-Benz_M180_engine|M108 engine]] with dual two-barrel downdraft [[carburettor]]s producing {{convert|130|bhp|abbr=on}} at 5,400 rpm. It could accelerate to {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 13 seconds for manual and 14 for automatic. The top speed was {{Convert|182|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for manual and {{Convert|177|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for automatic. The 250 SE had the same engine as 250 S except for fuel injection system and different engine designation [[Mercedes-Benz_M129_engine|(M129)]]. With increased engine output of {{convert|150|bhp||0|abbr=on}} at 5,500 rpm, 250 SE was one second faster to 100 km/h than 250 S and had higher top speed of {{Convert|193|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for both manual and automatic versions.\n\nBoth 300 SEb and 300 SEL were fitted with 2,966 cc [[Mercedes-Benz_M189_engine|M189 engine]]. The engine was an updated version of [[Mercedes-Benz_M186_engine|M186]], originally developed in 1951 for [[Mercedes-Benz W186|Type 300 \"Adenauer\"]], with Bosch mechanical fuel-injection system that caliberated the optimal fuel mixture automatically based on throttle pedal position and movement, engine speed, atmospheric pressure, water temperature, and driving conditions. The engine's output was {{convert|170|bhp||0|abbr=on}} at 5,400 rpm, and 300 SEb and 300 SEL could accelerate to {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 12 seconds and reach the top speed of {{Convert|200|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} ({{Convert|195|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} with automatic transmission).\n\nThe production figures for the first series from 1965 to 1967 showed 129,858 of 250 S/250 SE and 5,106 of 300 SEb/300 SEL. The tiny production figure of 300 SEb/300 SEL reflected the higher sales price with luxurious appointments, exclusivity, and smaller global market share.\n\n==300 SEL 6.3==\n{{main|Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3}}\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz W109 fl.jpg|thumb|Outwardly, the W109-based [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3|6.3]] appeared like any other 300 SEL. Its performance was another matter.]]\n\nIn 1966 company engineer Erich Waxenberger transplanted a massive 6.3 L [[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|Mercedes-Benz M100]] V8 from the company's flagship [[Mercedes-Benz 600|600]] (W100) into a W109 chassis, creating the first [[Sleeper (car)|Q-car]] from Mercedes-Benz. Full-scale production of 300 SEL 6.3 began in December 1967. 300 SEL 6.3 could reach {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 6.5 seconds and the top speed of {{Convert|220|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, making it the quickest production sedan, a title it held for many years.  \n\n==Second Series, 1967\u20131972==\n[[File:W108.Jpg|thumb|right|A W108 in France with [[selective yellow]] headlights]]\n[[File:01 W108 280SE.jpg|thumb|right|A 280 SE from July 1972 with a standard straight-six engine]]\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz 280 SE.jpg|thumb|right|A late model 280 SE 3.5, with a 3.5 V8 engine]]\nTo coincide with the launch of new smaller executive model, [[Mercedes-Benz_W114/W115|\"/8\" (Stroke Eight)]], to be slotted below W108/W109, the inline six engine range was revised in 1967. The 2.5-litre engine was enlarged to 2,778 cc (2.8 litres) and renamed as [[Mercedes-Benz_M180_engine#M130|M130]] for both carburetted ({{convert|140|hp|abbr=on}}) and fuel injected {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on}} versions.\n\n250 S and 250 SE were renamed as 280 S and 280 SE in November 1967 while 250 S was still offered in some export markets until March 1969. In January 1968, a long wheelbase variation, 280 SEL, was introduced for the first time. The 280 S could reach {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 12.5 seconds and top speed of {{Convert|185|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} ({{Convert|180|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} with automatic transmission). The 280 SE and 280 SEL accelerated to {{Convert|180|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 10.5 seconds with top speed of {{Convert|193|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|190|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} respectively.\n\nThe standard wheelbase 300 SEb was dropped while 300 SEL 2.8 obtained 2.8-litre engine with higher output {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}}, replacing the [[Mercedes-Benz_M186_engine|M186]] engine. The acceleration to {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} was 10.5 seconds, and the top speed was {{Convert|200|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nFollowing the success of limited production V8-powered [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3|300 SEL 6.3]] in 1967, Mercedes-Benz offered the all-new 3.5-litre [[Mercedes-Benz_M116_engine|M116]] V8 engine with new [[Jetronic|Bosch D-Jetronic]] electronic fuel injection in 1969. The V8 engine would move W108/W109 further upmarket in many export markets and allow them to be more competitive in the United States where many passenger vehicles, especially the American luxury marques, were fitted with V8 engines. The new {{convert|200|hp||0|abbr=on}} V8 engine was first fitted to W109 in August 1969 as 300 SEL 3.5 then to W108 in July 1970 as 280 SE 3.5 and 280 SEL 3.5.\n\nThe 3.5-litre V8 engine was bored out to 4,520 cc (4.5 litres) as to compensate for the loss of power following the changes in emission control regulations and due to lower fuel octane rating in the United States. The larger V8 engine was designated as [[Mercedes-Benz_M117_engine|M117]] and had the same output figures as 3.5-litre V8 engine. It was initially exclusive for the United States from 1971 to 1973 until the introduction of [[Mercedes-Benz_W116|450 SE/450 SEL (W116)]] which went on sale worldwide in September 1972 along with [[Mercedes-Benz_R107|450 SL (R107)]] and [[Mercedes-Benz_C107|450 SLC (C107)]]. 280 SE 4.5/280 SEL 4.5 and 300 SEL 4.5 were introduced in the spring of 1971.\n\nThe 300 SEL 2.8 was dropped in January 1970 since 300 SEL 3.5 was selling better and had better performance. The production of 280 SEL ended in April 1971, leaving 280 S and 280 SE as sole models with six-cylinder inline engines until the end of W108/W109 production in 1972, following the introduction of [[Mercedes-Benz_W116|W116]].\n\n==Transmission==\nThe standard transmission for Europe was a four-speed [[manual gearbox]]. A four-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] option was also available. Unusual among mainstream European automakers of the time, Mercedes developed and built their own automatic transmission system.<ref name=Autocar196702>{{cite journal |editor-first=Peter |editor-last= Garnier |title=Autocar Road Test: Mercedes-Benz 250 SE |journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume=126 |number=3703 |pages=17\u201323 |date=2 February 1967}}</ref> A five-speed manual gearbox was offered for six-cylinder inline engines only from 1969 to 1972, though a few customers opted for it.\n\nWhen the 3.5-litre V8 engine was introduced in 1969, the sole transmission choice was a four-speed automatic with fluid coupling. The customers could request the four-speed manual transmission with price reduction if they inclined so. As for 4.5-litre V8 engine for the United States, the transmission was three-speed automatic with torque converter.\n\n==Models==\n\n===W108===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Model\n!Chassis code\n!Production date\n!Number built\n!Engine\n|-\n|250 S||W108.012||07/65\u201303/69||74,677||2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M108]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|250 SE||W108.014||08/65\u201301/68||55,181||2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M129]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|300 SEb||W108.015||08/65\u201312/67||2,737||3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M189 engine|M189]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|280 S||W108.016||11/67\u201309/72||93,666||2.8&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M130]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|280 SE||W108.018||11/67\u201309/72||91,051||2.8&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M130]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|280 SEL||W108.019||01/68\u201304/71||8,250||2.8&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M130]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|280 SE 3.5||W108.057||07/70\u201309/72||11,309||3.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|-\n|280 SEL 3.5||W108.058||06/70\u201308/72||951||3.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|-\n|280 SE 4.5||W108.067||04/71\u201311/72||13,527||4.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|-\n|280 SEL 4.5||W108.068||05/71\u201311/72||8,173||4.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|}\n\n===W109===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Model\n!Chassis code\n!Production date\n!Number built\n!Engine\n|-\n|300 SEL||W109.015||09/65\u201312/67||2,369||3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M189 engine|M189]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|300 SEL||W109.016||12/67\u201301/70||2,519||2.8&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M130]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|300 SEL 6.3||W109.018||12/67\u201309/72||6,526||6.3&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|-\n|300 SEL 3.5||W109.056||08/69\u201309/72||9,483||3.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|-\n|300 SEL 4.5||W109.057||05/71\u201310/72||2,533||4.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|}\n\n===Timeline===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0 auto;

The line was an update of the predecessor [[Mercedes-Benz W111|W111]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W112|W112]] ''fintail'' sedans. The cars were successful in West Germany and in export markets including North America and Southeast Asia. During the seven-year run, a total of 383,361 units were manufactured.\n\nSince the W108 and W109 were only available as 4-door models, similarly squarish 2-door W111 and W112 coup\u00e9s and cabriolets filled those niches and are frequently mistaken for them.  \n\n==Model History==\n{{multiple image\n|width = 220\n|direction = vertical\n|image1 = Mercedes Benz W108 front 20070402.jpg\n|image2 = Mercedes Benz W108 rear 20070402.jpg\n|caption2 = Mercedes-Benz 280 SE W108\n|image3 = 3-4 dalas 12 pie zoga.JPG\n|caption3 = Since the W108 and W109 were only available as 4-door models, 2-door [[Mercedes-Benz W111|W111]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W112|W112]] coup\u00e9s and cabriolets, like this 1969 280 SE, are frequently mistaken for them\n}}\n\nThe car's predecessors, the [[Mercedes-Benz W111]] (1959\u201371)  and [[Mercedes-Benz W112|W112]] (1961-67), helped Mercedes-Benz develop greater sales and achieve [[economy of scale]] production, reducing both manufacture time and cost. Throughout the 1950s, Mercedes-Benz had been producing the coachwork [[Mercedes-Benz W188|300 S]] and [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL|300 SL]] and all but hand-built [[Mercedes-Benz W186|300 Adenauers]] alongside conveyor assembled Pontons (190, 190 SL and 220) etc. Unifying the entire Mercedes-Benz range into the [[Car tailfin|fintail]] ({{lang-de|Heckflosse}}) reduced production onto a single [[automobile platform]]. \n\nHowever, fashion trends in the early 1960s changed rapidly. By the time the [[Paul Bracq]]-designed 2-door coup\u00e9 and cabriolet W111s were launched, the predecessor W111 sedan's fins lost their chrome trim and sharp appearance.  The arrival of the [[Mercedes-Benz W113|W113]] 'Pagoda' coup\u00e9 and cabriolet in 1963 saw them further buried into the trunk's contour.  Finally, they disappeared completely on the [[Mercedes-Benz 600|W100 600]] in 1963.\n\nThe evolution of the W111 began under the leadership of Bracq in 1961 and ended in 1963. Although the fins' departure was the most visible change, the W108 had a lower body waist line and increased glass area - the windscreen alone was 17% larger than W111's - prominent enough to be referred to as a \"greenhouse\". The cars had a 60&nbsp;mm lower ride and 15&nbsp;mm wider doors. The result was a visibly newer-looking, sleeker car with an open and spacious interior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://benz-books.com/blog/542/mercedes-250s-se-w108/ |title=Mercedes 250S, SE W108: Mercedes elegance at its best |website=Benz Books |author=Bernd |accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Differences between W108 and W109===\nDue to the success of long wheelbase [[Mercedes-Benz W112|300 SE Lang (W112)]], which was intended as an interim car between [[Mercedes-Benz_W189|300 \"Adenauer\" (W189)]] and [[Mercedes-Benz_600|\"Grosser Mercedes\" 600 (W100)]], Mercedes-Benz continued to offer two wheelbase lengths for W108/W109. Initially, the wheelbase lengths denoted W108 (standard) and W109 (long). For 1968 model year, this distinction changed with the introduction of 280 SEL that retained W108, rather than W109, chassis designation.\n\nThe larger 3-litre six-cylinder inline engine (300 SEL) were exclusive to W109 with odd exception of standard wheelbase 300 SEb (1965\u20131967), which was designated as W108. The smaller six-cylinder inline engines (250 S/SE and 280 S/SE/SEL) were assigned to W108 only. Both eventually received the V8 engines in 1967 (W109) and 1970 (W108).\n\nW109 was more luxuriously appointed than W108, featuring burled walnut dashboards, automatic transmission, and power windows along with optional air conditioning system.\n\nThe W108 and W109 had different types of suspension systems: W108 retained the steel coil springs and oil-filled shock absorbers while W109 used the [[self-levelling suspension|self-levelling]] [[air suspension]].\n\n\n\n{{-}}\n\n==First Series, 1965\u20131967==\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz 300SEL-W108 Rear-view.JPG|thumb|right|W109 300 SEL]]\n[[File:Mercedes Benz W108.jpg|thumb|The simple elegance, large greenhouse, and practicality of the W108/W109 design is regarded by many as iconic]]\n\nThe W108/W109 premiered at the [[Frankfurt Auto Show#1965|Frankfurt Auto Show]] in 1965. The initial model range consisted of three W108s (250 S, 250 SE, and 300 SEb) and a sole W109 (300 SEL). The six-inline engines were carried over from the previous generation with mechanical refinements. The 2.2-litre [[Mercedes-Benz_M180_engine|M180]] engine was enlarged to 2.5 litres while the fuel-injected 3-litre [[Mercedes-Benz_M189_engine|M189]] version was carried over from \"300 Adenauer\".\n\nThe 250 S was fitted with 2,496 cc [[Mercedes-Benz_M180_engine|M108 engine]] with dual two-barrel downdraft [[carburettor]]s producing {{convert|130|bhp|abbr=on}} at 5,400 rpm. It could accelerate to {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 13 seconds for manual and 14 for automatic. The top speed was {{Convert|182|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for manual and {{Convert|177|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for automatic. The 250 SE had the same engine as 250 S except for fuel injection system and different engine designation [[Mercedes-Benz_M129_engine|(M129)]]. With increased engine output of {{convert|150|bhp||0|abbr=on}} at 5,500 rpm, 250 SE was one second faster to 100 km/h than 250 S and had higher top speed of {{Convert|193|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for both manual and automatic versions.\n\nBoth 300 SEb and 300 SEL were fitted with 2,966 cc [[Mercedes-Benz_M189_engine|M189 engine]]. The engine was an updated version of [[Mercedes-Benz_M186_engine|M186]], originally developed in 1951 for [[Mercedes-Benz W186|Type 300 \"Adenauer\"]], with Bosch mechanical fuel-injection system that caliberated the optimal fuel mixture automatically based on throttle pedal position and movement, engine speed, atmospheric pressure, water temperature, and driving conditions. The engine's output was {{convert|170|bhp||0|abbr=on}} at 5,400 rpm, and 300 SEb and 300 SEL could accelerate to {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 12 seconds and reach the top speed of {{Convert|200|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} ({{Convert|195|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} with automatic transmission).\n\nThe production figures for the first series from 1965 to 1967 showed 129,858 of 250 S/250 SE and 5,106 of 300 SEb/300 SEL. The tiny production figure of 300 SEb/300 SEL reflected the higher sales price with luxurious appointments, exclusivity, and smaller global market share.\n\n==300 SEL 6.3==\n{{main|Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3}}\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz W109 fl.jpg|thumb|Outwardly, the W109-based [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3|6.3]] appeared like any other 300 SEL. Its performance was another matter.]]\n\nIn 1966 company engineer Erich Waxenberger transplanted a massive 6.3 L [[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|Mercedes-Benz M100]] V8 from the company's flagship [[Mercedes-Benz 600|600]] (W100) into a W109 chassis, creating the first [[Sleeper (car)|Q-car]] from Mercedes-Benz. Full-scale production of 300 SEL 6.3 began in December 1967. 300 SEL 6.3 could reach {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 6.5 seconds and the top speed of {{Convert|220|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, making it the quickest production sedan, a title it held for many years.  \n\n==Second Series, 1967\u20131972==\n[[File:W108.Jpg|thumb|right|A W108 in France with [[selective yellow]] headlights]]\n[[File:01 W108 280SE.jpg|thumb|right|A 280 SE from July 1972 with a standard straight-six engine]]\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz 280 SE.jpg|thumb|right|A late model 280 SE 3.5, with a 3.5 V8 engine]]\nTo coincide with the launch of new smaller executive model, [[Mercedes-Benz_W114/W115|\"/8\" (Stroke Eight)]], to be slotted below W108/W109, the inline six engine range was revised in 1967. The 2.5-litre engine was enlarged to 2,778 cc (2.8 litres) and renamed as [[Mercedes-Benz_M180_engine#M130|M130]] for both carburetted ({{convert|140|hp|abbr=on}}) and fuel injected {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on}} versions.\n\n250 S and 250 SE were renamed as 280 S and 280 SE in November 1967 while 250 S was still offered in some export markets until March 1969. In January 1968, a long wheelbase variation, 280 SEL, was introduced for the first time. The 280 S could reach {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 12.5 seconds and top speed of {{Convert|185|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} ({{Convert|180|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} with automatic transmission). The 280 SE and 280 SEL accelerated to {{Convert|180|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 10.5 seconds with top speed of {{Convert|193|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|190|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} respectively.\n\nThe standard wheelbase 300 SEb was dropped while 300 SEL 2.8 obtained 2.8-litre engine with higher output {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}}, replacing the [[Mercedes-Benz_M186_engine|M186]] engine. The acceleration to {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} was 10.5 seconds, and the top speed was {{Convert|200|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nFollowing the success of limited production V8-powered [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3|300 SEL 6.3]] in 1967, Mercedes-Benz offered the all-new 3.5-litre [[Mercedes-Benz_M116_engine|M116]] V8 engine with new [[Jetronic|Bosch D-Jetronic]] electronic fuel injection in 1969. The V8 engine would move W108/W109 further upmarket in many export markets and allow them to be more competitive in the United States where many passenger vehicles, especially the American luxury marques, were fitted with V8 engines. The new {{convert|200|hp||0|abbr=on}} V8 engine was first fitted to W109 in August 1969 as 300 SEL 3.5 then to W108 in July 1970 as 280 SE 3.5 and 280 SEL 3.5.\n\nThe 3.5-litre V8 engine was bored out to 4,520 cc (4.5 litres) as to compensate for the loss of power following the changes in emission control regulations and due to lower fuel octane rating in the United States. The larger V8 engine was designated as [[Mercedes-Benz_M117_engine|M117]] and had the same output figures as 3.5-litre V8 engine. It was initially exclusive for the United States from 1971 to 1973 until the introduction of [[Mercedes-Benz_W116|450 SE/450 SEL (W116)]] which went on sale worldwide in September 1972 along with [[Mercedes-Benz_R107|450 SL (R107)]] and [[Mercedes-Benz_C107|450 SLC (C107)]]. 280 SE 4.5/280 SEL 4.5 and 300 SEL 4.5 were introduced in the spring of 1971.\n\nThe 300 SEL 2.8 was dropped in January 1970 since 300 SEL 3.5 was selling better and had better performance. The production of 280 SEL ended in April 1971, leaving 280 S and 280 SE as sole models with six-cylinder inline engines until the end of W108/W109 production in 1972, following the introduction of [[Mercedes-Benz_W116|W116]] in 1972.\n\n==Transmission==\nThe standard transmission for Europe was a four-speed [[manual gearbox]]. A four-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] option was also available. Unusual among mainstream European automakers of the time, Mercedes developed and built their own automatic transmission system.<ref name=Autocar196702>{{cite journal |editor-first=Peter |editor-last= Garnier |title=Autocar Road Test: Mercedes-Benz 250 SE |journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume=126 |number=3703 |pages=17\u201323 |date=2 February 1967}}</ref> A five-speed manual gearbox was offered for six-cylinder inline engines only from 1969 to 1972, though a few customers opted for it.\n\nWhen the 3.5-litre V8 engine was introduced in 1969, the sole transmission choice was a four-speed automatic with fluid coupling. The customers could request the four-speed manual transmission with price reduction if they inclined so. As for 4.5-litre V8 engine for the United States, the transmission was three-speed automatic with torque converter.\n\n==Models==\n\n===W108===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Model\n!Chassis code\n!Production date\n!Number built\n!Engine\n|-\n|250 S||W108.012||07/65\u201303/69||74,677||2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M108]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|250 SE||W108.014||08/65\u201301/68||55,181||2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M129]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|300 SEb||W108.015||08/65\u201312/67||2,737||3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M189 engine|M189]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|280 S||W108.016||11/67\u201309/72||93,666||2.8&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M130]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|280 SE||W108.018||11/67\u201309/72||91,051||2.8&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M130]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|280 SEL||W108.019||01/68\u201304/71||8,250||2.8&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M130]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|280 SE 3.5||W108.057||07/70\u201309/72||11,309||3.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|-\n|280 SEL 3.5||W108.058||06/70\u201308/72||951||3.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|-\n|280 SE 4.5||W108.067||04/71\u201311/72||13,527||4.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|-\n|280 SEL 4.5||W108.068||05/71\u201311/72||8,173||4.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|}\n\n===W109===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Model\n!Chassis code\n!Production date\n!Number built\n!Engine\n|-\n|300 SEL||W109.015||09/65\u201312/67||2,369||3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M189 engine|M189]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|300 SEL||W109.016||12/67\u201301/70||2,519||2.8&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M130 engine|M130]]'' [[Straight-6|I6]]\n|-\n|300 SEL 6.3||W109.018||12/67\u201309/72||6,526||6.3&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|-\n|300 SEL 3.5||W109.056||08/69\u201309/72||9,483||3.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M116 engine|M116]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|-\n|300 SEL 4.5||W109.057||05/71\u201310/72||2,533||4.5&nbsp;L ''[[Mercedes-Benz M117 engine|M117]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|}\n\n===Timeline===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0 auto;

The town was an important seaport held under a succession of royal houses in the [[Middle Ages]] as part of the lordship of [[Argos and Nauplia]], held initially by the [[de la Roche]] following the [[Fourth Crusade]] before coming under the [[Republic of Venice]] and, lastly, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The town was the capital of the [[First Hellenic Republic]] and of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]], from the start of the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] in 1821 until 1834. Nafplio is now the capital of the regional unit of [[Argolis]].\n\n==Name==\n\nThe name of the town changed several times over the centuries.

The Ottomans also called it ''Anabol\u0131''.\n\nIn the 19th century and early 20th century, the town was called indiscriminately ''N\u00e1fplion'' (\u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) and ''Nafplio'' (\u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf) in [[modern Greek]]. Both forms were used in official documents and travel guides. This explains why the old form ''N\u00e1fplion'' (sometimes transliterated to ''Navplion'') still occasionally survives up to this day.\n\n==Geography==\n{{wide image|\u0412\u0438\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u0430\u043f\u0444\u043b\u0438\u043e.jpg|750px|Panorama of modern Nafplion.}}\n\nNafplio is situated on the [[Argolic Gulf]] in the northeast [[Peloponnese]]. Most of the old town is on a peninsula jutting into the gulf; this peninsula forms a naturally protected bay that is enhanced by the addition of man-made [[mole (architecture)|moles]].

It was situated upon a rocky peninsula, connected with the mainland by a narrow isthmus. It was a very ancient place, and is said to have derived its name from [[Nauplius (mythology)|Nauplius]], the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Amymone]], and the father of [[Palamedes (Greek mythology)|Palamedes]], though it more probably owed its name, as [[Strabo]] has observed, to its harbour.<ref>\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u1f76 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, {{Cite Strabo|viii. p.368}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Pausanias|2|38|2}}</ref> [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] tells us that the Nauplians were [[ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]] belonging to the colony which [[Danaus]] brought to Argos;<ref>{{Cite Pausanias|4|35|2}}</ref> and from the position of their city upon a promontory running out into the sea, which is quite different from the site of the earlier Grecian cities, it is not improbable that it was originally a settlement made by strangers from the East.<ref>{{Cite DGRG|title=Nauplia}}</ref> Nauplia was at first independent of Argos, and a member of the maritime confederacy which held its meetings in the island of [[Calaureia]].<ref name=Strabo>{{Cite Strabo|viii. p.374}}</ref> About the time of the [[Second Messenian War]], it was conquered by the Argives; and the [[ancient Sparta|Lacedaemonians]] gave to its expelled citizens the town of [[Methone (Messenia)|Methone]] in [[ancient Messenia|Messenia]], where they continued to reside even after the restoration of the Messenian state by the [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] general [[Epaminondas]].<ref>{{Cite Pausanias|4|24|4}}, 4.27.8, 4.35.2.</ref> Argos now took the place of Nauplia in the Calaureian confederacy; and from this time Nauplia appears in history only as the seaport of Argos.<ref>\u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bb\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd, [[Euripides]] ''Orest.'' 767; \u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9, ''Electr.'' 451.</ref> As such it is mentioned by [[Strabo]],<ref name=Strabo/> but in the time of Pausanias (2nd century) the place was deserted.

Subsequently, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Principality of Achaea|Franks]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] added to the fortifications. In the middle ages Nauplia was called \u03c4\u1f78 \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f08\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, or \u03c4\u1f70 \u1f08\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1. It became a place of considerable importance in the middle ages, and has continued so down to the present day. In the time of the [[Crusades]] it first emerges from obscurity. Nafplio was taken in 1212 by French crusaders of the [[Principality of Achaea]]. It became part of the lordship of [[Argos and Nauplia]], which in 1388 was sold to the Republic of Venice,<ref>''Diplomatarium'' No. 127.</ref> who regarded it as one of their most important places in the Levant. During the subsequent 150 years, the lower city was expanded and fortified, and new fortifications added to Acronauplia.<ref>Wright, Ch. 1.</ref>\n\n===Venetian and Ottoman rule===\n{{Further|Stato da M\u00e0r|Ottoman Greece}}\nThe city, under Venetian rule twice repelled [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] attacks and sieges, first by [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] during the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1463\u201379)]] and then by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The city surrendered to the Ottomans in 1540, who renamed it Mora Yeni\u015fehri and established it as the seat of a [[Sanjak of Mora|sanjak]]. At that period, Nafplio looked very much like the 16th century image shown below to the right.\n\nThe [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] retook Nafplio in 1685 and made it the capital of their \"[[Kingdom of the Morea]]\". The city was strengthened by building the castle of [[Palamidi]], which was in fact the last major construction of the [[Stato da Mar|Venetian empire]] overseas. However, only 80 soldiers were assigned to defend the city and it was easily retaken by the Ottomans in 1715. Palamidi is located on a hill north of the old town. During the [[Greek War of Independence]], it played a major role. It was captured by [[Staikos Staikopoulos]] in November 1822.\n\n===19th century: Independence and first capital===\n{{See also|First Hellenic Republic}}\n\nDuring the [[Greek War of Independence]], Nafplio was a major Ottoman stronghold and was besieged for more than a year. The town finally surrendered on account of forced starvation. After its capture, because of its strong fortifications, it became the seat of the [[First Hellenic Republic|provisional government of Greece]].\n\nCount [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], first head of state of newly liberated Greece, set foot on the Greek mainland for the first time in Nafplio on 7 January 1828 and made it the official capital of Greece in 1829.  He was assassinated on 9 October 1831 by members of the [[Mavromichalis]] family, on the steps of the church of Saint Spyridon in Nafplio. After his assassination, a period of anarchy followed, until the arrival of King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] and the establishment of the new [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]]. Nafplio remained the capital of the kingdom until 1834, when King Otto decided to move the capital to [[Athens]].\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n\nTourism emerged slowly in the 1960s, but not to the same degree as some other Greek areas. Nevertheless, it tends to attract a number of tourists from [[Germany]] and the [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] countries in particular. Nafplio enjoys a very sunny and mild climate, even by Greek standards, and as a consequence has become a popular day or weekend road-trip destination for Athenians in wintertime.\n\nNafplio is a port, with fishing and transport ongoing, although the primary source of local employment currently is tourism, with two beaches on the other side of the [[peninsula]] from the main body of the town and a large amount of local accommodation.\n\nThe building of the [[National Bank of Greece]] is probably the only example to have been built in the [[Mycenaean Revival]] architectural style.<ref>\"Greece At Its Most Greek,\" by Phyllis rose, September 10, 2000, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE0D91631F933A2575AC0A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=4 ''New York Times''.]</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Nafplion Greece.jpg|550px|align-cap=center|Plateia Syntagmatos (Constitution Square).}}\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Nafplion_railway_station_11.jpg|thumb|Nafplio train station in 2019.]]\n===Bus===\nSince 1952, the town has been served by public bus ([[KTEL (Greece)|KTEL]] Argolida), which provides daily services to all destinations in region as well as other major Greek centers such as Athens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Company|url=http://www.ktelargolida.gr/?module=default&pages_id=4&lang=en|publisher=K.T.E.L Argolidas|accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Transportation Means|url=http://www.nafplio.gr/en/transportationmeansmenu.html|website=Municipality of Nafplion|publisher=Municipality of Nafplion|accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref> The journey to Athens takes two to two hours and 20 minutes, going via Corinth/Isthmos and [[Argos]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Map/Transport|url=http://www.visitnafplio.com/visitnafplio.com/Map_Transport.html|website=Visit Nafplio|accessdate=6 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401194143/http://www.visitnafplio.com/visitnafplio.com/Map_Transport.html|archivedate=1 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nRail service began in 1886 using an earlier station that still stands.<ref>{{cite web|title=The historical railway station of Nafplio|url=http://www.trainose.gr/en/%CE%BF-%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%85%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85/|publisher=TrainOSE|accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe town is connected by a branch line of ten kilometers from Argos to Nafplio.

Other fortifications of the city include the [[Palamidi]] and [[Bourtzi (Nafplio)|Bourtzi]], which is located in the middle of the harbour.\n\nNafplio maintains a traditional architectural style with many traditional-style colourful buildings and houses, influenced by the Venetians, because of the domination of 1338\u20131540. Also, modern-era neoclassical buildings are also preserved, while the building of the [[National Bank of Greece]] is an example of [[Mycenaean Revival architecture]].\n\nAround the city can be found several sculptures and statues.

The town was an important seaport held under a succession of royal houses in the [[Middle Ages]] as part of the lordship of [[Argos and Nauplia]], held initially by the [[de la Roche]] following the [[Fourth Crusade]] before coming under the [[Republic of Venice]] and, lastly, the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The Ottomans also called it ''Anabol\u0131''.\n\nIn the 19th century and early 20th century, the town was called indiscriminately ''N\u00e1fplion'' (\u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) and ''Nafplio'' (\u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf) in [[modern Greek]]. Both forms were used in official documents and travel guides. This explains why the old form ''N\u00e1fplion'' (sometimes transliterated to ''Navplion'') still occasionally survives up to this day.\n\n==Geography==\n{{wide image|\u0412\u0438\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u0430\u043f\u0444\u043b\u0438\u043e.jpg|750px|Panorama of modern Nafplion.}}\n\nNafplio is situated on the [[Argolic Gulf]] in the northeast [[Peloponnese]].

It was a very ancient place, and is said to have derived its name from [[Nauplius (mythology)|Nauplius]], the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Amymone]], and the father of [[Palamedes (Greek mythology)|Palamedes]], though it more probably owed its name, as [[Strabo]] has observed, to its harbour.<ref>\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u1f76 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, {{Cite Strabo|viii. p.368}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Pausanias|2|38|2}}</ref> [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] tells us that the Nauplians were [[ancient Egyptians|Egyptians]] belonging to the colony which [[Danaus]] brought to Argos;<ref>{{Cite Pausanias|4|35|2}}</ref> and from the position of their city upon a promontory running out into the sea, which is quite different from the site of the earlier Grecian cities, it is not improbable that it was originally a settlement made by strangers from the East.<ref>{{Cite DGRG|title=Nauplia}}</ref> Nauplia was at first independent of Argos, and a member of the maritime confederacy which held its meetings in the island of [[Calaureia]].<ref name=Strabo>{{Cite Strabo|viii. p.374}}</ref> About the time of the [[Second Messenian War]], it was conquered by the Argives; and the [[ancient Sparta|Lacedaemonians]] gave to its expelled citizens the town of [[Methone (Messenia)|Methone]] in [[ancient Messenia|Messenia]], where they continued to reside even after the restoration of the Messenian state by the [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] general [[Epaminondas]].<ref>{{Cite Pausanias|4|24|4}}, 4.27.8, 4.35.2.</ref> Argos now took the place of Nauplia in the Calaureian confederacy; and from this time Nauplia appears in history only as the seaport of Argos.<ref>\u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bb\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd, [[Euripides]] ''Orest.'' 767; \u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9, ''Electr.'' 451.</ref> As such it is mentioned by [[Strabo]],<ref name=Strabo/> but in the time of Pausanias (2nd century) the place was deserted.

Subsequently, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Principality of Achaea|Franks]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] added to the fortifications. In the middle ages Nauplia was called \u03c4\u1f78 \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f08\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, or \u03c4\u1f70 \u1f08\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1. It became a place of considerable importance in the middle ages, and has continued so down to the present day. In the time of the [[Crusades]] it first emerges from obscurity. Nafplio was taken in 1212 by French crusaders of the [[Principality of Achaea]]. It became part of the lordship of [[Argos and Nauplia]], which in 1388 was sold to the Republic of Venice,<ref>''Diplomatarium'' No. 127.</ref> who regarded it as one of their most important places in the Levant. During the subsequent 150 years, the lower city was expanded and fortified, and new fortifications added to Acronauplia.<ref>Wright, Ch. 1.</ref>\n\n===Venetian and Ottoman rule===\n{{Further|Stato da M\u00e0r|Ottoman Greece}}\nThe city, under Venetian rule twice repelled [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] attacks and sieges, first by [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] during the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1463\u201379)]] and then by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The city surrendered to the Ottomans in 1540, who renamed it Mora Yeni\u015fehri and established it as the seat of a [[Sanjak of Mora|sanjak]]. At that period, Nafplio looked very much like the 16th century image shown below to the right.\n\nThe [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] retook Nafplio in 1685 and made it the capital of their \"[[Kingdom of the Morea]]\". The city was strengthened by building the castle of [[Palamidi]], which was in fact the last major construction of the [[Stato da Mar|Venetian empire]] overseas. However, only 80 soldiers were assigned to defend the city and it was easily retaken by the Ottomans in 1715. Palamidi is located on a hill north of the old town. During the [[Greek War of Independence]], it played a major role. It was captured by [[Staikos Staikopoulos]] in November 1822.\n\n===19th century: Independence and first capital===\n{{See also|First Hellenic Republic}}\n\nDuring the [[Greek War of Independence]], Nafplio was a major Ottoman stronghold and was besieged for more than a year. The town finally surrendered on account of forced starvation. After its capture, because of its strong fortifications, it became the seat of the [[First Hellenic Republic|provisional government of Greece]].\n\nCount [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], first head of state of newly liberated Greece, set foot on the Greek mainland for the first time in Nafplio on 7 January 1828 and made it the official capital of Greece in 1829.  He was assassinated on 9 October 1831 by members of the [[Mavromichalis]] family, on the steps of the church of Saint Spyridon in Nafplio. After his assassination, a period of anarchy followed, until the arrival of King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] and the establishment of the new [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]]. Nafplio remained the capital of the kingdom until 1834, when King Otto decided to move the capital to [[Athens]].\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n\nTourism emerged slowly in the 1960s, but not to the same degree as some other Greek areas. Nevertheless, it tends to attract a number of tourists from [[Germany]] and the [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] countries in particular. Nafplio enjoys a very sunny and mild climate, even by Greek standards, and as a consequence has become a popular day or weekend road-trip destination for Athenians in wintertime.\n\nNafplio is a port, with fishing and transport ongoing, although the primary source of local employment currently is tourism, with two beaches on the other side of the [[peninsula]] from the main body of the town and a large amount of local accommodation.\n\nThe building of the [[National Bank of Greece]] is probably the only example to have been built in the [[Mycenaean Revival]] architectural style.<ref>\"Greece At Its Most Greek,\" by Phyllis rose, September 10, 2000, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE0D91631F933A2575AC0A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=4 ''New York Times''.]</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Nafplion Greece.jpg|550px|align-cap=center|Plateia Syntagmatos (Constitution Square).}}\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Nafplion_railway_station_11.jpg|thumb|Nafplio train station in 2019.]]\n===Bus===\nSince 1952, the town has been served by public bus ([[KTEL (Greece)|KTEL]] Argolida), which provides daily services to all destinations in region as well as other major Greek centers such as Athens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Company|url=http://www.ktelargolida.gr/?module=default&pages_id=4&lang=en|publisher=K.T.E.L Argolidas|accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Transportation Means|url=http://www.nafplio.gr/en/transportationmeansmenu.html|website=Municipality of Nafplion|publisher=Municipality of Nafplion|accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref> The journey to Athens takes two to two hours and 20 minutes, going via Corinth/Isthmos and [[Argos]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Map/Transport|url=http://www.visitnafplio.com/visitnafplio.com/Map_Transport.html|website=Visit Nafplio|accessdate=6 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401194143/http://www.visitnafplio.com/visitnafplio.com/Map_Transport.html|archivedate=1 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nRail service began in 1886 using an earlier station that still stands.<ref>{{cite web|title=The historical railway station of Nafplio|url=http://www.trainose.gr/en/%CE%BF-%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%85%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%85/|publisher=TrainOSE|accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe town is connected by a branch line of ten kilometers from Argos to Nafplio.

Until the thirteenth century, it was a town on its own. The arrival of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and the [[Franks]] transformed it into part of the town fortifications. Other fortifications of the city include the [[Palamidi]] and [[Bourtzi (Nafplio)|Bourtzi]], which is located in the middle of the harbour.\n\nNafplio maintains a traditional architectural style with many traditional-style colourful buildings and houses, influenced by the Venetians, because of the domination of 1338\u20131540. Also, modern-era neoclassical buildings are also preserved, while the building of the [[National Bank of Greece]] is an example of [[Mycenaean Revival architecture]].\n\nAround the city can be found several sculptures and statues. They are related mostly with the modern history of Nafplio, such as the statues of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], [[Otto of Greece]] and [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]].\n\n==Quarters==\n{{col-begin}}\n*Gyal\u00f3s\n*Kourti\n*Old town\n*Psaromachalas\n*Pronoia\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Cuisine===\nLocal specialities include:\n*''Goglies'' (Goges), pasta\n*''Giosa'', lamb or goat meat\n*''Bogana'', lamb meat with potatoes\n\n===Museums===\n*[[Archaeological Museum of Nafplion]]\n\n===Education===\nSince 2003, the [[University of Peloponnese]] has incorporated a new faculty, the School of Fine Arts.

For example, the parasitic trematode ''[[Microphallus]]'' sp., uses the snail ''[[New Zealand mud snail|Potamopyrgus antipodarum]]'' as an intermediate host. The parasite manipulates the snail's foraging behavior to increase the chance of it being preyed upon by the parasite's definitive hosts ([[waterfowl]]). The infected snail forages on the upper side of rocks during the period of the day when waterfowl feed most intensely. During the rest of the day, the snail forages at the bottom of rocks to reduce the risk of being eaten by fish (non-hosts for the parasitic trematode).<ref name=\"sjutton\">Levri, E. (1998).

The development of complex life cycles is most likely an adaptation of the parasite to survive in the predator.<ref name=\"Lafferty1999\" /> The development of parasite increased trophic transmission is a further adaptation in relation to a complex life cycle, where the parasite increases its transmission to a definitive host by manipulating its intermediate host.<ref name=\"sju\" />\n\n===Evolution of induced behaviors===\n\nThe ''adaptive manipulation'' hypothesis posits that specific behavioral alterations induced in a host can be used by parasites to increase their [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Under this hypothesis, induced behaviors are the result of natural selection acting upon the parasite's [[The Extended Phenotype|extended phenotype]] (in this case its ''host's behavior''). Many behaviors induced by [[obligate parasite]]s to complete their lifecycles are examples of adaptive manipulation because of their clear relationship to parasite fitness. For example, evidence has shown that infection by the parasitic worm ''[[Pomphorhynchus laevis]]'' leads to altered drifting behavior in its [[intermediate host]], the [[amphipod]] ''[[Gammarus pulex]]''; this altered behavior increases its host's predation risk by fish which are ''P. laevis''{{'}}s definitive hosts. The induced behavioral change in the host thus leads to the parasite's increased success in completing its life cycle.<ref name=\"Lagrue\">{{Cite journal | volume=88 |issue=11 |pages=2839\u20132847 |last1=Lagrue |first1=Cl\u00e9ment |last2=Kaldonski |first2=Nicolas |last3=Perrot-Minnot |first3=Marie J. |last4=Motreuil |first4=S\u00e9bastien |last5=Bollache |first5=Lo\u00efc |title=Modification of hosts' behavior by a parasite: field evidence for adaptive manipulation |journal=Ecology |date=Nov 2007 |pmid=18051653 |doi=10.1890/06-2105.1}}</ref> In general, whether a specific behavioral change serves an adaptive purpose for the parasite, the host, or both, depends on the entire \"host-parasite system\":<ref name=\"Klein 2003\">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(03)00163-X | pmid=12954438 | volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=441\u2013449 |last=Klein |first=Sabra L. |authorlink1=Sabra Klein|title=Parasite manipulation of the proximate mechanisms that mediate social behavior in vertebrates |journal=Physiology & Behavior |date=August 2003}}</ref> The life cycle of the pathogen, its virulence and the host's immune response.<ref name=\"Klein 2003\" />\n\nConversely, evolved behaviors of the host may be a result of adaptations to parasitism.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Del Giudice |first1=Marco |title=Invisible Designers: Brain Evolution Through the Lens of Parasite Manipulation |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |date=September 2019 |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=249\u2013282 |doi=10.1086/705038 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dbbd0d3fe29cdf98ad55285744935d22438da7e7 }}</ref>\n\n== Mechanisms ==\nThe way in which parasites induce behavioral changes in hosts has been compared to the way a neurobiologist would effect a similar change in a lab.<ref name= \"Hughes\">{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=edited by David P.

While the [[Tinbergen's four questions#Proximate explanations|proximate mechanisms]] underlying this broad targeting have not been fully characterized, two mechanisms used by parasites to alter behavior in [[vertebrate]] hosts have been identified: infection of the central nervous system and altered [[neurochemical]] communication.<ref name=\"Klein 2003\" />\n\n=== Infection of the central nervous system ===\n\nSome parasites alter host behavior by infecting [[neuron]]s in the host's central nervous system. The host's central nervous system responds to the parasite [[Immune system|as it would to any other infection]]. The hallmarks of such response include local inflammation and the release of chemicals such as [[cytokine]]s. The immune response itself is responsible for induced behavioral changes in many cases of parasitic infection. Parasites that are known to induce behavioral changes through central nervous system inflammation in their hosts include ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' in rats, ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' in mice and ''[[Plasmodium mexicanum]]'' in the Mexican lizard.<ref name=\"Klein 2003\" />\n\n[[File:Toxoplasma gondii (2).jpg|thumb|''Toxoplasma gondii'' induces behavioral changes in rats by infecting central nervous system neurons.]]\n\nWhile some parasites exploit their hosts' typical immune responses, others seem to alter the immune response itself.

A 1993 monograph considered the 229 star clusters called non-existent in the RNGC.
