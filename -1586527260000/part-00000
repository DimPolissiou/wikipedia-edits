In 1978, he founded a new company, '''Big Briar'''. Moog Music declared [[bankruptcy]] in 1987, and the Moog Music trademark was returned to Robert Moog in 2002, when Big Briar resumed operations under the name Moog Music. \n\nMoog Music also manages [[Moogfest]], a pioneering electronic music and music technology festival currently taking place in Durham, NC.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1953\u20131967: R.A.

Furthermore, the Minimoog introduced the pitch wheel, enabling vibrato and pitch-bending an interval of a perfect fifth above or below the note played on the keyboard.<ref name=\":1\" />Its compact size and range of available sounds allowed the Minimoog to be a comparative success, selling over 13,000 units over the next decade.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Pink Floyd]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], and [[Tangerine Dream]] were among the numerous musicians who used the Minimoog.\n\nOther variations on the Minimoog continued to be produced, until the company simply decided to re-release the Minimoog in 2016.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== 1975 - Taurus ===\n[[File:Moog Taurus.jpg|thumb|The Moog Taurus, with its organ-style pedals.]]\nThe first true Moog bass instrument was the [[Moog Taurus]], a pedal-operated analog synthesizer.<ref name=\":2\" /> Like the Moog, it remained a monophonic analog subtractive synthesizer, initially with 13 pedals in its first model.
