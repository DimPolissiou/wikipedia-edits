St. Moritz is first mentioned around 1137\u201339 as ''ad sanctum Mauricium''.<ref name=HDS/> The village was named after [[Saint Maurice]], an [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] saint from southern Egypt said to have been martyred in 3rd century Roman Switzerland while serving as leader of the [[Theban Legion]].\n\nPilgrims traveled to Saint Mauritius often to the church of the springs, where they drank from the blessed, bubbling waters of the Mauritius springs in the hopes of being healed. In 1519, the Medici pope, [[Leo X]], promised full absolution to anyone making a pilgrimage to the church of the springs. In the 16th century, the first scientific treatises about the St. Moritz mineral springs were written. In 1535, [[Paracelsus]], the great practitioner of nature cures, spent some time in St. Moritz. \n[[File:St. Moritz Bains.JPG|thumb|Baths in St. Moritz, ca. 1881]]\n\nAlthough it received some visitors during the summer, the origins of the winter resort only date back {{Time ago|1864}} to September 1864, when St. Moritz hotel pioneer [[Caspar Badrutt]] made a wager with four British summer guests: they should return in winter and, in the event that the village was not to their liking, he would reimburse their travel costs.

Its popularity extends to the altitude, weather, world class [[sport of athletics|athletics track]], and availability of paths and trails in the area.\n\nIn 1904, the oldest and world's last remaining natural bob run was opened. The {{convert|1.72<!--2-->|km|2|abbr=on}} ice channel \u2013 also known as the world's biggest {{nowrap|\"ice sculpture\" \u2013}} is built every winter from the ground up with only snow and water. The bob run hosted numerous world championships and was used in both Olympic Winter Games. In the early 1930s, some members of the bob club started taking guests along for taxi rides; today they run with slightly modified racing bobs.\n\nFor the 1928 games, the [[Cross-country skiing at the 1928 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]] and the cross-country skiing part of the [[Nordic combined at the 1928 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]] events took place around the hills of St. Moritz.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1928/1928w2.pdf 1928 Winter Olympics official report.] Part 2. pp. 8-10. {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Twenty years later, once again the [[Cross-country skiing at the 1948 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]], the cross-country skiing part of the [[Nordic combined at the 1948 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined]], and the [[Ice hockey at the 1948 Winter Olympics|ice hockey]] events took place in St. Moritz.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/ORW1948.pdf 1948 Winter Olympics official report.] pp. 6, 21, 23. {{in lang|fr|de}}</ref>\n[[File:Scultura di David Wynn.JPG|thumb|''[[Cresta run|Cresta]] Rider'',<br />by [[David Wynne (sculptor)|David Wynne]] (1985)]]\n[[File:Casin\u00f2 St. Moritz 20170820 160404.jpg|thumb|Casin\u00f2 St. Moritz]]\n\nIn addition to the above sports, St. Moritz is also well known as a destination for sailing. It is the host venue for the annual St. Moritz Match Race held on lake St. Moritz. The St. Moritz Match Race event is part of the prestigious [[World Match Racing Tour]] which covers 3 continents. The event draws the world's best sailing teams to St. Moritz in a gladiatorial battle of nerve and skill on the water. The identical supplied (BLU-26) boats are raced two at a time in an on the water dogfight which tests the sailors and skippers to the limits of their physical abilities. Points accrued count towards the World Match Racing Tour and a place in the final event, with the overall winner taking the title ISAF World Match Racing Tour Champion.

Racing in such close proximity (approximately 15 m) to the Lake St. Moritz shoreline provides excellent heart of the action viewing for the audience.\n\n==Tourism==\nThanks to its favorable location, St. Moritz enjoys over 300 days of sunshine a year. Every winter it hosts the \"White Turf\" horse race on the frozen [[Lake St. Moritz]] attended by the international [[upper class]].\n\nPopular pastimes include [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], and [[hiking]], and nearby there is also the world-famous [[Cresta Run]] [[toboggan]] course.\n\nThe year-round population is 5,600, with some 3,000 seasonal employees supporting hotels and rental units with a total of 13,000 beds.
