The Patriots looked to improve on their 12\u20134 record from 2006 and win the [[AFC East]] for the sixth time in seven years.\n\nThe Patriots finished the 2007 regular season by winning all sixteen of their games. They became only the eighth team in NFL history to finish a regular season undefeated, and first to do so since the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]], as well as only the fourth to finish undefeated and untied. The Patriots were also the first team with a perfect regular season since the NFL expanded its schedule to sixteen games in 1978. Thus, they broke the record for victories in a single regular season that had been shared by the [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|1984 San Francisco 49ers]], the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]], the [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|1998 Minnesota Vikings]], and the [[2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2004 Pittsburgh Steelers]], and later tied by the [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011 Green Bay Packers]] and [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|2015 Carolina Panthers]], who each finished with a record of 15\u20131, and are one of the only teams before or since that had nearly went 16\u20130. Honorable mentions include the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998 Denver Broncos]] and the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in [[2005 Indianapolis Colts season|2005]] and [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|2009]], all of whom had started 13\u20130 and finished 14\u20132 respectively. The 1984 49ers and 1985 Bears would win [[Super Bowl XIX]] and [[Super Bowl XX]] respectively, the 1998 Vikings and 2004 Steelers would lose their conference championship games, the 2011 Packers would lose their first playoff game, and the 2015 Panthers would lose [[Super Bowl 50]].\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XLII]], the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] defeated the Patriots 17\u201314 in an upset. With the loss, the Patriots were not able to join the 1984 49ers and 1985 Bears as Super Bowl champions, failing to go 19\u20130 and claim their fourth Super Bowl victory. Despite this loss, the 2007 Patriots are still regarded as one of the greatest teams in NFL history. \n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n== Season Summary ==\nThe Patriots entered the offseason following a stunning loss to the [[Colts\u2013Patriots rivalry|rival]] [[Indianapolis Colts]] in the [[NFL playoffs, 2006\u201307|AFC Championship]] after blowing a 21\u20133 first half lead--although they did when 6 of their final 7 regular season games in 2006.  After having lost their two starting wide receivers in the previous offseason, the Patriots added [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]] in free agency and traded for [[Wes Welker]] from the [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Randy Moss]] from the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the spring. Welker would tie for the NFL lead in receptions with [[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]] in 2007 while Moss would set an NFL regular season record with 23 touchdown catches (part of his 98 receptions). The season began with controversy, when Patriot head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and the Patriots organization were penalized by the NFL for their involvement in the videotaping of opponents\u2019 defensive signals from an unauthorized location in their Week 1 game against the [[New York Jets]]. This came to be referred to in the media as [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|\"Spygate\"]]. Early in the season, the Patriots won their first two games by identical scores of 38\u201314, and followed up the next game with a  score of 38\u20137. Despite the media scrutiny, the Patriots continued to gain momentum, winning mid-season games by scores such as 49\u201328, 52\u20137, and 56\u201310, as quarterback [[Tom Brady]] emphasized the team's desire to blow out and \u201ckill teams.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2007/11/21/dressed_for_success/?page=full|title=Dressed for success?|work=The Boston Globe|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=June 16, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023141103/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2007/11/21/dressed_for_success/?page=full|archivedate=October 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Patriots set the record for most points in a season with 589, shattering the [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|previous record]] by 33 points.

The Jets reached Patriots territory on their opening possession, but were forced to punt. The Patriots then began a 12-play, 91-yard drive that ended in an 11-yard [[Wes Welker]] touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7\u20130 lead. On the ensuing kickoff, [[Kelley Washington]] forced a fumble on Jets returner [[Justin Miller (American football)|Justin Miller]] after a 26-yard return, but tight end [[Chris Baker (American football)|Chris Baker]] recovered the ball at the Jets\u2019 33-yard line to retain possession. The Jets went three-and-out, but the Patriots punted back to the Jets despite a 19-yard [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]] catch to begin their next series. Three plays later, Jets quarterback [[Chad Pennington]] was sacked by linebacker [[Mike Vrabel]] and defensive lineman [[Ty Warren]], forcing a Jets punt on the final play of the first quarter.\n\n[[File:Patriots preseason 2007.jpg|thumb|Patriots players on the sideline during the 2007 preseason]]\n\nStarting from their own 42-yard line after the punt, the Patriots reached the Jets\u2019 25-yard line, where kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] lined up for a 42-yard field goal attempt. However, the snap was fumbled by holder [[Matt Cassel]], and recovered by Cassel to turn the ball over on downs. The Jets responded with a 10-play, 66-yard drive, tying the game at 7\u20137 on a 7-yard pass from Pennington to wide receiver [[Laveranues Coles]]. Several plays into the Patriots\u2019 ensuing drive, before and after the two-minute warning, wide receiver [[Randy Moss]] caught passes of 33- and 22-yards from quarterback [[Tom Brady]] to put the Patriots in the Jets\u2019 red zone. Brady then connected with tight end [[Benjamin Watson]] on a 5-yard touchdown pass that was reviewed by the booth but upheld, giving the Patriots a 14\u20137 lead going into halftime.\n\nPatriots cornerback [[Ellis Hobbs]] returned the opening kickoff of the second half 108&nbsp;yards for a touchdown and a new NFL record for the longest kickoff return in the league's history; at the time, it also tied the existing record for longest play in NFL history (a record broken a few weeks later by [[Antonio Cromartie]]). Nine plays into the Jets\u2019 next drive, Pennington was sacked by defensive lineman [[Jarvis Green]] and was injured; [[Kellen Clemens]] entered the game but the Jets were forced to punt two plays later. Four plays later, Brady hit Moss for a 51-yard touchdown reception that extended the Patriots\u2019 lead to 28\u20137. However, the Jets came back with a 9-play, 70-yard drive that was capped off with Coles\u2019 second touchdown grab of the day, this one from one yard out, to cut the Patriots\u2019 lead to 28\u201314. The Patriots received the ensuing kickoff with just over two minutes remaining in the third quarter and would not surrender the ball until there was just under seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, ending the 17-play drive with a 22-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots\u2019 lead to 31\u201314. The Jets then went three-and-out, and punter [[Ben Graham (football player)|Ben Graham]]\u2019s 36-yard punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 47-yard line. On a 1st-and-goal from the Jets\u2019 1-yard line, fullback [[Heath Evans]] could not score; the Patriots challenged that the ball did in fact break the plane of the goal line but the play was upheld. On the next play, following the two-minute warning, Evans did in fact score on a 1-yard run, increasing the Patriots\u2019 lead to 38\u201314. The Jets\u2019 next drive stalled on a Vrabel strip-sack of Clemens that the Jets recovered, but ended on a failed fourth down conversion from the Jets\u2019 38-yard line.

For the second consecutive week, the game began with a touchdown on the Patriots\u2019 first series: this time, Brady hit Watson for a 7-yard touchdown pass to give the Patriots a 7\u20130 lead. On the first play of the ensuing Chargers possession, their first, linebacker [[Rosevelt Colvin]] intercepted a [[Philip Rivers]] pass, but it did not translate into points for the Patriots as Gostkowski then missed a 41-yard field goal attempt on the Patriots\u2019 resulting series. After a Chargers three-and-out, the Patriots capped off a 10-play, 75-yard drive with a 23-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 14\u20130. Colvin then added a sack and forced fumble to his game statistics, as he strip-sacked Rivers after the Chargers reached the Patriots\u2019 34-yard line and defensive lineman [[Vince Wilfork]] recovered the fumble for the Patriots\u2019 second forced turnover of the game.\n\nOn the Patriots\u2019 next drive, which spanned into the second quarter, Brady was strip-sacked by linebacker [[Shawne Merriman]] at the Chargers\u2019 29-yard line, but Brady recovered his own fumble to retain possession for the Patriots. Six plays later, a 24-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots\u2019 lead to 17\u20130. After a Chargers three-and-out, the Patriots were pushed back to their 10-yard line after another Merriman sack of Brady. The Patriots would punt back to the Chargers, but on a 3rd-and-1 from the Patriots\u2019 37-yard line, Rivers was intercepted by linebacker [[Adalius Thomas]], who returned it 65&nbsp;yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 24\u20130 lead. The Chargers were unable to get past midfield on their next drive and punted, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line with just under three minutes to play in the first half. A 25-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Chargers safety [[Marlon McCree]] would help the Patriots reach the Chargers\u2019 26-yard line, but Brady was intercepted by safety [[Clinton Hart]] at the Chargers\u2019 10-yard line. The Chargers then ran one play to end the half.\n\nReceiving the kickoff to begin the second half, the Chargers embarked on a 16-play, 72-yard drive, reaching Patriots territory on a 22-yard third down reception by tight end [[Antonio Gates]]. Ten plays later, fullback [[Lorenzo Neal]] caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to put the Chargers on the scoreboard at 24\u20137. The Patriots responded by going 75&nbsp;yards on seven plays, taking a 31\u20137 lead on a 24-yard Moss touchdown reception, his second of the night. Three plays later, Rivers was intercepted by Patriots safety [[James Sanders (American football)|James Sanders]] at the Patriots\u2019 38-yard line, but the play was nullified by a 37-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Hobbs. Rivers completions of 19&nbsp;yards to wide receiver [[Malcom Floyd]] and 12&nbsp;yards to running back [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] helped put the Chargers in the Patriots\u2019 red zone, where Rivers completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Gates on the second play of the fourth quarter to cut the Patriots\u2019 lead to 31\u201314.\n\nOn the ensuing kickoff, Chargers wide receiver [[Kassim Osgood]] forced a fumble of Hobbs after a 31-yard return that was recovered by Chargers cornerback [[Quentin Jammer]] at the Patriots\u2019 31-yard line. However, Rivers was sacked twice for losses of 10&nbsp;yards each on the next two plays, the second of which was a strip-sack by Colvin that was recovered by offensive lineman [[Kris Dielman]]; the Chargers punted on 4th-and-30. Starting from their own 9-yard line with more than 13&nbsp;minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots did not surrender the ball back to the Chargers until there was less than four minutes left in the fourth quarter. This 15-play, 91-yard drive culminated in a 3-yard touchdown run by running back [[Sammy Morris]], extending the Patriots\u2019 lead to 38\u201314. The Chargers could not convert a first down on their next possession, giving the ball back to the Patriots to end the game as they improved to 2\u20130.\n\n===Week 3 vs. Buffalo Bills===\n{{Americanfootballbox|\n|Road=Bills\n|R1=7||R2=0||R3=0||R4=0\n|Home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=3||H2=14||H3=14||H4=7\n|stadium= Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|time= 1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT\n|weather= {{convert|74|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, clear\n|TV=CBS |TVAnnouncers= [[Kevin Harlan]] (play-by-play) and [[Rich Gannon]] (color commentator)\n|referee= [[Scott Green (American football official)|Scott Green]]\n|attendance= 68,756\n}}\nThe 0\u20132 Bills, who had not beaten the Patriots since Week 1 of [[2003 New England Patriots season|the 2003 season]], faced off against the Patriots in Foxboro.

Two plays later, Hobbs sacked Losman, causing a fumble at the Bills\u2019 35-yard line that set up a 24-yard Gostkowski field goal.

Early in the second quarter, the Patriots drove to the Bills\u2019 29-yard line, but on fourth down, opted not to punt; the gamble did not pay off and the Patriots turned the ball over on downs. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots again drove deep into Bills\u2019 territory, this time to the Bills\u2019 3-yard line, but a Brady fumble on a rushing attempt kept the Patriots from scoring. The Patriots challenged the ruling but it was upheld. The Bills could not advance past their own 1-yard line on their next possession, with punter [[Brian Moorman]] booming a 75-yard kick that was returned 29&nbsp;yards by Welker. Starting in Bills\u2019 territory, Brady culminated a six-play drive with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Watson. Another Bills punt gave the Patriots the ball in Bills territory again, setting up another six-play drive that ended in a 3-yard touchdown catch by Moss.\n\nAfter the teams exchanged three-and-outs to begin the second half, the Patriots embarked on a nine-play, 89-yard drive that ended on a 4-yard [[Jabar Gaffney]] touchdown reception that gave the Patriots a 24\u20137 lead. After another punt, the Patriots advanced into Bills territory on a 26-yard pass to Welker that was kept alive when Welker lateraled to Moss for another 11&nbsp;yards. Morris then ran in for a 4-yard touchdown. The Bills were able to pin the Patriots at their own 2-yard line on their next punt, but that only proved to be the beginning of a 10-play, 98-yard drive that came to a close when Brady connected with Moss on a 45-yard touchdown pass, extending the Patriots\u2019 lead to 38\u20137. The catch made Moss the first player in NFL history to have three games with at least 100 receiving yards to start a season. After an exchange of punts, the Bills began their ensuing drive with Edwards throwing an interception to cornerback [[Asante Samuel]], which was returned 42&nbsp;yards to the Bills\u2019 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not generate any points off the turnover, with an Evans run on fourth down from the Bills\u2019 8-yard line coming up short of the first down.

On the game's opening drive, the Patriots drove 66&nbsp;yards on 11 plays, stalling at the Bengals\u2019 13-yard line before Gostkowski hit a 31-yard field goal. The Bengals\u2019 next drive would span five plays but only one yard, ending in a punt. After an exchange of punts, the Patriots began a drive from their own 35-yard line, but quickly advanced into Bengals territory on a 49-yard Morris run. Three plays later, Brady hit Vrabel on a 1-yard touchdown pass to extend the Patriots lead to 10\u20130. After a Bengals punt on the first play of the second quarter, the Patriots had the ball but found themselves in a 3rd-and-23 situation, when Brady was intercepted by [[Leon Hall]] at the Bengals\u2019 35-yard line. The Bengals capitalized on the turnover, with [[Carson Palmer]] ending a five-play drive on a 1-yard touchdown pass to [[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]]. The Patriots responded by going on a 12-yard, 62-yard drive, finishing it with a 7-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 17\u20137. The Bengals managed to reach the Patriots\u2019 20-yard line on their next possession, but a Samuel interception at the 2-yard line kept the Bengals from scoring at the end of the first half.\n\nThe Bengals reached midfield on the opening drive of the third quarter before punting. From their own 19-yard line, the Patriots moved deep in Bengals territory after a 15-yard penalty was tacked onto a 16-yard Moss catch. A few plays later, Morris ran for his second touchdown of the night; the 7-yard run opened the Patriots lead to 24\u20137. The Bengals, though, continued to threaten the Patriots offensively, moving to the Patriots\u2019 22-yard line before linebacker [[Tedy Bruschi]] tipped a third-down pass to force a 40-yard [[Shayne Graham]] field goal. The Patriots next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but a Morris run on third down from the Bengals\u2019 13-yard line was stopped for a loss, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. Yet again, the Bengals moved into Patriots territory on their ensuing drive, but the Patriots defense prevented another touchdown and forced a 48-yard field goal, making the score 27\u201313. On the Patriots\u2019 next drive, a 23-yard Stallworth catch put the Patriots in Bengals territory, setting up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss. Down 34\u201313, the Bengals continued to move the ball with a 17-yard Houshmandzadeh catch on the next play, but Palmer's next pass attempt was intercepted by [[Randall Gay]] at the Patriots\u2019 47-yard line. The Patriots then ran out the clock to end the game and bring their record to 4\u20130.\n\n===Week 5: vs. Cleveland Browns===\n{{Americanfootballbox|\n|Road=Browns\n|R1=0||R2=0||R3=3||R4=14\n|Home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=10||H2=10||H3=0||H4=14\n|stadium= Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|time= 1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT\n|weather= {{convert|56|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, cloudy and cool, chance of showers\n|TV=CBS |TVAnnouncers= [[Greg Gumbel]] (play-by-play) and [[Dan Dierdorf]] (color commentator)\n|referee= [[Walt Coleman]]\n|attendance= 68,756\n}}\n[[File:Patriots-Browns 2007.jpg|thumb|Kicking after a touchdown against the Browns]]\nReturning to Foxboro, the Patriots faced off against the Browns, coached by their former defensive coordinator [[Romeo Crennel]]. The Patriots opened the game with a 14-play, 78-yard drive culminating in a Gostkowski 20-yard field goal. After a 65-yard drive brought them to the Patriots\u2019 1-yard line, the Browns failed to score on two downs before quarterback [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] threw an interception to linebacker [[Junior Seau]] on third down. Following a Patriots three-and-out, a Samuel interception on the first play of the Browns\u2019 next drive gave the Patriots the ball at the Browns\u2019 34-yard line. Brady quickly turned the turnover into points, throwing a 34-yard touchdown pass to Stallworth to give the Patriots a 10\u20130 lead. The Browns would then punt on their next drive. On the first drive of the second quarter, the Patriots would move into Browns territory but were forced to punt, giving the Browns the ball at their own 12-yard line. After a 36-yard punt by [[Scott Player]], the Patriots began their ensuing drive from their own 49-yard line. They would advance to the Browns\u2019 4-yard line, but a Morris run for a loss forced a 25-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriots a 13\u20130 lead. The Browns\u2019 next drive showed promise after Anderson moved the team from their own 10-yard line to the 46-yard line, but following the two-minute warning a false start penalty and then an interception by Seau, his second of the game, ended the advance. With good field position, Brady moved the 25 necessary yards in three plays, taking a 20\u20130 lead on a 7-yard Watson touchdown reception. A Bruschi sack then forced the Browns to take a knee to end the half.\n\nIn the second half, both teams exchanged punts before the Browns began an 8-play, 56-yard drive that got them on the scoreboard, with [[Phil Dawson]] kicking a 42-yard field goal. Neither team could advance past midfield until the closing minutes of the quarter. The Browns would then score their first touchdown of the day, on a 21-yard strike from Anderson to wide receiver [[Tim Carter (wide receiver)|Tim Carter]]. The Patriots would respond with their own touchdown drive, taking a 27\u201310 lead on a 25-yard touchdown catch by Watson. After an exchange of punts gave the Browns the ball at the Patriots\u2019 35-yard line, Anderson threw his second touchdown pass of the day, this one good for 14&nbsp;yards to tight end [[Kellen Winslow II]] to pull the Browns to within 10 points. The Patriots were able to hold the ball for the next five minutes, but could not score, with a Brady pass to Vrabel falling incomplete on fourth down from the Browns\u2019 4-yard line. However, this meant the Browns had to begin their next drive from that spot, and on the first play, Winslow fumbled a 15-yard catch, which was recovered by Gay and returned for a touchdown. The Browns reached the Patriots\u2019 10-yard line on the final possession of the game, but could not score, ending the game at 34\u201317, giving the Patriots their fifth win of the season as they improved to 5\u20130.

The Patriots took the opening drive of the game 80&nbsp;yards and capped it off with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Stallworth. After Dolphins quarterback [[Cleo Lemon]] fumbled to give the Patriots the ball on the Dolphins\u2019 28-yard line, the Patriots took a 14\u20130 lead with a 2-yard touchdown reception by Kyle Brady. The Dolphins cut the lead in half with a 4-yard Lemon touchdown run to end a 79-yard drive early in the second quarter, but [[Willie Andrews]] returned the ensuing kickoff 74&nbsp;yards to give the Patriots another 14-point lead. Following a Dolphins punt, a 36-yard Welker reception set up a 35-yard Moss touchdown catch. After another Dolphins punt, Brady connected with Moss on a 50-yard touchdown strike, giving the Patriots a 35\u20137 lead. An exchange of punts left the Dolphins with the ball at their own 1-yard line, but a 49-yard punt by [[Brandon Fields]] and a holding penalty on [[Kelley Washington]] gave the Patriots the ball at their own 29-yard line. Still, Brady led the Patriots on another scoring drive, ending this one on a 14-yard Welker catch to give the Patriots a 42\u20137 lead going into halftime.

Following a Patriots punt, the Dolphins began a 10-play, 80-yard drive that ended on a 1-yard [[Patrick Cobbs]] touchdown run early in the fourth quarter, cutting their deficit to 28 points. The Patriots replaced Brady with backup Cassel on the next drive, but after Cassel threw an interception to defensive end [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]] which Taylor returned for a touchdown, Brady returned for the Patriots\u2019 next possession.

On the Redskins\u2019 ensuing possession, Warren recovered a Vrabel strip-sack of [[Jason Campbell]] at the Redskins\u2019 21-yard line, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Redskins turned the ball over again on their next possession on a Samuel interception, only to regain it on the next play after Brady was strip-sacked by [[Phillip Daniels]] at the Patriots\u2019 40-yard line. The string of turnovers continued as the Redskins drove 20&nbsp;yards before another Vrabel strip-sack of Campbell was again recovered by Warren. With less than 2&nbsp;minutes remaining in the first half, the Patriots drove 73&nbsp;yards, and on a fake spike play from the Redskins\u2019 6-yard line, increased their lead to 24\u20130 on a touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. That touchdown pass was Brady's 29th of the season, eclipsing his career high set in [[2004 New England Patriots season|2004]] and [[2002 New England Patriots season|2002]], but with it only being week 8, accomplished this in only playing through the first eight of 16 games.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, an 85-yard Patriots drive ended in another Brady touchdown run, this one from 2&nbsp;yards out. The Redskins committed their fourth turnover of the game on their next possession, as Vrabel strip-sacked Campbell for the third time in the game; this time Colvin recovered the fumble and returned it 11&nbsp;yards for a touchdown to increase the Patriots\u2019 lead to 38\u20130. The Redskins managed to reach the Patriots\u2019 13-yard line on their next drive, but on fourth down, the Redskins could not convert and turned the ball over again. The Patriots began their next drive where they left off, going 88&nbsp;yards on a 14-play drive that spanned into the fourth quarter. It was finished on a 2-yard touchdown reception by Welker that grew the Patriots lead to 45\u20130. Following a Redskins punt, on the Patriots\u2019 next series, Cassel replaced Brady.

J. Feeley]], starting in place of an injured [[Donovan McNabb]], threw an interception to Samuel, who returned it for a touchdown. On the ensuing drive, the Eagles responded with a 14-play drive capped off by a 1-yard touchdown run by [[Brian Westbrook]]; thus, before the Patriots offense had its first possession, the game was tied 7\u20137. On that possession, Brady threw seven passes, was sacked once, and scrambled for 12&nbsp;yards, before Evans had a 1-yard touchdown run (the first called run of the game for the Patriots). The Eagles tied the game again on their next possession when wide receiver [[Greg Lewis (wide receiver)|Greg Lewis]] caught a 28-yard touchdown pass from Feeley. After a successful [[onside kick]] attempt by the Eagles led to a three-and-out drive, the Patriots started at their own 20-yard line and moved the ball all the way to the Eagles\u2019 11-yard line before the drive stalled and Gostkowski converted a 23-yard field goal. The Eagles responded with another touchdown pass from Feeley to Lewis, this one from 18&nbsp;yards out, to end a 68-yard drive. With less than 3&nbsp;minutes to go in the first half the Patriots were trailing the Eagles, 21\u201317. The Patriots then converted three third downs on their last possession of the half, and Gaffney caught a 19-yard touchdown pass to give the Patriots a halftime lead, 24\u201321.\n\nAfter an exchange of punts to begin the second half, Maroney saw his first carries of the game on a drive that appeared to end in a 4-yard Moss touchdown pass before the catch was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty. The next three plays were incomplete passes by Brady, and on fourth down, Gostkowski missed a 32-yard field goal to keep the score at 24\u201321 in favor of the Patriots. The Eagles responded with a 10-play, 78-yard drive, retaking the lead on an 8-yard touchdown pass to [[Reggie Brown (wide receiver)|Reggie Brown]]. After an unsuccessful fourth down conversion attempt from the Eagles\u2019 33-yard line, the Patriots defense held the Eagles to a three-and-out, forcing a punt. On a third down in the middle of the Patriots\u2019 next drive, Welker, who finished with 13 catches on the night, caught a 16-yard pass that moved the ball into the Eagles\u2019 red zone. With 7:24 left in the game, Maroney put the Patriots ahead 31\u201328 with a 4-yard touchdown run. The Eagles moved the ball to the Patriots\u2019 29-yard line on their next drive, but on 2nd and 4, Feeley was intercepted by Samuel in the end zone with 2:49 remaining in the game.

On the first drive of the game, a 42-yard Stallworth reception and three Ravens penalties helped set up a 1st and goal from the Ravens\u2019 3-yard line. The Patriots next four plays gained a net of zero yards, and Gostkowksi kicked a 21-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 3\u20130 lead. After an exchange of punts, the Ravens took the lead with [[Kyle Boller]] completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to [[Derrick Mason]] after a 70-yard drive. In the second quarter, Baltimore increased its lead when kicker [[Matt Stover]] converted a 29-yard field goal to cap a 12-play, 55-yard drive. On the ensuing drive, the Patriots responded with a 9-play, 60-yard drive that included two more Stallworth receptions and two more Ravens penalties and ended in a 1-yard Evans touchdown run. Two possessions later, with 56&nbsp;seconds remaining the first half, Brady threw his fifth interception of the season, this one to safety [[Ed Reed]], who proceeded to fumble on the return. Watson recovered the fumble and the Patriots went into halftime in a 10\u201310 tie.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, the Ravens drove 73&nbsp;yards and regained the lead on a 17-yard run by [[Willis McGahee]], his sixth rush of the 8-play drive. The Patriots answered on their next possession with an 11-play, 72-yard drive that included a dump-off pass to Maroney for 36&nbsp;yards. A 3-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss tied the game again at 17\u201317. In the first minute of the fourth quarter, Baltimore got the lead again, 24\u201317, as Boller completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Daniel Wilcox]] after an 8-play, 56-yard drive. The Patriots went 3-and-out on their next drive, and a 33-yard [[Yamon Figurs]] punt return coupled with a 5-yard [[Pierre Woods]] penalty gave the Ravens the ball at the Patriots\u2019 26-yard line with less than 13&nbsp;minutes remaining in the game. After two McGahee runs for 1&nbsp;yard and a false start penalty gave the Ravens a 3rd and 14 situation, Boller was intercepted at the Patriots\u2019 1-yard line by Sanders to hold the Ravens scoreless on the drive. Sanders\u2019 42-yard return gave the Patriots the ball at their own 43-yard line, and another Maroney dump-off pass for 43&nbsp;yards brought the Patriots to the Ravens\u2019 24-yard line. The Patriots then failed to make the first down, and Gostkowski kicked another field goal, this one from 38&nbsp;yards out, to cut the Ravens\u2019 lead to 24\u201320. The Patriots defense, which gave up almost 60 first half rushing yards to McGahee, held McGahee to 1&nbsp;yard on the Ravens\u2019 next drive and forced a 3-and-out. The Patriots\u2019 ensuing drive brought them to the Ravens\u2019 31-yard line before a 10-yard [[Dan Koppen]] penalty and incompletion forced another punt. With less than 6&nbsp;minutes remaining, the Patriots defense again prevented the Ravens offense from completing a first down and got the ball back with 3:30 left in the game.\n\nStarting from their own 27-yard line, the Patriots got to midfield on the second play of their drive with a 23-yard Watson reception. An incompletion and 9-yard Faulk catch brought 3rd and 1, where Brady rushed for 2&nbsp;yards and the first down. After the two-minute warning, another 9-yard Faulk catch on 3rd and 10 gave the Patriots a 4th and 1 from the Ravens\u2019 30-yard line with 1:48 remaining. Brady attempted another sneak and was stopped short of the first, but the play was nullified by a timeout called by Ravens defensive coordinator [[Rex Ryan]] just before the snap. Heath Evans lost a yard on the Patriots\u2019 next attempt, but a false start penalty by [[Russ Hochstein]] nullified the play and set up a 4th and 6. Brady scrambled for the first down and additionally, Ravens cornerback [[Samari Rolle]] was penalized for illegal contact to give the Patriots another 5&nbsp;yards, moving them to the Ravens\u2019 18-yard line with 1:38 left on the clock. A 5-yard Faulk rush and two incompletions gave the Patriots another fourth down situation. Brady's throw to Watson in the end zone fell incomplete, but the Patriots again received a fresh set of downs after Ravens defensive back [[Jamaine Winborne]] was called for defensive holding. On 1st and goal from the Ravens\u2019 8-yard line with 55&nbsp;seconds remaining, the Patriots took their first lead since the first quarter on a Gaffney touchdown reception that was upheld by official review. After the play, Ravens linebacker [[Bart Scott]] received two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties after throwing an official's flag into the stands, and Reed was flagged for being offsides on the extra point, setting up a Patriots kickoff from the Ravens\u2019 35-yard line. After a Gostkowski touchback on the kickoff, the Ravens completed two passes, bringing them to their own 45-yard line with 8&nbsp;seconds remaining. Boller threw a [[Hail Mary pass]] that was caught by wide receiver [[Mark J. Clayton|Mark Clayton]] at the Patriots\u2019 3-yard line, but he was tackled shy of the end zone as time expired.\n\nThe Patriots became the sixth team in NFL history to begin a season 12\u20130, in a game that was the most-watched program in the history of cable television.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/record_audience.html |title=Record audience |work=Boston.com Reiss\u2019 Pieces |first=Mike |last=Reiss |date=December 5, 2007 |accessdate=December 5, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324165912/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/record_audience.html |archivedate=March 24, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/sports/patriots/index.php/2007/12/05/legendary-viewing-audience-monday-night/ |title=Record-setting viewing audience Monday night |work=BostonHerald.com The Point After |first=John |last=Tomase |date=December 5, 2007 |accessdate=December 23, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071208192952/http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/sports/patriots/index.php/2007/12/05/legendary-viewing-audience-monday-night/| archivedate= December 8, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Week 14: vs. Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Americanfootballbox|\n|Road=Steelers\n|R1=3||R2=10||R3=0||R4=0\n|Home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=7||H2=10||H3=14||H4=3\n|stadium= Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|time= 4:15&nbsp;p.m. EST\n|weather= {{convert|34|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, cloudy and cold\n|TV=CBS |TVAnnouncers= Jim Nantz (play-by-play) and Phil Simms (color commentator)\n|referee= [[Terry McAulay]]\n|attendance= 68,756\n}}\nBeginning a stretch of three straight home games, the Patriots faced off against the 9\u20133 Steelers in their first afternoon game in five weeks.

The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&nbsp;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots\u2019 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots\u2019 lead to 17\u201310 on a 33-yard [[Mike Nugent]] field goal. The Patriots\u2019 ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets\u2019 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&nbsp;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets\u2019 next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20\u201310 win. It gave the Patriots a 14\u20130 record, tying with [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|the 1972 Miami Dolphins]] as the best record to start a season.<ref name=\"JetsNotes\">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/postgame_notes_1.html |title=Post-game notes |work=Boston.com Reiss\u2019 Pieces |first=Mike |last=Reiss |date=December 16, 2007 |accessdate=December 20, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022154242/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/postgame_notes_1.html |archivedate=October 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The win also clinched home-field advantage for the Patriots throughout [[NFL playoffs, 2007-08|the playoffs]].<ref name=\"JetsNotes\" />\n\n===Week 16: vs. Miami Dolphins===\n{{Americanfootballbox|\n|Road=Dolphins\n|R1=0||R2=0||R3=7||R4=0\n|Home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=7||H2=21||H3=0||H4=0\n|stadium= Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|time= 4:15&nbsp;p.m. EST\n|weather= {{convert|43|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, cloudy and mild with rain expected\n|TV=CBS |TVAnnouncers= Jim Nantz (play-by-play) and Phil Simms (color commentator)\n|referee= [[Ron Winter]]\n|attendance= 68,756\n}}\nPlaying their third consecutive home game, the Patriots tried to improve their record to 15\u20130 against the 1\u201313 Dolphins.

After a successful third-down conversion, Brady threw his second touchdown pass of the game to Moss from a yard out to give the Patriots a 14\u20130 lead. The Dolphins\u2019 punted again on their next drive, and the Patriots opened up a 21-point lead with a 59-yard Maroney touchdown run while also setting the franchise record for net yards on a season, breaking the record of 5,965 set in [[1978 New England Patriots season|1978]].<ref name=\"DolphinsNotes\" /> After the Dolphins\u2019 fourth three-and-out of the game, a 38-yard [[Brandon Fields]] punt was muffed by Troy Brown and recovered by the Dolphins, who punted again three plays later. After moving the ball from their own 20-yard line to the Dolphins\u2019 48-yard line, Brady completed a 48-yard touchdown pass to Gaffney on the Patriots\u2019 71st touchdown of the season, breaking the NFL record of 70 set by the [[1984 Miami Dolphins season|1984]] Dolphins.<ref name=\"DolphinsNotes\" /> The Dolphins drove the Patriots\u2019 4-yard line with 21&nbsp;seconds remaining in the half, but [[Tedy Bruschi]] batted down a Lemon pass on fourth down intended for [[Justin Peelle]] to preserve the Patriots\u2019 28\u20130 lead heading into halftime.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Welker caught his 101st pass of the season, tying the Patriots\u2019 individual franchise record Brown set in [[2001 New England Patriots season|2001]]. On the next play, Brady was intercepted by [[Jason Allen (American football)|Jason Allen]] the end zone on a pass intended for Moss. After a 22-yard Chatman rush began the Dolphins\u2019 ensuing drive, the Dolphins punted for the seventh time three plays later. On third down from their own 28-yard line, Brady threw his second interception of the game, this time picked off by linebacker [[Derrick Pope]] on a pass also intended for Moss. The Dolphins moved the ball on their next drive from their own 46-yard line to the Patriots\u2019 1-yard line, where Lemon scrambled out of bounds short of the end zone on 4th and goal. The Dolphins challenged the ruling, which was upheld after review. The play gave the Patriots the ball from their own 1-yard line, where a three-and-out set up a 64-yard Hanson punt from the end zone, his longest of the season. A 22-yard [[Lorenzo Booker]] rush on the Dolphins\u2019 next possession helped bring the Dolphins\u2019 to the Patriots 21-yard line, where Lemon connected with [[Greg Camarillo]] to cut the Patriots lead to 28\u20137. The Patriots committed their fourth turnover of the game when Brady was strip-sacked by [[Joey Porter]] to give the Dolphins the ball at their own 28-yard line.

With the game scheduled to air on [[NFL Network]], not available on some cable providers, the NFL arranged a three-way simulcast of the game with CBS and NBC, the first time an NFL game was broadcast on three networks, and the first national simulcast of any NFL game since [[Super Bowl I]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80579400&template=with-video&confirm=true |title=Patriots\u2019 historic game to be available to all of America, after all |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NFL  |date=December 26, 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071227132215/http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80579400&template=with-video&confirm=true| archivedate= December 27, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The New York and Boston television markets both had a fourth channel, a local TV station in each respective market covering the game.

The Patriots had already clinched a first-round bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs while the Giants were guaranteed to play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the wild card playoffs.  Nevertheless, the Patriots were attempting to become the first team since the NFL's expansion to a 16-game regular season schedule to go undefeated and thus the game became the most heavily promoted game in the history of the NFL to that point and the most watched regular season game ever to that point.\n\nOn the second play of the game, the 10\u20135 Giants moved into the Patriots\u2019 red zone on a 52-yard completion from [[Eli Manning]] to [[Plaxico Burress]]. Three plays later, The Giants took the lead on a 7-yard touchdown pass to [[Brandon Jacobs]]. The Patriots responded with a pair of 14-yard completions to Moss and Welker; Welker's catch, his 102nd of the season, set a Patriots franchise record.<ref name=\"GiantsNotes\" /> The Patriots then converted a fourth down, and on their next fourth down, they made a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Patriots would regain the ball at midfield following a Giants three-and-out. Completions to Stallworth and Welker put the Patriots in the Giants\u2019 red zone, where Brady completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to Moss, taking a 10\u20137 lead on the first play of the second quarter. On the play, three records were affected: the Patriots 560th point surpassed the [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|1998 Minnesota Vikings's]] record of 556 points in a season; the touchdown pass was Brady's 49th, tying Peyton Manning's [[2004 Indianapolis Colts season|2004]] record; and Moss recorded his 22nd touchdown catch of the season, tying [[Jerry Rice]]\u2019s [[1987 NFL season|1987]] record.\n\nAs a result of a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct after the touchdown, the Patriots kicked off from the 15-yard line. Giants wide receiver [[Domenik Hixon]] received it from the Giants\u2019 26-yard line and proceeded to run for a 74-yard touchdown return, retaking the lead for the Giants. Starting from their own 33-yard line, the Patriots moved into Giants territory on a 13-yard Maroney rush and 8-yard Faulk reception. Brady's 8 passing yards on the play gave him 4,557 for the season, breaking [[Drew Bledsoe]]\u2019s [[1994 New England Patriots season|1994]] franchise record of 4,555&nbsp;yards.<ref name=\"GiantsNotes\" /> After the drive stalled, Gostkowski's recorded his second field goal for the game, making the score 14\u201313 in favor of the Giants. Following a Giants punt, the Patriots mounted a drive that resulted in Gostkowski's third field goal of the night, from 37&nbsp;yards, after a 3rd down end zone pass to Moss ricocheted off of linebacker [[Gerris Wilkinson|Gerris Wilkinson's]] helmet. With 1:54 remaining the half and the Giants trailing 16\u201314, Manning completed five of his first seven passes to move from the Giants\u2019 15-yard line to the Patriots\u2019 3-yard line. On second down with 18&nbsp;seconds remaining, Manning threw his second touchdown pass of the game, this time to Boss, to take a 21\u201316 lead at the half.\n\nAfter the Patriots began the second half with a three-and-out, the Giants increased their lead to 12 points on a 19-yard touchdown catch by Burress from Manning. Facing their largest deficit of the season, the Patriots drove to the Giants\u2019 16-yard line with several Brady completions. A pass interference call against the Giants\u2019 Wilkinson gave the Patriots the ball at the Giants\u2019 1-yard line. After an illegal formation penalty moved the Patriots back 5&nbsp;yards, a 6-yard Maroney touchdown run cut the Giants\u2019 lead to 28\u201323. Three consecutive drives resulted in punts, and the Patriots gained possession of the ball with less than 12&nbsp;minutes remaining in the game.\n[[File:Patriotsgiants 031.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Brady]] on the sideline with teammates [[Randy Moss]] and [[Jabar Gaffney]], after throwing for his record-breaking 50th passing touchdown of the season.]]\nOn the second play of the drive, Brady attempted a deep pass to Moss, which was underthrown and dropped. On the next play, Brady attempted another deep pass to Moss, who caught this one for 65&nbsp;yards, setting two more NFL records: Moss set the record for most touchdown receptions in a season (23) and Brady set one for touchdown passes (50).<ref name=\"GiantsNotes\" /> The touchdown, Brady's last of the game, also brought Brady's touchdown-to-interception margin to +42; Peyton Manning held the previous record, +39 during the 2003\u20132004 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2008/01/extra_points_35.html |title=Extra points |work=Boston.com Reiss\u2019 Pieces |first=Mike |last=Reiss |date=January 1, 2008 |accessdate=January 1, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523111637/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2008/01/extra_points_35.html |archivedate=May 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This also brought Brady's touchdown-to-interception ratio to 6.25:1, another NFL record.  Brady himself would shatter his own record [[2010 New England Patriots season|three years later]].  The Patriots converted the subsequent two-point attempt, their only two-point conversion attempt of the season, on a Maroney rush to take a 31\u201328 lead with 11:15 remaining. On the Giants\u2019 ensuing drive, Hobbs intercepted a Manning pass intended for Burress at the Patriots\u2019 48-yard line. After driving to the red zone, a 5-yard catch by Moss marked his 1,493rd reception yard for the season, breaking [[Stanley Morgan|Stanley Morgan's]] [[1986 New England Patriots season|1986]] franchise record of 1,491&nbsp;yards. On the subsequent play, Maroney scored his second touchdown of the game on a 5-yard run to give the Patriots a 38\u201328 lead. With 4:36 left in the game, the Giants drove the ball to the Patriots\u2019 4-yard line, and two plays later, Manning completed a 3-yard touchdown pass to Burress, Manning's fourth for the game. After the Patriots\u2019 Vrabel recovered the Giants\u2019 onside kickoff, the Patriots knelt thrice to end the game as they finished the regular season 16\u20130.\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 joined the 14\u20130 [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]], 11\u20130 [[1942 Chicago Bears season|1942 Chicago Bears]], and 13\u20130 [[1934 Chicago Bears season|1934 Chicago Bears]] as the fourth team to record an undefeated regular season in the NFL (the [[1948 Cleveland Browns season|1948 Cleveland Browns]] were 14\u20130 in the [[All-America Football Conference]], an accomplishment recognized by the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], but not by the NFL.)

Patriots quarterback [[Tom Brady]] set the NFL record for completion percentage in a single game (92.9%) with 26 of 28 completions for 263&nbsp;yards and 3 touchdowns, while running back [[Laurence Maroney]] added 162 total yards (122 on the ground). Overall, New England gained 401&nbsp;yards and didn't punt the ball until 31&nbsp;seconds remained in the fourth quarter.\n\nJacksonville took the opening kickoff and went 80&nbsp;yards in 9 plays, featuring two receptions by [[Marcedes Lewis]] for 57&nbsp;yards, on the way to [[David Garrard]]\u2019s 9-yard touchdown pass to [[Matt Jones (American football)|Matt Jones]]. The Patriots then went on a 74-yard drive and scored with [[Tom Brady]]\u2019s 3-yard touchdown pass to [[Benjamin Watson]]. On Jacksonville's next possession, New England lineman [[Ty Warren]] forced a fumble while sacking Garrard, and linebacker [[Mike Vrabel]] recovered it at the Jaguars 29-yard line. Several plays later, Maroney scored a 1-yard touchdown run to give New England a 14\u20137 lead.\n\nJaguars running back [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] muffed the ensuing kickoff and was downed at his own 5-yard line. The Jaguars then moved the ball 95&nbsp;yards in 11 plays without facing a third down and scoring with Garrard's 6-yard touchdown pass to [[Ernest Wilford]]. For the third time in a row, New England drove deep into Jacksonville territory. But this time the drive stalled at the 17-yard line and ended with no points when [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed a 35-yard field goal with 53&nbsp;seconds left in the first half.\n[[File:2007Pats-DivisionalPlayoff-Victory.jpg|thumb|left|The Patriots on the field after their victory]]\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Brady completed 7 of 8 passes for 54&nbsp;yards on an 82-yard drive. On the last play, he took a snap in shotgun formation with [[Kevin Faulk]] to his right, Brady jumped in the air with his arms raised to make it look like a play used by the Patriots before where Faulk took the direct snap. The Jaguars defense followed Faulk, leaving [[Wes Welker]] open in the end zone, and Brady threw him the ball for a touchdown to give the Patriots a 21\u201314 lead. Jacksonville responded with a drive to the New England 21-yard line, but receiver [[Dennis Northcutt]] dropped a pass on third down, forcing them to settle for a [[Josh Scobee]] 39-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21\u201317. On New England's next drive, Jacksonville's [[Derek Landri]] was assessed a roughing-the-passer penalty, turning Welker's 6-yard catch into a 21-yard gain. Maroney gained 40&nbsp;yards with his next two carries, and following two more Welker receptions, Brady threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Watson giving New England a 28\u201317 lead.\n\nAn unnecessary roughness penalty and a 25-yard reception by [[Reggie Williams (wide receiver)|Reggie Williams]] on the Jacksonville's next drive set up a 25-yard field goal by Scobee, which cut the Jaguars deficit to one touchdown, 28\u201320. On the second play after the kickoff, Brady completed a 52-yard strike to [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]], setting up Gostkowski's second field goal attempt to put New England back up by two scores, 31\u201320.\n\nThen, with 3:46 left in the game, Pats safety [[Rodney Harrison]], intercepted a pass from Garrard at the Patriots\u2019 31-yard line, ending any hope of a Jacksonville comeback. Harrison's interception was his 7th career postseason pick, a Patriots record. This was also his fourth consecutive postseason game with an interception, tying an NFL record held by [[Aeneas Williams]].\n\nWith this win, the Patriots advanced to the AFC title game for the second year in a row and extended their perfect record to 17\u20130, matching the final record of the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]].\n\n'''Scoring'''\n\n'''First quarter'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Matt Jones (American football)|Matt Jones]] 8&nbsp;yard pass from [[David Garrard]] ([[Josh Scobee]] kick), 10:50.

With this win, the Patriots became the first NFL team to start with an 18\u20130 record and advanced to their fourth Super Bowl appearance in seven years.\n\nWith just over 5&nbsp;minutes left in the first quarter, Chargers defensive back [[Quentin Jammer]] intercepted a pass from Brady on the Patriots 40-yard line, setting up a 26-yard field goal by [[Nate Kaeding]]. New England responded by driving 65&nbsp;yards and scoring with a 1-yard Maroney touchdown run to take a 7\u20133 lead.\n\n[[File:Andre Tippett 2007AFCC2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andre Tippett]] presents [[Robert Kraft]] with the [[Lamar Hunt]] trophy]]\nKaeding kicked a 23-yard field goal in the second quarter to cut the score to 7\u20136, but after a punt, Patriots defensive back [[Asante Samuel]] intercepted a pass from [[Philip Rivers]] and returned it 10&nbsp;yards to the Chargers 24-yard line. One play later, Brady's 12-yard touchdown pass to [[Jabar Gaffney]] increased their lead to 14\u20136. Later on, a 26-yard run by [[Darren Sproles]] moved the ball to the New England 34-yard line. But once again, the Patriots defense kept San Diego out of the end zone, stopping them on 3rd and 1 and forcing them to settle for another Kaeding field goal, making the score 14\u20139 at halftime.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Brady threw his second interception of the game, this one to [[Drayton Florence]] at the New England 49-yard line. San Diego then moved the ball to the 4-yard line, but on 3rd and 1, linebacker [[Junior Seau]] tackled [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] for a 2-yard loss and the Chargers had to settle for Kaeding's fourth field goal. New England responded with a drive to the San Diego 2-yard line, with Maroney gaining 39&nbsp;yards on four running plays, but Chargers cornerback [[Antonio Cromartie]] ended the drive by intercepting Brady in the end zone.\n\nOn their first drive of the fourth quarter, New England moved the ball 67&nbsp;yards and scored with Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to [[Wes Welker]], making the score 21\u201312. Following a Chargers punt, the Patriots ended the game with a 15-play drive that took the final 9:13 off the game clock.

After scoring a combined 73 points in their regular season meeting, the teams scored only a mere 10 points by the end of the third quarter, with the Patriots leading 7 to 3. The Patriots\u2019 record-setting offense gave up five sacks and one lost fumble, while the Giants\u2019 offense managed only five first downs in the second and third quarters. Yet in the fourth quarter, quarterback [[Eli Manning]] led two go-ahead touchdown drives, including the winning drive that culminated with a 17-yard touchdown to [[Plaxico Burress]] with 39&nbsp;seconds remaining. The game marked the first time that a previously undefeated team had lost in a [[National Football League]] championship game since the [[1942 NFL season|1942]] [[Chicago Bears]] as the Patriots fell to 18\u20131 on the season.  The Patriots were also the second team to enter the Super Bowl undefeated, joining the [[1972 Miami Dolphins]], who reached [[Super Bowl VII]] with a 16\u20130 record and won to become the first and to date only NFL team to win the league championship after going all the way through the regular season and playoffs undefeated and untied, but were the first undefeated and untied team to fail to win the Super Bowl.\n\nAfter calling tails to win the [[Coin flipping|coin toss]], the Giants started the game with the longest opening drive in Super Bowl history,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=346770 \n |title=Giants prevent perfect season, beat Patriots \n |date=February 8, 2008 \n |publisher=[[Sporting News]] \n |accessdate=February 8, 2008 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207090843/http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=346770 \n |archivedate=February 7, 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n |df=mdy \n}}</ref> a 16-play, 77-yard march that consumed 9&nbsp;minutes, 59&nbsp;seconds and featured four third-down conversions, the most ever on a Super Bowl opening drive. But New England halted the drive at their own 14-yard line, forcing the Giants to settle for a 32-yard field goal from [[Lawrence Tynes]] that gave New York a 3\u20130 lead.\n\nNew England then responded with its own scoring drive as [[Laurence Maroney]] returned the kickoff 43&nbsp;yards to the Patriots\u2019 44-yard line, after which he rushed twice for 15&nbsp;yards. Quarterback [[Tom Brady]] then completed three passes for 23&nbsp;yards, but after two incomplete passes, New England was faced with 3rd-and-10 on the Giants\u2019 17. However, on that play, New York linebacker [[Antonio Pierce]] committed pass interference by striking the helmet of tight end [[Benjamin Watson]] in the end zone, giving New England 1st-and-goal at the 1. This set up a Maroney 1-yard touchdown run two plays later, the first play of the second quarter, for a 7\u20133 lead. The two teams each only had one drive in the entire opening quarter, a Super Bowl record.\n\nOn the Giants first drive of the second quarter, on 3rd-and-7, receiver [[Amani Toomer]] caught in a deep pass from Manning along the left sideline while dragging his feet in-bounds for a 38-yard gain, moving the ball to the Patriots\u2019 19. But three plays later, Manning threw a pass that bounced out of the arms of rookie receiver [[Steve Smith (wide receiver, born 1985)|Steve Smith]] and into the hands of cornerback [[Ellis Hobbs]] for an interception.\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 ensuing drive resulted in a three-and-out as on 3rd-and-1 [[James Butler (American football)|James Butler]] and [[Michael Strahan]] tackled Maroney for a two-yard loss and New England was forced to punt.\n\nThen on the Giants\u2019 next drive, rookie running back [[Ahmad Bradshaw]] fumbled a Manning hand-off and it looked as though Patriots\u2019 linebacker [[Pierre Woods]] had recovered the ball at the Giants\u2019 30. But after the officials picked through the pile, it was determined that Bradshaw had made the recovery. The Giants maintained possession and wound up punting. New England's next drive ended with consecutive Giants\u2019 sacks, the first by linebacker [[Kawika Mitchell]], the second by tackle [[Justin Tuck]].\n\nOn the Giants\u2019 following drive, New York moved the ball to the New England 25, but linebacker [[Adalius Thomas]] sacked Manning and forced a fumble. Smith recovered the ball, however Bradshaw was penalized for illegally batting the ball forward before the recovery. The penalty pushed the Giants out of field goal range, and following an incompletion, they were forced to punt.\n\nAfter the punt, two 18-yard receptions by Moss and [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]] moved the ball to the Giants\u2019 44. But with 22&nbsp;seconds left before halftime, Brady fumbled while being sacked by Tuck and defensive end [[Osi Umenyiora]] recovered the ball. The game then went to halftime with the Patriots leading 7\u20133.\n\nOn the first drive of the second half, New England had a 4th-and-2 and chose to punt. However, after the play had been run, Patriots\u2019 head coach [[Bill Belichick]] challenged that New York had too many players on the field and replay confirmed that was the case as Giants linebacker [[Chase Blackburn]] was unable to get to the sidelines as the ball was being snapped. Therefore, referee [[Mike Carey (American football)|Mike Carey]] reversed the play, and the Giants were penalized 5&nbsp;yards for having too many players on the field, giving the Patriots a first down. The Patriots then drove to the Giants\u2019 25, but Strahan sacked Brady for a 6-yard loss on third down. Then on 4th-and-13, with the ball on the Giants\u2019 31, Belichick decided against a long field goal attempt by [[Stephen Gostkowski]] and tried to pick up a first down instead. Brady's pass to [[Jabar Gaffney]] was incomplete as it went out of the back of the end zone and the Giants took over on downs.\n\nOn the Giants\u2019 first drive of the fourth quarter, Manning completed a 45-yard pass to rookie tight end [[Kevin Boss]]. Following three runs by Bradshaw and a 17-yard reception by Smith on third down, Manning finished the 7-play, 80-yard drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to [[David Tyree]], giving New York a 10\u20137 lead with 11:10 left in the game.\n\nAfter consecutive three-and-outs by the Patriots and Giants, New England got the ball at its own 20 with 7:54 to play. Brady then completed a 5-yard pass to [[Wes Welker]] and a 10-yard pass to Moss, followed by a 9-yard run by Maroney to give the Patriots a first down at their own 44. Brady followed with a 13-yard pass to Welker, a four-yard completion to [[Kevin Faulk]], and then a 10-yard pass to Welker for a first down at the Giants\u2019 29. After that, Brady found Moss for an 11-yard completion and Faulk for a 12-yard completion and New England now had 1st-and-goal from the Giants\u2019 6. Following two incomplete passes, New York cornerback [[Corey Webster]] slipped while backing into coverage, leaving Moss wide open in the end zone where Brady found him for a touchdown to give New England a 14\u201310 lead with 2:42 left in the game.\n\nOn the ensuing kickoff, [[Ray Ventrone]] tackled [[Domenik Hixon]] after a 14-yard return, giving New York the ball on their own 17 with 2:39 left and three timeouts remaining. Following two receptions by Toomer for 20&nbsp;yards, [[Brandon Jacobs]] kept the drive going with a 2-yard run on 4th-and-1. On the next series of downs, Patriots\u2019 cornerback [[Asante Samuel]] nearly caught a possibly game-ending interception on a ball intended for Tyree, but the ball slipped through his fingertips. On the next play, the Giants faced 3rd-and-5 from their own 44 with 1:15 remaining. Manning spun out of the grasp of lineman [[Jarvis Green]], righted himself, and [[Helmet Catch|threw a 32-yard completion to Tyree]], who made a leaping catch while covered by [[Rodney Harrison]] and maintained possession by pinning the ball against his helmet with one hand as he fell to the ground. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-11, Manning found a wide-open Smith for a 12-yard gain to the New England 13. On the next play, the Giants sent four receivers into the pattern while the Patriots sent six pass rushers after Manning and flipped four pass defenders to the right side of the field \u2013 resulting in Patriots\u2019 cornerback [[Ellis Hobbs]] being isolated on the left side to cover Giants\u2019 wide receiver [[Plaxico Burress]] one-on-one. Rodney Harrison tried to adjust the unbalanced formation but his fellow defenders, including Junior Seau, were eager to sack Manning and the defense was left unchanged. Hobbs bit on a fake slant inside (a \u201cslant-and-go\u201d or \u201cSluGo\u201d route) and Manning lofted a pass to the end zone where Burress caught the ball for a touchdown to complete the 12-play, 83-yard drive and give Giants a 17\u201314 lead with 35&nbsp;seconds left.\n\nNew England began its next possession on its own 26 with 29&nbsp;seconds remaining and three timeouts, but the Giants\u2019 defense didn't allow a single yard\u2014forcing an incompletion on first down, a 10-yard sack by rookie lineman [[Jay Alford]] on second down, and then two deep incomplete attempts to Moss, the first that was broken up by Webster, and the second of which, on 4th-and-20, was broken up by Giants\u2019 safety [[Gibril Wilson]] and caused a turnover on downs with one second remaining. After the incompletion, the game clock briefly read zero (one second was re-added),<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/peter_king/02/05/giants/index.html?eref=fannation | title=What it\u2019s all about, Giants\u2019 title a reminder of why we watch sports | date=February 5, 2008 | publisher=SI.com | accessdate=February 10, 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604164704/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/peter_king/02/05/giants/index.html?eref=fannation | archivedate=June 4, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> and coaches, players, reporters, and fans crowded the field as if the game had ended. Belichick hugged Giants\u2019 Coach [[Tom Coughlin]] at midfield, then an official explained to both coaches that the final second had to be run. The Patriots\u2019 defense took the field, and Belichick left for the locker room, not staying for the final play. This early departure was later criticized by some sportswriters who felt Belichick was being a sore loser, while others noted that he had properly congratulated Coughlin (they also noted Coughlin was one of the few opposing coaches he didn't loathe) and that the game was over once the Patriots failed to convert on 4th down.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://myespn.go.com/blogs/hashmarks/0-5-366/Belichick-has-left-the-building---a-second-early.html \n |title=Belichick has left the building...a second early \n |date=February 4, 2008 \n |publisher=ESPN \n |accessdate=February 13, 2008 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207222958/http://myespn.go.com/blogs/hashmarks/0-5-366/Belichick-has-left-the-building---a-second-early.html \n |archivedate=February 7, 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:19and0pats.png|right|thumb|150px|The cover to ''19\u20130: The Historic Championship Season of New England\u2019s Unbeatable Patriots'', which was pulled from pre-sale after the game.]] -->\nThe officials cleared the field, and restarted the clock.

The Patriots looked to improve on their 12\u20134 record from 2006 and win the [[AFC East]] for the sixth time in seven years.\n\nThe Patriots finished the 2007 regular season by winning all sixteen of their games. They became only the eighth team in NFL history to finish a regular season undefeated, and first to do so since the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]], as well as only the fourth to finish undefeated and untied. The Patriots were also the first team with a perfect regular season since the NFL expanded its schedule to sixteen games in 1978. Thus, they broke the record for victories in a single regular season that had been shared by the [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|1984 San Francisco 49ers]], the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]], the [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|1998 Minnesota Vikings]], and the [[2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2004 Pittsburgh Steelers]], and later tied by the [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011 Green Bay Packers]] and [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|2015 Carolina Panthers]], who each finished with a record of 15\u20131, and are one of the only teams before or since that had nearly went 16\u20130. Honorable mentions include the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998 Denver Broncos]] and the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in [[2005 Indianapolis Colts season|2005]] and [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|2009]], all of whom had started 13\u20130 and finished 14\u20132 respectively. The 1984 49ers and 1985 Bears would win [[Super Bowl XIX]] and [[Super Bowl XX]] respectively, the 1998 Vikings and 2004 Steelers would lose their conference championship games, the 2011 Packers would lose their first playoff game, and the 2015 Panthers would lose [[Super Bowl 50]].\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XLII]], the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] defeated the Patriots 17\u201314 in an upset. With the loss, the Patriots were not able to join the 1984 49ers and 1985 Bears as Super Bowl champions, failing to go 19\u20130 and claim their fourth Super Bowl victory. Despite this loss, the 2007 Patriots are still regarded as one of the greatest teams in NFL history. \n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n== Season Summary ==\nThe Patriots entered the offseason following a stunning loss to the [[Colts\u2013Patriots rivalry|rival]] [[Indianapolis Colts]] in the [[NFL playoffs, 2006\u201307|AFC Championship]] after blowing a 21\u20133 first half lead--although they did when 6 of their final 7 regular season games in 2006.  After having lost their two starting wide receivers in the previous offseason, the Patriots added [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]] in free agency and traded for [[Wes Welker]] from the [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Randy Moss]] from the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the spring. Welker would tie for the NFL lead in receptions with [[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]] in 2007 while Moss would set an NFL regular season record with 23 touchdown catches (part of his 98 receptions). The season began with controversy, when Patriot head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and the Patriots organization were penalized by the NFL for their involvement in the videotaping of opponents\u2019 defensive signals from an unauthorized location in their Week 1 game against the [[New York Jets]]. This came to be referred to in the media as [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|\"Spygate\"]]. Early in the season, the Patriots won their first two games by identical scores of 38\u201314, and followed up the next game with a  score of 38\u20137. Despite the media scrutiny, the Patriots continued to gain momentum, winning mid-season games by scores such as 49\u201328, 52\u20137, and 56\u201310, as quarterback [[Tom Brady]] emphasized the team's desire to blow out and \u201ckill teams.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2007/11/21/dressed_for_success/?page=full|title=Dressed for success?|work=The Boston Globe|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=June 16, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023141103/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2007/11/21/dressed_for_success/?page=full|archivedate=October 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Patriots set the record for most points in a season with 589, shattering the [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|previous record]] by 33 points.

The Jets reached Patriots territory on their opening possession, but were forced to punt. The Patriots then began a 12-play, 91-yard drive that ended in an 11-yard [[Wes Welker]] touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7\u20130 lead. On the ensuing kickoff, [[Kelley Washington]] forced a fumble on Jets returner [[Justin Miller (American football)|Justin Miller]] after a 26-yard return, but tight end [[Chris Baker (American football)|Chris Baker]] recovered the ball at the Jets\u2019 33-yard line to retain possession. The Jets went three-and-out, but the Patriots punted back to the Jets despite a 19-yard [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]] catch to begin their next series. Three plays later, Jets quarterback [[Chad Pennington]] was sacked by linebacker [[Mike Vrabel]] and defensive lineman [[Ty Warren]], forcing a Jets punt on the final play of the first quarter.\n\n[[File:Patriots preseason 2007.jpg|thumb|Patriots players on the sideline during the 2007 preseason]]\n\nStarting from their own 42-yard line after the punt, the Patriots reached the Jets\u2019 25-yard line, where kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] lined up for a 42-yard field goal attempt. However, the snap was fumbled by holder [[Matt Cassel]], and recovered by Cassel to turn the ball over on downs. The Jets responded with a 10-play, 66-yard drive, tying the game at 7\u20137 on a 7-yard pass from Pennington to wide receiver [[Laveranues Coles]]. Several plays into the Patriots\u2019 ensuing drive, before and after the two-minute warning, wide receiver [[Randy Moss]] caught passes of 33- and 22-yards from quarterback [[Tom Brady]] to put the Patriots in the Jets\u2019 red zone. Brady then connected with tight end [[Benjamin Watson]] on a 5-yard touchdown pass that was reviewed by the booth but upheld, giving the Patriots a 14\u20137 lead going into halftime.\n\nPatriots cornerback [[Ellis Hobbs]] returned the opening kickoff of the second half 108&nbsp;yards for a touchdown and a new NFL record for the longest kickoff return in the league's history; at the time, it also tied the existing record for longest play in NFL history (a record broken a few weeks later by [[Antonio Cromartie]]). Nine plays into the Jets\u2019 next drive, Pennington was sacked by defensive lineman [[Jarvis Green]] and was injured; [[Kellen Clemens]] entered the game but the Jets were forced to punt two plays later. Four plays later, Brady hit Moss for a 51-yard touchdown reception that extended the Patriots\u2019 lead to 28\u20137. However, the Jets came back with a 9-play, 70-yard drive that was capped off with Coles\u2019 second touchdown grab of the day, this one from one yard out, to cut the Patriots\u2019 lead to 28\u201314. The Patriots received the ensuing kickoff with just over two minutes remaining in the third quarter and would not surrender the ball until there was just under seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, ending the 17-play drive with a 22-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots\u2019 lead to 31\u201314. The Jets then went three-and-out, and punter [[Ben Graham (football player)|Ben Graham]]\u2019s 36-yard punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 47-yard line. On a 1st-and-goal from the Jets\u2019 1-yard line, fullback [[Heath Evans]] could not score; the Patriots challenged that the ball did in fact break the plane of the goal line but the play was upheld. On the next play, following the two-minute warning, Evans did in fact score on a 1-yard run, increasing the Patriots\u2019 lead to 38\u201314. The Jets\u2019 next drive stalled on a Vrabel strip-sack of Clemens that the Jets recovered, but ended on a failed fourth down conversion from the Jets\u2019 38-yard line.

For the second consecutive week, the game began with a touchdown on the Patriots\u2019 first series: this time, Brady hit Watson for a 7-yard touchdown pass to give the Patriots a 7\u20130 lead. On the first play of the ensuing Chargers possession, their first, linebacker [[Rosevelt Colvin]] intercepted a [[Philip Rivers]] pass, but it did not translate into points for the Patriots as Gostkowski then missed a 41-yard field goal attempt on the Patriots\u2019 resulting series. After a Chargers three-and-out, the Patriots capped off a 10-play, 75-yard drive with a 23-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 14\u20130. Colvin then added a sack and forced fumble to his game statistics, as he strip-sacked Rivers after the Chargers reached the Patriots\u2019 34-yard line and defensive lineman [[Vince Wilfork]] recovered the fumble for the Patriots\u2019 second forced turnover of the game.\n\nOn the Patriots\u2019 next drive, which spanned into the second quarter, Brady was strip-sacked by linebacker [[Shawne Merriman]] at the Chargers\u2019 29-yard line, but Brady recovered his own fumble to retain possession for the Patriots. Six plays later, a 24-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots\u2019 lead to 17\u20130. After a Chargers three-and-out, the Patriots were pushed back to their 10-yard line after another Merriman sack of Brady. The Patriots would punt back to the Chargers, but on a 3rd-and-1 from the Patriots\u2019 37-yard line, Rivers was intercepted by linebacker [[Adalius Thomas]], who returned it 65&nbsp;yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 24\u20130 lead. The Chargers were unable to get past midfield on their next drive and punted, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line with just under three minutes to play in the first half. A 25-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Chargers safety [[Marlon McCree]] would help the Patriots reach the Chargers\u2019 26-yard line, but Brady was intercepted by safety [[Clinton Hart]] at the Chargers\u2019 10-yard line. The Chargers then ran one play to end the half.\n\nReceiving the kickoff to begin the second half, the Chargers embarked on a 16-play, 72-yard drive, reaching Patriots territory on a 22-yard third down reception by tight end [[Antonio Gates]]. Ten plays later, fullback [[Lorenzo Neal]] caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to put the Chargers on the scoreboard at 24\u20137. The Patriots responded by going 75&nbsp;yards on seven plays, taking a 31\u20137 lead on a 24-yard Moss touchdown reception, his second of the night. Three plays later, Rivers was intercepted by Patriots safety [[James Sanders (American football)|James Sanders]] at the Patriots\u2019 38-yard line, but the play was nullified by a 37-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Hobbs. Rivers completions of 19&nbsp;yards to wide receiver [[Malcom Floyd]] and 12&nbsp;yards to running back [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] helped put the Chargers in the Patriots\u2019 red zone, where Rivers completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Gates on the second play of the fourth quarter to cut the Patriots\u2019 lead to 31\u201314.\n\nOn the ensuing kickoff, Chargers wide receiver [[Kassim Osgood]] forced a fumble of Hobbs after a 31-yard return that was recovered by Chargers cornerback [[Quentin Jammer]] at the Patriots\u2019 31-yard line. However, Rivers was sacked twice for losses of 10&nbsp;yards each on the next two plays, the second of which was a strip-sack by Colvin that was recovered by offensive lineman [[Kris Dielman]]; the Chargers punted on 4th-and-30. Starting from their own 9-yard line with more than 13&nbsp;minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots did not surrender the ball back to the Chargers until there was less than four minutes left in the fourth quarter. This 15-play, 91-yard drive culminated in a 3-yard touchdown run by running back [[Sammy Morris]], extending the Patriots\u2019 lead to 38\u201314.

Two plays later, Hobbs sacked Losman, causing a fumble at the Bills\u2019 35-yard line that set up a 24-yard Gostkowski field goal.

Early in the second quarter, the Patriots drove to the Bills\u2019 29-yard line, but on fourth down, opted not to punt; the gamble did not pay off and the Patriots turned the ball over on downs. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots again drove deep into Bills\u2019 territory, this time to the Bills\u2019 3-yard line, but a Brady fumble on a rushing attempt kept the Patriots from scoring. The Patriots challenged the ruling but it was upheld. The Bills could not advance past their own 1-yard line on their next possession, with punter [[Brian Moorman]] booming a 75-yard kick that was returned 29&nbsp;yards by Welker. Starting in Bills\u2019 territory, Brady culminated a six-play drive with an 8-yard touchdown pass to Watson. Another Bills punt gave the Patriots the ball in Bills territory again, setting up another six-play drive that ended in a 3-yard touchdown catch by Moss.\n\nAfter the teams exchanged three-and-outs to begin the second half, the Patriots embarked on a nine-play, 89-yard drive that ended on a 4-yard [[Jabar Gaffney]] touchdown reception that gave the Patriots a 24\u20137 lead. After another punt, the Patriots advanced into Bills territory on a 26-yard pass to Welker that was kept alive when Welker lateraled to Moss for another 11&nbsp;yards. Morris then ran in for a 4-yard touchdown. The Bills were able to pin the Patriots at their own 2-yard line on their next punt, but that only proved to be the beginning of a 10-play, 98-yard drive that came to a close when Brady connected with Moss on a 45-yard touchdown pass, extending the Patriots\u2019 lead to 38\u20137. The catch made Moss the first player in NFL history to have three games with at least 100 receiving yards to start a season. After an exchange of punts, the Bills began their ensuing drive with Edwards throwing an interception to cornerback [[Asante Samuel]], which was returned 42&nbsp;yards to the Bills\u2019 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not generate any points off the turnover, with an Evans run on fourth down from the Bills\u2019 8-yard line coming up short of the first down.

On the game's opening drive, the Patriots drove 66&nbsp;yards on 11 plays, stalling at the Bengals\u2019 13-yard line before Gostkowski hit a 31-yard field goal. The Bengals\u2019 next drive would span five plays but only one yard, ending in a punt. After an exchange of punts, the Patriots began a drive from their own 35-yard line, but quickly advanced into Bengals territory on a 49-yard Morris run. Three plays later, Brady hit Vrabel on a 1-yard touchdown pass to extend the Patriots lead to 10\u20130. After a Bengals punt on the first play of the second quarter, the Patriots had the ball but found themselves in a 3rd-and-23 situation, when Brady was intercepted by [[Leon Hall]] at the Bengals\u2019 35-yard line. The Bengals capitalized on the turnover, with [[Carson Palmer]] ending a five-play drive on a 1-yard touchdown pass to [[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]]. The Patriots responded by going on a 12-yard, 62-yard drive, finishing it with a 7-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 17\u20137. The Bengals managed to reach the Patriots\u2019 20-yard line on their next possession, but a Samuel interception at the 2-yard line kept the Bengals from scoring at the end of the first half.\n\nThe Bengals reached midfield on the opening drive of the third quarter before punting. From their own 19-yard line, the Patriots moved deep in Bengals territory after a 15-yard penalty was tacked onto a 16-yard Moss catch. A few plays later, Morris ran for his second touchdown of the night; the 7-yard run opened the Patriots lead to 24\u20137. The Bengals, though, continued to threaten the Patriots offensively, moving to the Patriots\u2019 22-yard line before linebacker [[Tedy Bruschi]] tipped a third-down pass to force a 40-yard [[Shayne Graham]] field goal. The Patriots next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but a Morris run on third down from the Bengals\u2019 13-yard line was stopped for a loss, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. Yet again, the Bengals moved into Patriots territory on their ensuing drive, but the Patriots defense prevented another touchdown and forced a 48-yard field goal, making the score 27\u201313. On the Patriots\u2019 next drive, a 23-yard Stallworth catch put the Patriots in Bengals territory, setting up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss. Down 34\u201313, the Bengals continued to move the ball with a 17-yard Houshmandzadeh catch on the next play, but Palmer's next pass attempt was intercepted by [[Randall Gay]] at the Patriots\u2019 47-yard line. The Patriots then ran out the clock to end the game and bring their record to 4\u20130.\n\n===Week 5: vs. Cleveland Browns===\n{{Americanfootballbox|\n|Road=Browns\n|R1=0||R2=0||R3=3||R4=14\n|Home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=10||H2=10||H3=0||H4=14\n|stadium= Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|time= 1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT\n|weather= {{convert|56|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, cloudy and cool, chance of showers\n|TV=CBS |TVAnnouncers= [[Greg Gumbel]] (play-by-play) and [[Dan Dierdorf]] (color commentator)\n|referee= [[Walt Coleman]]\n|attendance= 68,756\n}}\n[[File:Patriots-Browns 2007.jpg|thumb|Kicking after a touchdown against the Browns]]\nReturning to Foxboro, the Patriots faced off against the Browns, coached by their former defensive coordinator [[Romeo Crennel]]. The Patriots opened the game with a 14-play, 78-yard drive culminating in a Gostkowski 20-yard field goal. After a 65-yard drive brought them to the Patriots\u2019 1-yard line, the Browns failed to score on two downs before quarterback [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] threw an interception to linebacker [[Junior Seau]] on third down. Following a Patriots three-and-out, a Samuel interception on the first play of the Browns\u2019 next drive gave the Patriots the ball at the Browns\u2019 34-yard line. Brady quickly turned the turnover into points, throwing a 34-yard touchdown pass to Stallworth to give the Patriots a 10\u20130 lead. The Browns would then punt on their next drive. On the first drive of the second quarter, the Patriots would move into Browns territory but were forced to punt, giving the Browns the ball at their own 12-yard line. After a 36-yard punt by [[Scott Player]], the Patriots began their ensuing drive from their own 49-yard line. They would advance to the Browns\u2019 4-yard line, but a Morris run for a loss forced a 25-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriots a 13\u20130 lead. The Browns\u2019 next drive showed promise after Anderson moved the team from their own 10-yard line to the 46-yard line, but following the two-minute warning a false start penalty and then an interception by Seau, his second of the game, ended the advance. With good field position, Brady moved the 25 necessary yards in three plays, taking a 20\u20130 lead on a 7-yard Watson touchdown reception. A Bruschi sack then forced the Browns to take a knee to end the half.\n\nIn the second half, both teams exchanged punts before the Browns began an 8-play, 56-yard drive that got them on the scoreboard, with [[Phil Dawson]] kicking a 42-yard field goal. Neither team could advance past midfield until the closing minutes of the quarter. The Browns would then score their first touchdown of the day, on a 21-yard strike from Anderson to wide receiver [[Tim Carter (wide receiver)|Tim Carter]]. The Patriots would respond with their own touchdown drive, taking a 27\u201310 lead on a 25-yard touchdown catch by Watson. After an exchange of punts gave the Browns the ball at the Patriots\u2019 35-yard line, Anderson threw his second touchdown pass of the day, this one good for 14&nbsp;yards to tight end [[Kellen Winslow II]] to pull the Browns to within 10 points. The Patriots were able to hold the ball for the next five minutes, but could not score, with a Brady pass to Vrabel falling incomplete on fourth down from the Browns\u2019 4-yard line. However, this meant the Browns had to begin their next drive from that spot, and on the first play, Winslow fumbled a 15-yard catch, which was recovered by Gay and returned for a touchdown. The Browns reached the Patriots\u2019 10-yard line on the final possession of the game, but could not score, ending the game at 34\u201317, giving the Patriots their fifth win of the season as they improved to 5\u20130.

The Patriots took the opening drive of the game 80&nbsp;yards and capped it off with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Stallworth. After Dolphins quarterback [[Cleo Lemon]] fumbled to give the Patriots the ball on the Dolphins\u2019 28-yard line, the Patriots took a 14\u20130 lead with a 2-yard touchdown reception by Kyle Brady. The Dolphins cut the lead in half with a 4-yard Lemon touchdown run to end a 79-yard drive early in the second quarter, but [[Willie Andrews]] returned the ensuing kickoff 74&nbsp;yards to give the Patriots another 14-point lead. Following a Dolphins punt, a 36-yard Welker reception set up a 35-yard Moss touchdown catch. After another Dolphins punt, Brady connected with Moss on a 50-yard touchdown strike, giving the Patriots a 35\u20137 lead. An exchange of punts left the Dolphins with the ball at their own 1-yard line, but a 49-yard punt by [[Brandon Fields]] and a holding penalty on [[Kelley Washington]] gave the Patriots the ball at their own 29-yard line. Still, Brady led the Patriots on another scoring drive, ending this one on a 14-yard Welker catch to give the Patriots a 42\u20137 lead going into halftime.

Following a Patriots punt, the Dolphins began a 10-play, 80-yard drive that ended on a 1-yard [[Patrick Cobbs]] touchdown run early in the fourth quarter, cutting their deficit to 28 points. The Patriots replaced Brady with backup Cassel on the next drive, but after Cassel threw an interception to defensive end [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]] which Taylor returned for a touchdown, Brady returned for the Patriots\u2019 next possession.

On the Redskins\u2019 ensuing possession, Warren recovered a Vrabel strip-sack of [[Jason Campbell]] at the Redskins\u2019 21-yard line, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Redskins turned the ball over again on their next possession on a Samuel interception, only to regain it on the next play after Brady was strip-sacked by [[Phillip Daniels]] at the Patriots\u2019 40-yard line. The string of turnovers continued as the Redskins drove 20&nbsp;yards before another Vrabel strip-sack of Campbell was again recovered by Warren. With less than 2&nbsp;minutes remaining in the first half, the Patriots drove 73&nbsp;yards, and on a fake spike play from the Redskins\u2019 6-yard line, increased their lead to 24\u20130 on a touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. That touchdown pass was Brady's 29th of the season, eclipsing his career high set in [[2004 New England Patriots season|2004]] and [[2002 New England Patriots season|2002]], but with it only being week 8, accomplished this in only playing through the first eight of 16 games.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, an 85-yard Patriots drive ended in another Brady touchdown run, this one from 2&nbsp;yards out. The Redskins committed their fourth turnover of the game on their next possession, as Vrabel strip-sacked Campbell for the third time in the game; this time Colvin recovered the fumble and returned it 11&nbsp;yards for a touchdown to increase the Patriots\u2019 lead to 38\u20130. The Redskins managed to reach the Patriots\u2019 13-yard line on their next drive, but on fourth down, the Redskins could not convert and turned the ball over again. The Patriots began their next drive where they left off, going 88&nbsp;yards on a 14-play drive that spanned into the fourth quarter. It was finished on a 2-yard touchdown reception by Welker that grew the Patriots lead to 45\u20130. Following a Redskins punt, on the Patriots\u2019 next series, Cassel replaced Brady.

J. Feeley]], starting in place of an injured [[Donovan McNabb]], threw an interception to Samuel, who returned it for a touchdown. On the ensuing drive, the Eagles responded with a 14-play drive capped off by a 1-yard touchdown run by [[Brian Westbrook]]; thus, before the Patriots offense had its first possession, the game was tied 7\u20137. On that possession, Brady threw seven passes, was sacked once, and scrambled for 12&nbsp;yards, before Evans had a 1-yard touchdown run (the first called run of the game for the Patriots). The Eagles tied the game again on their next possession when wide receiver [[Greg Lewis (wide receiver)|Greg Lewis]] caught a 28-yard touchdown pass from Feeley. After a successful [[onside kick]] attempt by the Eagles led to a three-and-out drive, the Patriots started at their own 20-yard line and moved the ball all the way to the Eagles\u2019 11-yard line before the drive stalled and Gostkowski converted a 23-yard field goal. The Eagles responded with another touchdown pass from Feeley to Lewis, this one from 18&nbsp;yards out, to end a 68-yard drive. With less than 3&nbsp;minutes to go in the first half the Patriots were trailing the Eagles, 21\u201317. The Patriots then converted three third downs on their last possession of the half, and Gaffney caught a 19-yard touchdown pass to give the Patriots a halftime lead, 24\u201321.\n\nAfter an exchange of punts to begin the second half, Maroney saw his first carries of the game on a drive that appeared to end in a 4-yard Moss touchdown pass before the catch was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty. The next three plays were incomplete passes by Brady, and on fourth down, Gostkowski missed a 32-yard field goal to keep the score at 24\u201321 in favor of the Patriots. The Eagles responded with a 10-play, 78-yard drive, retaking the lead on an 8-yard touchdown pass to [[Reggie Brown (wide receiver)|Reggie Brown]]. After an unsuccessful fourth down conversion attempt from the Eagles\u2019 33-yard line, the Patriots defense held the Eagles to a three-and-out, forcing a punt. On a third down in the middle of the Patriots\u2019 next drive, Welker, who finished with 13 catches on the night, caught a 16-yard pass that moved the ball into the Eagles\u2019 red zone. With 7:24 left in the game, Maroney put the Patriots ahead 31\u201328 with a 4-yard touchdown run. The Eagles moved the ball to the Patriots\u2019 29-yard line on their next drive, but on 2nd and 4, Feeley was intercepted by Samuel in the end zone with 2:49 remaining in the game.

On the first drive of the game, a 42-yard Stallworth reception and three Ravens penalties helped set up a 1st and goal from the Ravens\u2019 3-yard line. The Patriots next four plays gained a net of zero yards, and Gostkowksi kicked a 21-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 3\u20130 lead. After an exchange of punts, the Ravens took the lead with [[Kyle Boller]] completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to [[Derrick Mason]] after a 70-yard drive. In the second quarter, Baltimore increased its lead when kicker [[Matt Stover]] converted a 29-yard field goal to cap a 12-play, 55-yard drive. On the ensuing drive, the Patriots responded with a 9-play, 60-yard drive that included two more Stallworth receptions and two more Ravens penalties and ended in a 1-yard Evans touchdown run. Two possessions later, with 56&nbsp;seconds remaining the first half, Brady threw his fifth interception of the season, this one to safety [[Ed Reed]], who proceeded to fumble on the return. Watson recovered the fumble and the Patriots went into halftime in a 10\u201310 tie.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, the Ravens drove 73&nbsp;yards and regained the lead on a 17-yard run by [[Willis McGahee]], his sixth rush of the 8-play drive. The Patriots answered on their next possession with an 11-play, 72-yard drive that included a dump-off pass to Maroney for 36&nbsp;yards. A 3-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss tied the game again at 17\u201317. In the first minute of the fourth quarter, Baltimore got the lead again, 24\u201317, as Boller completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Daniel Wilcox]] after an 8-play, 56-yard drive. The Patriots went 3-and-out on their next drive, and a 33-yard [[Yamon Figurs]] punt return coupled with a 5-yard [[Pierre Woods]] penalty gave the Ravens the ball at the Patriots\u2019 26-yard line with less than 13&nbsp;minutes remaining in the game. After two McGahee runs for 1&nbsp;yard and a false start penalty gave the Ravens a 3rd and 14 situation, Boller was intercepted at the Patriots\u2019 1-yard line by Sanders to hold the Ravens scoreless on the drive. Sanders\u2019 42-yard return gave the Patriots the ball at their own 43-yard line, and another Maroney dump-off pass for 43&nbsp;yards brought the Patriots to the Ravens\u2019 24-yard line. The Patriots then failed to make the first down, and Gostkowski kicked another field goal, this one from 38&nbsp;yards out, to cut the Ravens\u2019 lead to 24\u201320. The Patriots defense, which gave up almost 60 first half rushing yards to McGahee, held McGahee to 1&nbsp;yard on the Ravens\u2019 next drive and forced a 3-and-out. The Patriots\u2019 ensuing drive brought them to the Ravens\u2019 31-yard line before a 10-yard [[Dan Koppen]] penalty and incompletion forced another punt. With less than 6&nbsp;minutes remaining, the Patriots defense again prevented the Ravens offense from completing a first down and got the ball back with 3:30 left in the game.\n\nStarting from their own 27-yard line, the Patriots got to midfield on the second play of their drive with a 23-yard Watson reception. An incompletion and 9-yard Faulk catch brought 3rd and 1, where Brady rushed for 2&nbsp;yards and the first down. After the two-minute warning, another 9-yard Faulk catch on 3rd and 10 gave the Patriots a 4th and 1 from the Ravens\u2019 30-yard line with 1:48 remaining. Brady attempted another sneak and was stopped short of the first, but the play was nullified by a timeout called by Ravens defensive coordinator [[Rex Ryan]] just before the snap. Heath Evans lost a yard on the Patriots\u2019 next attempt, but a false start penalty by [[Russ Hochstein]] nullified the play and set up a 4th and 6. Brady scrambled for the first down and additionally, Ravens cornerback [[Samari Rolle]] was penalized for illegal contact to give the Patriots another 5&nbsp;yards, moving them to the Ravens\u2019 18-yard line with 1:38 left on the clock. A 5-yard Faulk rush and two incompletions gave the Patriots another fourth down situation. Brady's throw to Watson in the end zone fell incomplete, but the Patriots again received a fresh set of downs after Ravens defensive back [[Jamaine Winborne]] was called for defensive holding. On 1st and goal from the Ravens\u2019 8-yard line with 55&nbsp;seconds remaining, the Patriots took their first lead since the first quarter on a Gaffney touchdown reception that was upheld by official review. After the play, Ravens linebacker [[Bart Scott]] received two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties after throwing an official's flag into the stands, and Reed was flagged for being offsides on the extra point, setting up a Patriots kickoff from the Ravens\u2019 35-yard line. After a Gostkowski touchback on the kickoff, the Ravens completed two passes, bringing them to their own 45-yard line with 8&nbsp;seconds remaining. Boller threw a [[Hail Mary pass]] that was caught by wide receiver [[Mark J. Clayton|Mark Clayton]] at the Patriots\u2019 3-yard line, but he was tackled shy of the end zone as time expired.\n\nThe Patriots became the sixth team in NFL history to begin a season 12\u20130, in a game that was the most-watched program in the history of cable television.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/record_audience.html |title=Record audience |work=Boston.com Reiss\u2019 Pieces |first=Mike |last=Reiss |date=December 5, 2007 |accessdate=December 5, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324165912/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/record_audience.html |archivedate=March 24, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/sports/patriots/index.php/2007/12/05/legendary-viewing-audience-monday-night/ |title=Record-setting viewing audience Monday night |work=BostonHerald.com The Point After |first=John |last=Tomase |date=December 5, 2007 |accessdate=December 23, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071208192952/http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/sports/patriots/index.php/2007/12/05/legendary-viewing-audience-monday-night/| archivedate= December 8, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Week 14: vs. Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Americanfootballbox|\n|Road=Steelers\n|R1=3||R2=10||R3=0||R4=0\n|Home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=7||H2=10||H3=14||H4=3\n|stadium= Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|time= 4:15&nbsp;p.m. EST\n|weather= {{convert|34|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, cloudy and cold\n|TV=CBS |TVAnnouncers= Jim Nantz (play-by-play) and Phil Simms (color commentator)\n|referee= [[Terry McAulay]]\n|attendance= 68,756\n}}\nBeginning a stretch of three straight home games, the Patriots faced off against the 9\u20133 Steelers in their first afternoon game in five weeks.

The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&nbsp;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots\u2019 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots\u2019 lead to 17\u201310 on a 33-yard [[Mike Nugent]] field goal. The Patriots\u2019 ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets\u2019 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&nbsp;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets\u2019 next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20\u201310 win. It gave the Patriots a 14\u20130 record, tying with [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|the 1972 Miami Dolphins]] as the best record to start a season.<ref name=\"JetsNotes\">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/postgame_notes_1.html |title=Post-game notes |work=Boston.com Reiss\u2019 Pieces |first=Mike |last=Reiss |date=December 16, 2007 |accessdate=December 20, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022154242/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/postgame_notes_1.html |archivedate=October 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The win also clinched home-field advantage for the Patriots throughout [[NFL playoffs, 2007-08|the playoffs]].<ref name=\"JetsNotes\" />\n\n===Week 16: vs. Miami Dolphins===\n{{Americanfootballbox|\n|Road=Dolphins\n|R1=0||R2=0||R3=7||R4=0\n|Home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=7||H2=21||H3=0||H4=0\n|stadium= Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|time= 4:15&nbsp;p.m. EST\n|weather= {{convert|43|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, cloudy and mild with rain expected\n|TV=CBS |TVAnnouncers= Jim Nantz (play-by-play) and Phil Simms (color commentator)\n|referee= [[Ron Winter]]\n|attendance= 68,756\n}}\nPlaying their third consecutive home game, the Patriots tried to improve their record to 15\u20130 against the 1\u201313 Dolphins.

After a successful third-down conversion, Brady threw his second touchdown pass of the game to Moss from a yard out to give the Patriots a 14\u20130 lead. The Dolphins\u2019 punted again on their next drive, and the Patriots opened up a 21-point lead with a 59-yard Maroney touchdown run while also setting the franchise record for net yards on a season, breaking the record of 5,965 set in [[1978 New England Patriots season|1978]].<ref name=\"DolphinsNotes\" /> After the Dolphins\u2019 fourth three-and-out of the game, a 38-yard [[Brandon Fields]] punt was muffed by Troy Brown and recovered by the Dolphins, who punted again three plays later. After moving the ball from their own 20-yard line to the Dolphins\u2019 48-yard line, Brady completed a 48-yard touchdown pass to Gaffney on the Patriots\u2019 71st touchdown of the season, breaking the NFL record of 70 set by the [[1984 Miami Dolphins season|1984]] Dolphins.<ref name=\"DolphinsNotes\" /> The Dolphins drove the Patriots\u2019 4-yard line with 21&nbsp;seconds remaining in the half, but [[Tedy Bruschi]] batted down a Lemon pass on fourth down intended for [[Justin Peelle]] to preserve the Patriots\u2019 28\u20130 lead heading into halftime.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Welker caught his 101st pass of the season, tying the Patriots\u2019 individual franchise record Brown set in [[2001 New England Patriots season|2001]]. On the next play, Brady was intercepted by [[Jason Allen (American football)|Jason Allen]] the end zone on a pass intended for Moss. After a 22-yard Chatman rush began the Dolphins\u2019 ensuing drive, the Dolphins punted for the seventh time three plays later. On third down from their own 28-yard line, Brady threw his second interception of the game, this time picked off by linebacker [[Derrick Pope]] on a pass also intended for Moss. The Dolphins moved the ball on their next drive from their own 46-yard line to the Patriots\u2019 1-yard line, where Lemon scrambled out of bounds short of the end zone on 4th and goal. The Dolphins challenged the ruling, which was upheld after review. The play gave the Patriots the ball from their own 1-yard line, where a three-and-out set up a 64-yard Hanson punt from the end zone, his longest of the season. A 22-yard [[Lorenzo Booker]] rush on the Dolphins\u2019 next possession helped bring the Dolphins\u2019 to the Patriots 21-yard line, where Lemon connected with [[Greg Camarillo]] to cut the Patriots lead to 28\u20137. The Patriots committed their fourth turnover of the game when Brady was strip-sacked by [[Joey Porter]] to give the Dolphins the ball at their own 28-yard line.

With the game scheduled to air on [[NFL Network]], not available on some cable providers, the NFL arranged a three-way simulcast of the game with CBS and NBC, the first time an NFL game was broadcast on three networks, and the first national simulcast of any NFL game since [[Super Bowl I]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80579400&template=with-video&confirm=true |title=Patriots\u2019 historic game to be available to all of America, after all |agency=Associated Press |publisher=NFL  |date=December 26, 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071227132215/http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80579400&template=with-video&confirm=true| archivedate= December 27, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The New York and Boston television markets both had a fourth channel, a local TV station in each respective market covering the game.

The Patriots had already clinched a first-round bye and home-field advantage through the playoffs while the Giants were guaranteed to play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the wild card playoffs.  Nevertheless, the Patriots were attempting to become the first team since the NFL's expansion to a 16-game regular season schedule to go undefeated and thus the game became the most heavily promoted game in the history of the NFL to that point and the most watched regular season game ever to that point.\n\nOn the second play of the game, the 10\u20135 Giants moved into the Patriots\u2019 red zone on a 52-yard completion from [[Eli Manning]] to [[Plaxico Burress]]. Three plays later, The Giants took the lead on a 7-yard touchdown pass to [[Brandon Jacobs]]. The Patriots responded with a pair of 14-yard completions to Moss and Welker; Welker's catch, his 102nd of the season, set a Patriots franchise record.<ref name=\"GiantsNotes\" /> The Patriots then converted a fourth down, and on their next fourth down, they made a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Patriots would regain the ball at midfield following a Giants three-and-out. Completions to Stallworth and Welker put the Patriots in the Giants\u2019 red zone, where Brady completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to Moss, taking a 10\u20137 lead on the first play of the second quarter. On the play, three records were affected: the Patriots 560th point surpassed the [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|1998 Minnesota Vikings's]] record of 556 points in a season; the touchdown pass was Brady's 49th, tying Peyton Manning's [[2004 Indianapolis Colts season|2004]] record; and Moss recorded his 22nd touchdown catch of the season, tying [[Jerry Rice]]\u2019s [[1987 NFL season|1987]] record.\n\nAs a result of a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct after the touchdown, the Patriots kicked off from the 15-yard line. Giants wide receiver [[Domenik Hixon]] received it from the Giants\u2019 26-yard line and proceeded to run for a 74-yard touchdown return, retaking the lead for the Giants. Starting from their own 33-yard line, the Patriots moved into Giants territory on a 13-yard Maroney rush and 8-yard Faulk reception. Brady's 8 passing yards on the play gave him 4,557 for the season, breaking [[Drew Bledsoe]]\u2019s [[1994 New England Patriots season|1994]] franchise record of 4,555&nbsp;yards.<ref name=\"GiantsNotes\" /> After the drive stalled, Gostkowski's recorded his second field goal for the game, making the score 14\u201313 in favor of the Giants. Following a Giants punt, the Patriots mounted a drive that resulted in Gostkowski's third field goal of the night, from 37&nbsp;yards, after a 3rd down end zone pass to Moss ricocheted off of linebacker [[Gerris Wilkinson|Gerris Wilkinson's]] helmet. With 1:54 remaining the half and the Giants trailing 16\u201314, Manning completed five of his first seven passes to move from the Giants\u2019 15-yard line to the Patriots\u2019 3-yard line. On second down with 18&nbsp;seconds remaining, Manning threw his second touchdown pass of the game, this time to Boss, to take a 21\u201316 lead at the half.\n\nAfter the Patriots began the second half with a three-and-out, the Giants increased their lead to 12 points on a 19-yard touchdown catch by Burress from Manning. Facing their largest deficit of the season, the Patriots drove to the Giants\u2019 16-yard line with several Brady completions. A pass interference call against the Giants\u2019 Wilkinson gave the Patriots the ball at the Giants\u2019 1-yard line. After an illegal formation penalty moved the Patriots back 5&nbsp;yards, a 6-yard Maroney touchdown run cut the Giants\u2019 lead to 28\u201323. Three consecutive drives resulted in punts, and the Patriots gained possession of the ball with less than 12&nbsp;minutes remaining in the game.\n[[File:Patriotsgiants 031.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Brady]] on the sideline with teammates [[Randy Moss]] and [[Jabar Gaffney]], after throwing for his record-breaking 50th passing touchdown of the season.]]\nOn the second play of the drive, Brady attempted a deep pass to Moss, which was underthrown and dropped. On the next play, Brady attempted another deep pass to Moss, who caught this one for 65&nbsp;yards, setting two more NFL records: Moss set the record for most touchdown receptions in a season (23) and Brady set one for touchdown passes (50).<ref name=\"GiantsNotes\" /> The touchdown, Brady's last of the game, also brought Brady's touchdown-to-interception margin to +42; Peyton Manning held the previous record, +39 during the 2003\u20132004 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2008/01/extra_points_35.html |title=Extra points |work=Boston.com Reiss\u2019 Pieces |first=Mike |last=Reiss |date=January 1, 2008 |accessdate=January 1, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523111637/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2008/01/extra_points_35.html |archivedate=May 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This also brought Brady's touchdown-to-interception ratio to 6.25:1, another NFL record.  Brady himself would shatter his own record [[2010 New England Patriots season|three years later]].  The Patriots converted the subsequent two-point attempt, their only two-point conversion attempt of the season, on a Maroney rush to take a 31\u201328 lead with 11:15 remaining. On the Giants\u2019 ensuing drive, Hobbs intercepted a Manning pass intended for Burress at the Patriots\u2019 48-yard line. After driving to the red zone, a 5-yard catch by Moss marked his 1,493rd reception yard for the season, breaking [[Stanley Morgan|Stanley Morgan's]] [[1986 New England Patriots season|1986]] franchise record of 1,491&nbsp;yards. On the subsequent play, Maroney scored his second touchdown of the game on a 5-yard run to give the Patriots a 38\u201328 lead. With 4:36 left in the game, the Giants drove the ball to the Patriots\u2019 4-yard line, and two plays later, Manning completed a 3-yard touchdown pass to Burress, Manning's fourth for the game. After the Patriots\u2019 Vrabel recovered the Giants\u2019 onside kickoff, the Patriots knelt thrice to end the game as they finished the regular season 16\u20130.\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 joined the 14\u20130 [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]], 11\u20130 [[1942 Chicago Bears season|1942 Chicago Bears]], and 13\u20130 [[1934 Chicago Bears season|1934 Chicago Bears]] as the fourth team to record an undefeated regular season in the NFL (the [[1948 Cleveland Browns season|1948 Cleveland Browns]] were 14\u20130 in the [[All-America Football Conference]], an accomplishment recognized by the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], but not by the NFL.)

Patriots quarterback [[Tom Brady]] set the NFL record for completion percentage in a single game (92.9%) with 26 of 28 completions for 263&nbsp;yards and 3 touchdowns, while running back [[Laurence Maroney]] added 162 total yards (122 on the ground). Overall, New England gained 401&nbsp;yards and didn't punt the ball until 31&nbsp;seconds remained in the fourth quarter.\n\nJacksonville took the opening kickoff and went 80&nbsp;yards in 9 plays, featuring two receptions by [[Marcedes Lewis]] for 57&nbsp;yards, on the way to [[David Garrard]]\u2019s 9-yard touchdown pass to [[Matt Jones (American football)|Matt Jones]]. The Patriots then went on a 74-yard drive and scored with [[Tom Brady]]\u2019s 3-yard touchdown pass to [[Benjamin Watson]]. On Jacksonville's next possession, New England lineman [[Ty Warren]] forced a fumble while sacking Garrard, and linebacker [[Mike Vrabel]] recovered it at the Jaguars 29-yard line. Several plays later, Maroney scored a 1-yard touchdown run to give New England a 14\u20137 lead.\n\nJaguars running back [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] muffed the ensuing kickoff and was downed at his own 5-yard line. The Jaguars then moved the ball 95&nbsp;yards in 11 plays without facing a third down and scoring with Garrard's 6-yard touchdown pass to [[Ernest Wilford]]. For the third time in a row, New England drove deep into Jacksonville territory. But this time the drive stalled at the 17-yard line and ended with no points when [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed a 35-yard field goal with 53&nbsp;seconds left in the first half.\n[[File:2007Pats-DivisionalPlayoff-Victory.jpg|thumb|left|The Patriots on the field after their victory]]\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Brady completed 7 of 8 passes for 54&nbsp;yards on an 82-yard drive. On the last play, he took a snap in shotgun formation with [[Kevin Faulk]] to his right, Brady jumped in the air with his arms raised to make it look like a play used by the Patriots before where Faulk took the direct snap. The Jaguars defense followed Faulk, leaving [[Wes Welker]] open in the end zone, and Brady threw him the ball for a touchdown to give the Patriots a 21\u201314 lead. Jacksonville responded with a drive to the New England 21-yard line, but receiver [[Dennis Northcutt]] dropped a pass on third down, forcing them to settle for a [[Josh Scobee]] 39-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21\u201317. On New England's next drive, Jacksonville's [[Derek Landri]] was assessed a roughing-the-passer penalty, turning Welker's 6-yard catch into a 21-yard gain. Maroney gained 40&nbsp;yards with his next two carries, and following two more Welker receptions, Brady threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Watson giving New England a 28\u201317 lead.\n\nAn unnecessary roughness penalty and a 25-yard reception by [[Reggie Williams (wide receiver)|Reggie Williams]] on the Jacksonville's next drive set up a 25-yard field goal by Scobee, which cut the Jaguars deficit to one touchdown, 28\u201320. On the second play after the kickoff, Brady completed a 52-yard strike to [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]], setting up Gostkowski's second field goal attempt to put New England back up by two scores, 31\u201320.\n\nThen, with 3:46 left in the game, Pats safety [[Rodney Harrison]], intercepted a pass from Garrard at the Patriots\u2019 31-yard line, ending any hope of a Jacksonville comeback. Harrison's interception was his 7th career postseason pick, a Patriots record. This was also his fourth consecutive postseason game with an interception, tying an NFL record held by [[Aeneas Williams]].\n\nWith this win, the Patriots advanced to the AFC title game for the second year in a row and extended their perfect record to 17\u20130, matching the final record of the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]].\n\n'''Scoring'''\n\n'''First quarter'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Matt Jones (American football)|Matt Jones]] 8&nbsp;yard pass from [[David Garrard]] ([[Josh Scobee]] kick), 10:50.

With this win, the Patriots became the first NFL team to start with an 18\u20130 record and advanced to their fourth Super Bowl appearance in seven years.\n\nWith just over 5&nbsp;minutes left in the first quarter, Chargers defensive back [[Quentin Jammer]] intercepted a pass from Brady on the Patriots 40-yard line, setting up a 26-yard field goal by [[Nate Kaeding]]. New England responded by driving 65&nbsp;yards and scoring with a 1-yard Maroney touchdown run to take a 7\u20133 lead.\n\n[[File:Andre Tippett 2007AFCC2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andre Tippett]] presents [[Robert Kraft]] with the [[Lamar Hunt]] trophy]]\nKaeding kicked a 23-yard field goal in the second quarter to cut the score to 7\u20136, but after a punt, Patriots defensive back [[Asante Samuel]] intercepted a pass from [[Philip Rivers]] and returned it 10&nbsp;yards to the Chargers 24-yard line. One play later, Brady's 12-yard touchdown pass to [[Jabar Gaffney]] increased their lead to 14\u20136. Later on, a 26-yard run by [[Darren Sproles]] moved the ball to the New England 34-yard line. But once again, the Patriots defense kept San Diego out of the end zone, stopping them on 3rd and 1 and forcing them to settle for another Kaeding field goal, making the score 14\u20139 at halftime.\n\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Brady threw his second interception of the game, this one to [[Drayton Florence]] at the New England 49-yard line. San Diego then moved the ball to the 4-yard line, but on 3rd and 1, linebacker [[Junior Seau]] tackled [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] for a 2-yard loss and the Chargers had to settle for Kaeding's fourth field goal. New England responded with a drive to the San Diego 2-yard line, with Maroney gaining 39&nbsp;yards on four running plays, but Chargers cornerback [[Antonio Cromartie]] ended the drive by intercepting Brady in the end zone.\n\nOn their first drive of the fourth quarter, New England moved the ball 67&nbsp;yards and scored with Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to [[Wes Welker]], making the score 21\u201312. Following a Chargers punt, the Patriots ended the game with a 15-play drive that took the final 9:13 off the game clock.

After scoring a combined 73 points in their regular season meeting, the teams scored only a mere 10 points by the end of the third quarter, with the Patriots leading 7 to 3. The Patriots\u2019 record-setting offense gave up five sacks and one lost fumble, while the Giants\u2019 offense managed only five first downs in the second and third quarters. Yet in the fourth quarter, quarterback [[Eli Manning]] led two go-ahead touchdown drives, including the winning drive that culminated with a 17-yard touchdown to [[Plaxico Burress]] with 39&nbsp;seconds remaining. The game marked the first time that a previously undefeated team had lost in a [[National Football League]] championship game since the [[1942 NFL season|1942]] [[Chicago Bears]] as the Patriots fell to 18\u20131 on the season.  The Patriots were also the second team to enter the Super Bowl undefeated, joining the [[1972 Miami Dolphins]], who reached [[Super Bowl VII]] with a 16\u20130 record and won to become the first and to date only NFL team to win the league championship after going all the way through the regular season and playoffs undefeated and untied, but were the first undefeated and untied team to fail to win the Super Bowl.\n\nAfter calling tails to win the [[Coin flipping|coin toss]], the Giants started the game with the longest opening drive in Super Bowl history,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=346770 \n |title=Giants prevent perfect season, beat Patriots \n |date=February 8, 2008 \n |publisher=[[Sporting News]] \n |accessdate=February 8, 2008 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207090843/http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=346770 \n |archivedate=February 7, 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n |df=mdy \n}}</ref> a 16-play, 77-yard march that consumed 9&nbsp;minutes, 59&nbsp;seconds and featured four third-down conversions, the most ever on a Super Bowl opening drive. But New England halted the drive at their own 14-yard line, forcing the Giants to settle for a 32-yard field goal from [[Lawrence Tynes]] that gave New York a 3\u20130 lead.\n\nNew England then responded with its own scoring drive as [[Laurence Maroney]] returned the kickoff 43&nbsp;yards to the Patriots\u2019 44-yard line, after which he rushed twice for 15&nbsp;yards. Quarterback [[Tom Brady]] then completed three passes for 23&nbsp;yards, but after two incomplete passes, New England was faced with 3rd-and-10 on the Giants\u2019 17. However, on that play, New York linebacker [[Antonio Pierce]] committed pass interference by striking the helmet of tight end [[Benjamin Watson]] in the end zone, giving New England 1st-and-goal at the 1. This set up a Maroney 1-yard touchdown run two plays later, the first play of the second quarter, for a 7\u20133 lead. The two teams each only had one drive in the entire opening quarter, a Super Bowl record.\n\nOn the Giants first drive of the second quarter, on 3rd-and-7, receiver [[Amani Toomer]] caught in a deep pass from Manning along the left sideline while dragging his feet in-bounds for a 38-yard gain, moving the ball to the Patriots\u2019 19. But three plays later, Manning threw a pass that bounced out of the arms of rookie receiver [[Steve Smith (wide receiver, born 1985)|Steve Smith]] and into the hands of cornerback [[Ellis Hobbs]] for an interception.\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 ensuing drive resulted in a three-and-out as on 3rd-and-1 [[James Butler (American football)|James Butler]] and [[Michael Strahan]] tackled Maroney for a two-yard loss and New England was forced to punt.\n\nThen on the Giants\u2019 next drive, rookie running back [[Ahmad Bradshaw]] fumbled a Manning hand-off and it looked as though Patriots\u2019 linebacker [[Pierre Woods]] had recovered the ball at the Giants\u2019 30. But after the officials picked through the pile, it was determined that Bradshaw had made the recovery. The Giants maintained possession and wound up punting. New England's next drive ended with consecutive Giants\u2019 sacks, the first by linebacker [[Kawika Mitchell]], the second by tackle [[Justin Tuck]].\n\nOn the Giants\u2019 following drive, New York moved the ball to the New England 25, but linebacker [[Adalius Thomas]] sacked Manning and forced a fumble. Smith recovered the ball, however Bradshaw was penalized for illegally batting the ball forward before the recovery. The penalty pushed the Giants out of field goal range, and following an incompletion, they were forced to punt.\n\nAfter the punt, two 18-yard receptions by Moss and [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]] moved the ball to the Giants\u2019 44. But with 22&nbsp;seconds left before halftime, Brady fumbled while being sacked by Tuck and defensive end [[Osi Umenyiora]] recovered the ball. The game then went to halftime with the Patriots leading 7\u20133.\n\nOn the first drive of the second half, New England had a 4th-and-2 and chose to punt. However, after the play had been run, Patriots\u2019 head coach [[Bill Belichick]] challenged that New York had too many players on the field and replay confirmed that was the case as Giants linebacker [[Chase Blackburn]] was unable to get to the sidelines as the ball was being snapped. Therefore, referee [[Mike Carey (American football)|Mike Carey]] reversed the play, and the Giants were penalized 5&nbsp;yards for having too many players on the field, giving the Patriots a first down. The Patriots then drove to the Giants\u2019 25, but Strahan sacked Brady for a 6-yard loss on third down. Then on 4th-and-13, with the ball on the Giants\u2019 31, Belichick decided against a long field goal attempt by [[Stephen Gostkowski]] and tried to pick up a first down instead. Brady's pass to [[Jabar Gaffney]] was incomplete as it went out of the back of the end zone and the Giants took over on downs.\n\nOn the Giants\u2019 first drive of the fourth quarter, Manning completed a 45-yard pass to rookie tight end [[Kevin Boss]]. Following three runs by Bradshaw and a 17-yard reception by Smith on third down, Manning finished the 7-play, 80-yard drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to [[David Tyree]], giving New York a 10\u20137 lead with 11:10 left in the game.\n\nAfter consecutive three-and-outs by the Patriots and Giants, New England got the ball at its own 20 with 7:54 to play. Brady then completed a 5-yard pass to [[Wes Welker]] and a 10-yard pass to Moss, followed by a 9-yard run by Maroney to give the Patriots a first down at their own 44. Brady followed with a 13-yard pass to Welker, a four-yard completion to [[Kevin Faulk]], and then a 10-yard pass to Welker for a first down at the Giants\u2019 29. After that, Brady found Moss for an 11-yard completion and Faulk for a 12-yard completion and New England now had 1st-and-goal from the Giants\u2019 6. Following two incomplete passes, New York cornerback [[Corey Webster]] slipped while backing into coverage, leaving Moss wide open in the end zone where Brady found him for a touchdown to give New England a 14\u201310 lead with 2:42 left in the game.\n\nOn the ensuing kickoff, [[Ray Ventrone]] tackled [[Domenik Hixon]] after a 14-yard return, giving New York the ball on their own 17 with 2:39 left and three timeouts remaining. Following two receptions by Toomer for 20&nbsp;yards, [[Brandon Jacobs]] kept the drive going with a 2-yard run on 4th-and-1. On the next series of downs, Patriots\u2019 cornerback [[Asante Samuel]] nearly caught a possibly game-ending interception on a ball intended for Tyree, but the ball slipped through his fingertips. On the next play, the Giants faced 3rd-and-5 from their own 44 with 1:15 remaining. Manning spun out of the grasp of lineman [[Jarvis Green]], righted himself, and [[Helmet Catch|threw a 32-yard completion to Tyree]], who made a leaping catch while covered by [[Rodney Harrison]] and maintained possession by pinning the ball against his helmet with one hand as he fell to the ground. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-11, Manning found a wide-open Smith for a 12-yard gain to the New England 13. On the next play, the Giants sent four receivers into the pattern while the Patriots sent six pass rushers after Manning and flipped four pass defenders to the right side of the field \u2013 resulting in Patriots\u2019 cornerback [[Ellis Hobbs]] being isolated on the left side to cover Giants\u2019 wide receiver [[Plaxico Burress]] one-on-one. Rodney Harrison tried to adjust the unbalanced formation but his fellow defenders, including Junior Seau, were eager to sack Manning and the defense was left unchanged. Hobbs bit on a fake slant inside (a \u201cslant-and-go\u201d or \u201cSluGo\u201d route) and Manning lofted a pass to the end zone where Burress caught the ball for a touchdown to complete the 12-play, 83-yard drive and give Giants a 17\u201314 lead with 35&nbsp;seconds left.\n\nNew England began its next possession on its own 26 with 29&nbsp;seconds remaining and three timeouts, but the Giants\u2019 defense didn't allow a single yard\u2014forcing an incompletion on first down, a 10-yard sack by rookie lineman [[Jay Alford]] on second down, and then two deep incomplete attempts to Moss, the first that was broken up by Webster, and the second of which, on 4th-and-20, was broken up by Giants\u2019 safety [[Gibril Wilson]] and caused a turnover on downs with one second remaining. After the incompletion, the game clock briefly read zero (one second was re-added),<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/peter_king/02/05/giants/index.html?eref=fannation | title=What it\u2019s all about, Giants\u2019 title a reminder of why we watch sports | date=February 5, 2008 | publisher=SI.com | accessdate=February 10, 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604164704/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/peter_king/02/05/giants/index.html?eref=fannation | archivedate=June 4, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> and coaches, players, reporters, and fans crowded the field as if the game had ended. Belichick hugged Giants\u2019 Coach [[Tom Coughlin]] at midfield, then an official explained to both coaches that the final second had to be run. The Patriots\u2019 defense took the field, and Belichick left for the locker room, not staying for the final play. This early departure was later criticized by some sportswriters who felt Belichick was being a sore loser, while others noted that he had properly congratulated Coughlin (they also noted Coughlin was one of the few opposing coaches he didn't loathe) and that the game was over once the Patriots failed to convert on 4th down.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://myespn.go.com/blogs/hashmarks/0-5-366/Belichick-has-left-the-building---a-second-early.html \n |title=Belichick has left the building...a second early \n |date=February 4, 2008 \n |publisher=ESPN \n |accessdate=February 13, 2008 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207222958/http://myespn.go.com/blogs/hashmarks/0-5-366/Belichick-has-left-the-building---a-second-early.html \n |archivedate=February 7, 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:19and0pats.png|right|thumb|150px|The cover to ''19\u20130: The Historic Championship Season of New England\u2019s Unbeatable Patriots'', which was pulled from pre-sale after the game.]] -->\nThe officials cleared the field, and restarted the clock.

Vitruvius described the human figure as being like the principal source of proportion among the [[Classical orders]] of architecture. ]]\n\n'''Renaissance humanism''' was a revival in the study of [[classical antiquity]], at first [[Italian Renaissance|in Italy]] and then spreading across [[Western Europe]] in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. Contemporary use of the term ''humanism'' is consistent with the historical use prominent in that period, while ''Renaissance humanism'' is a [[retronym]] used to distinguish it from later humanist developments.<ref>The term ''la rinascita'' (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Vite de' pi\u00f9 eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani]]'' (The Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568) [[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky, Erwin]]. ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', New York: Harper and Row, 1960.\n\"The term ''umanista'' was used in fifteenth-century Italian academic slang to describe a teacher or student of classical literature and the arts associated with it, including that of rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them\" Nicholas Mann \"The Origins of Humanism,\" ''Cambridge Companion to Humanism'', Jill Kraye, editor [Cambridge University Press, 1996], p. 1\u20132).  The term \"[[Middle Ages]]\" for the preceding period separating classical antiquity from its \"rebirth\" first appears in Latin in 1469 as ''media tempestas''.</ref>\n\nRenaissance humanism was a response to what came to be depicted by later [[whig historians]] as the \"narrow pedantry\" associated with medieval [[scholasticism]].<ref>, Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.</ref> Humanists sought to create a [[citizenship|citizenry]] able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging in the [[Civic engagement|civic life]] of their communities and persuading others to [[virtue|virtuous]] and [[prudence|prudent]] actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[history]], [[poetry]], and [[ethics|moral philosophy]].\n\nHumanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a small elite, a program to revive the cultural legacy, literary legacy, and moral philosophy of classical antiquity. There were important centres of humanism in [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Genoa]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].\n\nThe Renaissance humanism also awoke in man a love of learning and \"a true love for books...[where] humanists built book collections and university libraries developed.\" Humanists believed that the individual encompassed \"body, mind, and soul,\" and learning was very much a part of educating all aspects of the human. This love of and for learning would lead to a demand in the printed word, which in turn drove the invention of Gutenberg's printing press.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray, Stuart|title=Library, the : an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|isbn=978-1-62873-322-8|location=|pages=58, 68|oclc=855503629}}</ref> \n\n==Definition==\nAccording to one scholar of the movement,\n<blockquote>Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the Middle Ages, not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content, and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and its extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, [[Greek language|Greek]], and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group.<ref>Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.

Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Origin==\n{{Renaissance}}\nSome of the first humanists were great collectors of antique [[manuscript]]s, including [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Coluccio Salutati]], and [[Poggio Bracciolini]]. Of the four, Petrarch was dubbed the \"Father of Humanism\" because of his devotion or loyalty to Greek and Roman scrolls. Many worked for the [[Catholic Church]] and were in [[Holy orders in the Catholic Church|holy orders]], like Petrarch. In contrast, others were [[lawyer]]s and [[chancellor]]s of Italian cities, and thus had access to book copying workshops, such as Petrarch's disciple [[Salutati]], the [[Chancellor of Florence]].\n\nIn Italy, the humanist educational program won rapid acceptance, and, by the mid-15th century, many of the [[upper class]]es had received humanist educations, possibly in addition to traditional [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] ones. Some of the highest officials of the Catholic Church were humanists with the resources to amass important libraries. Such was [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Basilios Bessarion]], a [[Religious conversion|convert]] to the Catholic Church from [[Greek Orthodoxy]], who was considered for the [[papacy]], and was one of the most learned scholars of his time. There were several 15th-century and early 16th-century humanist Popes<ref>They include [[Innocent VII]], [[Nicholas V]], [[Pius II]], [[Sixtus IV]], [[Alexander VI]], [[Julius II]] and [[Leo X]]. Innocent VII, a patron of Leonardo Bruni, is considered the first humanist Pope.

This volume (pp. 92\u2013125) contains an essay by [[Leonardo Bruni]], entitled \"The Study of Literature,\" on the education of girls.</ref> These subjects came to be known as the humanities, and the movement which they inspired is shown as humanism.\n\nThe migration waves of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Byzantine Greek scholars]] and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader]] [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sacking of Constantinople]] and the [[fall of Constantinople|end of the Byzantine Empire]] in 1453 greatly assisted the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] literature and science via their greater familiarity with ancient languages and works.<ref>[http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/late/laterbyz/harris-ren.html Byzantines in Renaissance Italy]</ref><ref>[http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/polyglots/greeks-in-italy.html Greeks in Italy]</ref> They included [[Gemistus Pletho]], [[George of Trebizond]], [[Theodorus Gaza]], and [[John Argyropoulos]].\n\nItalian humanism spread northward to [[Humanism in France|France]], [[Germany]], the [[Low Countries]], Poland-Lithuania, Hungary and [[England]] with the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, and it became associated with the [[Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent humanist [[Guillaume Bud\u00e9]] (1467\u20131540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian humanism to the study of antique [[coin]]age and to [[legal history]], composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Bud\u00e9 was a [[Absolute monarchy|royal absolutist]] (and not a [[republicanism|republican]] like the early Italian ''umanisti'') who was active in civic life, serving as a [[diplomat]] for [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] and helping to found the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France|Coll\u00e8ge des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Coll\u00e8ge de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Fran\u00e7ois I, was a [[poet]], [[novelist]], and [[religious mystic]]<ref>She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry.

However, at the time this was not commented on much by Renaissance scholars, who confined themselves to remarks about Lucretius's grammar and [[syntax]].\n\nOnly in 1564 did French commentator Denys Lambin (1519\u201372) announce in the preface to the work that \"he regarded Lucretius's Epicurean ideas as 'fanciful, absurd, and opposed to Christianity.'\" Lambin's introduction remained standard until the nineteenth century.<ref>See Jill Kraye's essay, \"Philologists and Philosophers\" in the ''Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism'' [1996], p. 153.)</ref> Epicurus's unacceptable doctrine that pleasure was the highest good \"ensured the unpopularity of his philosophy.\" <ref>(Kraye [1996] p. 154.)</ref> [[Lorenzo Valla]], however, puts a defense of Epicureanism in the mouth of one of the interlocutors of one of his dialogues.\n\n===Epicureanism===\nCharles Trinkhaus regards Valla's \"epicureanism\" as a ploy, not seriously meant by Valla, but designed to refute Stoicism, which he regarded together with Epicureanism as equally inferior to Christianity.<ref>See Trinkaus, ''In Our Image and Likeness'' Vol. 1 (University of Chicago Press, 1970), pp. 103\u2013170</ref> Valla's defense, or adaptation, of Epicureanism was later taken up  in ''The Epicurean'' by [[Erasmus]], the \"Prince of humanists:\"\n\n{{quote|If people who live agreeably are [[Epicureans]], none are more truly [[Epicurean]] than the righteous and godly.  And if it is names that bother us, no one better deserves the name of Epicurean than the revered founder and head of the [[Christianity|Christian]] philosophy [[Christ]], for in Greek ''epikouros'' means \"helper.\"  He alone, when the [[law of Nature]] was all but blotted out by sins, when the [[law of Moses]] incited to lists rather than cured them, when [[Satan]] ruled in the world unchallenged, brought timely aid to perishing humanity.  Completely mistaken, therefore, are those who talk in their foolish fashion about Christ's having been sad and gloomy in character and calling upon us to follow a dark mode of life.

In this spirit, [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|Pico della Mirandola]] attempted to construct a [[syncretism]] of religions and philosophies with Christianity, but his work did not win favor with the church authorities, who rejected it because of his views on magic.<ref name=\"O'Callaghan2012\">{{cite book|author=Daniel O'Callaghan|title=The Preservation of Jewish Religious Books in Sixteenth-Century Germany: Johannes Reuchlin's Augenspiegel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xt6b2Wi8kCQC&pg=PA43|date=9 November 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-24185-X|pages=43\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Widespread view===\nHistorian Steven Kreis expresses a widespread view (derived from the 19th-century Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]]), when he writes that: <blockquote>The period from the fourteenth century to the seventeenth worked in favor of the general emancipation of the individual. The city-states of northern Italy had come into contact with the diverse customs of the East, and gradually permitted expression in matters of taste and dress. The writings of Dante, and particularly the doctrines of Petrarch and humanists like Machiavelli, emphasized the virtues of intellectual freedom and individual expression. In the essays of Montaigne the individualistic view of life received perhaps the most persuasive and eloquent statement in the history of literature and philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kreis|first=Steven|title=Renaissance Humanism|year=2008|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/humanism.html|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref></blockquote>\nTwo noteworthy trends in Renaissance humanism were Renaissance Neo-Platonism and [[Hermeticism]], which through the works of figures like [[Nicholas of Kues]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Cornelius Agrippa]], [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]] and Pico della Mirandola sometimes came close to constituting a new religion itself. Of these two, Hermeticism has had great continuing influence in Western thought, while the former mostly dissipated as an intellectual trend, leading to movements in [[Western esotericism]] such as [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[New Age]] thinking.<ref>Plumb, 95</ref>  The \"Yates thesis\" of [[Frances Yates]] holds that before falling out of favor, esoteric Renaissance thought introduced several concepts that were useful for the development of the scientific method. However, this remains a matter of controversy.\n\n===Sixteenth century and beyond===\n{{Reformationliterature |expanded=overview}}\nThough humanists continued to use their scholarship in the service of the church into the middle of the sixteenth century and beyond, the sharply confrontational religious atmosphere following the Reformation resulted in the [[Counter-Reformation]] that sought to silence challenges to [[Catholic theology]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library & Renaissance Culture: Humanism|publisher=The Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|date=2002-07-01|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref> with similar efforts among the [[Protestant denominations]]. However, a number of humanists joined the Reformation movement and took over leadership functions, for example, [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Ulrich Zwingli]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Henry VIII]], [[John Calvin]], and [[William Tyndale]].\n\nWith the Counter-Reformation initiated by the [[Council of Trent]] (1545-1563), positions hardened and a strict Catholic orthodoxy based on Scholastic philosophy was imposed. Some humanists, even moderate Catholics such as Erasmus, risked being declared heretics for their perceived criticism of the church. In 1514 he left for [[Basel]] and worked at the [[University of Basel]] for several years.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion|volume=F-N|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopedicdict0000meag/page/1733 1733]|publisher=Corpus Publications|year=1979|isbn=978-0-9602572-1-8|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopedicdict0000meag/page/1733}}</ref>\n\nThe historian of the Renaissance [[John Rigby Hale|Sir John Hale]] cautions against too direct a linkage between Renaissance humanism and modern uses of the term humanism: \"Renaissance humanism must be kept free from any hint of either 'humanitarianism' or 'humanism' in its modern sense of rational, non-religious approach to life ... the word 'humanism' will mislead ... if it is seen in opposition to a Christianity its students in the main wished to supplement, not contradict, through their patient excavation of the sources of ancient God-inspired wisdom.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dJc3cOUVIYMC&q=contradict#search_anchor Hale, 171.] See also Davies, 479-480 for similar caution.</ref>\n\n==Humanists==\n{{main|List of Renaissance humanists}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Humanism}}\n* [[Renaissance humanism in Northern Europe]]\n* [[Christian humanism]]\n* [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance]]\n* [[Renaissance Latin]]\n* [[Legal humanists]]\n* [[New Learning]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bolgar, R.

Contemporary use of the term ''humanism'' is consistent with the historical use prominent in that period, while ''Renaissance humanism'' is a [[retronym]] used to distinguish it from later humanist developments.<ref>The term ''la rinascita'' (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Vite de' pi\u00f9 eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani]]'' (The Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568) [[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky, Erwin]].

The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them\" Nicholas Mann \"The Origins of Humanism,\" ''Cambridge Companion to Humanism'', Jill Kraye, editor [Cambridge University Press, 1996], p. 1\u20132).  The term \"[[Middle Ages]]\" for the preceding period separating classical antiquity from its \"rebirth\" first appears in Latin in 1469 as ''media tempestas''.</ref>\n\nRenaissance humanism was a response to what came to be depicted by later [[whig historians]] as the \"narrow pedantry\" associated with medieval [[scholasticism]].<ref>, Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.</ref> Humanists sought to create a [[citizenship|citizenry]] able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging in the [[Civic engagement|civic life]] of their communities and persuading others to [[virtue|virtuous]] and [[prudence|prudent]] actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[history]], [[poetry]], and [[ethics|moral philosophy]].\n\nHumanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a small elite, a program to revive the cultural legacy, literary legacy, and moral philosophy of classical antiquity. There were important centres of humanism in [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Genoa]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].\n\nThe Renaissance humanism also awoke in man a love of learning and \"a true love for books...[where] humanists built book collections and university libraries developed.\" Humanists believed that the individual encompassed \"body, mind, and soul,\" and learning was very much a part of educating all aspects of the human. This love of and for learning would lead to a demand in the printed word, which in turn drove the invention of Gutenberg's printing press.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Murray, Stuart, 1948-|title=Library, the : an illustrated history|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|isbn=978-1-62873-322-8|location=|pages=58, 68|oclc=855503629}}</ref> \n\n==Definition==\nAccording to one scholar of the movement,\n<blockquote>Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the Middle Ages, not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content, and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and its extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, [[Greek language|Greek]], and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group.<ref>Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178.

Of the four, Petrarch was dubbed the \"Father of Humanism\" because of his devotion or loyalty to Greek and Roman scrolls. Many worked for the [[Catholic Church]] and were in [[Holy orders in the Catholic Church|holy orders]], like Petrarch. In contrast, others were [[lawyer]]s and [[chancellor]]s of Italian cities, and thus had access to book copying workshops, such as Petrarch's disciple [[Salutati]], the [[Chancellor of Florence]].\n\nIn Italy, the humanist educational program won rapid acceptance, and, by the mid-15th century, many of the [[upper class]]es had received humanist educations, possibly in addition to traditional [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] ones. Some of the highest officials of the Catholic Church were humanists with the resources to amass important libraries. Such was [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Basilios Bessarion]], a [[Religious conversion|convert]] to the Catholic Church from [[Greek Orthodoxy]], who was considered for the [[papacy]], and was one of the most learned scholars of his time. There were several 15th-century and early 16th-century humanist Popes<ref>They include [[Innocent VII]], [[Nicholas V]], [[Pius II]], [[Sixtus IV]], [[Alexander VI]], [[Julius II]] and [[Leo X]]. Innocent VII, a patron of Leonardo Bruni, is considered the first humanist Pope.

This volume (pp. 92\u2013125) contains an essay by [[Leonardo Bruni]], entitled \"The Study of Literature,\" on the education of girls.</ref> These subjects came to be known as the humanities, and the movement which they inspired is shown as humanism.\n\nThe migration waves of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Byzantine Greek scholars]] and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader]] [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|sacking of Constantinople]] and the [[fall of Constantinople|end of the Byzantine Empire]] in 1453 greatly assisted the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] literature and science via their greater familiarity with ancient languages and works.<ref>[http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/late/laterbyz/harris-ren.html Byzantines in Renaissance Italy]</ref><ref>[http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/polyglots/greeks-in-italy.html Greeks in Italy]</ref> They included [[Gemistus Pletho]], [[George of Trebizond]], [[Theodorus Gaza]], and [[John Argyropoulos]].\n\nItalian humanism spread northward to [[Humanism in France|France]], [[Germany]], the [[Low Countries]], Poland-Lithuania, Hungary and [[England]] with the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, and it became associated with the [[Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent humanist [[Guillaume Bud\u00e9]] (1467\u20131540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian humanism to the study of antique [[coin]]age and to [[legal history]], composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Bud\u00e9 was a [[Absolute monarchy|royal absolutist]] (and not a [[republicanism|republican]] like the early Italian ''umanisti'') who was active in civic life, serving as a [[diplomat]] for [[Fran\u00e7ois I]] and helping to found the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France|Coll\u00e8ge des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Coll\u00e8ge de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Fran\u00e7ois I, was a [[poet]], [[novelist]], and [[religious mystic]]<ref>She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry.

However, at the time this was not commented on much by Renaissance scholars, who confined themselves to remarks about Lucretius's grammar and [[syntax]].\n\nOnly in 1564 did French commentator Denys Lambin (1519\u201372) announce in the preface to the work that \"he regarded Lucretius's Epicurean ideas as 'fanciful, absurd, and opposed to Christianity.'\" Lambin's introduction remained standard until the nineteenth century.<ref>See Jill Kraye's essay, \"Philologists and Philosophers\" in the ''Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism'' [1996], p. 153.)</ref> Epicurus's unacceptable doctrine that pleasure was the highest good \"ensured the unpopularity of his philosophy.\" <ref>(Kraye [1996] p. 154.)</ref> [[Lorenzo Valla]], however, puts a defense of Epicureanism in the mouth of one of the interlocutors of one of his dialogues.\n\n===Epicureanism===\nCharles Trinkhaus regards Valla's \"epicureanism\" as a ploy, not seriously meant by Valla, but designed to refute Stoicism, which he regarded together with Epicureanism as equally inferior to Christianity.<ref>See Trinkaus, ''In Our Image and Likeness'' Vol. 1 (University of Chicago Press, 1970), pp. 103\u2013170</ref> Valla's defense, or adaptation, of Epicureanism was later taken up  in ''The Epicurean'' by [[Erasmus]], the \"Prince of humanists:\"\n\n{{quote|If people who live agreeably are [[Epicureans]], none are more truly [[Epicurean]] than the righteous and godly.

The city-states of northern Italy had come into contact with the diverse customs of the East, and gradually permitted expression in matters of taste and dress. The writings of Dante, and particularly the doctrines of Petrarch and humanists like Machiavelli, emphasized the virtues of intellectual freedom and individual expression. In the essays of Montaigne the individualistic view of life received perhaps the most persuasive and eloquent statement in the history of literature and philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kreis|first=Steven|title=Renaissance Humanism|year=2008|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/humanism.html|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref></blockquote>\nTwo noteworthy trends in Renaissance humanism were Renaissance Neo-Platonism and [[Hermeticism]], which through the works of figures like [[Nicholas of Kues]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Cornelius Agrippa]], [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]] and Pico della Mirandola sometimes came close to constituting a new religion itself. Of these two, Hermeticism has had great continuing influence in Western thought, while the former mostly dissipated as an intellectual trend, leading to movements in [[Western esotericism]] such as [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[New Age]] thinking.<ref>Plumb, 95</ref>  The \"Yates thesis\" of [[Frances Yates]] holds that before falling out of favor, esoteric Renaissance thought introduced several concepts that were useful for the development of the scientific method. However, this remains a matter of controversy.\n\n===Sixteenth century and beyond===\n{{Reformationliterature |expanded=overview}}\nThough humanists continued to use their scholarship in the service of the church into the middle of the sixteenth century and beyond, the sharply confrontational religious atmosphere following the Reformation resulted in the [[Counter-Reformation]] that sought to silence challenges to [[Catholic theology]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library & Renaissance Culture: Humanism|publisher=The Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|date=2002-07-01|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref> with similar efforts among the [[Protestant denominations]]. However, a number of humanists joined the Reformation movement and took over leadership functions, for example, [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Ulrich Zwingli]], [[Martin Luther]], [[Henry VIII]], [[John Calvin]], and [[William Tyndale]].\n\nWith the Counter-Reformation initiated by the [[Council of Trent]] (1545-1563), positions hardened and a strict Catholic orthodoxy based on Scholastic philosophy was imposed. Some humanists, even moderate Catholics such as Erasmus, risked being declared heretics for their perceived criticism of the church. In 1514 he left for [[Basel]] and worked at the [[University of Basel]] for several years.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion|volume=F-N|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopedicdict0000meag/page/1733 1733]|publisher=Corpus Publications|year=1979|isbn=978-0-9602572-1-8|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopedicdict0000meag/page/1733}}</ref>\n\nThe historian of the Renaissance [[John Rigby Hale|Sir John Hale]] cautions against too direct a linkage between Renaissance humanism and modern uses of the term humanism: \"Renaissance humanism must be kept free from any hint of either 'humanitarianism' or 'humanism' in its modern sense of rational, non-religious approach to life ... the word 'humanism' will mislead ... if it is seen in opposition to a Christianity its students in the main wished to supplement, not contradict, through their patient excavation of the sources of ancient God-inspired wisdom.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dJc3cOUVIYMC&q=contradict#search_anchor Hale, 171.] See also Davies, 479-480 for similar caution.</ref>\n\n==Humanists==\n{{main|List of Renaissance humanists}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Humanism}}\n* [[Renaissance humanism in Northern Europe]]\n* [[Christian humanism]]\n* [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance]]\n* [[Renaissance Latin]]\n* [[Legal humanists]]\n* [[New Learning]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bolgar, R.

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;
