The strike started on 21 January 1992. Around 1,600 staff at RTE from three unions (SIPTU, NUJ and ETU) had gone on strike over staffing levels at RTE. The dispute began on 21 January 1992 when two person camera crews were introduced without the agreement of the SIPTU union. For nearly four weeks, all live home produced programming on both RTE One and Network Two were axed, with RTE filling its schedules with already recorded home produced shows along with a large amount of imported new programming and archive programming from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, USA and Australia, along with many films.

The strike started on 21 January 1992. Around 1,600 staff at RTE from three unions (SIPTU, NUJ and ETU) had gone on strike over staffing levels at RTE. The dispute began on 21 January 1992 when two person camera crews were introduced without the agreement of the SIPTU union. For nearly four weeks, all live home produced programming on both RTE One and Network Two were axed, with RTE filling its schedules with already recorded home produced shows along with a large amount of imported new programming and archive programming from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, USA and Australia, along with many films. RTE News output on television was reduced to short news summaries. It ended on 17 February 1992 with a resolution reached between the unions and RTE management.<ref>https://stillslibrary.rte.ie/indexplus/image/2552/047.html</ref>\n\n===Debuts===\n====RT\u00c9 One====\n*18 January \u2013 {{flagicon|UK}} ''[[Barney (UK TV series)|Barney]]'' (1988\u20131989)\n*18 April \u2013 {{flagicon|UK}} ''[[Coconuts (TV series)|Coconuts]]'' (1990)\n*17 September \u2013 ''[[Prime Time (Irish TV programme)|Prime Time]]'' (1992\u2013present)\n*Undated \u2013 {{flagicon|UK}} ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]'' (1990-1995)\n\n====Network 2====\n*8 January \u2013 {{flagicon|USA}} ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' (1990\u20131996)\n*8 January \u2013 {{flagicon|USA}}/{{flagicon|CAN}} ''[[Beetlejuice (TV series)|Beetlejuice]]'' (1989\u20131991)\n*21 January \u2013 {{flagicon|NZ}} ''[[All for One (1990 TV series)|All for One]]'' (1990)\n*25 January \u2013 {{flagicon|USA}} ''[[Reasonable Doubts]]'' (1991\u20131993)\n*11 February \u2013 {{flagicon|UK}} ''[[Victor and Hugo]]'' (1991\u20131992)\n*21 February \u2013 {{flagicon|UK}} ''[[Fiddley Foodle Bird]]'' (1992)\n*9 March \u2013 {{flagicon|SPA}} ''[[Bobobobs]]'' (1988\u20131989)\n*30 March \u2013 {{flagicon|USA}} ''[[The Legend of Prince Valiant]]'' (1991\u20131993)\n*9 April \u2013 {{flagicon|UK}} ''[[Henry's Cat]]'' (1983\u20131993)\n*14 April \u2013 {{flagicon|USA}} ''[[James Bond Jr.]]'' (1991\u20131992)\n*24 April \u2013 {{flagicon|UK}}/{{flagicon|USA}} ''[[Captain Zed and the Zee Zone]]'' (1991\u20131993)\n*11 May \u2013 {{flagicon|UK}}/{{flagicon|USA}} ''[[Where's Waldo?

The series will be paired up with the 1940 film ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'' as part of the Sci-Fi block ''Back to the Future''. However seeing as ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'' won't be broadcast for the first two weeks, a double bill of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' will be shown instead to fill the hour slot. [[Spearhead from Space]] the very first serial of the [[Doctor Who (season 7)|seventh season]] and the first serial to star [[Jon Pertwee]] as the [[Third Doctor]] will be the very first ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial to be shown in Ireland.\n*15 October \u2013 ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the long running UK science fiction series will start at an earlier time of 6:31pm on [[TG4]]. It will be billed as running for an hour, followed by ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'' which ends at 8:00pm. The serial it will be showing is parts 1 and 2 of the second serial of [[Doctor Who (season 7)|Season 7]] [[Doctor Who and the Silurians]].\n\n===November===\n*4 November \u2013 The Broadcasting Bill is presented in the [[D\u00e1il]], addressing the emergence of digital media.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==Baptism of Fire==\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed their velocity of movement by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>{{Baumgartner, Richard A. (2007). Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==Baptism of Fire==\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed their velocity of movement by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.<ref name=\"NPS\"/>.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.
