He is best known for his two stints in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (later called WWE); the first between 1986 and 1992, and the second between 1995 and 1997. He wrestled in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in 1983, [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1992, and the [[Lucha libre|Mexico]]-based [[Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]] between 1993 and 1994 and again in 1997. He appeared in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] during the summer of 1997 and made appearances for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] from 2006 through 2008.\n\nThroughout his career, Roberts was known for his intense and cerebral [[List of professional wrestling terms#P|promos]], dark charisma, extensive use of psychology in his matches, and innovative use of the [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]] finishing move (which was later named the \"coolest\" maneuver of all time by WWE).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-51|title=The 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|work=WWE}}</ref> He often brought snakes into the ring, most famously a [[Python (genus)|python]]. He was one of the subjects of the 1999 documentary film ''[[Beyond the Mat]]''. In 2012, he moved in with fellow wrestler [[Diamond Dallas Page]] to seek help in getting his life back on track following years of alcohol and drug addiction. He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 5, 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nAurelian Jake Smith Jr.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gomez|first=Luis|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-jake-the-snake-roberts-wwf-unspoken-words-20150115-column.html|title=Interview: Get ready for story time with Jake 'The Snake' Roberts|date=January 15, 2015|accessdate=July 5, 2016|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> was born in [[Gainesville, Texas]], on May 30, 1955. His father, [[Grizzly Smith|Aurelian \"Grizzly\" Smith]] (1932\u20132010), was also a wrestler.

Roberts had trouble developing his character, so in the late 1970s he traveled to Canada to wrestle. While in [[Stampede Wrestling]], Roberts feuded with the [[Junkyard Dog]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6CbXzEgzZ0|title=Jim Ross Interviews \" Jake the Snake \u2013 Roberts \"|date=February 20, 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKxy6GJTTBQ|title=Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter \u2013 Ladder Match: Stampede, July, 1979|date=December 10, 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIt was in Georgia Championship Wrestling during 1983 that Roberts became part of [[Paul Ellering]]'s [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]], the [[The Road Warriors#History|Legion of Doom]], and began a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Ron Garvin]] over the [[NWA National Television Championship|NWA World Television Championship]] that lasted into 1984. In 1984, Roberts entered [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) joining up with [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|\"Gentleman\" Chris Adams]] and [[Gino Hernandez]] in their feud against the [[Von Erich family|Von Erichs]], winning the WCCW Television title and 6-Man Tag Team title (with Adams and Hernandez). Roberts returned to Mid-South Wrestling for 1985, ending his run there in February 1986 after a feud with [[Dick Slater]].\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n====Debut and championship pursuits (1986\u20131990)====\n[[File:Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts.jpg|thumb|right|Many of Roberts' storylines revolved around the use of his snake, Damien, seen here in the middle of the ring]]\nRoberts debuted in the World Wrestling Federation in March 1986. A month later, he made his [[pay-per-view]] debut, defeating [[George Wells (wrestler)|George Wells]] at [[WrestleMania 2]]. During the match, Roberts made Wells foam from the mouth when he wrapped his snake Damien around Wells's head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania2.html|title=WrestleMania 2: Caged Heat|publisher=Slam Wrestling|author=Powell, John|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts' first major feud was against [[Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], beginning on a nationally televised episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event VI]]'' in May 1986. Roberts executed the DDT on Steamboat on the exposed concrete floor right in front of his wife Bonnie and then proceeded to rest his snake Damien on top of a prone Steamboat. While [[Vince McMahon]] and booker [[George Scott (wrestler)|George Scott]] were adamant about wanting the DDT to take place on the floor, Roberts initially refused until Steamboat told him that he would be able to adequately protect himself from injury. Unfortunately, Steamboat was unable to stop his head from hitting the concrete and was rendered unconscious, sustaining a concussion.<ref name=WWF6389Book>{{cite book|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 1: WWF 1963 \u2013 1989|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1492825975}}</ref> After Steamboat's recovery, Steamboat introduced a \"[[Komodo dragon]]\" as his pet to combat the psychological effects of Roberts' snake. The feud continued with Steamboat winning most of the matches (losing only one because he threw Roberts back in the ring before the 10 count, while not beating the count himself), most notably a Snake Pit Match (ostensibly a no-DQ match) at ''[[The Big Event]]'' in [[Toronto]], and the rematch on the October 1986 edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XII]]''.\n\nRecognizing his microphone skills, Roberts was given his own talk segment called \"The Snake Pit\", which debuted on the first episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'' in late 1986. \"The Snake Pit\" was patterned after \"[[Piper's Pit]]\", wherein Roberts would conduct interviews with wrestlers or managers to help push wrestlers and get feuds over with the crowd. The segment was eventually moved to ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' (to replace \"Piper's Pit\" after [[Roddy Piper]]'s retirement following [[WrestleMania III]])<ref name=WWF6389Book/> until the final segment aired in July 1987.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia281\">{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/281 281]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|title-link=WWE Encyclopedia}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1986, Roberts began to enjoy an upsurge in fan popularity, despite the WWF's attempts to cast him as an unpopular villain. In November 1986, Roberts challenged Randy Savage for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. Before the match, announcer Vince McMahon said the fans would probably support Savage against the disliked Roberts. However, to the surprise of both McMahon and fellow broadcaster [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]], the fans cheered loudly for Roberts throughout the bout. The match ended in a double disqualification. Around the same time, the WWF had also tried to set Roberts up as a nemesis to then fan-favorite [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]]. However, after Roberts hit Hogan with a DDT during an episode of ''The Snake Pit'', fans responded positively to the attack by chanting \"DDT\" rather than for Hogan, and McMahon abandoned his plans for a feud between them. Years later in a 2015 shoot interview, Roberts jokingly thanked the fans for ruining what would have been the biggest (and most profitable) run of his career as at the time Hogan was the biggest and most popular babyface and a run against Hogan would have meant main event television and PPV matches.\n\nHe officially turned face when he feuded with [[The Honky Tonk Man]], an [[Elvis impersonator]], who attacked Roberts<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.domainmarket.com/buynow/wrestlinggonewrong.com|title=WrestlingGoneWrong.com is available at DomainMarket.com|website=WrestlingGoneWrong.com is available at DomainMarket.com|accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref> with a guitar during his interview segment ''The Snake Pit''.

The attack led to their match at WrestleMania III in which Roberts had [[Detroit]] native [[Alice Cooper]] (a known lover of snakes) in his corner. After Honky Tonk won the Intercontinental Championship from Ricky Steamboat, Roberts unsuccessfully challenged him for the Championship several times throughout the rest of 1987. The initial plan was for Roberts to win the Intercontinental Championship shortly after The Honky Tonk Man's win over Steamboat and begin an angle with [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]], but because of the injuries from the guitar shot, the decision was made to keep the belt with The Honky Tonk Man.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/wwe-10-things-need-know-jake-snake-roberts.php/7|title=WWE: 10 Things You Need To Know About Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts|website=WhatCulture.com|access-date=April 3, 2016|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe then had a feud with [[Rick Rude|Ravishing Rick Rude]] and his manager [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]], who began a gimmick of selecting a woman from the crowd to kiss after each match. On the April 23, 1988 edition of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling'', Rude chose Roberts' real-life wife Cheryl, who refused the kiss and revealed that she was in fact the wife of Jake \"The Snake\".<ref name=\"history699\">{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963\u20131989|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=699|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}</ref> After Rude began insulting Roberts, Cheryl slapped him, angering Rude before Roberts ran out for the save.<ref name=\"history699\"/> This began a heated feud throughout the summer of 1988, which escalated after Rude began wearing a pair of tights emblazoned with a visage of Mrs. Roberts, which an irate Roberts tore off.\n\n[[File:Jake Roberts and Andre.jpg|thumb|[[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] feuded with Roberts based on Andr\u00e9's fear of snakes]]\nRoberts moved from the feud with Rude into a feud with [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] who was also managed by Bobby Heenan. On the March 11, 1989, episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XX]]'', Andr\u00e9 got involved in a match between Rick Rude and [[Brutus Beefcake|Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake]], siding with fellow [[The Heenan Family|Heenan Family]] member Rude.

Instead of fighting for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]], the prize of the feud was DiBiase's own [[Million Dollar Championship|Million Dollar Belt]]. It was at this time that Roberts' problems with the discs in his back were publicly acknowledged, as DiBiase attacked Roberts after a victory over his bodyguard [[Mike Jones (wrestler)|Virgil]] on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]''. In the attack, Roberts was (storyline) injured by DiBiase and needed time off to have surgery to repair the damage. Roberts returned and feuded with DiBiase throughout the end of 1989 into 1990, including a point where Roberts stole DiBiase's Million Dollar Belt, daring him or Virgil to reach into the canvas sack where Damien was to retrieve it. The culmination of their feud took place at [[WrestleMania VI]] at the [[Skydome]] in Toronto, where in a match where the Million Dollar Belt was on the line, DiBiase gained a count-out victory over Roberts, thus regaining his non-sanctioned title. After the match, Roberts mounted an offensive against DiBiase and Virgil and then began giving away DiBiase's \"money\" including giving some money to actress [[Mary Tyler Moore]] who was seated at ringside.\n\nFollowing a brief feud with [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] in the summer of 1990, Roberts feuded with [[Rick Martel|Rick \"The Model\" Martel]] throughout late 1990 into early 1991, after Martel ([[kayfabe]]) blinded Roberts by spraying his cologne \"Arrogance\" into his eyes. Roberts went so far as to wear white contact lenses to \"prove\" his blindness. After several months, the feud culminated in a match at [[WrestleMania VII]], in which both contestants were blindfolded (though both Roberts and Martel did later confess to having some limited vision due to the lights in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]). The bout ended after Roberts was able to \"locate\" Martel and deliver a DDT.\n\n====Various feuds and departure (1991\u20131992)====\nIn early to mid-1991, Roberts engaged in a feud with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] who \"squashed\" Damien with a pair of [[professional wrestling attacks#Senton|Earthquake splashes]] during their match on the April 27 (taped March 26) edition of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Graham\n|last=Cawthon|title=Ring Results: 1991|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> In reality, Roberts' bag contained hamburger meat intended to look like a snake and a small mechanical device to depict movement.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/henry6.htm|first=Justin|last=Henry|date=January 2, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2016|title=The Dominance of a Natural Disaster}}</ref> The feud was advanced when, several weeks later, Earthquake appeared on ''WWF Prime Time Wrestling'' and served \"Quakeburgers\" to co-host [[Alfred Hayes (wrestler)|Lord Alfred Hayes]] and [[Vince McMahon]], later claiming that the meat was ground from Damien's carcass.<ref name=\"Wrestlecrap\">{{cite book | authors=[[RD Reynolds]] and Randy Baer | title=Wrestlecrap \u2013 the very worst of pro wrestling | publisher=ECW Press | year=2003 | isbn=1-55022-584-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre }}</ref> Roberts later introduced a new snake, Damien's \"big brother\" Lucifer.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|first=Michael|last=Moore|title=Collectible News: Action Figure Spotlight - 40-inch \"Damien\" snake|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_64264.shtml#.V4Anl7grLIV|date=August 14, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1991 there were a series of televised vignettes featuring the [[Warrior (wrestler)|Ultimate Warrior]] turning to Roberts for help in his feud with [[The Undertaker]]. In the set-up, Roberts explained to Warrior that, after passing three tests, he would have the \"knowledge of the dark side\" to defeat Undertaker. The segments included Warrior being locked inside a coffin (a reprise of an incident that occurred on ''The Funeral Parlor'', hosted by the Undertaker's manager, [[Paul Bearer]]; earlier in the year); the Warrior being \"buried alive\" in dirt before being abandoned; and Warrior walking through a room full of live snakes to reach a chest containing \"the answer\". During the latter segment, the Warrior opened the chest, only to be immediately bitten by a [[king cobra]] (actually a rubber prop). As Warrior \"weakened\" from the effects of the cobra's strike, Roberts was joined by The Undertaker and Paul Bearer, revealing the three were working together all along;<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre/page/70 70\u201371]|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55022-584-6|url=https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre/page/70}}</ref> Roberts closed the final segment by proclaiming, ''\"Never trust a snake\"'', turning Roberts [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] for the first time since 1987.<ref>{{cite book|title=Steel Chair to the Head|last=Sammond|first=Nicholas|pages=47\u201348|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8223-3438-5}}</ref> A series of matches were planned, but the feud was canceled after the Ultimate Warrior was fired by the WWF the night of [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam]].\n\nAfter SummerSlam, Roberts was placed in a feud with [[Randy Savage]]. During the post-SummerSlam wedding reception of Savage and [[Miss Elizabeth]] (in reality they had been married since 1984), Elizabeth opened a gift package containing a live cobra.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Sporting News|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/wwe/list/wwe-summerslam-best-moments-randy-savage-shawn-michaels-bret-hart-john-cena-brock-lesnar/8sknr46ybywb1vfpr0c19tmw3/slide/1|accessdate=July 5, 2010|title=Macho Man marries Elizabeth -- 1991|first=Brian|last=Fritz|date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> Roberts and the Undertaker attacked Savage, until [[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]] ran them off. A short feud with Sid ensued when Sid was scheduled to wrestle \"El Diablo\" and the Undertaker came out and accepted the challenge to face Sid. Paul Bearer offered \"El Diablo\" what appeared to be a bribe to walk away. As the match began, \"El Diablo\" came back to the ring and hit Sid. Then \"El Diablo\" unmasked revealing himself as Jake. Roberts proceeded to unleash a king cobra on Sid, until Hacksaw Jim Duggan intervened. Sid and Jake wrestled on ''Superstars'' a week later. But soon, Sid injured his biceps, which forced the feud to end.<ref name=WWF6389Book/>\n\nRoberts immediately began berating Randy Savage in a series of promos, aware that Savage \u2014 who had lost a retirement match to the Ultimate Warrior at Wrestlemania VII \u2014 was unable to exact revenge. During an October 21 taping for ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling'', Roberts goaded Savage into the ring and brutally attacked him, eventually tying Savage into the ropes and got the king cobra to bite his arm; the snake was devenomized and, according to Roberts' DVD ''Pick Your Poison'', he had trouble getting the cobra to release his bite. According to Roberts, on the day the angle was shot, he had to let the cobra bite him on his leg at Savage's request to convince him that the snake had been devenomized and Savage would regularly check on Roberts to make sure he had no side effects from the bite. The segment went on longer than planned, and Savage's blood was clearly visible as it dripped from the puncture wounds.\n\nWWF president [[Jack Tunney]] reinstated Savage as an active wrestler to get revenge for the attack. To explain the absence of the cobra, Tunney \"banned\" Roberts from ever bringing a snake to the ring again. Savage and Roberts feuded for the next few months. Their first match was at the [[This Tuesday in Texas|Tuesday in Texas]] [[pay-per-view]] on December 3 in San Antonio, Texas, which saw Savage earn a victory over Roberts and Roberts slap Miss Elizabeth. The feud continued through the early part of 1992 and included Savage eliminating Roberts from that year's [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]] match. The feud ended on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]'', with Savage getting the win. Roberts, livid at having lost to him and having received two of Savage's flying elbow drops (one of which after the match), was helped backstage. Enraged, he grabbed a steel chair and said that he was going to hit whoever came backstage first, whether it was Savage or Elizabeth. Just as Roberts was about to swing the chair, he was stopped by the Undertaker; Roberts was distracted long enough for Savage to hit him with the chair instead. That incident helped set up Roberts' feud with the Undertaker. Roberts appeared on ''The Funeral Parlor'' to demand answers from the Undertaker about why he stopped him from attacking Elizabeth. When Roberts was dissatisfied with the answers, he hit Bearer with a DDT and, after jamming Undertaker's hand in a coffin, began hitting him with a steel chair; however, Undertaker got up after each chair shot and eventually chased Roberts backstage dragging the coffin behind him. At [[WrestleMania VIII]], Roberts lost the match, [[Undefeated WrestleMania streak of The Undertaker|becoming the second man to lose to The Undertaker at WrestleMania]].<ref name=WWF6389Book/>\n\nThe WrestleMania VIII match turned out to be Roberts' last for the WWF for nearly four years. His departure came after he was upset that WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]] did not offer him a position on the writing staff, despite being promised such previously. After [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] stepped down from his post on the writing staff stemming from the recent sexual harassment scandal, McMahon decided that, out of respect for Patterson, the spot would be left vacant. Roberts felt he was not only being lied to, but also being betrayed. In response, he threatened to [[List of professional wrestling terms#N|no-show]] WrestleMania if he was not given a release from his contract. On his 'Pick Your Poison' DVD, Roberts expressed his regret for his actions to get a release from his contract.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1992)===\nRoberts went on to work for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) alongside his father, [[Grizzly Smith]], where he aligned himself with [[Sione Vailahi|The Barbarian]] and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] to feud against [[Steve Borden|Sting]] and [[Nikita Koloff]]. However, before he could officially join WCW, he had to wait 90 days. According to the ''Pick Your Poison'' DVD, Roberts had initially signed a lucrative contract under Kip Allen Frey, who was running WCW at the time. On the 87th day, Frey stepped down and was replaced by [[Bill Watts]], for whom Roberts had [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] with back in his days at [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]]. Ultimately, Roberts estimates that he went from making about $3.5 million a year to approximately $200,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://insidepulse.com/2010/03/01/the-smark-dvd-rant-for-jake-roberts-pick-your-poison/|title=The SmarK DVD Rant for Jake Roberts: Pick Your Poison {{!}} Inside Pulse|access-date=April 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts made his first television appearance on August 2, 1992 at a ''[[WCW Main Event|Main Event]]'' taping in Baltimore, Maryland after coming through the crowd to attack [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw92.htm|website=History of WCW|title=History of WCW|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> His first WCW match came six days later when he defeated [[Marcus Alexander Bagwell]] on a house show in Chicago, Illinois. He would quickly form an alliance with Cactus Jack and The Barbarian. His first major TV wrestling appearance for WCW was at ''[[Clash of the Champions XX]]'', where his team won a 4-man elimination tag match. Roberts scored a pinfall victory over Sting, which built their feud further. His single WCW [[pay-per-view]] match was against Sting at [[Halloween Havoc (1992)|Halloween Havoc]] in 1992. Their match was determined via the [[Professional wrestling match types#Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal|Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]].<ref name=mf229>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.229)</ref> There was a series of gimmick matches on the wheel, but because the wheel itself was not gimmicked, neither Roberts nor Sting knew the kind of match they would be wrestling until the wheel stopped spinning. When the wheel stopped, it had landed on what many observers believed was the worst option \u2014 the [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Coal Miner's Glove match]]. While Halloween Havoc was the company's top-selling PPV for several years,<ref name=mf229/> Roberts soon left WCW.\n\nFollowing the loss to Sting he continued his feud, facing him on several house shows immediately after the event. On the November 2 episode of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]]'', [[Tony Schiavone]] conducted a sit-down interview with Roberts regarding the decision of Bill Watts to ban his bringing of the snake to ringside, and his impending first round match against [[Dustin Rhodes]] in the first round of the King of Cable tournament. He was replaced in the tournament by [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]].\n\n=== Various promotions (1993\u20131994)===\nAfter leaving WCW, Roberts spent his next couple of years wrestling around the world. In February 1993, he took part in a tour in Australia. He won the [[American Wrestling Federation]] Heavyweight Title defeating [[Don Muraco]] on March 4. Then in April 1993, he toured Europe, particularly Austria and Germany. In September 1993, he took part wrestling a tour for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].\n\nRoberts debuted in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] promotion [[Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]] (AAA) in April 1993, causing the defeat of [[Konnan]] in the career vs. career match at [[Tripleman\u00eda I]]. Roberts' run-in started a feud that lasted until 1994 at [[Tripleman\u00eda II-C]], in which Konnan defeated Roberts in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|hair vs. hair match]].\n\nIn the spring of 1994, Roberts returned to the United States to wrestle for [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW). On May 2, he defeated [[Tony Anthony]] to win the [[SMW Heavyweight Championship]]; the title change aired on May 14. Roberts no-showed several defenses, forcing SMW to give the title back to Anthony on July 5. By the end of 1994, Roberts took a hiatus.\n\n===Return to WWF (1996\u20131997)===\n{{details|The Attitude Era}}\nAfter spending over a year in hiatus, Roberts returned to WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] in 1996, as a [[Bible]]-preacher.<ref name=mf229/> To go along with his new gimmick, his new Albino Burmese Python was named \"[[Book of Revelation|Revelations]].\" His gimmick also mirrored his real life, as Roberts had recently become a [[born-again Christian]] and had been preaching around the country.<ref name=mf229/>\n\n[[Image:Jake Roberts in 1996.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Roberts and [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] in 1996]]\nDuring his second tenure with the company, Roberts was pushed as a \"[[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] story\" and faced [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in the final match of the [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996]] [[King of the Ring tournament]]. Changes had to be made to the match's scripting as legitimate injuries sustained earlier in the evening in a match with [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] left Roberts unable to engage in the longer, more evenly matched bout originally intended between the men. In order to prevent Roberts from sustaining further injury, he was quickly defeated by Austin; in a post-match interview, Austin mocked his recital of the biblical passage [[John 3:16]] by saying ''\"You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! Talk about your [[Psalms]], talk about John 3:16... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!\"''.<ref name=mf229/> The [[catchphrase]] helped propel Austin to the top of the WWF, and is one of the moments that is often cited as the beginning of \"[[The Attitude Era]]\". Roberts next feuded with [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry \"The King\" Lawler]], who went to great lengths to ridicule Roberts' past [[alcoholism]].\n\nIn early 1997, the WWF wanted Roberts to wind down his in-ring career and to join the backstage side of the company. Since he still loved to wrestle, he did not make this transition well. This led to a relapse with drugs and alcohol. He appeared at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]] where he entered at no. 7 and was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. His last match with WWF was at ''Shotgun Saturday Night'' on January 25, 1997 against [[Salvatore Sincere]] in a winning effort. He was released in February 1997.\n\n===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997\u20131998)===\nDuring the summer of 1997, Roberts debuted in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]]. His introduction came towards the end of a match between Lawler and [[Tommy Dreamer]], which was the main event of the show. As the match went on, the arena lights were turned off. Moments later when the lights came back on, Roberts was already in the ring, and proceeded to give Tommy Dreamer a clothesline. He then went to the camera man and screamed; \"''Your God... he giveth, and he can taketh away. My God, he giveth... but he ain't got the balls to do nothin' else''.\" He promptly clotheslined Lawler, who fell onto Dreamer for a two count before exiting the ring.\n\nRoberts also teamed with [[Tommy Dreamer]] at the 1998 [[November to Remember]] as his mystery partner against [[Justin Credible]] and [[Jack Victory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Extreme Championship Wrestling Results (1998)|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw/1998.html|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Independent circuit (1999\u2013present)===\nIn October 1999, Roberts was one of several former NWA, WWF, and ECW wrestlers brought in to compete in the first ''[[Heroes of Wrestling]]'' event in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]]. He was booked to face [[Jim Neidhart]] in one half of the card's double main event in what was billed as a \"special grudge match\" between the two. Roberts was so intoxicated that during the course of the night, he slurred his way through a promo before the match and staggered to, from, and around the ring during his entrance. After doing such things as pretending his snake was a penis and stroking it like he was masturbating and attempting to kiss the snake with his tongue, the show's promoter sent [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]], who were supposed to compete in the other main event match, to the ring and made the main event a tag team match with Roberts teaming with Yokozuna against Bundy and Neidhart. Roberts, who was so drunk that he could not stand up, took the fall in the match after Bundy splashed and pinned him.\n\nIn 2001, Roberts moved to [[Great Britain]], where he began competing for Brian Dixon's [[All Star Wrestling]]. In December, he made his debut for [[Ricky Knight]]'s [[World Association of Wrestling]] in [[Lowestoft]]. On October 20, 2002, Roberts became the NWA UK Hammerlock Heavyweight Champion in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]], [[England]] by defeating \"Vigilante\" Johnny Moss. Moss regained the title the next night in [[Ashford, Kent]], though. In November 2002, Roberts started his own wrestling promotion in the UK, called \"Real Stars of Wrestling\". RSOW ran three events, each headlined by Roberts vs. The Honky Tonk Man.\n\nRoberts made his final British appearance at WAW's ''October Outrage'' show in Canvey Island, Essex, once again teaming with Steve Quintain against the [[UK Pitbulls]]. However, Roberts turned up at the show \"in no fit state to compete\", but went ahead with his match. Roberts cut a drunken promo paying tribute to [[Ray Traylor]], who had died a few days before, and almost got into a scuffle with several WAW wrestlers who were sent out to defuse the situation.<ref>{{Cite web|title = smackdown-raw-superstars-nxt \u2013 Jake Roberts|url = http://mohammadwwe.mihanblog.com/post/189|website = mohammadwwe.mihanblog.com|access-date = February 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts made an appearance at [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]]'s Houston-based [[Reality of Wrestling|Pro Wrestling Alliance]] (PWA) promotion, in which he cut a promo urging those who want to enter the wrestling business to not follow along his path. At one point, he said he loved the wrestling business more than anything else in the world. PWA wrestler \"Rockstar\" Robbie Gillmore then interrupted Roberts and attempted to make an alliance based upon the fact that Robbie wears an 80s style shirt featuring a cobra. Roberts had just said all he ever wanted was a little respect, and the Rockstar's interruption irritated him. Roberts then attacked Gillmore.\n\nOn October 6, 2007 he lost to [[Scott Hall]] at [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]].\n\nIn May 2009, Roberts joined the [[Jim Rose Circus]] for the ''Jim Rose Circus vs. Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts: The Legends Collide Tour''. Advertised as \"a grueling 40 city campaign\" containing pretty girls, wrestling, amazing circus stunts, and a fist fight, the tour features [[Jim Rose Circus|Jim Rose]] and wrestler [[Nick Cvjetkovich|Sinn Bodhi]] as \"Team Jake\".\n\nOn January 29, 2011, Roberts wrestled what was billed as his retirement match, when he defeated Sinn Bodhi at the [[Pro Wrestling Guerrilla]] (PWG) show during the [[WrestleReunion#WrestleReunion 5|WrestleReunion 5]] weekend.<ref name=WrestleReunion5>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_47214.shtml|title=1/29 PWG results in Los Angeles: Complete \"virtual-time\" coverage of PWG Title match, Kaval vs. Davey, Roberts retirement, Legends Battle Royal|last=Massingham|first=Matt|date=January 30, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2011|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref>\n\nOn May 18, 2013, Roberts returned to the ring for First State Championship Wrestling, a Delaware-based wrestling promotion, as part of an eight-man tag team main event. He teamed with Eric Chapel and CraziiWolf (Crazii Shea and Greywolf), defeating the team of [[Salvatore Sincere]], Steve C Wrestling and Pretty Ugly ([[James Ellsworth (wrestler)|Jimmy Dream]] and Adam Ugly).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/1cwwrestling/posts/1601622733396798|title=1CW results from 5/18/14|work=facebook.com}}</ref> On March 15, 2014, Roberts debuted in Regional Championship Wrestling's Rumblemania 9 in Reading, Pennsylvania as a surprise partner for Cliff Serenyi against Russian Mafia with Rich Rogers. This match ended in a DQ. Rogers was knocked out when Roberts stuck the snake in Roger's pants.\n\nOn June 14, 2014, Roberts participated in a six-man tag match in the main event for Reborn Wrestling (a Christian wrestling organization in Johnson City, Tennessee), teaming with The Stallion and Alex Cage to defeat [[EZ Money]], Reborn Champion Cody Ices and Anthony Brody.<ref>{{cite web|title=6/14 Reborn Wrestling: Jake Roberts and EZ Money meet in the six-man tag main event of a Christian based pro wrestling show|url=http://prowrestling.net/article.php?6-14-Reborn-Wrestling-Jake-Roberts-and-EZ-Money-meet-in-the-six-man-tag-main-event-of-a-Christian-based-pro-wrestling-show-37554|website=prowrestling.net|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> On June 15, 2014, Roberts was an entrant in the [[CWF Hollywood]] Red Carpet Rumble which was won by [[Willie Mack (wrestler)|Willie Mack]].\n[[File:Jake at CB Seminar.jpg|thumb|upright|Roberts talking at a wrestling seminar in 2016]]\nIn 2016, he went on his Unspoken Word tour.\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2006, 2008)===\nRoberts made an appearance on the October 19, 2006 episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]''.

Roberts warned Orton that facing The Undertaker, particularly at WrestleMania, could be a soul-altering experience; he then fell victim to Orton's \"RKO,\" helping to fuel Orton's \"Legend Killer\" [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]]. He worked with the company to create a [[DVD]] retrospective of his career (the aforementioned ''Pick Your Poison'' DVD), which was released later that year.\n\nIn 2013, Roberts announced his desire to return to WWE as a participant in the [[Royal Rumble (2014)|2014 Royal Rumble]].<ref name=resurrection/>\n\nOn January 6, 2014, Roberts made an appearance on the \"Old School\" episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', laying a python over the face of an unconscious [[Dean Ambrose]].<ref name=resurrection/> Notably, although Ambrose's onscreen character was unconscious, he himself was visibly attempting not to smile during the segment as Roberts had been his favorite wrestler during his childhood.

Once he reached the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in March 1986, Roberts would bring a live [[Burmese Python]] (though various snakes were used over the years, most were named \"Damien\") to ringside in a canvas bag. Other snakes used were a [[python reticulatus|Reticulated Python]] named Lucifer, an unnamed (de-venomized) [[Cobra]], and an albino Burmese Python named Revelations (during Roberts' Christian conversion gimmick in 1996). After executing a DDT for the pin, Roberts would coil the constrictor around the opponent's neck, and the snake would slither around on top of the fallen wrestler, sometimes appearing to strangle him.\n\nRoberts has been praised by his fellow wrestlers for his psychology in the ring.<ref name=resurrection/> [[Jim Ross]] has stated that Roberts stands out for not only his ring psychology, but also his promo work.<ref name=resurrection>{{cite video|title=The Resurrection of Jake the Snake|year=2015|people=Yu, Steve (director)|medium=Documentary|publisher=Slamdance}}</ref> [[Ted DiBiase]] has stated how much he enjoyed working with Roberts,<ref name=resurrection/> while [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] rated Roberts as the second best worker he worked with.

Throughout the film, he made confessions about his tragic past, including the murder of his sister by her husband's ex-wife and the collapse of his marriage. Amongst the more disturbing moments was Roberts reportedly smoking [[crack cocaine|crack]] in a hotel room after a reunion with his daughter Brandy, though the act is not shown on camera. In 2005, Roberts, along with others, heavily criticized the film for showing him in a negative light, complaining that the depiction of him was \"not the real Jake Roberts.\" Roberts also stated that director Barry Blaustein and [[Terry Funk]] lied to him about the aims of the film, telling him it was a [[television special]] on the effects of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nRoberts was featured in another wrestling documentary in 2015 entitled ''The Resurrection of Jake the Snake'', which chronicled his time living with [[Diamond Dallas Page]] beginning in October 2012.<ref name=resurrection/>\n\nRoberts appeared as Mr. Lucas, the owner of a gourmet condom company, in the comedy film, ''[[The Bet (2016 film)|The Bet]]'' which also featured Dallas Page and [[Roddy Piper]].\n\nRoberts also made an appearance in ''An Almost True Story: TOXIC TUTU'' in 2015, as himself, in a scene with [[Jonny Fairplay]] from ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''.\n\nRoberts has a role in the 2019 film ''[[The Peanut Butter Falcon]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Health issues===\nIn 2007, WWE started a policy of paying all expenses for its former performers who wanted to start [[drug rehabilitation]] programs.

American actor and [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] currently signed to [[All Elite Wrestling]] (AEW). He is best known for his two stints in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (later called WWE); the first between 1986 and 1992, and the second between 1995 and 1997. He wrestled in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] in 1983, [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1992, and the [[Lucha libre|Mexico]]-based [[Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]] between 1993 and 1994 and again in 1997. He appeared in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] during the summer of 1997 and made appearances for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] from 2006 through 2008.\n\nThroughout his career, Roberts was known for his intense and cerebral [[List of professional wrestling terms#P|promos]], dark charisma, extensive use of psychology in his matches, and innovative use of the [[DDT (professional wrestling)|DDT]] finishing move (which was later named the \"coolest\" maneuver of all time by WWE).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-51|title=The 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|work=WWE}}</ref> He often brought snakes into the ring, most famously a [[Python (genus)|python]]. He was one of the subjects of the 1999 documentary film ''[[Beyond the Mat]]''. In 2012, he moved in with fellow wrestler [[Diamond Dallas Page]] to seek help in getting his life back on track following years of alcohol and drug addiction. He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 5, 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nAurelian Jake Smith Jr.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gomez|first=Luis|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-jake-the-snake-roberts-wwf-unspoken-words-20150115-column.html|title=Interview: Get ready for story time with Jake 'The Snake' Roberts|date=January 15, 2015|accessdate=July 5, 2016|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> was born in [[Gainesville, Texas]], on May 30, 1955. His father, [[Grizzly Smith|Aurelian \"Grizzly\" Smith]] (1932\u20132010), was also a wrestler. Roberts had a strained relationship with his father,<ref name=resurrection/> and claims that he was sexually and physically abused by his stepmother during his childhood.<ref name=resurrection/> He has a half-brother, [[Michael Smith (wrestler)|Michael Smith]], and a half-sister, [[Robin Smith (wrestler)|Robin Smith]], both of whom also became wrestlers. During the late 1980s, all three wrestled at the same time for the WWF (now [[WWE]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2009/12/07/12065306.html|title=Family matters in pro wrestling|author=Van Der Griend, Blaine|publisher=SLAM!

Roberts had trouble developing his character, so in the late 1970s he traveled to Canada to wrestle. While in [[Stampede Wrestling]], Roberts feuded with the [[Junkyard Dog]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6CbXzEgzZ0|title=Jim Ross Interviews \" Jake the Snake \u2013 Roberts \"|date=February 20, 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKxy6GJTTBQ|title=Jake Roberts vs. Big Daddy Ritter \u2013 Ladder Match: Stampede, July, 1979|date=December 10, 2012|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIt was in Georgia Championship Wrestling during 1983 that Roberts became part of [[Paul Ellering]]'s [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|stable]], the [[The Road Warriors#History|Legion of Doom]], and began a [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Ron Garvin]] over the [[NWA National Television Championship|NWA World Television Championship]] that lasted into 1984. In 1984, Roberts entered [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW) joining up with [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|\"Gentleman\" Chris Adams]] and [[Gino Hernandez]] in their feud against the [[Von Erich family|Von Erichs]], winning the WCCW Television title and 6-Man Tag Team title (with Adams and Hernandez). Roberts returned to Mid-South Wrestling for 1985, ending his run there in February 1986 after a feud with [[Dick Slater]].\n\n===World Wrestling Federation===\n====Debut and championship pursuits (1986\u20131990)====\n[[File:Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts.jpg|thumb|right|Many of Roberts' storylines revolved around the use of his snake, Damien, seen here in the middle of the ring]]\nRoberts debuted in the World Wrestling Federation in March 1986. A month later, he made his [[pay-per-view]] debut, defeating [[George Wells (wrestler)|George Wells]] at [[WrestleMania 2]]. During the match, Roberts made Wells foam from the mouth when he wrapped his snake Damien around Wells's head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania2.html|title=WrestleMania 2: Caged Heat|publisher=Slam Wrestling|author=Powell, John|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts' first major feud was against [[Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], beginning on a nationally televised episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event VI]]'' in May 1986. Roberts executed the DDT on Steamboat on the exposed concrete floor right in front of his wife Bonnie and then proceeded to rest his snake Damien on top of a prone Steamboat. While [[Vince McMahon]] and booker [[George Scott (wrestler)|George Scott]] were adamant about wanting the DDT to take place on the floor, Roberts initially refused until Steamboat told him that he would be able to adequately protect himself from injury. Unfortunately, Steamboat was unable to stop his head from hitting the concrete and was rendered unconscious, sustaining a concussion.<ref name=WWF6389Book>{{cite book|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 1: WWF 1963 \u2013 1989|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1492825975}}</ref> After Steamboat's recovery, Steamboat introduced a \"[[Komodo dragon]]\" as his pet to combat the psychological effects of Roberts' snake. The feud continued with Steamboat winning most of the matches (losing only one because he threw Roberts back in the ring before the 10 count, while not beating the count himself), most notably a Snake Pit Match (ostensibly a no-DQ match) at ''[[The Big Event]]'' in [[Toronto]], and the rematch on the October 1986 edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XII]]''.\n\nRecognizing his microphone skills, Roberts was given his own talk segment called \"The Snake Pit\", which debuted on the first episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'' in late 1986. \"The Snake Pit\" was patterned after \"[[Piper's Pit]]\", wherein Roberts would conduct interviews with wrestlers or managers to help push wrestlers and get feuds over with the crowd. The segment was eventually moved to ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' (to replace \"Piper's Pit\" after [[Roddy Piper]]'s retirement following [[WrestleMania III]])<ref name=WWF6389Book/> until the final segment aired in July 1987.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia281\">{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/281 281]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|title-link=WWE Encyclopedia}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1986, Roberts began to enjoy an upsurge in fan popularity, despite the WWF's attempts to cast him as an unpopular villain. In November 1986, Roberts challenged Randy Savage for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. Before the match, announcer Vince McMahon said the fans would probably support Savage against the disliked Roberts. However, to the surprise of both McMahon and fellow broadcaster [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]], the fans cheered loudly for Roberts throughout the bout. The match ended in a double disqualification. Around the same time, the WWF had also tried to set Roberts up as a nemesis to then fan-favorite [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]]. However, after Roberts hit Hogan with a DDT during an episode of ''The Snake Pit'', fans responded positively to the attack by chanting \"DDT\" rather than for Hogan, and McMahon abandoned his plans for a feud between them. Years later in a 2015 shoot interview, Roberts jokingly thanked the fans for ruining what would have been the biggest (and most profitable) run of his career as at the time Hogan was the biggest and most popular babyface and a run against Hogan would have meant main event television and PPV matches.\n\nHe officially turned face when he feuded with [[The Honky Tonk Man]], an [[Elvis impersonator]], who attacked Roberts<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.domainmarket.com/buynow/wrestlinggonewrong.com|title=WrestlingGoneWrong.com is available at DomainMarket.com|website=WrestlingGoneWrong.com is available at DomainMarket.com|accessdate=December 19, 2019}}</ref> with a guitar during his interview segment ''The Snake Pit''. The Honky Tonk Man's guitar shot actually injured Roberts' neck, as at the time guitars were not prepared to break easily.<ref name=mf228>{{cite book|title=Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks|last=Foley|first=Mick|page=[https://archive.org/details/mankindhaveniced00fole/page/228 228]|publisher=[[ReganBooks]]|year=1999|isbn=978-0-06-039299-4|url=https://archive.org/details/mankindhaveniced00fole|url-access=registration}}</ref> The Honky Tonk Man denies that he purposefully injured Roberts, although Honky's manager [[Jimmy Hart]], as well as a video of the incident (seen on the ''Pick Your Poison'' DVD) suggests otherwise with Roberts later claiming that he was picking pieces of wood out of his back for weeks after. The attack led to their match at WrestleMania III in which Roberts had [[Detroit]] native [[Alice Cooper]] (a known lover of snakes) in his corner. After Honky Tonk won the Intercontinental Championship from Ricky Steamboat, Roberts unsuccessfully challenged him for the Championship several times throughout the rest of 1987. The initial plan was for Roberts to win the Intercontinental Championship shortly after The Honky Tonk Man's win over Steamboat and begin an angle with [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]], but because of the injuries from the guitar shot, the decision was made to keep the belt with The Honky Tonk Man.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/wwe/wwe-10-things-need-know-jake-snake-roberts.php/7|title=WWE: 10 Things You Need To Know About Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts|website=WhatCulture.com|access-date=April 3, 2016|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe then had a feud with [[Rick Rude|Ravishing Rick Rude]] and his manager [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]], who began a gimmick of selecting a woman from the crowd to kiss after each match. On the April 23, 1988 edition of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling'', Rude chose Roberts' real-life wife Cheryl, who refused the kiss and revealed that she was in fact the wife of Jake \"The Snake\".<ref name=\"history699\">{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963\u20131989|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=699|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}</ref> After Rude began insulting Roberts, Cheryl slapped him, angering Rude before Roberts ran out for the save.<ref name=\"history699\"/> This began a heated feud throughout the summer of 1988, which escalated after Rude began wearing a pair of tights emblazoned with a visage of Mrs. Roberts, which an irate Roberts tore off.\n\n[[File:Jake Roberts and Andre.jpg|thumb|[[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] feuded with Roberts based on Andr\u00e9's fear of snakes]]\nRoberts moved from the feud with Rude into a feud with [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] who was also managed by Bobby Heenan. On the March 11, 1989, episode of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XX]]'', Andr\u00e9 got involved in a match between Rick Rude and [[Brutus Beefcake|Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake]], siding with fellow [[The Heenan Family|Heenan Family]] member Rude. Roberts came to the ring to help Beefcake, who eventually won by disqualification.<ref>{{cite book|page=279|title=Andre the Giant: A Legendary Life|first=Michael|last=Krugman|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2009|isbn=978-1439188132}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Saturday Night's Main Event|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/snme.htm|accessdate=July 5, 2016}}</ref> Roberts used his snake Damien to scare Andre into an eventual \"[[heart attack]].\"<!--This appears to have been in January--the SNME interference was taped in February and broadcast in March--> Although the subsequent feud on the house show circuit saw Andr\u00e9 victorious after most of those matches, Roberts can claim a victory via disqualification over Andr\u00e9 after The Giant attacked special guest referee and former foe [[Big John Studd]] at [[WrestleMania V]].\n\nShortly after his feud with Andr\u00e9 had ended, Roberts entered into a feud with Ted DiBiase. Instead of fighting for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]], the prize of the feud was DiBiase's own [[Million Dollar Championship|Million Dollar Belt]]. It was at this time that Roberts' problems with the discs in his back were publicly acknowledged, as DiBiase attacked Roberts after a victory over his bodyguard [[Mike Jones (wrestler)|Virgil]] on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]''. In the attack, Roberts was (storyline) injured by DiBiase and needed time off to have surgery to repair the damage. Roberts returned and feuded with DiBiase throughout the end of 1989 into 1990, including a point where Roberts stole DiBiase's Million Dollar Belt, daring him or Virgil to reach into the canvas sack where Damien was to retrieve it. The culmination of their feud took place at [[WrestleMania VI]] at the [[Skydome]] in Toronto, where in a match where the Million Dollar Belt was on the line, DiBiase gained a count-out victory over Roberts, thus regaining his non-sanctioned title. After the match, Roberts mounted an offensive against DiBiase and Virgil and then began giving away DiBiase's \"money\" including giving some money to actress [[Mary Tyler Moore]] who was seated at ringside.\n\nFollowing a brief feud with [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] in the summer of 1990, Roberts feuded with [[Rick Martel|Rick \"The Model\" Martel]] throughout late 1990 into early 1991, after Martel ([[kayfabe]]) blinded Roberts by spraying his cologne \"Arrogance\" into his eyes. Roberts went so far as to wear white contact lenses to \"prove\" his blindness. After several months, the feud culminated in a match at [[WrestleMania VII]], in which both contestants were blindfolded (though both Roberts and Martel did later confess to having some limited vision due to the lights in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]). The bout ended after Roberts was able to \"locate\" Martel and deliver a DDT.\n\n====Various feuds and departure (1991\u20131992)====\nIn early to mid-1991, Roberts engaged in a feud with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] who \"squashed\" Damien with a pair of [[professional wrestling attacks#Senton|Earthquake splashes]] during their match on the April 27 (taped March 26) edition of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Graham\n|last=Cawthon|title=Ring Results: 1991|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> In reality, Roberts' bag contained hamburger meat intended to look like a snake and a small mechanical device to depict movement.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The History of WWE|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/henry6.htm|first=Justin|last=Henry|date=January 2, 2015|accessdate=July 7, 2016|title=The Dominance of a Natural Disaster}}</ref> The feud was advanced when, several weeks later, Earthquake appeared on ''WWF Prime Time Wrestling'' and served \"Quakeburgers\" to co-host [[Alfred Hayes (wrestler)|Lord Alfred Hayes]] and [[Vince McMahon]], later claiming that the meat was ground from Damien's carcass.<ref name=\"Wrestlecrap\">{{cite book | authors=[[RD Reynolds]] and Randy Baer | title=Wrestlecrap \u2013 the very worst of pro wrestling | publisher=ECW Press | year=2003 | isbn=1-55022-584-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre }}</ref> Roberts later introduced a new snake, Damien's \"big brother\" Lucifer.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|first=Michael|last=Moore|title=Collectible News: Action Figure Spotlight - 40-inch \"Damien\" snake|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/The_Specialists_34/article_64264.shtml#.V4Anl7grLIV|date=August 14, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1991 there were a series of televised vignettes featuring the [[Warrior (wrestler)|Ultimate Warrior]] turning to Roberts for help in his feud with [[The Undertaker]]. In the set-up, Roberts explained to Warrior that, after passing three tests, he would have the \"knowledge of the dark side\" to defeat Undertaker. The segments included Warrior being locked inside a coffin (a reprise of an incident that occurred on ''The Funeral Parlor'', hosted by the Undertaker's manager, [[Paul Bearer]]; earlier in the year); the Warrior being \"buried alive\" in dirt before being abandoned; and Warrior walking through a room full of live snakes to reach a chest containing \"the answer\". During the latter segment, the Warrior opened the chest, only to be immediately bitten by a [[king cobra]] (actually a rubber prop). As Warrior \"weakened\" from the effects of the cobra's strike, Roberts was joined by The Undertaker and Paul Bearer, revealing the three were working together all along;<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre/page/70 70\u201371]|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55022-584-6|url=https://archive.org/details/wrestlecrapveryw00rdre/page/70}}</ref> Roberts closed the final segment by proclaiming, ''\"Never trust a snake\"'', turning Roberts [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] for the first time since 1987.<ref>{{cite book|title=Steel Chair to the Head|last=Sammond|first=Nicholas|pages=47\u201348|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8223-3438-5}}</ref> A series of matches were planned, but the feud was canceled after the Ultimate Warrior was fired by the WWF the night of [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam]].\n\nAfter SummerSlam, Roberts was placed in a feud with [[Randy Savage]]. During the post-SummerSlam wedding reception of Savage and [[Miss Elizabeth]] (in reality they had been married since 1984), Elizabeth opened a gift package containing a live cobra.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Sporting News|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/wwe/list/wwe-summerslam-best-moments-randy-savage-shawn-michaels-bret-hart-john-cena-brock-lesnar/8sknr46ybywb1vfpr0c19tmw3/slide/1|accessdate=July 5, 2010|title=Macho Man marries Elizabeth -- 1991|first=Brian|last=Fritz|date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> Roberts and the Undertaker attacked Savage, until [[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]] ran them off. A short feud with Sid ensued when Sid was scheduled to wrestle \"El Diablo\" and the Undertaker came out and accepted the challenge to face Sid. Paul Bearer offered \"El Diablo\" what appeared to be a bribe to walk away. As the match began, \"El Diablo\" came back to the ring and hit Sid. Then \"El Diablo\" unmasked revealing himself as Jake. Roberts proceeded to unleash a king cobra on Sid, until Hacksaw Jim Duggan intervened. Sid and Jake wrestled on ''Superstars'' a week later. But soon, Sid injured his biceps, which forced the feud to end.<ref name=WWF6389Book/>\n\nRoberts immediately began berating Randy Savage in a series of promos, aware that Savage \u2014 who had lost a retirement match to the Ultimate Warrior at Wrestlemania VII \u2014 was unable to exact revenge. During an October 21 taping for ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling'', Roberts goaded Savage into the ring and brutally attacked him, eventually tying Savage into the ropes and got the king cobra to bite his arm; the snake was devenomized and, according to Roberts' DVD ''Pick Your Poison'', he had trouble getting the cobra to release his bite. According to Roberts, on the day the angle was shot, he had to let the cobra bite him on his leg at Savage's request to convince him that the snake had been devenomized and Savage would regularly check on Roberts to make sure he had no side effects from the bite. The segment went on longer than planned, and Savage's blood was clearly visible as it dripped from the puncture wounds.\n\nWWF president [[Jack Tunney]] reinstated Savage as an active wrestler to get revenge for the attack. To explain the absence of the cobra, Tunney \"banned\" Roberts from ever bringing a snake to the ring again. Savage and Roberts feuded for the next few months. Their first match was at the [[This Tuesday in Texas|Tuesday in Texas]] [[pay-per-view]] on December 3 in San Antonio, Texas, which saw Savage earn a victory over Roberts and Roberts slap Miss Elizabeth. The feud continued through the early part of 1992 and included Savage eliminating Roberts from that year's [[Royal Rumble (1992)|Royal Rumble]] match. The feud ended on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]'', with Savage getting the win. Roberts, livid at having lost to him and having received two of Savage's flying elbow drops (one of which after the match), was helped backstage. Enraged, he grabbed a steel chair and said that he was going to hit whoever came backstage first, whether it was Savage or Elizabeth. Just as Roberts was about to swing the chair, he was stopped by the Undertaker; Roberts was distracted long enough for Savage to hit him with the chair instead. That incident helped set up Roberts' feud with the Undertaker. Roberts appeared on ''The Funeral Parlor'' to demand answers from the Undertaker about why he stopped him from attacking Elizabeth. When Roberts was dissatisfied with the answers, he hit Bearer with a DDT and, after jamming Undertaker's hand in a coffin, began hitting him with a steel chair; however, Undertaker got up after each chair shot and eventually chased Roberts backstage dragging the coffin behind him. At [[WrestleMania VIII]], Roberts lost the match, [[Undefeated WrestleMania streak of The Undertaker|becoming the second man to lose to The Undertaker at WrestleMania]].<ref name=WWF6389Book/>\n\nThe WrestleMania VIII match turned out to be Roberts' last for the WWF for nearly four years. His departure came after he was upset that WWF chairman [[Vince McMahon]] did not offer him a position on the writing staff, despite being promised such previously. After [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] stepped down from his post on the writing staff stemming from the recent sexual harassment scandal, McMahon decided that, out of respect for Patterson, the spot would be left vacant. Roberts felt he was not only being lied to, but also being betrayed. In response, he threatened to [[List of professional wrestling terms#N|no-show]] WrestleMania if he was not given a release from his contract. On his 'Pick Your Poison' DVD, Roberts expressed his regret for his actions to get a release from his contract.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1992)===\nRoberts went on to work for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) alongside his father, [[Grizzly Smith]], where he aligned himself with [[Sione Vailahi|The Barbarian]] and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] to feud against [[Steve Borden|Sting]] and [[Nikita Koloff]]. However, before he could officially join WCW, he had to wait 90 days. According to the ''Pick Your Poison'' DVD, Roberts had initially signed a lucrative contract under Kip Allen Frey, who was running WCW at the time. On the 87th day, Frey stepped down and was replaced by [[Bill Watts]], for whom Roberts had [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]] with back in his days at [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]]. Ultimately, Roberts estimates that he went from making about $3.5 million a year to approximately $200,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://insidepulse.com/2010/03/01/the-smark-dvd-rant-for-jake-roberts-pick-your-poison/|title=The SmarK DVD Rant for Jake Roberts: Pick Your Poison {{!}} Inside Pulse|access-date=April 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts made his first television appearance on August 2, 1992 at a ''[[WCW Main Event|Main Event]]'' taping in Baltimore, Maryland after coming through the crowd to attack [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw92.htm|website=History of WCW|title=History of WCW|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> His first WCW match came six days later when he defeated [[Marcus Alexander Bagwell]] on a house show in Chicago, Illinois. He would quickly form an alliance with Cactus Jack and The Barbarian. His first major TV wrestling appearance for WCW was at ''[[Clash of the Champions XX]]'', where his team won a 4-man elimination tag match. Roberts scored a pinfall victory over Sting, which built their feud further. His single WCW [[pay-per-view]] match was against Sting at [[Halloween Havoc (1992)|Halloween Havoc]] in 1992. Their match was determined via the [[Professional wrestling match types#Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal|Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]].<ref name=mf229>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.229)</ref> There was a series of gimmick matches on the wheel, but because the wheel itself was not gimmicked, neither Roberts nor Sting knew the kind of match they would be wrestling until the wheel stopped spinning. When the wheel stopped, it had landed on what many observers believed was the worst option \u2014 the [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Coal Miner's Glove match]]. While Halloween Havoc was the company's top-selling PPV for several years,<ref name=mf229/> Roberts soon left WCW.\n\nFollowing the loss to Sting he continued his feud, facing him on several house shows immediately after the event. On the November 2 episode of ''[[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]]'', [[Tony Schiavone]] conducted a sit-down interview with Roberts regarding the decision of Bill Watts to ban his bringing of the snake to ringside, and his impending first round match against [[Dustin Rhodes]] in the first round of the King of Cable tournament. He was replaced in the tournament by [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]].\n\n=== Various promotions (1993\u20131994)===\nAfter leaving WCW, Roberts spent his next couple of years wrestling around the world. In February 1993, he took part in a tour in Australia. He won the [[American Wrestling Federation]] Heavyweight Title defeating [[Don Muraco]] on March 4. Then in April 1993, he toured Europe, particularly Austria and Germany. In September 1993, he took part wrestling a tour for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].\n\nRoberts debuted in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] promotion [[Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n]] (AAA) in April 1993, causing the defeat of [[Konnan]] in the career vs. career match at [[Tripleman\u00eda I]]. Roberts' run-in started a feud that lasted until 1994 at [[Tripleman\u00eda II-C]], in which Konnan defeated Roberts in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|hair vs. hair match]].\n\nIn the spring of 1994, Roberts returned to the United States to wrestle for [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW). On May 2, he defeated [[Tony Anthony]] to win the [[SMW Heavyweight Championship]]; the title change aired on May 14. Roberts no-showed several defenses, forcing SMW to give the title back to Anthony on July 5. By the end of 1994, Roberts took a hiatus.\n\n===Return to WWF (1996\u20131997)===\n{{details|The Attitude Era}}\nAfter spending over a year in hiatus, Roberts returned to WWF at the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] in 1996, as a [[Bible]]-preacher.<ref name=mf229/> To go along with his new gimmick, his new Albino Burmese Python was named \"[[Book of Revelation|Revelations]].\" His gimmick also mirrored his real life, as Roberts had recently become a [[born-again Christian]] and had been preaching around the country.<ref name=mf229/>\n\n[[Image:Jake Roberts in 1996.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Roberts and [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] in 1996]]\nDuring his second tenure with the company, Roberts was pushed as a \"[[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] story\" and faced [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in the final match of the [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996]] [[King of the Ring tournament]]. Changes had to be made to the match's scripting as legitimate injuries sustained earlier in the evening in a match with [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] left Roberts unable to engage in the longer, more evenly matched bout originally intended between the men. In order to prevent Roberts from sustaining further injury, he was quickly defeated by Austin; in a post-match interview, Austin mocked his recital of the biblical passage [[John 3:16]] by saying ''\"You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! Talk about your [[Psalms]], talk about John 3:16... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!\"''.<ref name=mf229/> The [[catchphrase]] helped propel Austin to the top of the WWF, and is one of the moments that is often cited as the beginning of \"[[The Attitude Era]]\". Roberts next feuded with [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry \"The King\" Lawler]], who went to great lengths to ridicule Roberts' past [[alcoholism]].\n\nIn early 1997, the WWF wanted Roberts to wind down his in-ring career and to join the backstage side of the company. Since he still loved to wrestle, he did not make this transition well. This led to a relapse with drugs and alcohol. He appeared at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|1997 Royal Rumble]] where he entered at no. 7 and was eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. His last match with WWF was at ''Shotgun Saturday Night'' on January 25, 1997 against [[Salvatore Sincere]] in a winning effort. He was released in February 1997.\n\n===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997\u20131998)===\nDuring the summer of 1997, Roberts debuted in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]]. His introduction came towards the end of a match between Lawler and [[Tommy Dreamer]], which was the main event of the show. As the match went on, the arena lights were turned off. Moments later when the lights came back on, Roberts was already in the ring, and proceeded to give Tommy Dreamer a clothesline. He then went to the camera man and screamed; \"''Your God... he giveth, and he can taketh away. My God, he giveth... but he ain't got the balls to do nothin' else''.\" He promptly clotheslined Lawler, who fell onto Dreamer for a two count before exiting the ring.\n\nRoberts also teamed with [[Tommy Dreamer]] at the 1998 [[November to Remember]] as his mystery partner against [[Justin Credible]] and [[Jack Victory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Extreme Championship Wrestling Results (1998)|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/ecw/1998.html|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Independent circuit (1999\u2013present)===\nIn October 1999, Roberts was one of several former NWA, WWF, and ECW wrestlers brought in to compete in the first ''[[Heroes of Wrestling]]'' event in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi]]. He was booked to face [[Jim Neidhart]] in one half of the card's double main event in what was billed as a \"special grudge match\" between the two. Roberts was so intoxicated that during the course of the night, he slurred his way through a promo before the match and staggered to, from, and around the ring during his entrance. After doing such things as pretending his snake was a penis and stroking it like he was masturbating and attempting to kiss the snake with his tongue, the show's promoter sent [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]], who were supposed to compete in the other main event match, to the ring and made the main event a tag team match with Roberts teaming with Yokozuna against Bundy and Neidhart. Roberts, who was so drunk that he could not stand up, took the fall in the match after Bundy splashed and pinned him.\n\nIn 2001, Roberts moved to [[Great Britain]], where he began competing for Brian Dixon's [[All Star Wrestling]]. In December, he made his debut for [[Ricky Knight]]'s [[World Association of Wrestling]] in [[Lowestoft]]. On October 20, 2002, Roberts became the NWA UK Hammerlock Heavyweight Champion in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]], [[England]] by defeating \"Vigilante\" Johnny Moss. Moss regained the title the next night in [[Ashford, Kent]], though. In November 2002, Roberts started his own wrestling promotion in the UK, called \"Real Stars of Wrestling\". RSOW ran three events, each headlined by Roberts vs. The Honky Tonk Man.\n\nRoberts made his final British appearance at WAW's ''October Outrage'' show in Canvey Island, Essex, once again teaming with Steve Quintain against the [[UK Pitbulls]]. However, Roberts turned up at the show \"in no fit state to compete\", but went ahead with his match. Roberts cut a drunken promo paying tribute to [[Ray Traylor]], who had died a few days before, and almost got into a scuffle with several WAW wrestlers who were sent out to defuse the situation.<ref>{{Cite web|title = smackdown-raw-superstars-nxt \u2013 Jake Roberts|url = http://mohammadwwe.mihanblog.com/post/189|website = mohammadwwe.mihanblog.com|access-date = February 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoberts made an appearance at [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]]'s Houston-based [[Reality of Wrestling|Pro Wrestling Alliance]] (PWA) promotion, in which he cut a promo urging those who want to enter the wrestling business to not follow along his path. At one point, he said he loved the wrestling business more than anything else in the world. PWA wrestler \"Rockstar\" Robbie Gillmore then interrupted Roberts and attempted to make an alliance based upon the fact that Robbie wears an 80s style shirt featuring a cobra. Roberts had just said all he ever wanted was a little respect, and the Rockstar's interruption irritated him. Roberts then attacked Gillmore.\n\nOn October 6, 2007 he lost to [[Scott Hall]] at [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]].\n\nIn May 2009, Roberts joined the [[Jim Rose Circus]] for the ''Jim Rose Circus vs. Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts: The Legends Collide Tour''. Advertised as \"a grueling 40 city campaign\" containing pretty girls, wrestling, amazing circus stunts, and a fist fight, the tour features [[Jim Rose Circus|Jim Rose]] and wrestler [[Nick Cvjetkovich|Sinn Bodhi]] as \"Team Jake\".\n\nOn January 29, 2011, Roberts wrestled what was billed as his retirement match, when he defeated Sinn Bodhi at the [[Pro Wrestling Guerrilla]] (PWG) show during the [[WrestleReunion#WrestleReunion 5|WrestleReunion 5]] weekend.<ref name=WrestleReunion5>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Arena_Reports_10/article_47214.shtml|title=1/29 PWG results in Los Angeles: Complete \"virtual-time\" coverage of PWG Title match, Kaval vs. Davey, Roberts retirement, Legends Battle Royal|last=Massingham|first=Matt|date=January 30, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2011|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref>\n\nOn May 18, 2013, Roberts returned to the ring for First State Championship Wrestling, a Delaware-based wrestling promotion, as part of an eight-man tag team main event.

This match ended in a DQ. Rogers was knocked out when Roberts stuck the snake in Roger's pants.\n\nOn June 14, 2014, Roberts participated in a six-man tag match in the main event for Reborn Wrestling (a Christian wrestling organization in Johnson City, Tennessee), teaming with The Stallion and Alex Cage to defeat [[EZ Money]], Reborn Champion Cody Ices and Anthony Brody.<ref>{{cite web|title=6/14 Reborn Wrestling: Jake Roberts and EZ Money meet in the six-man tag main event of a Christian based pro wrestling show|url=http://prowrestling.net/article.php?6-14-Reborn-Wrestling-Jake-Roberts-and-EZ-Money-meet-in-the-six-man-tag-main-event-of-a-Christian-based-pro-wrestling-show-37554|website=prowrestling.net|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> On June 15, 2014, Roberts was an entrant in the [[CWF Hollywood]] Red Carpet Rumble which was won by [[Willie Mack (wrestler)|Willie Mack]].\n[[File:Jake at CB Seminar.jpg|thumb|upright|Roberts talking at a wrestling seminar in 2016]]\nIn 2016, he went on his Unspoken Word tour.\n\n===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2006, 2008)===\nRoberts made an appearance on the October 19, 2006 episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]''.

Other snakes used were a [[python reticulatus|Reticulated Python]] named Lucifer, an unnamed (de-venomized) [[Cobra]], and an albino Burmese Python named Revelations (during Roberts' Christian conversion gimmick in 1996). After executing a DDT for the pin, Roberts would coil the constrictor around the opponent's neck, and the snake would slither around on top of the fallen wrestler, sometimes appearing to strangle him.\n\nRoberts has been praised by his fellow wrestlers for his psychology in the ring.<ref name=resurrection/> [[Jim Ross]] has stated that Roberts stands out for not only his ring psychology, but also his promo work.<ref name=resurrection>{{cite video|title=The Resurrection of Jake the Snake|year=2015|people=Yu, Steve (director)|medium=Documentary|publisher=Slamdance}}</ref> [[Ted DiBiase]] has stated how much he enjoyed working with Roberts,<ref name=resurrection/> while [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] rated Roberts as the second best worker he worked with.

Amongst the more disturbing moments was Roberts reportedly smoking [[crack cocaine|crack]] in a hotel room after a reunion with his daughter Brandy, though the act is not shown on camera. In 2005, Roberts, along with others, heavily criticized the film for showing him in a negative light, complaining that the depiction of him was \"not the real Jake Roberts.\" Roberts also stated that director Barry Blaustein and [[Terry Funk]] lied to him about the aims of the film, telling him it was a [[television special]] on the effects of drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nRoberts was featured in another wrestling documentary in 2015 entitled ''The Resurrection of Jake the Snake'', which chronicled his time living with [[Diamond Dallas Page]] beginning in October 2012.<ref name=resurrection/>\n\nRoberts appeared as Mr. Lucas, the owner of a gourmet condom company, in the comedy film, ''[[The Bet (2016 film)|The Bet]]'' which also featured Dallas Page and [[Roddy Piper]].\n\nRoberts also made an appearance in ''An Almost True Story: TOXIC TUTU'' in 2015, as himself, in a scene with [[Jonny Fairplay]] from ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''.\n\nRoberts has a role in the 2019 film ''[[The Peanut Butter Falcon]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\n===Health issues===\nIn 2007, WWE started a policy of paying all expenses for its former performers who wanted to start [[drug rehabilitation]] programs.

Magee said that Roberts was induced to a \"coma-like\" state in order to treat pneumonia.

Hughes''' holds the Philip S. Bernstein Chair of Jewish Studies in the Department of Religion and Classics at the [[University of Rochester]].  Previously, he was the Gordon and Gretchen Gross Professor in the Institute of Jewish Thought and Heritage at the [[University at Buffalo]], State University of New York from 2009-2012, and, from 2001-2009, Professor of Religious Studies at the [[University of Calgary]], Alberta, Canada.\n\n==Biography==\nThe first-born son of William (1927\u20132013) and Sadie (n\u00e9e Alley, 1936\u2013 ) Hughes, Aaron was born on August 15, 1968, at the University Hospital in [[Edmonton, AB]].   His father is a native of [[Glasgow, Scotland]] and his mother was born in [[Fort Simpson, NWT]].  He also has a young brother, Cameron (1972\u2013 ).  A first-generation college student, Hughes received a BA (hons) in [[Religious Studies]] at the [[University of Alberta]] in 1993.  He worked primarily there with Francis Landy, a respected literary theorist who works on the Hebrew Bible.  Following this, he went to the Department of Religious Studies at [[Indiana University in Bloomington]], where he received an MA in 1995 and a PhD in 2000 for a dissertation entitled \"Philosophy's Mythos: Aesthetics, the Imagination, and the Philosophical Novel on Medieval Jewish and Islamic Thought.  This was subsequently published as The Texture of the Divine: Imagination in Medieval Islamic and Jewish Thought (Indiana University Press, 2004), and which was one of three finalist for a [[Koret Jewish Book Award]] in the Thought/Philosophy category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishbooks.com/awards04.html|title=MyJewishBooks Online}}</ref>   His dissertation advisor was Hava Tirosh-Samuelson (now at ASU).  In addition to his coursework at Indiana University, Hughes also spent a year, 1996-1997, at the [[Hebrew University in Jerusalem]] and a year, 1999-2000, at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n==Work==\n\nHughes is a scholar of three distinct fields of research: [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Islamic Studies]] and Theory and Method in the Academic Study of Religion. In terms of Jewish philosophy, Hughes has traditionally worked on medieval Jewish and Islamic Neo-Platonists, [[Avicenna]], [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]], and [[Ibn Tufayl]].  His work is particularly noted for its ability to discuss both the Hebrew and Islamic philosophers of the Jewish-Islamic symbiosis of medieval al-Andalus.<ref>The Texture of the  Divine, Jonathn P. Decter, Jewish Quarterly Review 97.3 (2007) e82-e84</ref>  His work on [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] is especially noted.<ref>Abraham Ibn Ezra, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-ezra/</ref>  More recently Hughes has turned his attention away from a strict [[historicism]] to a hermeneutic that attempts to read premodern Jewish Philosophers in the light of modern ones (as can be seen, for example in his ''The Invention of Jewish Identity'').\n\nIn terms of Islamic Studies, Hughes has primarily been interested in critiquing what he regards as the overly apologetical and ecumenical approach to the field.  This can be witnessed, for example in his two books that take aim at the field (Situating Islam and Theorizing Islam).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.meforum.org/2154/situating-islam|title=Review of Situating Islam|journal=Middle East Quarterly|first=Stephen|last=Schwartz|date=1 March 2009}}</ref>  However rather than just critique, Hughes has also attempted a corrective with his ''Muslim Identities'', which is meant to be an attempt to provide an introduction to Islam in ways that eschews the more irenic approaches of people like Fred Denny and [[John Esposito]].  Writing in the ''[[Journal of Islamic Studies]]'', [[Murad Wilfried Hofmann]] describes Hughes' ''Muslim Identities'' as \"the very best introduction currently available in English for non-Muslims seeking a sound approach to Islam.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wilfried Hofmann|first1=Murad|title=Muslim Identities: An Introduction to Islam By AARON W.

Hughes''' holds the Philip S. Bernstein Chair of Jewish Studies in the Department of Religion and Classics at the [[University of Rochester]].  Previously, he was the Gordon and Gretchen Gross Professor in the Institute of Jewish Thought and Heritage at the [[University at Buffalo]], State University of New York from 2009-2012, and, from 2001-2009, Professor of Religious Studies at the [[University of Calgary]], Alberta, Canada.\n\n==Biography==\nThe first-born son of William (1927\u20132013) and Sadie (n\u00e9e Alley, 1936\u2013 ) Hughes, Aaron was born on August 15, 1968, at the University Hospital in [[Edmonton, AB]].   His father is a native of [[Glasgow, Scotland]] and his mother was born in [[Fort Simpson, NWT]].  He also has a young brother, Cameron (1972\u2013 ).  A first-generation college student, Hughes received a BA (hons) in [[Religious Studies]] at the [[University of Alberta]] in 1993.  He worked primarily there with Francis Landy, a respected literary theorist who works on the Hebrew Bible.  Following this, he went to the Department of Religious Studies at [[Indiana University in Bloomington]], where he received an MA in 1995 and a PhD in 2000 for a dissertation entitled \"Philosophy's Mythos: Aesthetics, the Imagination, and the Philosophical Novel on Medieval Jewish and Islamic Thought.  This was subsequently published as The Texture of the Divine: Imagination in Medieval Islamic and Jewish Thought (Indiana University Press, 2004), and which was one of three finalist for a [[Koret Jewish Book Award]] in the Thought/Philosophy category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishbooks.com/awards04.html|title=MyJewishBooks Online}}</ref>   His dissertation advisor was Hava Tirosh-Samuelson (now at ASU).  In addition to his coursework at Indiana University, Hughes also spent a year, 1996-1997, at the [[Hebrew University in Jerusalem]] and a year, 1999-2000, at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n==Work==\n\nHughes is a scholar of three distinct fields of research: [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Islamic Studies]] and Theory and Method in the Academic Study of Religion. In terms of Jewish philosophy, Hughes has traditionally worked on medieval Jewish and Islamic Neo-Platonists, [[Avicenna]], [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]], and [[Ibn Tufayl]].  His work is particularly noted for its ability to discuss both the Hebrew and Islamic philosophers of the Jewish-Islamic symbiosis of medieval al-Andalus.<ref>The Texture of the  Divine, Jonathn P. Decter, Jewish Quarterly Review 97.3 (2007) e82-e84</ref>  His work on [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] is especially noted.<ref>Abraham Ibn Ezra, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-ezra/</ref>  More recently Hughes has turned his attention away from a strict [[historicism]] to a hermeneutic that attempts to read premodern Jewish Philosophers in the light of modern ones (as can be seen, for example in his ''The Invention of Jewish Identity'').\n\nIn terms of Islamic Studies, Hughes has primarily been interested in critiquing what he regards as the overly apologetical and ecumenical approach to the field.  This can be witnessed, for example in his two books that take aim at the field (Situating Islam and Theorizing Islam).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.meforum.org/2154/situating-islam|title=Review of Situating Islam|journal=Middle East Quarterly|first=Stephen|last=Schwartz|date=1 March 2009}}</ref>  However rather than just critique, Hughes has also attempted a corrective with his ''Muslim Identities'', which is meant to be an attempt to provide an introduction to Islam in ways that eschews the more irenic approaches of people like Fred Denny and [[John Esposito]].  Writing in the ''[[Journal of Islamic Studies]]'', [[Murad Wilfried Hofmann]] describes Hughes' ''Muslim Identities'' as \"the very best introduction currently available in English for non-Muslims seeking a sound approach to Islam.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wilfried Hofmann|first1=Murad|title=Muslim Identities: An Introduction to Islam By AARON W.

Students paid no tuition but purchased tickets to five or six daily lectures.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=|title=The Development of Harvard University since the inauguration of President Eliot, 1869-1929|last=Morison|first=Samuel Eliot|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1930|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=555\u2013594 & Preface}}</ref>  The first two students graduated in 1788.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/history-hms|title=The History of HMS|website=hms.harvard.edu}}</ref>\n\nIn the following century, the medical school moved locations several times due to changing clinical relationships, a function of the fact that Harvard Medical School does not directly own or operate a teaching hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medstudenthandbook.hms.harvard.edu/history-harvard-medicine|title=History of Harvard Medicine|website=medstudenthandbook.hms.harvard.edu}}</ref> In 1810, the school moved to [[Boston]] at what is now downtown Washington Street. In 1816, the school was moved to Mason Street and was called the Massachusetts Medical College of Harvard University in recognition of a gift from the Great and General Court of Massachusetts. In 1847, the school was moved to Mason Street to be closer to [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. In 1883, the school was relocated to Copley Square.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/history-hms|title=The History of HMS - Harvard Medical School|website=hms.harvard.edu}}</ref> Prior to this move, [[Charles William Eliot]] became Harvard's president in 1869 and found the medical school in the worst condition of any part of the university. He instituted drastic reforms that raised admissions standards, instituted a formal degree program, and defined HMS as a professional school within Harvard University that laid the groundwork for its transformation into one of the leading medical schools in the world.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1906, the medical school moved to its current location in the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area]]. The Longwood campus's five original marble-faced buildings of the quadrangle still remain in use today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hms.harvard.edu/public/history/history.html|title=Harvard Medical School&nbsp;\u2014 History|accessdate=February 25, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505174638/http://hms.harvard.edu/public/history/history.html|archive-date=May 5, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countway.harvard.edu/archives/historyNotes.shtml\n|title=Countway Medical Library&nbsp;\u2014 Records Management&nbsp;\u2014 Historical Notes|accessdate=February 25, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175511/http://www.countway.harvard.edu/archives/historyNotes.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 1, 2006}}</ref>\n\n=== Innovations ===\nHarvard Medical School faculty have been associated with a number of important medical and public health innovations:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Introduction of smallpox vaccination to America \n* First use of [[anesthesia]] for pain control during surgery \n* The introduction of insulin to the US to treat [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]\n* Comprehending of the role of [[vitamin B12]] in treating anemia\n* Identification of [[coenzyme A]] and understanding of proteins\n* Developing tissue culture methods for the [[Poliovirus|polio virus]], which paved the way for vaccines against polio\n* Mapping the visual system of the brain\n* Development of the first successful [[chemotherapy]] for [[childhood leukemia]]\n* Development of the first implantable cardiac pacemaker\n* Discovering the inheritance of immunity to infection\n* Development of artificial skin for burn victims\n* The first successful heart valve surgery \n* The first successful human kidney transplant\n* The first reattachment of a severed human limb \n* Discovery of the genes that cause [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], [[Huntington's disease]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] ([[Lou Gehrig's disease]]), and [[Alzheimer's disease]], among many others\n* Establishing the importance of tumor vascular supply (angiogenesis) and seeding the field of vascular biology\n* Discovery of the cause of [[Pre-eclampsia|preeclampsia]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://medstudenthandbook.hms.harvard.edu/history-harvard-medicine|title=History of Harvard Medicine|access-date=August 4, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Broadening admissions  ===\n==== Women ====\n {{multiple image\n | direction = vertical  | width = 235\n | image1 = Massachusetts Medical College ca1824 MasonSt Boston.png\n | alt1 = Massachusetts Medical College at Mason St. (Old building)\n | caption1 = Massachusetts Medical College at Mason St. (Old building)\n | image2 = Harvard Medical School HDR.jpg\n | alt2 = Harvard Medical School quadrangle in [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area|Longwood Medical Area]].\n | caption2 = Harvard Medical School quadrangle in [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area|Longwood Medical Area]].\n }}\n\nIn mid-1847, Professor [[Walter Channing (physician)|Walter Channing]]'s proposal that women be admitted to lectures and examinations was rejected by the [[President and Fellows of Harvard College]]. While [[Harriot Kezia Hunt]] was soon after given permission to attend medical lectures, this permission was withdrawn in 1850.\n\nIn 1866, two women with extensive medical education elsewhere applied but were denied admission. In 1867, a single faculty member's vote blocked the admission of [[Susan Dimock]].\nIn 1872, Harvard declined a gift of $10,000 conditioned on medical school admitting women medical students on the same term as men.\nA similar offer of $50,000, by group of ten women including [[Marie Elizabeth Zakrzewska]], was declined in 1882; a committee of five was appointed to study the matter.\nAfter the medical school moved from North Grove Street to Boylston Street in 1883, professor [[Henry Ingersoll Bowditch]]'s proposal that the North Grove Street premises be used for medical education for women was rejected.\n\nIn 1943, a dean's committee recommended the admission of women, the proportion of men and women being dependent solely on the qualifications of the applicants.<ref name=beecher>{{Cite book|title=Medicine at Harvard : the first three hundred years|last=Beecher|first=Henry Knowles|publisher=University Press of New England|year=1977|isbn=|location=Hanover, N.H.|pages=460\u2013481}}</ref> \nIn 1945, the first class of women was admitted; projected benefits included helping male students learn to view women as equals, increasing the number of physicians in lower-paid specialties typically shunned by men, and replacing the weakest third of all-male classes with better-qualified women.<ref name=\"First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945\">{{cite report|url=http://repository.countway.harvard.edu/xmlui/handle/10473/1782|title=First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945|publisher=Countway Repository, Harvard University Library|accessdate=May 2, 2016}}</ref> By 1972, about one fifth of Harvard medical students were women.<ref name=beecher/>\n\n==== African Americans ====\nIn 1850, three black men, [[Martin Delany]], [[Daniel Laing Jr.]], and [[Isaac H.

In recent decades, HMS has maintained a three-phase curriculum with a classroom based pre-clerkship phase, a principal clinical experience (PCE), and a post-PCE phase.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://meded.hms.harvard.edu/md-program|title=MD Program|website=meded.hms.harvard.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-clerkship phase has two curricular tracks. The majority of students enter in the more traditional Pathways track that focuses on active learning and earlier entry into the clinic with courses that include students from the [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine]]. Pathways students gain early exposure to the clinic through a longitudinal clinical skills course that lasts the duration of the pre-clerkship phase. A small portion of each class enter in the [[Harvard\u2013MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology|HST]] track, which is jointly administered with [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. The HST track is designed to train physician-scientists with emphasis on basic physiology and quantitative understanding of biological processes through courses that include [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] students from MIT.\n\n== Admissions ==\nAdmission to Harvard Medical School's [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] program is highly selective. There are 165 total spots for each incoming class, with 135 spots in the Pathways curriculum and 30 spots in the [[Harvard\u2013MIT Program of Health Sciences and Technology|HST]] program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://meded.hms.harvard.edu/admissions-at-a-glance|title=Admissions at a Glance|website=meded.hms.harvard.edu}}</ref> While both use a single application, each curricular track independently evaluates applicants.\n\nFor the MD Class of 2023, 6,815 candidates applied and 227 were admitted (3.3%). There was a matriculation rate of 73%.<ref name = \"Facts and Figures\"/>\n\n== Affiliated teaching hospitals and research institutes ==\nHarvard Medical School does not directly own or operate any hospitals and instead relies on affiliated teaching hospitals for clinical education.

Affiliated teaching hospitals and research institutes include [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute]], and [[Boston Children's Hospital]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/hms-affiliates|title=HMS Affiliates - Harvard Medical School|website=hms.harvard.edu}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHarvard Medical School was founded on September 19, 1782, after President Joseph Willard presented a report with plans for a medical school to the [[President and Fellows of Harvard College]]. It is the third-oldest medical school in the United States, founded after the [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons]].\n\nThe founding faculty members of Harvard Medical School were [[John Warren (surgeon)|John Warren]], [[Benjamin Waterhouse]], and Aaron Dexter.<ref name=\":1\"/> Lectures were first held in the basement of [[Harvard Hall]] and then later in [[Holden Chapel]]. Students paid no tuition but purchased tickets to five or six daily lectures.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=|title=The Development of Harvard University since the inauguration of President Eliot, 1869-1929|last=Morison|first=Samuel Eliot|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1930|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=555\u2013594 & Preface}}</ref>  The first two students graduated in 1788.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/history-hms|title=The History of HMS|website=hms.harvard.edu}}</ref>\n\nIn the following century, the medical school moved locations several times due to changing clinical relationships, a function of the fact that Harvard Medical School does not directly own or operate a teaching hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medstudenthandbook.hms.harvard.edu/history-harvard-medicine|title=History of Harvard Medicine|website=medstudenthandbook.hms.harvard.edu}}</ref> In 1810, the school moved to [[Boston]] at what is now downtown Washington Street. In 1816, the school was moved to Mason Street and was called the Massachusetts Medical College of Harvard University in recognition of a gift from the Great and General Court of Massachusetts. In 1847, the school was moved to Mason Street to be closer to [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. In 1883, the school was relocated to Copley Square.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/history-hms|title=The History of HMS - Harvard Medical School|website=hms.harvard.edu}}</ref> Prior to this move, [[Charles William Eliot]] became Harvard's president in 1869 and found the medical school in the worst condition of any part of the university. He instituted drastic reforms that raised admissions standards, instituted a formal degree program, and defined HMS as a professional school within Harvard University that laid the groundwork for its transformation into one of the leading medical schools in the world.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1906, the medical school moved to its current location in the [[Longwood Medical and Academic Area]].

While [[Harriot Kezia Hunt]] was soon after given permission to attend medical lectures, this permission was withdrawn in 1850.\n\nIn 1866, two women with extensive medical education elsewhere applied but were denied admission. In 1867, a single faculty member's vote blocked the admission of [[Susan Dimock]].\nIn 1872, Harvard declined a gift of $10,000 conditioned on medical school admitting women medical students on the same term as men.\nA similar offer of $50,000, by group of ten women including [[Marie Elizabeth Zakrzewska]], was declined in 1882; a committee of five was appointed to study the matter.\nAfter the medical school moved from North Grove Street to Boylston Street in 1883, professor [[Henry Ingersoll Bowditch]]'s proposal that the North Grove Street premises be used for medical education for women was rejected.\n\nIn 1943, a dean's committee recommended the admission of women, the proportion of men and women being dependent solely on the qualifications of the applicants.<ref name=beecher>{{Cite book|title=Medicine at Harvard : the first three hundred years|last=Beecher|first=Henry Knowles|publisher=University Press of New England|year=1977|isbn=|location=Hanover, N.H.|pages=460\u2013481}}</ref> \nIn 1945, the first class of women was admitted; projected benefits included helping male students learn to view women as equals, increasing the number of physicians in lower-paid specialties typically shunned by men, and replacing the weakest third of all-male classes with better-qualified women.<ref name=\"First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945\">{{cite report|url=http://repository.countway.harvard.edu/xmlui/handle/10473/1782|title=First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945|publisher=Countway Repository, Harvard University Library|accessdate=May 2, 2016}}</ref> By 1972, about one fifth of Harvard medical students were women.<ref name=beecher/>\n\n==== African Americans ====\nIn 1850, three black men, [[Martin Delany]], [[Daniel Laing Jr.]], and [[Isaac H. Snowden]], were admitted to the school but were later expelled under pressure from faculty and other students.\n\nIn 1968, in response to a petition signed by hundreds of medical students, the faculty established a commission on relations with the black community in Boston; at the time less than one percent of Harvard medical students were black.\nBy 1973, the number of black students admitted had tripled, and by the next year it had quadrupled.<ref name=beecher/>\n\n== Curriculum ==\nHarvard Medical School has gone through many curricular revisions for its MD program. In recent decades, HMS has maintained a three-phase curriculum with a classroom based pre-clerkship phase, a principal clinical experience (PCE), and a post-PCE phase.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://meded.hms.harvard.edu/md-program|title=MD Program|website=meded.hms.harvard.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-clerkship phase has two curricular tracks. The majority of students enter in the more traditional Pathways track that focuses on active learning and earlier entry into the clinic with courses that include students from the [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine]]. Pathways students gain early exposure to the clinic through a longitudinal clinical skills course that lasts the duration of the pre-clerkship phase. A small portion of each class enter in the [[Harvard\u2013MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology|HST]] track, which is jointly administered with [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. The HST track is designed to train physician-scientists with emphasis on basic physiology and quantitative understanding of biological processes through courses that include [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] students from MIT.\n\n== Admissions ==\nAdmission to Harvard Medical School's [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] program is highly selective. There are 165 total spots for each incoming class, with 135 spots in the Pathways curriculum and 30 spots in the [[Harvard\u2013MIT Program of Health Sciences and Technology|HST]] program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://meded.hms.harvard.edu/admissions-at-a-glance|title=Admissions at a Glance|website=meded.hms.harvard.edu}}</ref> While both use a single application, each curricular track independently evaluates applicants.\n\nFor the MD Class of 2023, 6,815 candidates applied and 227 were admitted (3.3%). There was a matriculation rate of 73%.<ref name = \"Facts and Figures\"/>\n\n== Affiliated teaching hospitals and research institutes ==\nHarvard Medical School does not directly own or operate any hospitals and instead relies on affiliated teaching hospitals for clinical education. Medical students primarily complete their clinical experiences at [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Boston Children's Hospital]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Cambridge Health Alliance]], and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://meded.hms.harvard.edu/pathways|title=Pathways|website=meded.hms.harvard.edu}}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=19em|\n* [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]]\n* [[Boston Children's Hospital]]\n* [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]]\n* [[Cambridge Health Alliance]]\n* [[Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute]]\n* Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute\n* [[Rashi School|Hebrew SeniorLife]]\n* [[Joslin Diabetes Center]]\n* Judge Baker's Children's Center\n* [[Massachusetts Eye and Ear]]\n* [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]\n* [[McLean Hospital]]\n* [[Mount Auburn Hospital]]\n* [[Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital]]\n* [[VA Boston Healthcare System]]\n}}\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n<!--IS THE CRITERIA HERE THAT ANY NAME A WP EDITOR ADDS IS CONSIDERED FINE?

The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions.<ref name=\"press release\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.nro.gov/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963}}</ref> Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory.\n\nMOL was also similar to the [[Soviet]] [[Almaz]] space station, which had a very similar purpose and design. Unlike the MOL, however, Almaz was flown several times throughout the 1970s and was eventually used for military reconnaissance. \n\nMOL was canceled in 1969, during the height of the [[Apollo program]], when it was shown that uncrewed [[reconnaissance satellite]]s could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively. U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA [[Skylab]] (Apollo Applications Program) which flew in the mid-1970s.\n\n== Background ==\n==Modules==\n===Specifications===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Crew: 2\n*Maximum duration: 40 days\n*Orbit: Sun synchronous or polar\n*Length: {{convert|21.92|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Diameter: {{convert|3.05|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Habitable volume: {{convert|11.3|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}\n*Gross mass: {{convert|14476|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Payload: {{convert|2700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Power: [[fuel cell]]s or [[solar cell]]s\n*[[Reaction control system|RCS]] system: [[dinitrogen tetroxide|{{chem2|N2O4}}]]/[[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]]\n*Reference:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/m/mol.html |title=MOL |website=Astronautix.com |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:MOL 01.jpg|MOL main features\nImage:Proposed USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory - GPN-2003-00094.jpg|Early 1960s MOL conceptual drawing that did not use the Gemini spacecraft\nImage:Dorian 21.jpg|Integral launch dual compartment laboratory\nImage:Dorian_25.jpg|MOL variations\nImage:MOL spacesuit.jpg|MOL spacesuit\nFile:USAF_Astronaut_Maneuvering_Unit.jpg|Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), developed for MOL\n</gallery>\n\n==Spacecraft==\nThe Gemini capsule was redesigned for MOL and named Gemini B.

After about one month of space station operations, the crew would return to the Gemini B capsule, separate from the station and perform reentry.

It used a Gemini B spacecraft as a reentry vehicle.\n\nThe crew were to be launched using a [[Titan 3M]] with the stacked Gemini B and MOL, and returned to Earth in the Gemini B. They would conduct up to 40 days of military reconnaissance using large optics, [[camera]]s, and side-looking [[radar]].\n\nThe [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit]] (AMU) was developed for the MOL project.  NASA chief astronaut [[Deke Slayton]] later speculated in his autobiography that the AMU may have been developed for MOL because the Air Force \"thought they might have the chance to inspect somebody else's satellites.\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=174}}\n\nIn response to the announcement of the MOL, the [[Soviet Union]] commissioned the development of its own military space station, [[Almaz]]. Three Almaz space stations flew as [[Salyut]] space stations, and the program also developed a military add-on used on [[Salyut 6]] and [[Salyut 7]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz.html |title=The Almaz program |publisher=Russian Space Web |access-date=12 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000112/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/almaz.htm |title=Almaz |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |first=Mark |last=Wade |access-date=12 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119184429/http://astronautix.com/project/almaz.htm |archive-date=19 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Almprog/almprog.htm |title=The Almaz Space Station Program |publisher=Sven's Space Place |first=Sven |last=Grahn |access-date=12 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Test flight===\n[[File:Titan-3C MOL-Gemini-B-Test 3.jpg|thumb|MOL test launch [[OPS 0855]], 3 November 1966, Cape Canaveral, FL]]\nMOL Test flight [[OPS 0855]] was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|Launch Complex 40]] on 3 November 1966 at 13:50:42 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], on a [[Titan IIIC]]-9.

A hatch installed in the Gemini's [[heat shield]]\u2014intended to provide access to the MOL during crewed operations\u2014was tested during the capsule's reentry.

This camera system was codenamed ''Dorian'' and given the designation [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]]. The project was canceled on 10 June 1969 before any operational flights occurred.\n\nThe KH-10 intended for the MOL program was succeeded by the uncrewed [[KH-11 Kennan]], which launched in 1976 as the Soviet Union was winding down its [[Almaz|crewed space reconnaissance program]].  The KH-11 is said to have achieved the goal of {{convert|3|in|mm|0|adj=on}} imaging [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and introduced video transmission of images back to Earth.\n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. MOL program director [[Bernard Schriever]] commissioned a report in May 1966 examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version.<ref name=\"day20190319\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3456/1 |title=The Space Review: The measure of a man: Evaluating the role of astronauts in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program (part 1) |last=Day |first=Dwayne A. |date=2018-03-19 |website=The Space Review |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nMOL was canceled on 10 June 1969 with the first projected flight three years away. Between 1965 and 1969, MOL's projected cost rose from $1.5 billion to $3 billion while the Vietnam War took larger portions of the defense budget. While Defense Secretary [[Melvin R. Laird]] and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] strongly supported the station, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] head [[Richard Helms]] did not support the project because he feared that the death of a MOL astronaut might ground launches and thus damage the nation's satellite reconnaissance program. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] agreed to the [[Bureau of the Budget]]'s proposal to cancel MOL,{{sfn|Heppenheimer|1998|pp=204\u2013205}} as it was determined the capabilities of uncrewed spy satellites met or exceeded the capabilities of crewed MOL missions.\n\nAl Crews said in 2015 that when he saw high-resolution photographs from [[KH-8 Gambit 3]], first launched a few months after the 1966 report, he knew that manned MOL would be canceled. NASA offered those MOL astronauts 35 years of age and under the opportunity to transfer to its astronaut program. Seven of the 14 astronauts were 35 or younger and took the offer, becoming [[NASA Astronaut Group 7]]: Future [[NASA Administrator]] [[Richard H. Truly]], [[Karol J. Bobko]], [[Robert Crippen]], [[C.

The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions.<ref name=\"press release\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.nro.gov/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963}}</ref> Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory.\n\nMOL was also similar to the [[Soviet]] [[Almaz]] space station, which had a very similar purpose and design. Unlike the MOL, however, Almaz was flown several times throughout the 1970s and did end up being used for military reconnaissance. \n\nMOL was canceled in 1969, during the height of the [[Apollo program]], when it was shown that uncrewed [[reconnaissance satellite]]s could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively. U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA [[Skylab]] (Apollo Applications Program) which flew in the mid-1970s.\n\n== Background ==\n==Modules==\n===Specifications===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Crew: 2\n*Maximum duration: 40 days\n*Orbit: Sun synchronous or polar\n*Length: {{convert|21.92|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Diameter: {{convert|3.05|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Habitable volume: {{convert|11.3|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}\n*Gross mass: {{convert|14476|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Payload: {{convert|2700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Power: [[fuel cell]]s or [[solar cell]]s\n*[[Reaction control system|RCS]] system: [[dinitrogen tetroxide|{{chem2|N2O4}}]]/[[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]]\n*Reference:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/m/mol.html |title=MOL |website=Astronautix.com |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:MOL 01.jpg|MOL main features\nImage:Proposed USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory - GPN-2003-00094.jpg|Early 1960s MOL conceptual drawing that did not use the Gemini spacecraft\nImage:Dorian 21.jpg|Integral launch dual compartment laboratory\nImage:Dorian_25.jpg|MOL variations\nImage:MOL spacesuit.jpg|MOL spacesuit\nFile:USAF_Astronaut_Maneuvering_Unit.jpg|Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), developed for MOL\n</gallery>\n\n==Spacecraft==\nThe Gemini capsule was redesigned for MOL and named Gemini B.

Once in orbit, the crew would power down the capsule and activate MOL. After about one month of space station operations, the crew would return to the Gemini B capsule, separate from the station and perform reentry.

It used a Gemini B spacecraft as a reentry vehicle.\n\nThe crew were to be launched using a [[Titan 3M]] with the stacked Gemini B and MOL, and returned to Earth in the Gemini B. They would conduct up to 40 days of military reconnaissance using large optics, [[camera]]s, and side-looking [[radar]].\n\nThe [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit]] (AMU) was developed for the MOL project.  NASA chief astronaut [[Deke Slayton]] later speculated in his autobiography that the AMU may have been developed for MOL because the Air Force \"thought they might have the chance to inspect somebody else's satellites.\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=174}}\n\nIn response to the announcement of the MOL, the [[Soviet Union]] commissioned the development of its own military space station, [[Almaz]]. Three Almaz space stations flew as [[Salyut]] space stations, and the program also developed a military add-on used on [[Salyut 6]] and [[Salyut 7]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz.html |title=The Almaz program |publisher=Russian Space Web |access-date=12 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000112/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/almaz.htm |title=Almaz |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |first=Mark |last=Wade |access-date=12 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119184429/http://astronautix.com/project/almaz.htm |archive-date=19 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Almprog/almprog.htm |title=The Almaz Space Station Program |publisher=Sven's Space Place |first=Sven |last=Grahn |access-date=12 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Test flight===\n[[File:Titan-3C MOL-Gemini-B-Test 3.jpg|thumb|MOL test launch [[OPS 0855]], 3 November 1966, Cape Canaveral, FL]]\nMOL Test flight [[OPS 0855]] was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|Launch Complex 40]] on 3 November 1966 at 13:50:42 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], on a [[Titan IIIC]]-9. The flight consisted of a MOL [[mockup]] built from a [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] propellant tank, and the [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|refurbished capsule]] from the [[Gemini 2]] mission as a [[prototype]] {{nowrap|Gemini B}} spacecraft.\n\nAfter the [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|Gemini B prototype]] separated for a sub-orbital [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]], the MOL mockup continued into [[orbit]] and released three satellites. A hatch installed in the Gemini's [[heat shield]]\u2014intended to provide access to the MOL during crewed operations\u2014was tested during the capsule's reentry. The Gemini capsule was recovered near [[Ascension Island]] in the South Atlantic by the {{USS|La Salle|AGF-3|6}} after a flight of 33 minutes.\n\n===Proposed===\n* 1970 December 1 -  MOL 1 - First uncrewed Gemini-B/[[Titan IIIM]] qualification flight (Gemini-B flown alone, without an active MOL)\n* 1971 June 1 -  MOL 2 - Second uncrewed Gemini-B/Titan 3M qualification flight (Gemini-B flown alone, without an active MOL)\n* 1972 February 1 -  MOL 3 - A crew of two ([[James M.

This camera system was codenamed ''Dorian'' and given the designation [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]]. The project was canceled on 10 June 1969 before any operational flights occurred.\n\nThe KH-10 intended for the MOL program was succeeded by the uncrewed [[KH-11 Kennan]], which launched in 1976 as the Soviet Union was winding down its [[Almaz|crewed space reconnaissance program]].  The KH-11 is said to have achieved the goal of {{convert|3|in|mm|0|adj=on}} imaging [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and introduced video transmission of images back to Earth.\n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. MOL program director [[Bernard Schriever]] commissioned a report in May 1966 examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version.<ref name=\"day20190319\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3456/1 |title=The Space Review: The measure of a man: Evaluating the role of astronauts in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program (part 1) |last=Day |first=Dwayne A. |date=2018-03-19 |website=The Space Review |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nMOL was canceled on 10 June 1969 with the first projected flight three years away. Between 1965 and 1969, MOL's projected cost rose from $1.5 billion to $3 billion while the Vietnam War took larger portions of the defense budget. While Defense Secretary [[Melvin R. Laird]] and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] strongly supported the station, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] head [[Richard Helms]] did not support the project because he feared that the death of a MOL astronaut might ground launches and thus damage the nation's satellite reconnaissance program. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] agreed to the [[Bureau of the Budget]]'s proposal to cancel MOL,{{sfn|Heppenheimer|1998|pp=204\u2013205}} as it was determined the capabilities of uncrewed spy satellites met or exceeded the capabilities of crewed MOL missions.\n\nAl Crews said in 2015 that when he saw high-resolution photographs from [[KH-8 Gambit 3]], first launched a few months after the 1966 report, he knew that manned MOL would be canceled. NASA offered those MOL astronauts 35 years of age and under the opportunity to transfer to its astronaut program. Seven of the 14 astronauts were 35 or younger and took the offer, becoming [[NASA Astronaut Group 7]]: Future [[NASA Administrator]] [[Richard H. Truly]], [[Karol J. Bobko]], [[Robert Crippen]], [[C.

Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.\n\nThe male equivalent of the mermaid is the [[merman]], also a familiar figure in folklore and heraldry. Although traditions about and sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids, they are generally assumed to co-exist with their female counterparts. The male and the female collectively are sometimes referred to as [[merfolk]] or merpeople.\n\nThe conception of mermaids in the West may have been influenced by the [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] of [[Greek mythology]], which were originally half-birdlike, but came to be pictured as half-fishlike in the Christian era. Historical accounts of mermaids, such as those reported by [[Christopher Columbus]] during his exploration of the Caribbean, may have been sightings of [[manatee]]s or similar aquatic mammals.  While there is no evidence that mermaids exist outside folklore, reports of mermaid sightings continue to the present day.\n\nMermaids have been a popular [[Sea in culture|subject of art and literature]] in recent centuries, such as in [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairytale fantasy|literary fairy tale]] \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" (1836). They have subsequently been depicted in operas, paintings, books, comics, animation, and [[live action]] films.She just mad I prove my point\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Leighton-The Fisherman and the Syren-c. 1856-1858.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''The Fisherman and the Syren'', by [[Frederic Leighton]], c. 1856\u20131858]]\nThe word ''mermaid'' is a compound of the [[Old English]] ''mere'' (sea), and ''maid'' (a girl or young woman).<ref name=\"oxforddictionaries1\">{{cite web| title= Mermaid | publisher = Oxford | work = Dictionaries | url = http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mermaid?q=mermaid | accessdate= 16 April 2012}}</ref> The equivalent term in Old English was ''merewif''.<ref>{{cite web| title= Mermaid | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=mermaid&searchmode=none}}</ref> They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair.<ref name=\"oxforddictionaries1\" />\n\n== Origins ==\nThe [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s of Greek mythology (especially the ''[[Odyssey]]''), conceived of as half-bird and half-woman, gradually shifted to the image of a fish-tailed woman.

It is woman for half its length; but the other half, from thighs to feet, stretched out in a fish's tail. But the image in [[Jerusalem|the Holy City]] is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fish to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other [[fowl]]s they do not eat the [[dove]], for they believe it is holy. And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and Semiramis, the first because Derketo has the shape of a fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a dove. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way.

Angry njuzu may be blamed for unexpected misfortunes, such as bad weather, or the sudden disappearance of people.  Benevolent njuzu are thought to reside in peaceful lakes or rivers. If a person goes missing near such lakes or rivers, he or she may have been taken by the njuzu. To obtain the person's release, local elders will brew beer as a propitiatory offering, and ask the njuzu to return the person alive. Those seeking the person's release are not supposed to cry or shed tears.

Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.\n\nThe male equivalent of the mermaid is the [[merman]], also a familiar figure in folklore and heraldry. Although traditions about and sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids, they are generally assumed to co-exist with their female counterparts. The male and the female collectively are sometimes referred to as [[merfolk]] or merpeople.\n\nThe conception of mermaids in the West may have been influenced by the [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] of [[Greek mythology]], which were originally half-birdlike, but came to be pictured as half-fishlike in the Christian era. Historical accounts of mermaids, such as those reported by [[Christopher Columbus]] during his exploration of the Caribbean, may have been sightings of [[manatee]]s or similar aquatic mammals.  While there is no evidence that mermaids exist outside folklore, reports of mermaid sightings continue to the present day.\n\nMermaids have been a popular [[Sea in culture|subject of art and literature]] in recent centuries, such as in [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairytale fantasy|literary fairy tale]] \"[[The Little Mermaid]]\" (1836). They have subsequently been depicted in operas, paintings, books, comics, animation, and [[live action]] films.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Leighton-The Fisherman and the Syren-c. 1856-1858.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''The Fisherman and the Syren'', by [[Frederic Leighton]], c. 1856\u20131858]]\nThe word ''mermaid'' is a compound of the [[Old English]] ''mere'' (sea), and ''maid'' (a girl or young woman).<ref name=\"oxforddictionaries1\">{{cite web| title= Mermaid | publisher = Oxford | work = Dictionaries | url = http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mermaid?q=mermaid | accessdate= 16 April 2012}}</ref> The equivalent term in Old English was ''merewif''.<ref>{{cite web| title= Mermaid | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=mermaid&searchmode=none}}</ref> They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair.<ref name=\"oxforddictionaries1\" />\n\n== Origins ==\nThe [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s of Greek mythology (especially the ''[[Odyssey]]''), conceived of as half-bird and half-woman, gradually shifted to the image of a fish-tailed woman.

Angry njuzu may be blamed for unexpected misfortunes, such as bad weather, or the sudden disappearance of people.  Benevolent njuzu are thought to reside in peaceful lakes or rivers. If a person goes missing near such lakes or rivers, he or she may have been taken by the njuzu. To obtain the person's release, local elders will brew beer as a propitiatory offering, and ask the njuzu to return the person alive. Those seeking the person's release are not supposed to cry or shed tears.

But the mermaid's fish-tail poses an insurmountable obstacle for enticing humans, and the sea-witch offers a potion to transform into human form, at a price (the mermaid's tongue and beautiful voice). The mermaid endures the excruciating pain of having human legs, and despite her inability to speak, almost succeeds in wedding the prince, but for a twist of fate.{{Efn|The prince is betrothed to a princess, who turns out to be the girl he mistakenly believed to be his rescuer (due to the mermaid's concealment).}} The mermaid is doomed unless she stabs the prince with a magic knife before his marriage.

{"title_page": "Complexity class", "text_new": "[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among several important complexity classes]]\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], a '''complexity class''' is a set of [[Computational problem|problems]] of related resource-based complexity. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of allowable error. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 0. Another is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/2 for strings in the language and with error probability 0 for strings not in the language. Finally, the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/3. The class '''BPP''' is at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuit models====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for non-uniform computation (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the Boolean function <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the langauge <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''': the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in '''TIME'''<math>(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class in its own right because it turns out it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm.

These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of allowable error. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 0. Another is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/2 for strings in the language and with error probability 0 for strings not in the language. Finally, the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/3. The class '''BPP''' is at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuit models====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for non-uniform computation (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the Boolean function <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the langauge <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''': the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in '''TIME'''<math>(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p.286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class in its own right because it turns out it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.
