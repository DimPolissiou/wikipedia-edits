The [[screenplay]] by [[Lillian Hellman]] is based on her 1939 play ''[[The Little Foxes]]''. Hellman's ex-husband [[Arthur Kober]], [[Dorothy Parker]] and her husband [[Alan Campbell (screenwriter)|Alan Campbell]] contributed additional scenes and dialogue.<ref name=TCM>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/81524/The-Little-Foxes/articles.html |title=Articles: The Little Foxes (1941) |first=Margarita |last=Landazuri |website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[Southern United States|Southern]] aristocrat Regina Hubbard Giddens ([[Bette Davis]]) struggles for wealth and freedom within the confines of an early 20th-century society where a father considered only sons as legal heirs. As a result, her [[avarice|avaricious]] brothers, Benjamin ([[Charles Dingle]]) and Oscar ([[Carl Benton Reid]]), are independently wealthy, while she must rely for financial support upon her sickly husband Horace ([[Herbert Marshall]]), who has been away undergoing treatment for a severe heart condition.\n\n[[File:Bette davis the little foxes.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Bette Davis]] in ''The Little Foxes'']]\n\nOscar, having married and maligned the sweet-souled, now hopelessly alcoholic Birdie ([[Patricia Collinge]]) to acquire her family's [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] and its cotton fields, now wants to join forces with Benjamin to construct a [[cotton mill]]. They approach their sister with their need for an additional $75,000 to invest in the project. Oscar initially proposes a marriage between his son Leo ([[Dan Duryea]]) and Regina's daughter Alexandra ([[Teresa Wright]]) \u2013 first cousins \u2013 as a means of getting Horace's money; but Horace and Alexandra are repulsed by the suggestion. When Regina asks Horace outright for the money, he refuses. She tells him his refusal is not important since he will die soon and she is eagerly waiting for that day to come. Alexandra overhears the conversation and is distraught.  She then comforts her father after Regina leaves the room.\n\n[[File:Patricia-collinge-trailer.jpg|thumb|Patricia Collinge]]\n\nBen and Oscar, aware of Horace's refusal, pressure Leo into stealing Horace's [[railroad]] [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] from his personal security box at the bank to complete the sum needed to construct the mill. After returning home from an impromptu trip to his security box at the bank, Horace informs Regina of the theft of his bonds. Regina, realizing her two brothers stole the bonds through Leo, who works at the bank, schemes to acquire a larger share of the mill by blackmailing her brothers about their theft.\n\nImmediately, Horace states he is changing his will to leave Alexandra everything except the railroad bonds which, he will claim, he freely lent to Leo. This story will thwart any attempt by Regina to blackmail her brothers over their theft and will deny her any claim to an ownership stake in the mill. Alexandra is rescued from a larger misfortune, that of marrying the repugnant Leo, by Birdie, the only person able to do so, who wills herself the courage to tell the younger woman not to marry the wrong man (i.e. Leo), lest she bear the consequences for the rest of her life. Unfortunately, Oscar overhears part of the conversation and, after Alexandra is out of earshot, slaps Birdie hard.\n\n[[File:Bette Davis and Herbert Marshall \"The Little Foxes\" (1941).jpg|thumb|left|Bette Davis and Herbert Marshall]]\n\nRegina argues with Horace about her contempt for him; and, when he suffers a heart attack, she makes no effort to get him his medicine from upstairs. Horace climbs the stairs to get his medicine but collapses on the way up. The final scenes of the film involve a dying Horace surrounded by family, a doctor and servants who await the chance he may survive. Eventually, Horace dies, leaving no one to contradict Regina if she accuses her brothers of theft. She thus blackmails her brothers, demanding that she be given 75% ownership of the mill business, and they are left with no choice but to accept her demands.\n\nAlexandra hears this conversation; and, upon the brothers' leaving, she confronts her mother about the nature of her father's death on the stairway. Regina denies any wrongdoing, but Alexandra is skeptical.  Alexandra then states the importance of not idly watching people do evil, and Regina tells her daughter that she cannot do anything to stop her from leaving the household, while hoping that she stays. Alexandra runs away with newspaperman David ([[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]]). Regina is left wealthy, but completely alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Regina Hubbard Giddens\n* [[Herbert Marshall]] as Horace Giddens\n* [[Teresa Wright]] as Alexandra Giddens\n* [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] as David Hewitt\n* [[Dan Duryea]] as Leo Hubbard\n* [[Patricia Collinge]] as Birdie Hubbard\n* [[Charles Dingle]] as Ben Hubbard\n* [[Carl Benton Reid]] as Oscar Hubbard\n* [[Jessica Grayson]] as Addie (as Jessie Grayson)\n* [[John Marriott (actor)|John Marriott]] as Cal\n* [[Russell Hicks (actor)|Russell Hicks]] as William Marshall\n* [[Lucien Littlefield]] as Manders\n* [[Virginia Brissac]] as Mrs. Hewitt\n* Terry Nibert as Julia\n* Henry 'Hot Shot' Thomas as Harold\n* [[Charles R.

Producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]] agreed, since none of Bankhead's films had been box office hits. (Coincidentally, Davis had recreated on film another of Bankhead's Broadway roles, Judith Traherne in ''[[Dark Victory (play)|Dark Victory]]''.) However, Davis was reluctant: \"On ''The Little Foxes'' I begged the producer, Samuel Goldwyn, to let Tallulah Bankhead play Regina because Tallulah was magnificent on the stage. He wouldn't let her.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUFplyZZAZsC&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=All About All About Eve: The Complete Behind-the-Scenes Story of the Bitchiest Film Ever Made! |first=Sam |last=Staggs |date=23 June 2001 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |via=Google Books |isbn=978-1466830431}}</ref> Initially [[Jack L. Warner]] refused to lend Davis to Goldwyn, who then offered the role to [[Miriam Hopkins]].<ref name=Higham>Higham 1981, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> When Wyler refused to work with her, Goldwyn resumed negotiations with Warner and finally secured Davis for $385,000. As a contract player at [[Warner Bros.]], Davis was earning $3,000 a week, and when she discovered how much Warner had received for her appearance in ''Foxes'', she demanded and ultimately received a share of the payment.<ref name=\"Stine\" />\n\nWyler encouraged Davis to see Bankhead in the original play, which she did despite major misgivings. She later regretted doing so because after watching Bankhead's performance and reading Hellman's screenplay she felt compelled to create a totally different interpretation of the role, one she didn't feel suited the character. Bankhead had portrayed Regina as a victim forced to fight for her survival due to the contempt with which her brothers treated her, but Davis played her as a cold, conniving, calculating woman wearing a death mask of white powder she insisted makeup artist [[Perc Westmore]] create for her.<ref name=Higham />\n\nIn her autobiography, ''A Lonely Life'', Davis gave a different version about having to see Bankhead in the play. \"A great admirer of hers, I wanted in no way to be influenced by her work. It was Willie's intention that I give a different interpretation of the part. I insisted that Tallulah had played it the only way it could be played. Miss Hellman's Regina was written with such definition that it could only be played one way.\"<ref>Davis 1962, p. 207.</ref> \"I had to do that part exactly the way Tallulah did it, because that's the way Lillian Hellman wrote it. But I was always sad that Tallulah couldn't record Regina from the theatre, because she was marvelous.\"\n\n[[File:The-Little-Foxes-Breakfast.jpg|thumb|Tallulah Bankhead, [[Charles Dingle]], [[Carl Benton Reid]] and [[Dan Duryea]] in the original Broadway production of ''The Little Foxes'' (1939)]]\n[[Charles Dingle]], [[Carl Benton Reid]], [[Dan Duryea]], and [[Patricia Collinge]] all reprised their critically acclaimed Broadway performances. Critics preferred Bankhead's rendition of the role to Davis's, though the supporting cast was highly praised. The character of David Hewitt was not in the original play. Hellman created him to add a second sympathetic male to stand alongside Horace among all the venomous Hubbard men.\n\nDavis and Wyler frequently fought during filming, about everything from her appearance (Wyler thought she looked like a [[Kabuki]] performer, but Davis wanted to look older than her age as the part was written for a 40-year-old) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a more feminine and sympathetic Regina, akin to Tallulah's interpretation). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of ''The Letter'', but this time she held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. \"It was the only time in my career that I walked out on a film after the shooting had begun,\" she later recalled. \"I was a nervous wreck due to the fact that my favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way ... I just didn't want to continue.\"<ref name=Stine /> The actress retreated to her rented house in [[Laguna Beach]] and \"''flatly'' refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to sue me for the ''entire'' cost of the production.\"<ref name=Stine /> A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by [[Katharine Hepburn]] or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress.<ref name=Higham /> Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s, she and Wyler never worked together again.<ref name=TCM /><ref name=Stine /><ref name=Higham />\nThe film premiered at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported it was seen by 22,163 persons on its opening day, setting what was then an all-time attendance mark for a normal opening day at the theatre.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1941/08/23/archives/film-record-set-by-little-foxes-22163-persons-saw-movie-at-music.html \"Film record set by 'Little Foxes'; 22,163 Persons Saw Movie at Music Hall on Thursday, a New Opening Day Mark.\"] ''The New York Times'', August 22, 1941.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Hellman wrote the play ''[[Another Part of the Forest]]'', a [[prequel]] to ''Foxes''. It was [[Another Part of the Forest (film)|adapted for the screen in 1948]].\n\nIn 2003, the character of Regina Giddens, played by Davis, was ranked No. 43 on the [[American Film Institute]] list of the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|50 Best Villains of American Cinema]].\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]] observed,\n{{quote|Lillian Hellman's grim and malignant melodrama... has now been translated to the screen with all its original viciousness intact ... [It] leaps to the front as the most bitingly sinister picture of the year and as one of the most cruelly realistic character studies yet shown on the screen ... Mr. Wyler, with the aid of Gregg Toland, has used the camera to sweep in the myriad small details of a mauve decadent household and the more indicative facets of the many characters... Miss Davis's performance in the role which Talluluh Bankhead played so brassily on the stage is abundant with color and mood... she does occasionally drop an unmistakable imitation of her predecessor... Better than that, however, are the other members of the cast. Charles Dingle as Brother Ben Hubbard, the oldest and sharpest of the rattlesnake clan, is the perfect villain in respectable garb.

The [[screenplay]] by [[Lillian Hellman]] is based on her 1939 play ''[[The Little Foxes]]''. Hellman's ex-husband [[Arthur Kober]], [[Dorothy Parker]] and her husband [[Alan Campbell (screenwriter)|Alan Campbell]] contributed additional scenes and dialogue.<ref name=TCM>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/81524/The-Little-Foxes/articles.html |title=Articles: The Little Foxes (1941) |first=Margarita |last=Landazuri |website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[Southern United States|Southern]] aristocrat Regina Hubbard Giddens ([[Bette Davis]]) struggles for wealth and freedom within the confines of an early 20th-century society where a father considered only sons as legal heirs. As a result, her [[avarice|avaricious]] brothers, Benjamin ([[Charles Dingle]]) and Oscar ([[Carl Benton Reid]]), are independently wealthy, while she must rely for financial support upon her sickly husband Horace ([[Herbert Marshall]]), who has been away undergoing treatment for a severe heart condition.\n\n[[File:Bette davis the little foxes.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Bette Davis]] in ''The Little Foxes'']]\n\nOscar, having married and maligned the sweet-souled, now hopelessly alcoholic Birdie ([[Patricia Collinge]]) to acquire her family's [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] and its cotton fields, now wants to join forces with Benjamin to construct a [[cotton mill]]. They approach their sister with their need for an additional $75,000 to invest in the project. Oscar initially proposes a marriage between his son Leo ([[Dan Duryea]]) and Regina's daughter Alexandra ([[Teresa Wright]]) \u2013 first cousins \u2013 as a means of getting Horace's money; but Horace and Alexandra are repulsed by the suggestion. When Regina asks Horace outright for the money, he refuses. She tells him his refusal is not important since he will die soon and she is eagerly waiting for that day to come. Alexandra overhears the conversation and is distraught.  She then comforts her father after Regina leaves the room.\n\n[[File:Patricia-collinge-trailer.jpg|thumb|Patricia Collinge]]\n\nBen and Oscar, aware of Horace's refusal, pressure Leo into stealing Horace's [[railroad]] [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] from his personal security box at the bank to complete the sum needed to construct the mill. After returning home from an impromptu trip to his security box at the bank, Horace informs Regina of the theft of his bonds. Regina, realizing her two brothers stole the bonds through Leo, who works at the bank, schemes to acquire a larger share of the mill by blackmailing her brothers about their theft.\n\nImmediately, Horace states he is changing his will to leave Alexandra everything except the railroad bonds which, he will claim, he freely lent to Leo. This story will thwart any attempt by Regina to blackmail her brothers over their theft and will deny her any claim to an ownership stake in the mill. Alexandra is rescued from a larger misfortune, that of marrying the repugnant Leo, by Birdie, the only person able to do so, who wills herself the courage to tell the younger woman not to marry the wrong man (i.e. Leo), lest she bear the consequences for the rest of her life. Unfortunately, Oscar overhears part of the conversation and, after Alexandra is out of earshot, slaps Birdie hard.\n\n[[File:Bette Davis and Herbert Marshall \"The Little Foxes\" (1941).jpg|thumb|left|Bette Davis and Herbert Marshall]]\n\nRegina argues with Horace about her contempt for him; and, when he suffers a heart attack, she makes no effort to get him his medicine from upstairs. Horace climbs the stairs to get his medicine but collapses on the way up. The final scenes of the film involve a dying Horace surrounded by family, a doctor and servants who await the chance he may survive. Eventually, Horace dies, leaving no one to contradict Regina if she accuses her brothers of theft. She thus blackmails her brothers, demanding that she be given 75% ownership of the mill business, and they are left with no choice but to accept her demands.\n\nAlexandra hears this conversation; and, upon the brothers' leaving, she confronts her mother about the nature of her father's death on the stairway. Regina denies any wrongdoing, but Alexandra is skeptical.  Alexandra then states the importance of not idly watching people do evil, and Regina tells her daughter that she cannot do anything to stop her from leaving the household, while hoping that she stays. Alexandra runs away with newspaperman David ([[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]]). Regina is left wealthy, but completely alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Regina Hubbard Giddens\n* [[Herbert Marshall]] as Horace Giddens\n* [[Teresa Wright]] as Alexandra Giddens\n* [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] as David Hewitt\n* [[Dan Duryea]] as Leo Hubbard\n* [[Patricia Collinge]] as Birdie Hubbard\n* [[Charles Dingle]] as Ben Hubbard\n* [[Carl Benton Reid]] as Oscar Hubbard\n* [[Jessica Grayson]] as Addie (as Jessie Grayson)\n* [[John Marriott (actor)|John Marriott]] as Cal\n* [[Russell Hicks (actor)|Russell Hicks]] as William Marshall\n* [[Lucien Littlefield]] as Manders\n* [[Virginia Brissac]] as Mrs. Hewitt\n* Terry Nibert as Julia\n* Henry 'Hot Shot' Thomas as Harold\n* [[Charles R.

Producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]] agreed, since none of Bankhead's films had been box office hits. (Coincidentally, Davis had recreated on film another of Bankhead's Broadway roles, Judith Traherne in ''[[Dark Victory (play)|Dark Victory]]''.) However, Davis was reluctant: \"On ''The Little Foxes'' I begged the producer, Samuel Goldwyn, to let Tallulah Bankhead play Regina because Tallulah was magnificent on the stage. He wouldn't let her.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUFplyZZAZsC&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=All About All About Eve: The Complete Behind-the-Scenes Story of the Bitchiest Film Ever Made! |first=Sam |last=Staggs |date=23 June 2001 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |via=Google Books |isbn=978-1466830431}}</ref> Initially [[Jack L. Warner]] refused to lend Davis to Goldwyn, who then offered the role to [[Miriam Hopkins]].<ref name=Higham>Higham 1981, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> When Wyler refused to work with her, Goldwyn resumed negotiations with Warner and finally secured Davis for $385,000. As a contract player at [[Warner Bros.]], Davis was earning $3,000 a week, and when she discovered how much Warner had received for her appearance in ''Foxes'', she demanded and ultimately received a share of the payment.<ref name=\"Stine\" />\n\nWyler encouraged Davis to see Bankhead in the original play, which she did despite major misgivings. She later regretted doing so because after watching Bankhead's performance and reading Hellman's screenplay she felt compelled to create a totally different interpretation of the role, one she didn't feel suited the character. Bankhead had portrayed Regina as a victim forced to fight for her survival due to the contempt with which her brothers treated her, but Davis played her as a cold, conniving, calculating woman wearing a death mask of white powder she insisted makeup artist [[Perc Westmore]] create for her.<ref name=Higham />\n\nIn her autobiography, ''A Lonely Life'', Davis gave a different version about having to see Bankhead in the play. \"A great admirer of hers, I wanted in no way to be influenced by her work. It was Willie's intention that I give a different interpretation of the part. I insisted that Tallulah had played it the only way it could be played. Miss Hellman's Regina was written with such definition that it could only be played one way.\"<ref>Davis 1962, p. 207.</ref> \"I had to do that part exactly the way Tallulah did it, because that's the way Lillian Hellman wrote it. But I was always sad that Tallulah couldn't record Regina from the theatre, because she was marvelous.\"\n\n[[File:The-Little-Foxes-Breakfast.jpg|thumb|Tallulah Bankhead, [[Charles Dingle]], [[Carl Benton Reid]] and [[Dan Duryea]] in the original Broadway production of ''The Little Foxes'' (1939)]]\n[[Charles Dingle]], [[Carl Benton Reid]], [[Dan Duryea]], and [[Patricia Collinge]] all reprised their critically acclaimed Broadway performances. Critics preferred Bankhead's rendition of the role to Davis's, though the supporting cast was highly praised. The character of David Hewitt was not in the original play. Hellman created him to add a second sympathetic male to stand alongside Horace among all the venomous Hubbard men.\n\nDavis and Wyler frequently fought during filming, about everything from her appearance (Wyler thought she looked like a [[Kabuki]] performer, but Davis wanted to look older than her age as the part was written for a 40-year-old) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a more feminine and sympathetic Regina, akin to Tallulah's interpretation). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of ''The Letter'', but this time she held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. \"It was the only time in my career that I walked out on a film after the shooting had begun,\" she later recalled. \"I was a nervous wreck due to the fact that my favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way ... I just didn't want to continue.\"<ref name=Stine /> The actress retreated to her rented house in [[Laguna Beach]] and \"''flatly'' refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to sue me for the ''entire'' cost of the production.\"<ref name=Stine /> A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by [[Katharine Hepburn]] or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress.<ref name=Higham /> Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s, she and Wyler never worked together again.<ref name=TCM /><ref name=Stine /><ref name=Higham />\nThe film premiered at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported it was seen by 22,163 persons on its opening day, setting what was then an all-time attendance mark for a normal opening day at the theatre.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1941/08/23/archives/film-record-set-by-little-foxes-22163-persons-saw-movie-at-music.html \"Film record set by 'Little Foxes'; 22,163 Persons Saw Movie at Music Hall on Thursday, a New Opening Day Mark.\"] ''The New York Times'', August 22, 1941.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Hellman wrote the play ''[[Another Part of the Forest]]'', a [[prequel]] to ''Foxes''. It was [[Another Part of the Forest (film)|adapted for the screen in 1948]].\n\nIn 2003, the character of Regina Giddens, played by Davis, was ranked #43 on the [[American Film Institute]] list of the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|50 Best Villains of American Cinema]].\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Bosley Crowther]] observed,\n{{quote|Lillian Hellman's grim and malignant melodrama... has now been translated to the screen with all its original viciousness intact ... [It] leaps to the front as the most bitingly sinister picture of the year and as one of the most cruelly realistic character studies yet shown on the screen ... Mr. Wyler, with the aid of Gregg Toland, has used the camera to sweep in the myriad small details of a mauve decadent household and the more indicative facets of the many characters... Miss Davis's performance in the role which Talluluh Bankhead played so brassily on the stage is abundant with color and mood... she does occasionally drop an unmistakable imitation of her predecessor... Better than that, however, are the other members of the cast. Charles Dingle as Brother Ben Hubbard, the oldest and sharpest of the rattlesnake clan, is the perfect villain in respectable garb. Carl Benton Reid as Brother Oscar is magnificently dark, sullen and undependable. Patricia Collinge repeats her excellent stage performance...

He presided over the [[Council of Rome]] of 382 that determined the canon or official list of Sacred Scripture.<ref>The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church</ref> He spoke out against major heresies in the church (including [[Apollinarianism]] and [[Pneumatomachi|Macedonianism]]) and encouraged production of the [[Vulgate]] [[Bible]] with his support for [[Jerome]].  He helped reconcile the relations between the [[Western Church|Church of Rome]] and the [[Church of Antioch]], and encouraged the veneration of martyrs.\n\nAs well as various prose letters and other pieces Damasus was the author of Latin verse.  [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] describes his epitaph for a young girl called Projecta (of great interest to scholars as the [[Projecta Casket]] in the [[British Museum]] may have been made for her) as \"a tissue of tags and clich\u00e9s shakily strung together and barely squeezed into the meter\".\n<ref>Cameron, 136-139; 136 and 137 are quoted in turn</ref>  Damasus has been described as \"the first society Pope\",<ref>Cameron, 136</ref> and was possibly a member of a group of Spanish Christians, largely related to each other, who were close to the Spaniard [[Theodosius I]].<ref>Cameron, 142-143</ref>\n\nA number of images of \"DAMAS\" in [[gold glass]] cups probably represent him and seem to be the first contemporary images of a pope to survive, though there is no real attempt at a likeness. \"Damas\" appears with other figures, including a Florus who may be Projecta's father.

The legend reads D N GRATIANVS P F AVG (''Dominus Noster Gratianus Pius Felix Augustus'').]] -->\n\nThe reign of [[Gratian]], which coincided with Damasus' papacy, forms an important epoch in ecclesiastical history, since during that period (359\u2013383), [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] for the first time became dominant throughout the empire. Under the influence of Ambrose, Gratian refused{{fact|date=May 2019}} to wear the insignia of the ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' as unbefitting a Christian, removed the [[Altar of Victory]] from the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] at Rome, despite protests from the pagan members of the Senate. Emperor Gratian also forbade legacies of real property to the [[Vestals]] and abolished other privileges belonging to them and to the pontiffs.\n\n==Early life==\nPope Damasus I was born in Rome around 305.<ref>''The Liturgy of the Hours'', Vol. I, 11 December.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Pope Damasus I|url = http://www.nndb.com/people/956/000096668/|website = www.nndb.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}</ref> Damasus' parents were Antonius, who became a priest at the Church of St. Lawrence (San Lorenzo) in Rome, and his wife Laurentia. Both parents originally come from the region of [[Lusitania]]. Damasus began his ecclesiastical career as a deacon in his father's church, where he went on to serve as a priest. This later became the basilica of [[San Lorenzo fuori le Mura|Saint Lawrence outside the Walls]] in Rome.<ref name=foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1226 Foley OFM, Leonard. \"St. Damasus I\", ''Saint of the Day'', (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media]</ref>\n \nDuring Damasus' early years, Constantine I rose to rule the [[Western Roman Empire]]. As emperor, he issued the [[Edict of Milan]] (313), which granted religious freedom to Christians in all parts of the Roman Empire. A crisis precipitated by the rejection of religious freedom by [[Licinius]], Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, in favor of [[paganism]] resulted in a civil war in 324 that placed Constantine firmly in control of a reunited Empire. This led to the establishment of Christian religious supremacy in [[Constantinople]] and gradually led to a See in that city which sought to rival the authority of the [[Holy See|Roman See]]. Damasus was most likely in his twenties at the time.\n\nWhen Pope Liberius was banished by Emperor [[Constantius II]] to [[Veria|Berea]] in 354, Damasus was [[deacon|archdeacon]] of the Roman church and followed Liberius into exile, though he immediately returned to Rome. During the period before Liberius' return, Damasus had a great share in the government of the church.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/DAMASUS.htm ST DAMASUS, POPE, CONFESSOR (A.D. 305\u2013384)] Butler, Alban. ''\"The Lives or the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints'', vol. III, ewtn</ref>\n\n==Succession crisis==\nIn the early [[Catholic Church|Church]], bishops were customarily elected by the [[clergy]] and the people of the diocese. While this simple method worked well in a small community of Christians unified by persecution, as the congregation grew in size, the acclamation of a new bishop was fraught with division, and rival claimants and a certain class hostility between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[plebeian]] candidates unsettled some episcopal elections. At the same time, 4th-century emperors expected each new pope-elect to be presented to them for approval, which sometimes led to state domination of the Church's internal affairs.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Pope Liberius]] on 24 September 366, Damasus succeeded to the Papacy amidst factional violence.  The deacons and laity, supported Liberius' [[deacon]] [[Antipope Ursicinus|Ursinus]]. The upper-class former partisans of [[Antipope Felix II|Felix]], who had ruled during Liberius' exile, supported the election of Damasus.\n\nThe two were elected simultaneously (Damasus' election was held in [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]]). [[J. N. D. Kelly]] states that Damasus  hired a gang of thugs that stormed the [[Basilica Julia|Julian Basilica]], carrying out a three-day massacre of the Ursinians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=J. N.

It describes Ursinus as being the valid successor to Liberius, and  Damasus as following a heretical interloper, Felix. This account also records that an armed force  instigated by  Damasus broke  into the Basilica of Julius and a three-day  slaughtering of those assembled there took place. After  gaining control of the Lateran basilica  Damasus  was  then ordained as bishop in the cathedral of Rome. However, Damasus  was  accused of bribing the urban officials of Rome to have Ursinus and  chief supporters exiled, including some presbyters.  As a result of this attempt, some of (the apparently quite numerous) supporters of Ursinus interrupted this process and rescued the presbyters, taking them to  the Basilica of Liberius  (identified as the \u201cbasilica of Sicinnius\u201d), the apparent  headquarters of the Ursinian sect. Damasus then responded  by  ordering an  attack against the Liberian basilica, resulting in another massacre: \"They broke down the doors and set fire underneath it, then rushed in...and killed a hundred and sixty of the people inside, both men and women.\u201d   Damasus next sent a final assault against some Ursinian supporters who had  fled to the cemetery of Saint Agnes, slaying many.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McIntyre |first1=Thomas J. |title=The First Pontiff: Pope Damasus I and the Expansion of the Roman Primacy |date=2015 |publisher=Electronic Theses & Dissertations. 1277 |pages=15, 33, 34 |url=https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2355&context=etd |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nChurch historians such as [[Jerome]] and [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], championed Damasus. At a synod in 378, Ursinus was condemned and Damasus exonerated and declared the true pope. The former antipope continued to intrigue against Damasus for the next few years and unsuccessfully attempted to revive his claim on Damasus's death. Ursinus was among the [[Arianism|Arian]] party in [[Milan]], according to [[Ambrose]].<ref>Ambrose, ''Epistles'' iv</ref>\n\n==Papacy==\n[[File:Damasus (Nuremberg chronicles f 131v 1.).jpg|thumb|Pope Damasus as depicted in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' ]]\nDamasus faced accusations of murder and adultery with a married woman<ref>M. Walsh, ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'' (HarperCollins Publishers: New York, 1991), 413.</ref> in his early years as Pope. [[Edward Gibbon]] writes, \"The enemies of Damasus styled him ''Auriscalpius Matronarum,'' the ladies' ear-scratcher.\"<ref name=\":0\">Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' chapter 25, n. 83</ref> The neutrality of these claims has come into question with some suggesting that the accusations were motivated by the schismatic conflict with the supporters of [[Arianism]].\n\nDamasus I was active in defending the [[Catholic Church]] against the threat of [[Schism (religion)|schism]]s. In two Roman synods (368 and 369) he condemned [[Apollinarianism]] and [[Pneumatomachi|Macedonianism]], and sent legates to the [[First Council of Constantinople]] that was convoked in 381 to address these [[Christian heresy|heresies]].<ref>https://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/CONSTAN1.HTM</ref>\n\n===Council of Rome of 382 and the Biblical canon===\nOne of the important works of Pope Damasus was to preside in the [[Council of Rome]] of 382 that determined the canon or official list of Sacred Scripture. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, states:\nA council probably held at Rome in 382 under Damasus gave a complete list of the canonical books of both the Old Testament and the New Testament (also known as the '[[Gelasian Decree]]' because it was reproduced by Gelasius in 495), which is identical with the list given at Trent. American Catholic priest and historian [[William Jurgens]] stated: \"The first part of this decree has long been known as the Decree of Damasus, and concerns the Holy Spirit and the seven-fold gifts. The second part of the decree is more familiarly known as the opening part of the Gelasian Decree, in regard to the canon of Scripture: De libris recipiendis vel non recipiendis. It is now commonly held that the part of the Gelasian Decree dealing with the accepted canon of Scripture is an authentic work of the Council of Rome of 382 A.D. and that Gelasius edited it again at the end of the fifth century, adding to it the catalog of the rejected books, the apocrypha. It is now almost universally accepted that these parts one and two of the Decree of Damasus are authentic parts of the Acts of the Council of Rome of 382 A.D. (Jurgens, Faith of the Early Fathers)\n\n===Jerome, the Vulgate and the Canon===\nPope Damasus appointed [[Jerome]] as his confidential secretary. Invited to Rome originally to a synod of 382 convened to end the [[Schism (religion)|schism]] of [[Antioch]], he made himself indispensable to the pope, and took a prominent place in his councils. Jerome spent three years (382\u2013385) in Rome in close intercourse with Pope Damasus and the leading Christians. Writing in 409, Jerome remarked, \"A great many years ago when I was helping Damasus, bishop of Rome with his ecclesiastical correspondence, and writing his answers to the questions referred to him by the councils of the east and west...\"<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF2-06/letters/lette123.htm ''Epistle'' cxx.10]</ref>\n\nIn order to put an end to the marked divergences in the western texts of that period, Damasus encouraged the highly respected scholar Jerome to revise the available [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] versions of the [[Bible]] into a more accurate [[Latin]] on the basis of the Greek [[New Testament]] and the [[Septuagint]], resulting in the [[Vulgate]]. According to Protestant biblical scholar, [[F.F. Bruce]], the commissioning of the Vulgate was a key moment in fixing the biblical canon in the [[Western Christianity|West]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://media.sabda.org/alkitab-2/PDF%20Books/00059%20Bruce%20The%20Canon%20of%20Scripture.pdf|title=The Canon of Scripture|last=Bruce|first=F.

He died in the reign of the emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] at the age of almost eighty\".<ref>''De Viris Illustribus'', ch. 103</ref> Damasus may be the author of the anonymous ''[[Carmen contra paganos]]'' (song against the pagans).<ref name=ODB>{{ODB|authorlink=Barry Baldwin|first=Barry|last=Baldwin|title=Carmen Contra Paganos}}</ref>\n\n====Letter of Jerome to Damasus====\n{{further|Letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus}}\nThe letters from Jerome to Damasus are examples of the primacy of the See of Peter:\n{{quote|Yet, though your greatness terrifies me, your kindness attracts me. From the priest I demand the safe-keeping of the victim, from the shepherd the protection due to the sheep. Away with all that is overweening; let the state of Roman majesty withdraw.

As I follow no leader save Christ, so I communicate with none but your blessedness, that is with the chair of Peter. For this, I know, is the rock on which the church is built! This is the house where alone the paschal lamb can be rightly eaten. This is the ark of Noah, and he who is not found in it shall perish when the flood prevails. But since by reason of my sins I have betaken myself to this desert which lies between Syria and the uncivilized waste, I cannot, owing to the great distance between us, always ask of your sanctity the holy thing of the Lord. Consequently I here follow the Egyptian confessors who share your faith, and anchor my frail craft under the shadow of their great argosies. I know nothing of Vitalis; I reject Meletius; I have nothing to do with Paulinus. He that gathers not with you scatters; he that is not of Christ is of Antichrist.<ref>Letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus, 376, 2.</ref>}}\n\n===Relations with the Eastern Church===\n\nThe Eastern Church, in the person of [[Basil of Caesarea]], earnestly sought the aid and encouragement of Damasus against an apparently triumphant [[Arianism]]. Damasus, however, harbored some degree of suspicion against the great [[Cappadocia]]n [[Doctor of the Church]]. In the matter of the [[Meletius of Antioch|Meletian Schism]] at Antioch, Damasus \u2014 together with [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], and his successor, [[Peter II of Alexandria]] \u2014 sympathized with the party of [[Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch|Paulinus]] as more sincerely representative of Nicene orthodoxy. On the death of [[Meletius of Antioch|Meletius]] he sought to secure the succession for Paulinus and to exclude [[Flavian I of Antioch|Flavian]].<ref>[[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]], ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.15</ref> During his papacy, Peter II of Alexandria sought refuge in [[Rome]] from the persecuting Arians. He was received by Damasus, who supported him against the Arians.<ref name=\"ce\"/> \n\nDamasus supported the appeal of the Christian senators to Emperor [[Gratian]] for the removal of the altar of Victory from the Senate House,<ref>Ambrose, ''Epistles'' xvii, n. 10</ref> and lived to welcome the famous edict of [[Theodosius I]], \"De fide Catholica\" (27 February 380),<ref>''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'' XVI, 1, 2</ref> which proclaimed as the religion of the Roman State that doctrine which [[Saint Peter|Peter]] had preached to the Romans and of which Damasus was head.<ref name=\"ce\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04613a.htm Shahan, Thomas. \"Pope St. Damasus I.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 4.

Damasus' regard for the Roman martyr is attested also by the tradition according to which the Pope built a church devoted to Laurence in his own house, [[San Lorenzo in Damaso]].\n\nDamasus was pope for eighteen years and two months. His feast day is 11 December.

He presided over the [[Council of Rome]] of 382 that determined the canon or official list of Sacred Scripture.<ref>The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church</ref> He spoke out against major heresies in the church (including [[Apollinarianism]] and [[Pneumatomachi|Macedonianism]]) and encouraged production of the [[Vulgate]] [[Bible]] with his support for [[Jerome]].  He helped reconcile the relations between the [[Western Church|Church of Rome]] and the [[Church of Antioch]], and encouraged the veneration of martyrs.\n\nAs well as various prose letters and other pieces Damasus was the author of Latin verse.  [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] describes his epitaph for a young girl called Projecta (of great interest to scholars as the [[Projecta Casket]] in the [[British Museum]] may have been made for her) as \"a tissue of tags and clich\u00e9s shakily strung together and barely squeezed into the meter\".\n<ref>Cameron, 136-139; 136 and 137 are quoted in turn</ref>  Damasus has been described as \"the first society Pope\",<ref>Cameron, 136</ref> and was possibly a member of a group of Spanish Christians, largely related to each other, who were close to the Spaniard [[Theodosius I]].<ref>Cameron, 142-143</ref>\n\nA number of images of \"DAMAS\" in [[gold glass]] cups probably represent him and seem to be the first contemporary images of a pope to survive, though there is no real attempt at a likeness. \"Damas\" appears with other figures, including a Florus who may be Projecta's father.

The legend reads D N GRATIANVS P F AVG (''Dominus Noster Gratianus Pius Felix Augustus'').]] -->\n\nThe reign of [[Gratian]], which coincided with Damasus' papacy, forms an important epoch in ecclesiastical history, since during that period (359\u2013383), [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] for the first time became dominant throughout the empire. Under the influence of Ambrose, Gratian refused{{fact|date=May 2019}} to wear the insignia of the ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' as unbefitting a Christian, removed the [[Altar of Victory]] from the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] at Rome, despite protests from the pagan members of the Senate. Emperor Gratian also forbade legacies of real property to the [[Vestals]] and abolished other privileges belonging to them and to the pontiffs.\n\n==Early life==\nPope Damasus I was born in Rome around 305.<ref>''The Liturgy of the Hours'', Vol. I, 11 December.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Pope Damasus I|url = http://www.nndb.com/people/956/000096668/|website = www.nndb.com|access-date = 2016-01-13}}</ref> Damasus' parents were Antonius, who became a priest at the Church of St. Lawrence (San Lorenzo) in Rome, and his wife Laurentia. Both parents originally come from the region of [[Lusitania]]. Damasus began his ecclesiastical career as a deacon in his father's church, where he went on to serve as a priest. This later became the basilica of [[San Lorenzo fuori le Mura|Saint Lawrence outside the Walls]] in Rome.<ref name=foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1226 Foley OFM, Leonard. \"St. Damasus I\", ''Saint of the Day'', (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media]</ref>\n \nDuring Damasus' early years, Constantine I rose to rule the [[Western Roman Empire]]. As emperor, he issued the [[Edict of Milan]] (313), which granted religious freedom to Christians in all parts of the Roman Empire. A crisis precipitated by the rejection of religious freedom by [[Licinius]], Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, in favor of [[paganism]] resulted in a civil war in 324 that placed Constantine firmly in control of a reunited Empire. This led to the establishment of Christian religious supremacy in [[Constantinople]] and gradually led to a See in that city which sought to rival the authority of the [[Holy See|Roman See]]. Damasus was most likely in his twenties at the time.\n\nWhen Pope Liberius was banished by Emperor [[Constantius II]] to [[Veria|Berea]] in 354, Damasus was [[deacon|archdeacon]] of the Roman church and followed Liberius into exile, though he immediately returned to Rome. During the period before Liberius' return, Damasus had a great share in the government of the church.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/DAMASUS.htm ST DAMASUS, POPE, CONFESSOR (A.D. 305\u2013384)] Butler, Alban. ''\"The Lives or the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints'', vol. III, ewtn</ref>\n\n==Succession crisis==\nIn the early [[Catholic Church|Church]], bishops were customarily elected by the [[clergy]] and the people of the diocese. While this simple method worked well in a small community of Christians unified by persecution, as the congregation grew in size, the acclamation of a new bishop was fraught with division, and rival claimants and a certain class hostility between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[plebeian]] candidates unsettled some episcopal elections. At the same time, 4th-century emperors expected each new pope-elect to be presented to them for approval, which sometimes led to state domination of the Church's internal affairs.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Pope Liberius]] on 24 September 366, Damasus succeeded to the Papacy amidst factional violence.  The deacons and laity, supported Liberius' [[deacon]] [[Antipope Ursicinus|Ursinus]]. The upper-class former partisans of [[Antipope Felix II|Felix]], who had ruled during Liberius' exile, supported the election of Damasus.\n\nThe two were elected simultaneously (Damasus' election was held in [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]]). [[J. N. D. Kelly]] states that Damasus  hired a gang of thugs that stormed the [[Basilica Julia|Julian Basilica]], carrying out a three-day massacre of the Ursinians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=J. N.

It describes Ursinus as being the valid successor to Liberius, and  Damasus as following a heretical interloper, Felix. This account also records that an armed force  instigated by  Damasus broke  into the Basilica of Julius and a three-day  slaughtering of those assembled there took place. After  gaining control of the Lateran basilica  Damasus  was  then ordained as bishop in the cathedral of Rome. However, Damasus  was  accused of bribing the urban officials of Rome to have Ursinus and  chief supporters exiled, including some presbyters.  As a result of this attempt, some of (the apparently quite numerous) supporters of Ursinus interrupted this process and rescued the presbyters, taking them to  the Basilica of Liberius  (identified as the \u201cbasilica of Sicinnius\u201d), the apparent  headquarters of the Ursinian sect. Damasus then responded  by  ordering an  attack against the Liberian basilica, resulting in another massacre: \"They broke down the doors and set fire underneath it, then rushed in...and killed a hundred and sixty of the people inside, both men and women.\u201d   Damasus next sent a final assault against some Ursinian supporters who had  fled to the cemetery of Saint Agnes, slaying many.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McIntyre |first1=Thomas J. |title=The First Pontiff: Pope Damasus I and the Expansion of the Roman Primacy |date=2015 |publisher=Electronic Theses & Dissertations. 1277 |pages=15, 33, 34 |url=https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2355&context=etd |accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nChurch historians such as [[Jerome]] and [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], championed Damasus. At a synod in 378, Ursinus was condemned and Damasus exonerated and declared the true pope. The former antipope continued to intrigue against Damasus for the next few years and unsuccessfully attempted to revive his claim on Damasus's death. Ursinus was among the [[Arianism|Arian]] party in [[Milan]], according to [[Ambrose]].<ref>Ambrose, ''Epistles'' iv</ref>\n\n==Papacy==\n[[File:Damasus (Nuremberg chronicles f 131v 1.).jpg|thumb|Pope Damasus as depicted in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' ]]\nDamasus faced accusations of murder and adultery with a married woman<ref>M. Walsh, ''Butler's Lives of the Saints'' (HarperCollins Publishers: New York, 1991), 413.</ref> in his early years as Pope. [[Edward Gibbon]] writes, \"The enemies of Damasus styled him ''Auriscalpius Matronarum,'' the ladies' ear-scratcher.\"<ref name=\":0\">Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' chapter 25, n. 83</ref> The neutrality of these claims has come into question with some suggesting that the accusations were motivated by the schismatic conflict with the supporters of [[Arianism]].\n\nDamasus I was active in defending the [[Catholic Church]] against the threat of [[Schism (religion)|schism]]s. In two Roman synods (368 and 369) he condemned [[Apollinarianism]] and [[Pneumatomachi|Macedonianism]], and sent legates to the [[First Council of Constantinople]] that was convoked in 381 to address these [[Christian heresy|heresies]].<ref>https://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/CONSTAN1.HTM</ref>\n\n===Council of Rome of 382 and the Biblical canon===\nOne of the important works of Pope Damasus was to preside in the [[Council of Rome]] of 382 that determined the canon or official list of Sacred Scripture. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, states:\nA council probably held at Rome in 382 under Damasus gave a complete list of the canonical books of both the Old Testament and the New Testament (also known as the '[[Gelasian Decree]]' because it was reproduced by Gelasius in 495), which is identical with the list given at Trent. American Catholic priest and historian [[William Jurgens]] stated: \"The first part of this decree has long been known as the Decree of Damasus, and concerns the Holy Spirit and the seven-fold gifts. The second part of the decree is more familiarly known as the opening part of the Gelasian Decree, in regard to the canon of Scripture: De libris recipiendis vel non recipiendis. It is now commonly held that the part of the Gelasian Decree dealing with the accepted canon of Scripture is an authentic work of the Council of Rome of 382 A.D. and that Gelasius edited it again at the end of the fifth century, adding to it the catalog of the rejected books, the apocrypha. It is now almost universally accepted that these parts one and two of the Decree of Damasus are authentic parts of the Acts of the Council of Rome of 382 A.D. (Jurgens, Faith of the Early Fathers)\n\n===Jerome, the Vulgate and the Canon===\nPope Damasus appointed [[Jerome]] as his confidential secretary. Invited to Rome originally to a synod of 382 convened to end the [[Schism (religion)|schism]] of [[Antioch]], he made himself indispensable to the pope, and took a prominent place in his councils. Jerome spent three years (382\u2013385) in Rome in close intercourse with Pope Damasus and the leading Christians. Writing in 409, Jerome remarked, \"A great many years ago when I was helping Damasus, bishop of Rome with his ecclesiastical correspondence, and writing his answers to the questions referred to him by the councils of the east and west...\"<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF2-06/letters/lette123.htm ''Epistle'' cxx.10]</ref>\n\nIn order to put an end to the marked divergences in the western texts of that period, Damasus encouraged the highly respected scholar Jerome to revise the available [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] versions of the [[Bible]] into a more accurate [[Latin]] on the basis of the Greek [[New Testament]] and the [[Septuagint]], resulting in the [[Vulgate]]. According to Protestant biblical scholar, [[F.F. Bruce]], the commissioning of the Vulgate was a key moment in fixing the biblical canon in the [[Western Christianity|West]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://media.sabda.org/alkitab-2/PDF%20Books/00059%20Bruce%20The%20Canon%20of%20Scripture.pdf|title=The Canon of Scripture|last=Bruce|first=F.

He died in the reign of the emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] at the age of almost eighty\".<ref>''De Viris Illustribus'', ch. 103</ref> Damasus may be the author of the anonymous ''[[Carmen contra paganos]]'' (song against the pagans).<ref name=ODB>{{ODB|authorlink=Barry Baldwin|first=Barry|last=Baldwin|title=Carmen Contra Paganos}}</ref>\n\n====Letter of Jerome to Damasus====\n{{further|Letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus}}\nThe letters from Jerome to Damasus are examples of the primacy of the See of Peter:\n{{quote|Yet, though your greatness terrifies me, your kindness attracts me. From the priest I demand the safe-keeping of the victim, from the shepherd the protection due to the sheep. Away with all that is overweening; let the state of Roman majesty withdraw.

This is the house where alone the paschal lamb can be rightly eaten. This is the ark of Noah, and he who is not found in it shall perish when the flood prevails. But since by reason of my sins I have betaken myself to this desert which lies between Syria and the uncivilized waste, I cannot, owing to the great distance between us, always ask of your sanctity the holy thing of the Lord. Consequently I here follow the Egyptian confessors who share your faith, and anchor my frail craft under the shadow of their great argosies.

Damasus, however, harbored some degree of suspicion against the great [[Cappadocia]]n [[Doctor of the Church]]. In the matter of the [[Meletius of Antioch|Meletian Schism]] at Antioch, Damasus \u2014 together with [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], and his successor, [[Peter II of Alexandria]] \u2014 sympathized with the party of [[Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch|Paulinus]] as more sincerely representative of Nicene orthodoxy. On the death of [[Meletius of Antioch|Meletius]] he sought to secure the succession for Paulinus and to exclude [[Flavian I of Antioch|Flavian]].<ref>[[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates]], ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5.15</ref> During his papacy, Peter II of Alexandria sought refuge in [[Rome]] from the persecuting Arians.

Damasus' regard for the Roman martyr is attested also by the tradition according to which the Pope built a church devoted to Laurence in his own house, [[San Lorenzo in Damaso]].\n\nDamasus was pope for eighteen years and two months. His feast day is 11 December.

Two of the gates, E73 and E75, can accommodate the [[Airbus A380]].\n\nAlong with the standard customs and immigration facilities, Terminal 1 also contains special customs \"B\" checkpoints along the international arrivals walkway. Passengers connecting from an international or trans-border arrival to another international (non-U.S.) departure in Terminal 1 go to one of these checkpoints for passport control and immigration checks, then are immediately directed to Pier E for departure.

The unsuspecting people took the bag of poisoned flour from Coutts and proceeded to a communal area in the hills between Kangaroo and Towallum Creeks. Here, they made damper from the flour and ate it.<ref name=\"lydon\" >{{Citation | author1=Lydon, Jane | title='no moral doubt...' : Aboriginal evidence and the Kangaroo Creek poisoning, 1847\u20131849 | publication-date=1996 | url=https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p72561/pdf/article0714.pdf | accessdate=5 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article141476489 |title=Poisoned Blacks|newspaper=[[Dungog Chronicle : Durham and Gloucester Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 April 1934 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=6 |via=Trove }}</ref>\n\nA couple of days later, several reports emerged of a large number of Aboriginal people becoming violently ill and dying in the hills behind Kangaroo Creek. The local Commissioner for Crown Lands, Oliver Fry, heard these reports from both white and black sources, and came to investigate. In January 1848, Fry visited the site and found the decomposing bodies of at least 23 people. He collected evidence including remnants of the damper that remained, and immediately arrested and charged Coutts for the crime. Local magistrates concluded Coutts should stand trial for wilful murder and he was transported to Sydney to be tried at the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"lydon\" />\n\nOn 23 February, Coutts appeared before judge [[Alfred Stephen]] and was given bail on \u00a31,000 worth of sureties. The case was delayed and on 10 May 1848, the Attorney General, [[John Plunkett]], decided not to proceed with the case. Plunkett did this even though he had a very strong suspicion of Coutts' guilt and was aware that justice was being \"entirely evaded\" by this decision. Coutts was subsequently discharged and returned to Kangaroo Creek.<ref name=\"lydon\" />\n\n==Moving northwards==\nDuring his time at Sydney, one of Coutts' hutkeepers at Kangaroo Creek was killed by local Gumbaynggirr in an apparent revenge attack. Coutts quickly sold out of his Kangaroo Creek holdings and in 1850 he took up the [[Tooloom Creek|Tooloom]] property in the ranges about 100&nbsp;km to the north of [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]]. He also invested in a steamer named the ''Raven'' which provided a river transport service between [[Brisbane]] and [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]. In 1851, Coutts looked to gain further property by taking a large flock of sheep further north to squat on land near to [[Camboon, Queensland|Camboon]] on the [[Dawson River (Queensland)|Dawson River]]. This region was being strongly defended from British colonisation by the resident [[Yiman people]] who killed several of Coutts' shepherds and speared to death Alexander \"Sandy\" Ross, who was a squatter accompanying Coutts in his attempt to set up a property. Due to the resistance of the Yiman, Coutts was forced to abandon the Dawson River and returned to Tooloom.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article677024 |title=Central Criminal Court|newspaper=[[The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=6 December 1851 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref> A few years later, he bought the [[Ellangowan, Queensland|Ellangowan]] property near [[Toowoomba]]. His wife died at this property in 1856 and the following year Coutts sold the ''Raven''.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1859, Coutts decided to retire from the violent yet profitable frontier pastoralist lifestyle and bought a mansion in the waterside Sydney suburb of [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] where he stayed until 1866.<ref name=\"couttsclan\" /> The residence he purchased, known as \"Balmoral House\", still exists today under that name at 46 Waterview Street in Balmain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Balmoral House |url=https://balmainwalks.org.au/tb_walk_stop/balmoral-house/ |website=Balmain Walks |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> In 1866, Coutts decided to return to the land and purchased the [[Toolburra, Queensland|North Toolburra]] property near [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]] in the recently created British colony of [[Queensland]]. By this stage, this area was hundreds of kilometres within the brutal frontier of British invasion but Coutts still managed to meet his death at Toolburra soon after moving there. In January 1868, Coutts walked under a tree that was being felled on this property and was hit on the head by a large branch which killed him instantly. A large funeral was organised at Warwick and he is buried in the Coutts family plot at [[Warwick General Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article82096059 |title=The Accidental Death of Thomas Coutts, Esq. |newspaper=[[Warwick Examiner and Times]] |location=Queensland, Australia |date=18 January 1868 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Thomas Coutts |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/181981281/thomas-coutts |website=Find a Grave |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Family and legacy==\nThomas Coutts had two notable brothers, one of which was Donald Coutts who accompanied Thomas throughout most of his pastoral pursuits.

The unsuspecting people took the bag of poisoned flour from Coutts and proceeded to a communal area in the hills between Kangaroo and Towallum Creeks. Here, they made damper from the flour and ate it.<ref name=\"lydon\" >{{Citation | author1=Lydon, Jane | title='no moral doubt...' : Aboriginal evidence and the Kangaroo Creek poisoning, 1847\u20131849 | publication-date=1996 | url=https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p72561/pdf/article0714.pdf | accessdate=5 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article141476489 |title=Poisoned Blacks|newspaper=[[Dungog Chronicle : Durham and Gloucester Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 April 1934 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=6 |via=Trove }}</ref>\n\nA couple of days later, several reports emerged of a large number of Aboriginal people becoming violently ill and dying in the hills behind Kangaroo Creek. The local Commissioner for Crown Lands, Oliver Fry, heard these reports from both white and black sources, and came to investigate. In January 1848, Fry visited the site and found the decomposing bodies of at least 23 people. He collected evidence including remnants of the damper that remained, and immediately arrested and charged Coutts for the crime. Local magistrates concluded Coutts should stand trial for wilful murder and he was transported to Sydney to be tried at the Supreme Court.<ref name=\"lydon\" />\n\nOn 23 February, Coutts appeared before judge [[Alfred Stephen]] and was given bail on \u00a31,000 worth of sureties. The case was delayed and on 10 May 1848, the Attorney General, [[John Plunkett]], decided not to proceed with the case. Plunkett did this even though he had a very strong suspicion of Coutts' guilt and was aware that justice was being \"entirely evaded\" by this decision. Coutts was subsequently discharged and returned to Kangaroo Creek.<ref name=\"lydon\" />\n\n==Moving northwards==\nDuring his time at Sydney, one of Coutts' hutkeepers at Kangaroo Creek was killed by local Gumbaynggirr in an apparent revenge attack. Coutts quickly sold out of his Kangaroo Creek holdings and in 1850 he took up the [[Tooloom Creek|Tooloom]] property in the ranges about 100km to the north of [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]]. He also invested in a steamer named the ''Raven'' which provided a river transport service between [[Brisbane]] and [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]. In 1851, Coutts looked to gain further property by taking a large flock of sheep further north to squat on land near to [[Camboon, Queensland|Camboon]] on the [[Dawson River (Queensland)|Dawson River]]. This region was being strongly defended from British colonisation by the resident [[Yiman people]] who killed several of Coutts' shepherds and speared to death Alexander \"Sandy\" Ross, who was a squatter accompanying Coutts in his attempt to set up a property. Due to the resistance of the Yiman, Coutts was forced to abandon the Dawson River and returned to Tooloom.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article677024 |title=Central Criminal Court|newspaper=[[The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=6 December 1851 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref> A few years later, he bought the [[Ellangowan, Queensland|Ellangowan]] property near [[Toowoomba]]. His wife died at this property in 1856 and the following year Coutts sold the ''Raven''.\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1859, Coutts decided to retire from the violent yet profitable frontier pastoralist lifestyle and bought a mansion in the waterside Sydney suburb of [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] where he stayed until 1866.<ref name=\"couttsclan\" /> The residence he purchased, known as \"Balmoral House\", still exists today under that name at 46 Waterview Street in Balmain.<ref>{{cite web |title=Balmoral House |url=https://balmainwalks.org.au/tb_walk_stop/balmoral-house/ |website=Balmain Walks |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> In 1866, Coutts decided to return to the land and purchased the [[Toolburra, Queensland|North Toolburra]] property near [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]] in the recently created British colony of [[Queensland]]. By this stage, this area was hundreds of kilometres within the brutal frontier of British invasion but Coutts still managed to meet his death at Toolburra soon after moving there. In January 1868, Coutts walked under a tree that was being felled on this property and was hit on the head by a large branch which killed him instantly. A large funeral was organised at Warwick and he is buried in the Coutts family plot at [[Warwick General Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article82096059 |title=The Accidental Death of Thomas Coutts, Esq. |newspaper=[[Warwick Examiner and Times]] |location=Queensland, Australia |date=18 January 1868 |access-date=5 April 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Thomas Coutts |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/181981281/thomas-coutts |website=Find a Grave |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Family and legacy==\nThomas Coutts had two notable brothers, one of which was Donald Coutts who accompanied Thomas throughout most of his pastoral pursuits.
