With a curiosity about nature, he studied the heavens using a telescope from his father and observed the birds flying. Essentially a country boy, he loved the outdoors and hiking with his father on trips to Worcester and became an excellent marksman with a rifle.<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|63,64}} In 1898, his mother contracted tuberculosis and they moved back to Worcester for the clear air. On Sundays, the family attended the Episcopal church, and Robert sang in the choir.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|16}}\n\n===Childhood experiment===\nWith the [[electrification]] of American cities in the 1880s, the young Goddard became interested in science\u2014specifically, engineering and technology. When his father showed him how to generate static electricity on the family's carpet, the five-year-old's imagination was sparked.

He became a thorough diarist and documenter of his work\u2014a skill that would greatly benefit his later career. These interests merged at age 16, when Goddard attempted to construct a balloon out of [[aluminum]], shaping the raw metal in his home workshop, and filling it with hydrogen. After nearly five weeks of methodical, documented efforts, he finally abandoned the project, remarking, \"... balloon will not go up. ... Aluminum is too heavy. Failior {{sic}} crowns enterprise.\" However, the lesson of this failure did not restrain Goddard's growing determination and confidence in his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|21}} He wrote in 1927, \"I imagine an innate interest in mechanical things was inherited from a number of ancestors  who were machinists.\" <ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|7}}\n\n===Cherry tree dream===\nHe became interested in space when he read [[H. G. Wells]]' science fiction classic ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' at 16 years old.<ref name=\"GoddardBio\">{{Cite web | url = http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/people/biographies/goddard.pdf | publisher = [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] | title = Goddard Biography}}.</ref> His dedication to pursuing space flight became fixed on October 19, 1899. The 17-year-old Goddard climbed a cherry tree to cut off dead limbs. He was transfixed by the sky, and his imagination grew. He later wrote:\n\n{{quote |On this day I climbed a tall cherry tree at the back of the barn ... and as I looked toward the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the ''possibility'' of ascending to Mars, and how it would look on a small scale, if sent up from the meadow at my feet. I have several photographs of the tree, taken since, with the little ladder I made to climb it, leaning against it.\nIt seemed to me then that a weight whirling around a horizontal shaft, moving more rapidly above than below, could furnish lift by virtue of the greater centrifugal force at the top of the path.\n\nI was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended. Existence at last seemed very purposive.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|26}}<ref name=\"NASA Goddard\" >{{cite web\n  | url = http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sgoddard.htm\n  | title = Robert Goddard and His Rockets\n  | publisher = NASA}}</ref>}}\n\nFor the rest of his life, he observed October 19 as \"Anniversary Day\", a private commemoration of the day of his greatest inspiration.\n\n== Education and early studies ==\n\nThe young Goddard was a thin and frail boy, almost always in fragile health. He suffered from stomach problems, pleurisy, colds, and bronchitis, and he fell two years behind his classmates. He became a voracious reader, regularly visiting the local public library to borrow books on the physical sciences.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|16,19}}\n\n===Aerodynamics and motion===\n\nGoddard's interest in aerodynamics led him to study some of [[Samuel Langley]]'s scientific papers in the periodical ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]''. In these papers, Langley wrote that birds flap their wings with different force on each side to turn in the air. Inspired by these articles, the teenage Goddard watched swallows and chimney swifts from the porch of his home, noting how subtly the birds moved their wings to control their flight. He noted how remarkably the birds controlled their flight with their tail feathers, which he called the birds' equivalent of [[ailerons]]. He took exception to some of Langley's conclusions and in 1901 wrote a letter to ''St. Nicholas'' magazine<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|5}} with his own ideas. The editor of  ''St. Nicholas'' declined to publish Goddard's letter, remarking that birds fly with a certain amount of intelligence and that \"machines will not act with such intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|31}} Goddard disagreed, believing that a man could control a flying machine with his own intelligence.\n\nAround this time, Goddard read [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', and found that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law of Motion]] applied to motion in space. He wrote later about his own tests of the Law:\n\n{{quote |I began to realize that there might be something after all to Newton's Laws. The Third Law was accordingly tested, both with devices suspended by rubber bands and by devices on floats, in the little brook back of the barn, and the said law was verified conclusively. It made me realize that if a way to navigate space were to be discovered, or invented, it would be the result of a knowledge of physics and mathematics.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}}}}\n\n===Academics===\nAs his health improved, Goddard continued his formal schooling as a 19-year-old sophomore at [[South High Community School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm|title=Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Collection \u2013 Archives and Special Collections \u2013 Clark University|work=clarku.edu}}</ref> in Worcester in 1901. He excelled in his coursework, and his peers twice elected him class president. Making up for  lost time, he studied books on mathematics, astronomy, mechanics and composition from the school library.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}} At his graduation ceremony in 1904, he gave his class oration as [[valedictorian]]. In his speech, entitled \"On Taking Things for Granted\", Goddard included a section that would become emblematic of his life:\n\n<blockquote>[J]ust as in the sciences we have learned that we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|19}}\n</blockquote>\n\nGoddard enrolled at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in 1904.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|41}} He quickly impressed the head of the physics department, A. Wilmer Duff, with his thirst for knowledge, and Duff took him on as a laboratory assistant and tutor.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|42}} At WPI, Goddard joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity and began a long courtship with high school classmate Miriam Olmstead, an honor student who had graduated with him as [[salutatorian]]. Eventually, she and Goddard were engaged, but they drifted apart and ended the engagement around 1909.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp |51}}\n\nGoddard received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in physics from Worcester Polytechnic in 1908,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} and after serving there for a year as an instructor in physics, he began his graduate studies at [[Clark University]] in Worcester in the fall of 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/library/collections/rgoddard.html | publisher =WPI George C. Gordon Library | title = Robert Goddard |date= |accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> Goddard received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in physics from Clark University in 1910, and then stayed at Clark to complete his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics in 1911. He spent another year at Clark as an honorary fellow in physics, and in 1912 he accepted a research fellowship at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Frist Campus Center|Palmer Physical Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|56\u201358}}\n\n===First scientific writings===\nThe high school student summed up his ideas on space travel in a proposed article, \"The Navigation of Space,\" which he submitted to the ''Popular Science News''. The journal's editor returned it, saying that they could not use it \"in the near future.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|34}}\n\nWhile still an undergraduate, Goddard wrote a paper proposing a method for balancing [[airplane]]s using gyro-stabilization. He submitted the idea to ''[[Scientific American]]'', which published the paper in 1907. Goddard later wrote in his diaries that he believed his paper was the first proposal of a way to automatically stabilize aircraft in flight.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} His proposal came around the same time as other scientists were making breakthroughs in developing functional [[gyroscope]]s.\n\nWhile studying physics at WPI, ideas came to Goddard's mind that sometimes seemed impossible, but he was compelled to record them for future investigation. He wrote that \"there was something inside which simply would not stop working.\" He purchased some cloth-covered notebooks and began filling them with a variety of thoughts, mostly concerning his dream of space travel.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|11\u201313}} He considered centrifugal force, radio waves, magnetic reaction, solar energy, atomic energy, ion or electrostatic propulsion and other methods to reach space. After experimenting with solid fuel rockets he was convinced by 1909 that chemical-propellant engines were the answer.<ref name= \"Frank\" />{{rp|11\u201312}} A particularly complex concept was set down in June 1908: Sending a camera around distant planets, guided by measurements of gravity along the trajectory, and returning to earth.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|14}}\n\nHis first writing on the possibility of a liquid-fueled rocket came on February 2, 1909. Goddard had begun to study ways of increasing a rocket's efficiency using methods differing from conventional [[solid-fuel rocket]]s. He wrote in his notebook about using liquid hydrogen as a fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. He believed that 50 percent efficiency could be achieved with these liquid propellants (i.e., half of the heat energy of combustion converted to the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|55}}\n\n==First patents==\nIn the decades around 1910, radio was a new technology, fertile for innovation. In 1912, while working at Princeton University, Goddard investigated the effects of radio waves on insulators.<ref>Goddard, Robert H. \"On ponderomotive force upon a dielectric which carries a displacement current in a magnetic field\", ''[[Physical Review]]'', Vol. 6(2), pp. 99\u2013120 (August 1914).</ref> In order to generate radio-frequency power, he invented a vacuum tube with a beam deflection<ref>{{US patent|1159209}}</ref> that operated like a cathode-ray oscillator tube. His patent on this tube, which predated that of [[Lee De Forest]], became central in the suit between [[Arthur A. Collins]], whose small company made radio transmitter tubes, and [[AT&T]] and [[RCA]] over his use of [[vacuum tube]] technology.  Goddard accepted only a consultant's fee from Collins when the suit was dropped. Eventually the two big companies allowed the country's growing electronics industry to use the De Forest patents freely.<ref>McElroy, Gil, \"The Collins 45A \u2013 How Art Collins met Robert Goddard\", ''QST'', Vol. 81(2), pp. 44\u201346 (February 1997).</ref>\n\n===Rocket math===\nBy 1912 he had in his spare time, using calculus, developed the mathematics which allowed him to calculate the position and velocity of a rocket in vertical flight, given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity (with respect to the rocket frame) of the exhaust gases. In effect he had independently developed the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] published a decade earlier in Russia. For vertical flight he included the effects of gravity and aerodynamic drag.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|136}}\n\nHis first goal was to build a [[Rocketsonde|sounding rocket]] with which to study the atmosphere. Not only would such investigation aid meteorology, but it was necessary to determine temperature, density and wind speed in order to design efficient space launch vehicles. He was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was in fact to develop a vehicle for flights into space, since most scientists, especially in the United States, did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit, nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas. Later, in 1933, Goddard said that \"[I]n no case must we allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel, test by test and step by step, until one day we succeed, cost what it may.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|65,67,74,101}}\n\n===Fight to survive===\nIn early 1913, Goddard became seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]] and had to leave his position at Princeton. He then returned to Worcester, where he began a prolonged process of recovery at home. His doctors did not expect him to live. He decided he should spend time outside in the fresh air and walk for exercise, and he gradually improved.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61\u201364}} When his nurse discovered some of his notes in his bed, he kept them, arguing, \"I have to live to do this work.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|66}}\n\nIt was during this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most important work. As his symptoms subsided, he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. He was afraid that nobody would be able to read his scribbling should he \nsuccumb.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n===Foundational patents===\nIn the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, [[patents]] were considered essential, not only to protect original work but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure those ideas before someone else did\u2014and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote descriptions concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent lawyer in  Worcester who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard's first patent application was submitted in October 1913.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|63\u201370}}\n\nIn 1914, his first two landmark patents were accepted and registered. The first, {{US patent|1102653}}, described a multi-stage rocket fueled with a solid \"explosive material.\" The second, {{US patent|1103503}}, described a rocket fueled with a [[solid fuel]] (explosive material) or with [[liquid propellant]]s (gasoline and liquid nitrous oxide). The two patents would eventually become important milestones in the history of rocketry.<ref name=\"Sea and Sky: Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.seasky.org/spacexp/sky5d1.html\n  | title = Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\n  | publisher = Sea and Sky}}</ref><ref name=\"Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.russianspaceweb.com/chronology_XX.html\n  | title = Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\n  | publisher = Russian Space Web}}</ref> Overall, 214 patents were published, some posthumously by his wife.\n\n== Early rocketry research ==\n[[File:Robert Goddard footage.ogv|thumb|right|Video clips of Goddard's launches and other events in his life]]\nIn the fall of 1914, Goddard's health had improved, and he accepted a part-time position as an instructor and research fellow at Clark University.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|73}} His position at Clark allowed him to further his rocketry research. He ordered numerous supplies that could be used to build rocket prototypes for launch and spent much of 1915 in preparation for his first tests. Goddard's first test launch of a powder rocket came on an early evening in 1915 following his daytime classes at Clark.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|74}} The launch was loud and bright enough to arouse the alarm of the campus janitor, and Goddard had to reassure him that his experiments, while being serious study, were also quite harmless. After this incident, Goddard took his experiments inside the physics lab, in order to limit any disturbance.\n\nAt the Clark physics lab, Goddard conducted static tests of powder rockets to measure their thrust and efficiency. He found his earlier estimates to be verified; powder rockets were converting only about two percent of the thermal energy in their fuel into thrust and kinetic energy. At this point he applied [[de Laval nozzle]]s, which were generally used with steam turbine engines, and these greatly improved efficiency. (Of the several definitions of rocket efficiency, Goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the ''internal efficiency'' of the engine: the ratio of the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion, expressed as a percentage.)<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|130}} By mid-summer of 1915, Goddard had obtained an average efficiency of 40 percent with a nozzle exit velocity of {{nowrap|6728 feet (2051 meters) per second}}.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|75}} Connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion (de Laval) nozzles, Goddard was able in static tests to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63% and exhaust velocities of over 7000 feet (2134 meters) per second.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|78}}\n\nFew would recognize it at the time, but this little engine was a major breakthrough. These experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape Earth and travel into space. This engine and subsequent experiments sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution were the beginning of modern rocketry and, ultimately, space exploration.<ref name=\"Pendray\">{{cite book|last=Pendray|first=G.

Goddard responded with a detailed manuscript he had already prepared, entitled ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|79}}\n\nIn January 1917, the Smithsonian agreed to provide Goddard with a five-year grant totaling {{nowrap|US$5000}}.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|84}} Afterward, Clark was able to contribute {{nowrap|US$3500 }} and the use of their physics lab to the project. Worcester Polytechnic Institute also allowed him to use its abandoned Magnetics Laboratory on the edge of campus during this time, as a safe place for testing.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|85}} WPI also made some parts in their machine shop.\n\nGoddard's fellow Clark scientists were astonished at the unusually large Smithsonian grant for rocket research, which they thought was not real science.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|85}} Decades later, rocket scientists who knew how much it cost to research and develop rockets said that he had received little financial support.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Viking Rocket Story|last=Rosen|first=Milton W.|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1955|isbn=|location=New York|pages=11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Enterprise|last=Grey|first=Jerry|publisher=William Morrow and Company|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York|pages=260\u2013688-03462\u20134}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, at the insistence of Dr. Arthur G. Webster, the world-renowned head of Clark's physics department,  Goddard arranged for the Smithsonian to publish the paper,  ''A Method...,'' which documented his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nWhile at Clark University, Goddard did research into solar power using a parabolic dish to concentrate the Sun's rays on a machined piece of [[quartz]], that was sprayed with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which then heated water and drove an electric generator. Goddard believed his invention had overcome all the obstacles that had previously defeated other scientists and inventors, and he had his findings published in the November 1929 issue of  ''Popular Science''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 \"A New Invention To Harness The Sun\"], ''Popular Science'', November 1929.</ref>\n\n===Goddard's military rocket===\nNot all of Goddard's early work was geared towards space travel. As the United States entered World War I in 1917, the country's universities began to lend their services to the war effort. Goddard believed his rocket research could be applied to many different military applications, including mobile artillery, field weapons and naval [[torpedo]]es. He made proposals to the Navy and Army. No record exists in his papers of any interest by the Navy to Goddard's inquiry. However, Army Ordnance was quite interested, and Goddard met several times with Army personnel.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89}}\n\nDuring this time, Goddard was also contacted, in early 1918, by a civilian industrialist in Worcester about the possibility of manufacturing rockets for the military. However, as the businessman's enthusiasm grew, so did Goddard's suspicion. Talks eventually broke down as Goddard began to fear his work might be appropriated by the business. However, an [[Army Signal Corps]] officer tried to make Goddard cooperate, but he was called off by General [[George Squier]] of the Signal Corps who had been contacted by Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89\u201391}} Goddard became leery of working with corporations and was careful to secure patents to \"protect his ideas.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|152}} These events led to the Signal Corps sponsoring Goddard's work during World War I.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nGoddard proposed to the Army an idea for a tube-based rocket launcher as a light infantry weapon. The launcher concept became the precursor to the [[bazooka]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|92}} The rocket-powered, recoil-free weapon was the brainchild of Goddard as a side project (under Army contract) of his work on rocket propulsion. Goddard, during his [[tenure]] at [[Clark University]], and working at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] for security reasons, designed the tube-fired rocket for military use during World War I. He and his co-worker, Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]] successfully demonstrated his rocket to the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Maryland]], on November 6, 1918, using two music stands for a launch platform. The Army was impressed, but the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Compi\u00e8gne Armistice]] was signed only five days later, and further development was discontinued as World War I ended.<ref name=\"NASA \u2013 Dr. Robert H.

Goddard continued to be a part-time consultant to the U.S. Government at [[Indian Head, Maryland]],<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|121}} until 1923, but his focus had turned to other research involving rocket propulsion, including work with liquid fuels and liquid oxygen.\n\nLater, the former Clark University researcher Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]], and Army officers Col. [[Leslie Skinner]] and Lt. [[Edward Uhl]] continued Goddard's work on the bazooka. A [[shaped-charge]] warhead was attached to the rocket, leading to the tank-killing weapon used in World War II and to many other powerful rocket weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|305}}\n\n== ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes'' ==\n\nIn 1919 Goddard thought that it would be premature to disclose the results of his experiments because his engine was not sufficiently developed. Dr. Webster realized that Goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that Goddard publish his progress so far or he would take care of it himself, so Goddard asked the Smithsonian Institution if it would publish the report, updated with footnotes, that he had submitted in late 1916.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nIn late 1919, the Smithsonian published Goddard's groundbreaking work, ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''. The report describes Goddard's mathematical theories of rocket flight, his experiments with solid-fuel rockets, and the possibilities he saw of exploring Earth's atmosphere and beyond. Along with [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]]'s earlier work, ''The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices'',<ref name=\"Tsiolkovsky, Exploration of Cosmic Space\">{{cite book\n  |title=The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices\n  |first=Konstantin |last=Tsiolkovsky\n  |authorlink=Konstantin Tsiolkovsky\n  |year=1903\n  |ref=Tsiolkovsky, Exploration of Cosmic Space\n}}</ref> which was not widely disseminated outside Russia,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ley|first1=Willy|title=Events in Space|url=https://archive.org/details/eventsinspace0000leyw|url-access=registration|date=1969|publisher=David McKay Company|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/eventsinspace0000leyw/page/9 9]}}</ref> Goddard's report is regarded as one of the pioneering works of the science of rocketry, and 1750 copies were distributed worldwide.<ref name=\"Emme\">{{cite book|last=Emme|first=Eugene M.|title=A History of Spaceflight|year=1965|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|page=90}}</ref> Goddard also sent a copy to individuals who requested one, until his personal supply was exhausted. Smithsonian aerospace historian Frank Winter said that this paper was \"one of the key catalysts behind the international rocket movement of the 1920s and 30s.\" <ref name= \"NYT\"/>\n\nGoddard described extensive experiments with solid-fuel [[rocket engine]]s burning high-grade nitrocellulose [[smokeless powder]].

Included as a [[thought experiment]] was the idea of launching a rocket to the Moon and igniting a mass of flash powder on its surface, so as to be visible through a telescope. He discussed the matter seriously, down to an estimate of the amount of powder required. Goddard's conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 3.21 tons could produce a flash \"just visible\" from Earth, assuming a final payload weight of 10.7 pounds.<ref name=\"Method\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Goddard|editor1-first=Esther C. |editor2-first=G.

He did, though, publish and talk about the rocket principle and [[sounding rockets]], since these subjects were not too \"far out.\" In a letter to the Smithsonian, dated March 1920, he discussed: photographing the Moon and planets from rocket-powered fly-by probes, sending messages to distant civilizations on inscribed metal plates, the use of solar energy in space, and the idea of high-velocity ion propulsion. In that same letter, Goddard clearly describes the concept of the [[Atmospheric reentry#Ablative|ablative heat shield]], suggesting the landing apparatus be covered with \"layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between\" designed to erode in the same way as the surface of a meteor.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/stories/march-1920-report-concerning-further-developments-space-travel\n|last=Goddard  |first=Robert H.\n  |title=Report Concerning Further Developments\n  |date=March 1920\n  |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution Archives\n}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |bgcolor=#F5F5F5 |salign=center |align=right |width=33% |quote=Every vision is a joke until the first man accomplishes it; once realized, it becomes commonplace.|source=&ndash;Response to a reporter's question following criticism in ''The New York Times'', 1920.<ref name=\"Clark University\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www2.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm#nyt\n|title=When was the famous New York Times editorial about Dr. Goddard?\n|publisher=Clark University\n|accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref><ref name=\"NASA\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/f_goddard.html\n|title=Robert Goddard: A Man and His Rocket\n|publisher=NASA\n|accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>}}\n\n===Publicity and criticism===\nThe publication of Goddard's document gained him national attention from U.S. newspapers, most of it negative. Although Goddard's discussion of targeting the moon was only a small part of the work as a whole (eight lines on the next to last page of 69 pages), and was intended as an illustration of the possibilities rather than a declaration of intent, the papers sensationalized his ideas to the point of misrepresentation and ridicule. Even the Smithsonian had to abstain from publicity because of the amount of ridiculous correspondence received from the general public.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|113}} David Lasser, who co-founded the [[American Rocket Society]] (ARS), wrote in 1931 that Goddard was subjected in the press to the \"most violent attacks.\"<ref name=\"Lasser\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Lasser|editor1-first=David |editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Godwin |title=The Conquest of Space|year=2002|publisher=Apogee Books|location=Burlington, Ontario|isbn=1-896522-92-0|page=38}}</ref>\n\nOn January 12, 1920, a front-page story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"Believes Rocket Can Reach Moon\", reported a Smithsonian press release about a \"multiple-charge, high-efficiency rocket.\" The chief application envisaged was \"the possibility of sending recording apparatus to moderate and extreme altitudes within the Earth's atmosphere\", the advantage over balloon-carried instruments being ease of recovery, since \"the new rocket apparatus would go straight up and come straight down.\" But it also mentioned a proposal \"to [send] to the dark part of the new moon a sufficiently large amount of the most brilliant flash powder which, in being ignited on impact, would be plainly visible in a powerful telescope.

After one of Goddard's experiments in 1929, a local Worcester newspaper carried the mocking headline \"Moon rocket misses target by 238,799{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;miles.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|editor=Nelson, Craig\n|title=Rocket Men: The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon\n|publisher=\n|location=\n|year=1713\n|pages=\n|isbn=9781101057735\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWMivGgbM7kC&pg=PT96 }}\n</ref>\n\nThough the unimaginitive of the public chuckled at the \"moon man,\" his groundbreaking paper was read seriously by many rocketeers in America, Europe, and Russia who were stirred to build their own rockets. This work was his most important contribution to the quest to \"aim for the stars.\" <ref name= \"Gainor\" />{{rp|50}}\n\nGoddard worked alone with just his team of mechanics and machinists for many years.  This was a result of the harsh criticism from the media and other scientists, and his understanding of the military applications which foreign powers might use. Goddard became increasingly suspicious of others and often worked alone, except during the two World Wars, which limited the impact of much of his work. Another limiting factor was the lack of support from the American government, military and academia, all failing to understand the value of the rocket to study the atmosphere and near space, and for military applications. As Germany became ever more war-like, he refused to communicate with German rocket experimenters, though he received more and more of their correspondence.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|131}}\n\n===='A Correction'====\nForty-nine years after its editorial mocking Goddard, on July 17, 1969\u2014the day after the launch of [[Apollo 11]]\u2014''The New York Times'' published a short item under the headline \"A Correction.\" The three-paragraph statement summarized its 1920 editorial and concluded:\n<blockquote>Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.<ref>''The New York Times'', July 17, 1969, p. 43,</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==First liquid-fueled flight==\n\nGoddard began considering liquid propellants, including hydrogen and oxygen, as early as 1909. He knew that hydrogen and oxygen was the most efficient fuel/oxidizer combination. Liquid hydrogen was not readily available in 1921, however, and he selected gasoline as the safest fuel to handle.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|13}}\n\n===First static tests===\n[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Robert Goddard, bundled against the cold weather of March 16, 1926, holds the launching frame of his most notable invention \u2014 the first liquid-fueled rocket.]]\nGoddard began experimenting with liquid oxidizer, [[liquid fuel rocket]]s in September 1921, and successfully tested the first liquid propellant engine in November 1923.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|520}} It had a cylindrical [[combustion chamber]], using impinging jets to mix and atomize [[liquid oxygen]] and [[gasoline]].<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|499\u2013500}}\n\nIn 1924\u201325, Goddard had problems developing a high-pressure [[piston pump]] to send fuel to the combustion chamber. He wanted to scale up the experiments, but his funding would not allow such growth. He decided to forego the pumps and use a pressurized fuel feed system applying pressure to the fuel tank from a tank of [[inert gas]], a technique used today. The liquid oxygen, some of which evaporated,  provided its own pressure.\n\nOn December 6, 1925, he tested the simpler pressure feed system. He conducted a static test on the firing stand at the Clark University physics laboratory. The engine successfully lifted its own weight in a 27-second test in the static rack. It was a major success for Goddard, proving that a liquid fuel rocket was possible.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|140}} The test moved Goddard an important step closer to launching a rocket with liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard conducted an additional test in December, and two more in January 1926. After that, he began preparing for a possible launch of the rocket system.\n\n===First flight===\nGoddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled ([[bipropellant rocket|gasoline and liquid oxygen]]) rocket on March 16, 1926, in [[Auburn, Massachusetts]]. Present at the launch were his crew chief Henry Sachs, Esther Goddard, and Percy Roope, who was Clark's assistant professor in the physics department. Goddard's diary entry of the event was notable for its understatement:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 16. Went to Auburn with S[achs] in am. E[sther] and Mr. Roope came out at 1 p.m. Tried rocket at 2.30. It rose 41 feet & went 184 feet, in 2.5 secs., after the lower half of the nozzle burned off. Brought materials to lab. ...<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHis diary entry the next day elaborated:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 17, 1926. The first flight with a rocket using liquid propellants was made yesterday at Aunt Effie's farm in Auburn. ... \nEven though the release was pulled, the rocket did not rise at first, but the flame came out, and there was a steady roar. After a number of seconds it rose, slowly until it cleared the frame, and then at express train speed, curving over to the left, and striking the ice and snow, still going at a rapid rate.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe rocket, which was later dubbed \"Nell\", rose just 41&nbsp;feet during a 2.5-second flight that ended 184 feet away in a cabbage field,<ref>{{cite book|last=Streissguth|first=Thomas|title=Rocket man: the story of Robert Goddard|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=1995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37 37]|isbn=0-87614-863-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37}}</ref> but it was an important demonstration that liquid fuels and oxidizers were possible propellants for larger rockets. The launch site is now a [[National Historic Landmark]], the [[Goddard Rocket Launching Site]].\n\nViewers familiar with more modern rocket designs may find it difficult to distinguish the rocket from its launching apparatus in the well-known picture of \"Nell\". The complete rocket is significantly taller than Goddard but does not include the pyramidal support structure which he is grasping. The rocket's [[combustion chamber]] is the small cylinder at the top; the [[nozzle]] is visible beneath it. The fuel tank, which is also part of the rocket, is the larger cylinder opposite Goddard's torso. The fuel tank is directly beneath the nozzle and is protected from the motor's exhaust by an [[asbestos]] cone. Asbestos-wrapped aluminum tubes connect the motor to the tanks, providing both support and fuel transport.<ref>[http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf NASA, ''Discover NASA and You''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527221503/http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }}.</ref> This layout is no longer used, since the experiment showed that this was [[Pendulum rocket fallacy|no more stable]] than placing the combustion chamber and nozzle at the base. By May, after a series of modifications to simplify the plumbing, the combustion chamber and nozzle were placed in the now classic position, at the lower end of the rocket.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|259}}\n\nGoddard determined early that fins alone were not sufficient to stabilize the rocket in flight and keep it on the desired trajectory in the face of winds aloft and other disturbing forces. He added movable vanes in the exhaust, controlled by a gyroscope, to control and steer his rocket. (The Germans used this technique in their V-2.) He also introduced the more efficient swiveling engine in several rockets, basically the method used to steer large liquid-propellant missiles and launchers today.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|263\u20136}}\n\n==Lindbergh and Goddard==\n\nAfter launch of one of Goddard's rockets in July 1929 again gained the attention of the newspapers,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9tbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wlINAAAAIBAJ&dq=rocket%20accident&pg=4275%2C2780242 \"Giant Rocket Alarms Many\"], ''St. Joseph, Missouri Gazette'', July 18, 1929.</ref> [[Charles Lindbergh]] learned of his work in a ''New York Times'' article. At the time, Lindbergh had begun to wonder what would become of [[aviation]] (even space flight) in the distant future and had settled on jet propulsion and rocket flight as a probable next step. After checking with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and being assured that Goddard was a bona fide physicist and not a crackpot, he phoned Goddard in November 1929.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|141}} Professor Goddard met the aviator soon after in his office at Clark University.<ref name=\"lehm\">{{cite journal|last=Lehman|first=Milton|date=October 4, 1963|title=How Lindbergh Gave a Lift to Rocketry|journal=LIFE Magazine|volume=55|issue=14|pages=115\u2013127|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uFIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA115|accessdate=15 Mar 2010}}</ref> Upon meeting Goddard, Lindbergh was immediately impressed by his research, and Goddard was similarly impressed by the flier's interest. He discussed his work openly with Lindbergh, forming an alliance that would last for the rest of his life. While having long since become reticent to share his ideas, Goddard showed complete openness with those few who shared his dream, and whom he felt he could trust.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBy late 1929, Goddard had been attracting additional notoriety with each rocket launch. He was finding it increasingly difficult to conduct his research without unwanted distractions. Lindbergh discussed finding additional financing for Goddard's work and lent his famous name to Goddard's work. In 1930 Lindbergh made several proposals to industry and private investors for funding, which proved all but impossible to find following the recent [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|U.S. stock market crash]] in October 1929.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\n===Guggenheim sponsorship===\nIn the spring of 1930, Lindbergh finally found an ally in the [[Guggenheim family]]. Financier [[Daniel Guggenheim]] agreed to fund Goddard's research over the next four years for a total of $100,000 (~${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1932|r=-5}}}} today). The Guggenheim family, especially [[Harry Frank Guggenheim|Harry Guggenheim]], would continue to support Goddard's work in the years to come. The Goddards soon moved to [[Roswell, New Mexico]] <ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBecause of the military potential of the rocket, Goddard, Lindbergh, Harry Guggenheim, the Smithsonian Institution and others tried in 1940, before the U.S. entered World War II, to convince the Army and Navy of its value. Goddard's services were offered, but there was no interest, initially. Two young, imaginative military officers eventually got the services to attempt to contract with Goddard just prior to the war. The Navy beat the Army to the punch and secured his services to build variable-thrust, liquid-fueled rocket engines for jet-assisted take-off (JATO) of aircraft.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|293\u2013297}} These rocket engines were the precursors to the larger throttlable rocket plane engines that helped launch the space age.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The X-Planes|last=Miller|first=Jay|publisher=Orion Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=43,128\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAstronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] wrote that his father, Edwin Aldrin Sr. \"was an early supporter of Robert Goddard.\"  The elder Aldrin was a student of physics under Goddard at Clark, and worked with Lindbergh to obtain the help of the Guggenheims. Buzz believed that if Goddard had received military support as von Braun's team had in Germany, American rocket technology would have developed much more rapidly in World War II.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Men from Earth|last=Aldrin|first=Buzz|last2=McConnell|first2=Malcolm|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1989|isbn=0-553-05374-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/ xx,21]|url=https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/}}</ref>\n\n===Lack of vision in the United States===\nBefore World War II there was a lack of vision and serious interest in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard's rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|719,746}} Between the World Wars, the [[Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] was the main source of funding for Goddard's research.<ref name=\"Braun\" />{{rp|46,59,60}} Goddard's liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian [[Eugene Emme]], but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans.<ref name=\"Emme\" />{{rp|63}} Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he \"would not be surprised if the research would become something in the nature of a race,\" and he wondered how soon the European \"theorists\" would begin to build rockets.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|136}}\nIn 1936, the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Berlin asked Charles Lindbergh to visit Germany and learn what he could of their progress in aviation. Although the Luftwaffe showed him their factories and were open concerning their growing airpower, they were silent on the subject of rocketry. When Lindbergh told Goddard of this behavior, Goddard said, \"Yes, they must have plans for the rocket. When will our own people in Washington listen to reason?\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|272}}\n\nMost of the U.S.'s largest universities were also slow to realize rocketry's potential. Just before World War II, the head of the aeronautics department at MIT, at a meeting held by the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] to discuss project funding, said that the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) \"can take the Buck Rogers Job [rocket research].\"<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite book|last=Carter|first=John|title=Sex and Rockets|year=1999|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|page=31}}</ref> In 1941, Goddard tried to recruit an engineer for his team from MIT but couldn't find one who was interested.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|326}}  There were some exceptions: MIT was at least teaching basic rocketry,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|264}} and Caltech had courses in rocketry and aerodynamics. After the war, Dr. Jerome Hunsaker of MIT, having studied Goddard's patents, stated that \"Every liquid-fuel rocket that flies is a Goddard rocket.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|363}}\n\nWhile away in Roswell, Goddard was still head of the physics department at Clark University, and Clark allowed him to devote most of his time to rocket research. Likewise, the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) permitted astronomer [[Samuel Herrick (astronomer)|Samuel Herrick]] to pursue research in space vehicle guidance and control, and shortly after the war to teach courses in spacecraft guidance and orbit determination. Herrick began corresponding with Goddard in 1931 and asked if he should work in this new field, which he named [[astrodynamics]]. Herrick said that Goddard had the vision to advise and encourage him in his use of [[celestial mechanics]] \"to anticipate the basic problem of space navigation.\" Herrick's work contributed substantially to America's readiness to control flight of Earth satellites and send men to the Moon and back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=vt/viblbv00753.xml|title=Samuel Herrick Papers 1930-1974|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Roswell, New Mexico==\n[[File:RobertHGoddardRocket TopDown.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Lindbergh]] took this picture of Robert H.

He had consulted a meteorologist as to the best area to do his work, and Roswell seemed ideal. Here they would not endanger anyone, would not be bothered by the curious and would experience a more moderate climate (which was also better for Goddard's health).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|177}} The locals valued personal privacy, knew Goddard desired his, and when travelers asked where Goddard's facilities were located, they would likely be misdirected.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|261}}\n\nBy September 1931, his rockets had the now familiar appearance of a smooth casing with tail-fins. He began experimenting with [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] guidance and made a flight test of such a system in April 1932. A gyroscope mounted on gimbals electrically controlled steering vanes in the exhaust, similar to the system used by the German [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] over 10&nbsp;years later. Though the rocket crashed after a short ascent, the guidance system had worked, and Goddard considered the test a success.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|193\u20135}}\n\nA temporary loss of funding from the Guggenheims, as a result of the depression, forced Goddard in spring of 1932 to return to his much-loathed professorial responsibilities at Clark University.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clary |first1=David |title=Rocket Man |date=2003 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |isbn=978-0786887057 |pages=165\u2013166}}</ref> He remained at the university until the autumn of 1934, when funding resumed.<ref name=\"The Papers of Robert H.

Goddard\"/> Upon his return to Roswell, he began work on his A series of rockets, 4 to 4.5&nbsp;meters long, and powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen pressurized with nitrogen. The gyroscopic control system was housed in the middle of the rocket, between the propellant tanks.<ref name=\"RockDev\">{{cite book|last=Goddard|first=Robert and editors Esther C. Goddard and G. Edward Pendray|title=Rocket Development|year=1961|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|xv,15\u201346}}\n\nThe A-4 used a simpler pendulum system for guidance, as the gyroscopic system was being repaired. On March 8, 1935, it flew up to 1,000 feet, then turned into the wind and, Goddard reported, \"roared in a powerful descent across the prairie, at close to, or at, the speed of sound.\" On March 28, 1935, the A-5 successfully flew vertically to an altitude of (0.91&nbsp;mi; 4,800&nbsp;ft) using his gyroscopic guidance system. It then turned to a nearly horizontal path, flew 13,000 feet and achieved a maximum speed of 550 miles per hour. Goddard was elated because the guidance system kept the rocket on a vertical path so well.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|208}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|978\u20139}}\n\nIn 1936\u20131939, Goddard began work on the K and L series rockets, which were much more massive and designed to reach very high altitude. The K series consisted of static bench tests of a more powerful engine, achieving a thrust of 624&nbsp;lbs in February 1936.<ref name=\"Braun\">{{cite book|last=Von Braun|first=Wernher and Frederick I. Ordway III|title=History of Rocketry and Space Travel, revised Edition|year=1969|publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Co.|location=New York|page=50}}</ref>  This work was plagued by trouble with chamber burn-through. In 1923, Goddard had built a regeneratively cooled engine, which circulated liquid oxygen around the outside of the combustion chamber, but he deemed the idea too complicated. He then used a curtain cooling method that involved spraying excess gasoline, which evaporated around the inside wall of the combustion chamber, but this scheme did not work well, and the larger rockets failed. Goddard returned to a smaller design, and his L-13 reached an altitude of 2.7 kilometers (1.7&nbsp;mi; 8,900&nbsp;ft), the highest of any of his rockets. Weight was reduced by using thin-walled fuel tanks wound with high-tensile-strength wire.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|71\u2013148}}\n\nGoddard experimented with many of the features of today's large rockets, such as multiple combustion chambers and nozzles. In November 1936, he flew the world's first rocket (L-7) with multiple chambers, hoping to increase thrust without increasing the size of a single chamber. It had four combustion chambers, reached a height of 200 feet, and corrected its vertical path using blast vanes until one chamber burned through. This flight demonstrated that a rocket with multiple combustion chambers could fly stably and be easily guided.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|96}} In July 1937 he replaced the guidance vanes with a movable tail section containing a single combustion chamber, as if on gimbals ([[thrust vectoring]]). The flight was of low altitude, but a large disturbance, probably caused by a change in the wind velocity, was corrected back to vertical. In an August test the flight path was corrected seven times by the movable tail and was captured on film by Mrs Goddard.<ref name= \"RockDev\" />{{rp|113\u2013116}}\n\nFrom 1940 to 1941, Goddard worked on the P series of rockets, which used propellant turbopumps (also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen). The lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures, permitting a more powerful engine (greater thrust) and a lighter structure (lighter tanks and no pressurization tank), but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching an altitude of only a few hundred feet. The turbopumps worked well, however, and Goddard was pleased.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|187\u2013215}}\n\nWhen Goddard mentioned the need for turbopumps, Harry Guggenheim suggested that he contact pump manufacturers to aid him. None were interested, as the development cost of these miniature pumps was prohibitive. Goddard's team was therefore left on its own and from September 1938 to June 1940 designed and tested the small turbopumps and gas generators to operate the turbines. Esther later said that the pump tests were \"the most trying and disheartening phase of the research.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274\u20135}}\n\nGoddard was able to flight-test many of his rockets, but many resulted in what the uninitiated would call failures, usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control. Goddard did not consider them failures, however, because he felt that he always learned something from a test.<ref name=\"Gainor\" />{{rp|45}} Most of his work involved static tests, which are a standard procedure today, before a flight test. He wrote to a correspondent:  \"It is not a simple matter to differentiate unsuccessful from successful experiments. ... [Most] work that is finally successful is the result of a series of unsuccessful tests in which difficulties are gradually eliminated.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274}}\n\n===General Jimmy Doolittle===\n[[Jimmy Doolittle]] was introduced to the field of space science at an early point in its history. He recalls in his autobiography, \"I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation. ... While with Shell Oil I worked with him on the development of a type of fuel. ... \"<ref name=Jimmy>{{cite book|last1=Doolittle|first1=James H. \"Jimmy\"|title=I Could Never Be So Lucky Again|date=1991|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|page=515}}</ref> Harry Guggenheim and Charles Lindbergh arranged for (then Major) Doolittle to discuss with Goddard a special blend of gasoline. Doolittle flew himself to Roswell in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddard's shop and a \"short course\" in rocketry.  He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddard's rocket. In closing he said, \"interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away\u2014who knows!\" In July 1941, he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in his rocket propulsion research. The Army was interested only in JATO at this point. However, Doolittle and Lindbergh were concerned about the state of rocketry in the US, and Doolittle remained in touch with Goddard.<ref name=Method/>{{rp|1208\u201316,1334,1443}}\n\nShortly after World War II, Doolittle spoke concerning Goddard to an [[American Rocket Society]] (ARS) conference at which a  large number interested in rocketry attended.

Simply reaching high altitudes was not his primary goal; he was trying, with a methodical approach, to perfect his liquid fuel engine and subsystems such as guidance and control so that his rocket could eventually achieve high altitudes without tumbling in the rare atmosphere, providing a stable vehicle for the experiments it would eventually carry. He had built the necessary turbopumps and was on the verge of building larger, lighter, more reliable rockets to reach extreme altitudes carrying scientific instruments when World War II intervened and changed the path of American history.

The Goddards noticed that some mail had been opened, and some mailed reports had gone missing. An accredited [[military attach\u00e9]] to the US, Friedrich von Boetticher, sent a four-page report to the ''[[Abwehr]]'' in 1936, and the spy Gustav Guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information, claiming to have visited Roswell and witnessed a launch. The ''Abwehr'' was very interested and responded with more questions about Goddard's work.<ref>{{cite book\n  |first=David  |last=Kahn\n  |title=Hitler's Spies: German Military Intelligence in World War II\n  |publisher=Da Capo Press\n  |year=2000\n  |page=77\n  |isbn=0-02-052440-4\n}}</ref>{{rp|77}}<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|227\u20138}} Guellich's reports did include information about fuel mixtures and the important concept of fuel-curtain cooling,<ref>The Game of the Foxes, Ladislas Farago, 1972,</ref>{{rp|39\u201341}} but thereafter the Germans received very little information about Goddard.\n\nThe Soviet Union had a spy in the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics.

Fischer, who had visited Goddard in Roswell earlier and gained his confidence, believed Goddard was doing valuable work and was able to convince the Bureau of Aeronautics in September 1941 that Goddard could build the JATO unit the Navy desired. While still in Roswell, and before the Navy contract took effect, Goddard began in September to apply his technology to build a variable-thrust engine to be attached to a [[PBY]] seaplane. By May 1942, he had a unit that could meet the Navy's requirements and be able to launch a heavily loaded aircraft from a short runway. In February, he received part of a PBY with bullet holes apparently acquired in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack. Goddard wrote to Guggenheim that \"I can think of nothing that would give me greater satisfaction than to have it contribute to the inevitable retaliation.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|322,328\u20139,331,335,337}}\n\nIn April, Fischer notified Goddard that the Navy wanted to do all its rocket work at the Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis. Esther, worried that a move to the climate of Maryland would cause Robert's health to deteriorate faster, objected. But the patriotic Goddard replied, \"Esther, don't you know there's a war on?\" Fischer also questioned the move, as Goddard could work just as well in Roswell. Goddard simply answered, \"I was wondering when you would ask me.\" Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger\u2014a long range missile\u2014but JATO was all he could manage, hoping for a greater project later.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|338,9}} It was a case of a square peg in a round hole, according to a disappointed Goddard.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|209}}\n\nGoddard and his team had already been in Annapolis a month and had tested his constant-thrust JATO engine when he received a Navy telegram, forwarded from Roswell, ordering him to Annapolis. Lt. Fischer asked for a crash effort. By August, his engine was producing 800&nbsp;lbs of thrust for 20 seconds, and Fischer was anxious to try it on a PBY. On the sixth test run, with all bugs worked out, the PBY, piloted by Fischer, was pushed into the air from the Severn River. Fischer landed and prepared to launch again. Goddard had wanted to check the unit, but radio contact with the PBY had been lost. On the seventh try, the engine caught fire. The plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted. Because Goddard had installed a safety feature at the last minute, there was no explosion and no lives were lost. The problem's cause was traced to hasty installation and rough handling. Cheaper, safer solid fuel JATO engines were eventually selected by the armed forces. An engineer later said, \"Putting [Goddard's] rocket on a seaplane was like hitching an eagle to a plow.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|344\u201350}}\n\nMilton Lehman notes:\n<blockquote>\nIn its 1942 crash effort to perfect an aircraft booster, the Navy was beginning to learn its way in rocketry. In similar efforts, the Army Air Corps was also exploring the field [with [[GALCIT]]]. Compared to Germany's massive program, these beginnings were small, yet essential to later progress. They helped develop a nucleus of trained American rocket engineers, the first of the new breed who would follow the professor into the Age of Space.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|350}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn August, 1943, President Atwood at Clark wrote to Goddard that the University was losing the acting head of the Physics Department, was taking on \"emergency work\" for the Army, and he was to \"report for duty or declare the position vacant.\" Goddard replied that he believed he was needed by he Navy, was nearing retirement age, and was unable to lecture because of his throat problem, which did not allow allow him to talk above a whisper. He regretfully resigned as Professor of Physics and expressed his deepest appreciation for all Atwood and the Trustees had done for him and indirectly for the war effort.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1509\u201311}} In June he had gone to see a throat specialist in Baltimore, who recommended that he not talk at all, to give his throat a rest.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1503}}\n  \nThe station, under Lt Commander Robert Truax, was developing another JATO engine in 1942 that used [[hypergolic propellant]]<nowiki/>s, eliminating the need for an ignition system.

Goddard made improvements to the engine, and in November it was demonstrated to the Navy and some officials from Washington. Fischer invited the spectators to operate the controls; the engine blasted out over the Severn at full throttle with no hesitation, idled, and roared again at various thrust levels. The test was perfect, exceeding the Navy's requirements. The unit was able to be stopped and restarted, and it produced a medium thrust of 600 pounds for 15 seconds and a full thrust of 1,000 pounds for over 15 seconds. A Navy Commander commented that \"It was like being Thor, playing with thunderbolts.\" Goddard had produced the essential propulsion control system of the rocket plane. The Goddards celebrated by attending the Army-Navy football game and attending the Fischers' cocktail party.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|350\u20131}}\n\nThis engine was the basis of the Curtiss-Wright XLR25-CW-1 two-chamber, 15,000-pound variable-thrust engine that powered the [[Bell X-2]] research rocket plane. After World War II, Goddard's team and some patents went to [[Curtiss-Wright]] Corporation. \"Although his death in August 1945 prevented him from participating in the actual development of this engine, it was a direct descendent of his design.\"<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|1606}} Clark University and the Guggenheim Foundation received the royalties from the use of the patents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/curtiss-wright-xlr25-cw-1/page/2/|title=This Day In Aviation|last=Swopes|first=Began R.|date=2017|access-date=2 Sep 2019}}</ref>  In September 1956, the X-2 was the first plane to reach 126,000 feet altitude and in its last flight exceeded Mach 3 (3.2) before losing control and crashing.

Though the design details were not exactly the same, the basic design of the V-2 was similar to one of Goddard's rockets. The V-2, however, was technically far more advanced than the most successful of the rockets designed and tested by Goddard. The [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center|Peenem\u00fcnde rocket group]] led by [[Wernher von Braun]] may have benefited from the pre-1939 contacts to a limited extent,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|387\u20138}} but had also started from the work of their own space pioneer, [[Hermann Oberth]]; they also had the benefit of intensive state funding, large-scale production facilities (using slave labor), and repeated flight-testing that allowed them to refine their designs.

General [[Walter Dornberger]], head of the V-2 project, used the idea that they were in a race with the U.S. and that Goddard had \"disappeared\" (to work with the Navy) as a way to persuade Hitler to raise the priority of the V-2.\n\n== Goddard's secrecy ==\nGoddard avoided sharing details of his work with other scientists and preferred to work alone with his technicians. [[Frank Malina]], who was then studying rocketry at the [[California Institute of Technology]], visited Goddard in August 1936. Goddard hesitated to discuss any of his research, other than that which had already been published in ''Liquid-Propellant Rocket Development''. [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]], Malina's mentor at the time, was unhappy with Goddard's attitude and later wrote, \"Naturally we at Caltech wanted as much information as we could get from Goddard for our mutual benefit. But Goddard believed in secrecy. ... The trouble with secrecy is that one can easily go in the wrong direction and never know it.\" <ref name=\"Burrows\" />{{rp|90}} However, at an earlier point, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n said that Malina was \"highly enthusiastic\" after his visit and that Caltech made changes to their liquid-propellant rocket, based on Goddard's work and patents. Malina remembered his visit as friendly and that he saw all but a few components in Goddard's shop.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|178}}\n\nGoddard's concerns about secrecy led to criticism for failure to cooperate with other scientists and engineers. His approach at that time was that independent development of his ideas without interference would bring quicker results even though he received less technical support. George Sutton, who became a rocket scientist working with von Braun's team in the late 1940s, said that he and his fellow workers had not heard of Goddard or his contributions and that they would have saved time if they had known the details of his work. Sutton admits that it may have been their fault for not looking for Goddard's patents and depending on the German team for knowledge and guidance; he wrote that information about the patents was not well distributed in the U.S. at that early period after World War II, though Germany and the Soviet Union had copies of some of them. (The Patent Office did not release rocket patents during World War II.)<ref name=\"Sutton\">{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, Virginia|pages=267, 269}}</ref> However, the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, an offshoot of the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] at Caltech (GALCIT), filed two patent applications in Sep 1943 referencing Goddard's {{US patent|1102653}} for the multistage rocket.\n\nBy 1939, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's GALCIT had received Army Air Corps funding to develop rockets to assist in aircraft take-off. Goddard learned of this in 1940, and openly expressed his displeasure at not being considered.<ref name=\"Burrows\">{{cite book\n  |last=Burrows |first=William E.\n  |title=This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age\n  |year=1999 |publisher=Modern Library\n  | pages=89\u201392\n  |isbn=0-375-75485-7\n}}</ref> Malina could not understand why the Army did not arrange for an exchange of information between Goddard and Caltech since both were under government contract at the same time. Goddard did not think he could be of that much help to Caltech because they were designing rocket engines mainly with solid fuel, while he was using liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard was concerned with avoiding the public criticism and ridicule he had faced in the 1920s, which he believed had harmed his professional reputation. He also lacked interest in discussions with people who had less understanding of rocketry than he did,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|171}} feeling that his time was extremely constrained.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|23}} Goddard's health was frequently poor, as a result of his earlier bout of tuberculosis, and he was uncertain about how long he had to live<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|65,190}} He felt, therefore, that he hadn't the time to spare arguing with other scientists and the press about his new field of research, or helping all the amateur rocketeers who wrote to him.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61,71,110\u201311,114\u201315}} In 1932 Goddard wrote to H. G. Wells:\n<blockquote> How many more years I shall be able to work on the problem, I do not know; I hope, as long as I live. There can be no thought of finishing, for \"aiming at the stars\", both literally and figuratively, is a problem to occupy generations, so that no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.<ref name=Stoiko>{{cite book|last=Stoiko|first=Michael|title=Pioneers of Rocketry|year=1974|publisher=Hawthorn Books|location=New York|page=63}}</ref></blockquote>\nGoddard spoke to professional groups, published articles and papers and patented his ideas; but while he discussed basic principles, he was unwilling to reveal the details of his designs until he had flown rockets to high altitudes and thus proven his theory.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|115}} He tended to avoid any mention of space flight, and spoke only of high-altitude research, since he believed that other scientists regarded the subject as unscientific.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|116}} GALCIT saw Goddard's publicity problems and that the word \"rocket\" was \"of such bad repute\" that they used the word \"jet\" in the name of JPL and the related Aerojet Engineering Corporation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History Of Rocket Technology|editor-last=Emme|editor-first=Eugene E.|last1=Malina |first1=Frank J.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=Detroit|pages=52}}</ref>\n\nMany authors writing about Goddard mention his secrecy, but\nneglect the reasons for it. Some reasons have been noted above. Much of his work was for the military and was classified.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1541}} There were some in the U.S. before World War II that called for long-range rockets, and in 1939 Major James Randolph wrote a \"provocative article\" advocating a 3000-mile range missile. Goddard was \"annoyed\" by the unclassified paper as he thought the subject of weapons should be \"discussed in strict secrecy.\" <ref name=\"Don\">{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Don P.|title=Bossart: America's Forgotten Rocket Scientist|year=2016|publisher=Mental Landscape|location=San Bernardino, CA|pages=76}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Goddard's tendency to secrecy was not absolute, nor was he totally uncooperative. In 1945 GALCIT was building the [[WAC Corporal]] for the Army.  But in 1942 they were having trouble with their liquid propellant rocket engine's performance (timely, smooth ignition and explosions). Frank Malina went  to Annapolis in February and consulted with Goddard and Stiff, and they arrived at a solution to the problem (hypergolic propellant), which resulted in the successful launch of the high-altitude research rocket in October 1945.<ref name=\"Heinz\">{{cite book|last=Gartmann|first=Heinz|title=The Men Behind the Space Rockets|year=1955|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|pages=149}}</ref>\n\nDuring the First and Second World Wars, Goddard offered his services, patents, and technology to the military, and made some significant contributions. Just before the Second World War several young Army officers and a few higher-ranking ones believed Goddard's research was important but were unable to generate funds for his work.<ref name=\"Glenn\">{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/rgoddardsite/|title=Robert H.

He became a thorough diarist and documenter of his work\u2014a skill that would greatly benefit his later career. These interests merged at age 16, when Goddard attempted to construct a balloon out of [[aluminum]], shaping the raw metal in his home workshop, and filling it with hydrogen. After nearly five weeks of methodical, documented efforts, he finally abandoned the project, remarking, \"... balloon will not go up. ... Aluminum is too heavy. Failior {{sic}} crowns enterprise.\" However, the lesson of this failure did not restrain Goddard's growing determination and confidence in his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|21}} He wrote in 1927, \"I imagine an innate interest in mechanical things was inherited from a number of ancestors  who were machinists.\" <ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|7}}\n\n===Cherry tree dream===\nHe became interested in space when he read [[H.

Wells]]' science fiction classic ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' at 16 years old.<ref name=\"GoddardBio\">{{Cite web | url = http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/people/biographies/goddard.pdf | publisher = [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] | title = Goddard Biography}}.</ref> His dedication to pursuing space flight became fixed on October 19, 1899. The 17-year-old Goddard climbed a cherry tree to cut off dead limbs. He was transfixed by the sky, and his imagination grew. He later wrote:\n\n{{quote |On this day I climbed a tall cherry tree at the back of the barn ... and as I looked toward the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the ''possibility'' of ascending to Mars, and how it would look on a small scale, if sent up from the meadow at my feet. I have several photographs of the tree, taken since, with the little ladder I made to climb it, leaning against it.\nIt seemed to me then that a weight whirling around a horizontal shaft, moving more rapidly above than below, could furnish lift by virtue of the greater centrifugal force at the top of the path.\n\nI was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended. Existence at last seemed very purposive.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|26}}<ref name=\"NASA Goddard\" >{{cite web\n  | url = http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sgoddard.htm\n  | title = Robert Goddard and His Rockets\n  | publisher = NASA}}</ref>}}\n\nFor the rest of his life, he observed October 19 as \"Anniversary Day\", a private commemoration of the day of his greatest inspiration.\n\n== Education and early studies ==\n\nThe young Goddard was a thin and frail boy, almost always in fragile health. He suffered from stomach problems, pleurisy, colds, and bronchitis, and he fell two years behind his classmates. He became a voracious reader, regularly visiting the local public library to borrow books on the physical sciences.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|16,19}}\n\n===Aerodynamics and motion===\n\nGoddard's interest in aerodynamics led him to study some of [[Samuel Langley]]'s scientific papers in the periodical ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]''. In these papers, Langley wrote that birds flap their wings with different force on each side to turn in the air. Inspired by these articles, the teenage Goddard watched swallows and chimney swifts from the porch of his home, noting how subtly the birds moved their wings to control their flight. He noted how remarkably the birds controlled their flight with their tail feathers, which he called the birds' equivalent of [[ailerons]]. He took exception to some of Langley's conclusions and in 1901 wrote a letter to ''St. Nicholas'' magazine<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|5}} with his own ideas. The editor of  ''St. Nicholas'' declined to publish Goddard's letter, remarking that birds fly with a certain amount of intelligence and that \"machines will not act with such intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|31}} Goddard disagreed, believing that a man could control a flying machine with his own intelligence.\n\nAround this time, Goddard read [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', and found that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law of Motion]] applied to motion in space. He wrote later about his own tests of the Law:\n\n{{quote |I began to realize that there might be something after all to Newton's Laws. The Third Law was accordingly tested, both with devices suspended by rubber bands and by devices on floats, in the little brook back of the barn, and the said law was verified conclusively. It made me realize that if a way to navigate space were to be discovered, or invented, it would be the result of a knowledge of physics and mathematics.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}}}}\n\n===Academics===\nAs his health improved, Goddard continued his formal schooling as a 19-year-old sophomore at [[South High Community School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm|title=Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Dr. Robert H.

He excelled in his coursework, and his peers twice elected him class president. Making up for  lost time, he studied books on mathematics, astronomy, mechanics and composition from the school library.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}} At his graduation ceremony in 1904, he gave his class oration as [[valedictorian]]. In his speech, entitled \"On Taking Things for Granted\", Goddard included a section that would become emblematic of his life:\n\n<blockquote>[J]ust as in the sciences we have learned that we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|19}}\n</blockquote>\n\nGoddard enrolled at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in 1904.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|41}} He quickly impressed the head of the physics department, A. Wilmer Duff, with his thirst for knowledge, and Duff took him on as a laboratory assistant and tutor.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|42}} At WPI, Goddard joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity and began a long courtship with high school classmate Miriam Olmstead, an honor student who had graduated with him as [[salutatorian]]. Eventually, she and Goddard were engaged, but they drifted apart and ended the engagement around 1909.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp |51}}\n\nGoddard received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in physics from Worcester Polytechnic in 1908,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} and after serving there for a year as an instructor in physics, he began his graduate studies at [[Clark University]] in Worcester in the fall of 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/library/collections/rgoddard.html | publisher =WPI George C. Gordon Library | title = Robert Goddard |date= |accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> Goddard received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in physics from Clark University in 1910, and then stayed at Clark to complete his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics in 1911. He spent another year at Clark as an honorary fellow in physics, and in 1912 he accepted a research fellowship at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Frist Campus Center|Palmer Physical Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|56\u201358}}\n\n===First scientific writings===\nThe high school student summed up his ideas on space travel in a proposed article, \"The Navigation of Space,\" which he submitted to the ''Popular Science News''. The journal's editor returned it, saying that they could not use it \"in the near future.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|34}}\n\nWhile still an undergraduate, Goddard wrote a paper proposing a method for balancing [[airplane]]s using gyro-stabilization. He submitted the idea to ''[[Scientific American]]'', which published the paper in 1907. Goddard later wrote in his diaries that he believed his paper was the first proposal of a way to automatically stabilize aircraft in flight.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} His proposal came around the same time as other scientists were making breakthroughs in developing functional [[gyroscope]]s.\n\nWhile studying physics at WPI, ideas came to Goddard's mind that sometimes seemed impossible, but he was compelled to record them for future investigation. He wrote that \"there was something inside which simply would not stop working.\" He purchased some cloth-covered notebooks and began filling them with a variety of thoughts, mostly concerning his dream of space travel.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|11\u201313}} He considered centrifugal force, radio waves, magnetic reaction, solar energy, atomic energy, ion or electrostatic propulsion and other methods to reach space. After experimenting with solid fuel rockets he was convinced by 1909 that chemical-propellant engines were the answer.<ref name= \"Frank\" />{{rp|11\u201312}} A particularly complex concept was set down in June 1908: Sending a camera around distant planets, guided by measurements of gravity along the trajectory, and returning to earth.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|14}}\n\nHis first writing on the possibility of a liquid-fueled rocket came on February 2, 1909. Goddard had begun to study ways of increasing a rocket's efficiency using methods differing from conventional [[solid-fuel rocket]]s. He wrote in his notebook about using liquid hydrogen as a fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. He believed that 50 percent efficiency could be achieved with these liquid propellants (i.e., half of the heat energy of combustion converted to the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|55}}\n\n==First patents==\nIn the decades around 1910, radio was a new technology, fertile for innovation. In 1912, while working at Princeton University, Goddard investigated the effects of radio waves on insulators.<ref>Goddard, Robert H. \"On ponderomotive force upon a dielectric which carries a displacement current in a magnetic field\", ''[[Physical Review]]'', Vol. 6(2), pp. 99\u2013120 (August 1914).</ref> In order to generate radio-frequency power, he invented a vacuum tube with a beam deflection<ref>{{US patent|1159209}}</ref> that operated like a cathode-ray oscillator tube. His patent on this tube, which predated that of [[Lee De Forest]], became central in the suit between [[Arthur A. Collins]], whose small company made radio transmitter tubes, and [[AT&T]] and [[RCA]] over his use of [[vacuum tube]] technology.  Goddard accepted only a consultant's fee from Collins when the suit was dropped. Eventually the two big companies allowed the country's growing electronics industry to use the De Forest patents freely.<ref>McElroy, Gil, \"The Collins 45A \u2013 How Art Collins met Robert Goddard\", ''QST'', Vol. 81(2), pp. 44\u201346 (February 1997).</ref>\n\n===Rocket math===\nBy 1912 he had in his spare time, using calculus, developed the mathematics which allowed him to calculate the position and velocity of a rocket in vertical flight, given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity (with respect to the rocket frame) of the exhaust gases. In effect he had independently developed the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] published a decade earlier in Russia. For vertical flight he included the effects of gravity and aerodynamic drag.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|136}}\n\nHis first goal was to build a [[Rocketsonde|sounding rocket]] with which to study the atmosphere. Not only would such investigation aid meteorology, but it was necessary to determine temperature, density and wind speed in order to design efficient space launch vehicles. He was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was in fact to develop a vehicle for flights into space, since most scientists, especially in the United States, did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit, nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas. Later, in 1933, Goddard said that \"[I]n no case must we allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel, test by test and step by step, until one day we succeed, cost what it may.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|65,67,74,101}}\n\n===Fight to survive===\nIn early 1913, Goddard became seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]] and had to leave his position at Princeton. He then returned to Worcester, where he began a prolonged process of recovery at home. His doctors did not expect him to live. He decided he should spend time outside in the fresh air and walk for exercise, and he gradually improved.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61\u201364}} When his nurse discovered some of his notes in his bed, he kept them, arguing, \"I have to live to do this work.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|66}}\n\nIt was during this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most important work. As his symptoms subsided, he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. He was afraid that nobody would be able to read his scribbling should he \nsuccumb.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n===Foundational patents===\nIn the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, [[patents]] were considered essential, not only to protect original work but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure those ideas before someone else did\u2014and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote descriptions concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent lawyer in  Worcester who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard's first patent application was submitted in October 1913.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|63\u201370}}\n\nIn 1914, his first two landmark patents were accepted and registered. The first, {{US patent|1102653}}, described a multi-stage rocket fueled with a solid \"explosive material.\" The second, {{US patent|1103503}}, described a rocket fueled with a [[solid fuel]] (explosive material) or with [[liquid propellant]]s (gasoline and liquid nitrous oxide). The two patents would eventually become important milestones in the history of rocketry.<ref name=\"Sea and Sky: Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.seasky.org/spacexp/sky5d1.html\n  | title = Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\n  | publisher = Sea and Sky}}</ref><ref name=\"Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.russianspaceweb.com/chronology_XX.html\n  | title = Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\n  | publisher = Russian Space Web}}</ref> Overall, 214 patents were published, some posthumously by his wife.\n\n== Early rocketry research ==\n[[File:Robert Goddard footage.ogv|thumb|right|Video clips of Goddard's launches and other events in his life]]\nIn the fall of 1914, Goddard's health had improved, and he accepted a part-time position as an instructor and research fellow at Clark University.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|73}} His position at Clark allowed him to further his rocketry research. He ordered numerous supplies that could be used to build rocket prototypes for launch and spent much of 1915 in preparation for his first tests. Goddard's first test launch of a powder rocket came on an early evening in 1915 following his daytime classes at Clark.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|74}} The launch was loud and bright enough to arouse the alarm of the campus janitor, and Goddard had to reassure him that his experiments, while being serious study, were also quite harmless. After this incident, Goddard took his experiments inside the physics lab, in order to limit any disturbance.\n\nAt the Clark physics lab, Goddard conducted static tests of powder rockets to measure their thrust and efficiency. He found his earlier estimates to be verified; powder rockets were converting only about two percent of the thermal energy in their fuel into thrust and kinetic energy. At this point he applied [[de Laval nozzle]]s, which were generally used with steam turbine engines, and these greatly improved efficiency. (Of the several definitions of rocket efficiency, Goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the ''internal efficiency'' of the engine: the ratio of the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion, expressed as a percentage.)<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|130}} By mid-summer of 1915, Goddard had obtained an average efficiency of 40 percent with a nozzle exit velocity of {{nowrap|6728 feet (2051 meters) per second}}.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|75}} Connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion (de Laval) nozzles, Goddard was able in static tests to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63% and exhaust velocities of over 7000 feet (2134 meters) per second.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|78}}\n\nFew would recognize it at the time, but this little engine was a major breakthrough. These experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape Earth and travel into space. This engine and subsequent experiments sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution were the beginning of modern rocketry and, ultimately, space exploration.<ref name=\"Pendray\">{{cite book|last=Pendray|first=G.

With these performance levels, he believed a rocket could vertically lift a weight of {{nowrap|1 lb (0.45 kg)}} to a height of {{nowrap| 232 miles (373 km)}} with an initial launch weight of only {{nowrap|89.6 lbs (40.64 kg)}}.<ref>{{Cite web | date = September 1916 |title=September 27, 1916 \u2013 Goddard's Proposal to the Smithsonian | url = http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/documents/goddardsept1916.htm | publisher = The Smithsonian Institution}}.</ref> (Earth's atmosphere can be considered to end at {{convert|80|to|100|mi|km}} altitude, where its drag effect on orbiting satellites becomes minimal.)\n\nThe Smithsonian was interested and asked Goddard to elaborate upon his initial inquiry. Goddard responded with a detailed manuscript he had already prepared, entitled ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|79}}\n\nIn January 1917, the Smithsonian agreed to provide Goddard with a five-year grant totaling {{nowrap|US$5000}}.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|84}} Afterward, Clark was able to contribute {{nowrap|US$3500 }} and the use of their physics lab to the project. Worcester Polytechnic Institute also allowed him to use its abandoned Magnetics Laboratory on the edge of campus during this time, as a safe place for testing.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|85}} WPI also made some parts in their machine shop.\n\nGoddard's fellow Clark scientists were astonished at the unusually large Smithsonian grant for rocket research, which they thought was not real science.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|85}} Decades later, rocket scientists who knew how much it cost to research and develop rockets said that he had received little financial support.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Viking Rocket Story|last=Rosen|first=Milton W.|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1955|isbn=|location=New York|pages=11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Enterprise|last=Grey|first=Jerry|publisher=William Morrow and Company|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York|pages=260\u2013688-03462\u20134}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, at the insistence of Dr. Arthur G. Webster, the world-renowned head of Clark's physics department,  Goddard arranged for the Smithsonian to publish the paper,  ''A Method...,'' which documented his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nWhile at Clark University, Goddard did research into solar power using a parabolic dish to concentrate the Sun's rays on a machined piece of [[quartz]], that was sprayed with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which then heated water and drove an electric generator. Goddard believed his invention had overcome all the obstacles that had previously defeated other scientists and inventors, and he had his findings published in the November 1929 issue of  ''Popular Science''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 \"A New Invention To Harness The Sun\"], ''Popular Science'', November 1929.</ref>\n\n===Goddard's military rocket===\nNot all of Goddard's early work was geared towards space travel. As the United States entered World War I in 1917, the country's universities began to lend their services to the war effort. Goddard believed his rocket research could be applied to many different military applications, including mobile artillery, field weapons and naval [[torpedo]]es. He made proposals to the Navy and Army. No record exists in his papers of any interest by the Navy to Goddard's inquiry. However, Army Ordnance was quite interested, and Goddard met several times with Army personnel.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89}}\n\nDuring this time, Goddard was also contacted, in early 1918, by a civilian industrialist in Worcester about the possibility of manufacturing rockets for the military. However, as the businessman's enthusiasm grew, so did Goddard's suspicion. Talks eventually broke down as Goddard began to fear his work might be appropriated by the business. However, an [[Army Signal Corps]] officer tried to make Goddard cooperate, but he was called off by General [[George Squier]] of the Signal Corps who had been contacted by Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89\u201391}} Goddard became leery of working with corporations and was careful to secure patents to \"protect his ideas.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|152}} These events led to the Signal Corps sponsoring Goddard's work during World War I.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nGoddard proposed to the Army an idea for a tube-based rocket launcher as a light infantry weapon. The launcher concept became the precursor to the [[bazooka]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|92}} The rocket-powered, recoil-free weapon was the brainchild of Goddard as a side project (under Army contract) of his work on rocket propulsion. Goddard, during his [[tenure]] at [[Clark University]], and working at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] for security reasons, designed the tube-fired rocket for military use during World War I. He and his co-worker, Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]] successfully demonstrated his rocket to the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Maryland]], on November 6, 1918, using two music stands for a launch platform. The Army was impressed, but the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Compi\u00e8gne Armistice]] was signed only five days later, and further development was discontinued as World War I ended.<ref name=\"NASA \u2013 Dr. Robert H.

Goddard, American Rocketry Pioneer\n  | publisher = NASA\n  | accessdate = 2010-05-04\n}}.</ref>\n\nThe delay in the development of the bazooka and other weapons was a result of the long recovery period required from Goddard's serious bout with tuberculosis. Goddard continued to be a part-time consultant to the U.S. Government at [[Indian Head, Maryland]],<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|121}} until 1923, but his focus had turned to other research involving rocket propulsion, including work with liquid fuels and liquid oxygen.\n\nLater, the former Clark University researcher Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]], and Army officers Col. [[Leslie Skinner]] and Lt. [[Edward Uhl]] continued Goddard's work on the bazooka. A [[shaped-charge]] warhead was attached to the rocket, leading to the tank-killing weapon used in World War II and to many other powerful rocket weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|305}}\n\n== ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes'' ==\n\nIn 1919 Goddard thought that it would be premature to disclose the results of his experiments because his engine was not sufficiently developed. Dr. Webster realized that Goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that Goddard publish his progress so far or he would take care of it himself, so Goddard asked the Smithsonian Institution if it would publish the report, updated with footnotes, that he had submitted in late 1916.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nIn late 1919, the Smithsonian published Goddard's groundbreaking work, ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''. The report describes Goddard's mathematical theories of rocket flight, his experiments with solid-fuel rockets, and the possibilities he saw of exploring Earth's atmosphere and beyond. Along with [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]]'s earlier work, ''The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices'',<ref name=\"Tsiolkovsky, Exploration of Cosmic Space\">{{cite book\n  |title=The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices\n  |first=Konstantin |last=Tsiolkovsky\n  |authorlink=Konstantin Tsiolkovsky\n  |year=1903\n  |ref=Tsiolkovsky, Exploration of Cosmic Space\n}}</ref> which was not widely disseminated outside Russia,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ley|first1=Willy|title=Events in Space|url=https://archive.org/details/eventsinspace0000leyw|url-access=registration|date=1969|publisher=David McKay Company|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/eventsinspace0000leyw/page/9 9]}}</ref> Goddard's report is regarded as one of the pioneering works of the science of rocketry, and 1750 copies were distributed worldwide.<ref name=\"Emme\">{{cite book|last=Emme|first=Eugene M.|title=A History of Spaceflight|year=1965|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|page=90}}</ref> Goddard also sent a copy to individuals who requested one, until his personal supply was exhausted. Smithsonian aerospace historian Frank Winter said that this paper was \"one of the key catalysts behind the international rocket movement of the 1920s and 30s.\" <ref name= \"NYT\"/>\n\nGoddard described extensive experiments with solid-fuel [[rocket engine]]s burning high-grade nitrocellulose [[smokeless powder]].

Included as a [[thought experiment]] was the idea of launching a rocket to the Moon and igniting a mass of flash powder on its surface, so as to be visible through a telescope. He discussed the matter seriously, down to an estimate of the amount of powder required. Goddard's conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 3.21 tons could produce a flash \"just visible\" from Earth, assuming a final payload weight of 10.7 pounds.<ref name=\"Method\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Goddard|editor1-first=Esther C. |editor2-first=G.

He did, though, publish and talk about the rocket principle and [[sounding rockets]], since these subjects were not too \"far out.\" In a letter to the Smithsonian, dated March 1920, he discussed: photographing the Moon and planets from rocket-powered fly-by probes, sending messages to distant civilizations on inscribed metal plates, the use of solar energy in space, and the idea of high-velocity ion propulsion. In that same letter, Goddard clearly describes the concept of the [[Atmospheric reentry#Ablative|ablative heat shield]], suggesting the landing apparatus be covered with \"layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between\" designed to erode in the same way as the surface of a meteor.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/stories/march-1920-report-concerning-further-developments-space-travel\n|last=Goddard  |first=Robert H.\n  |title=Report Concerning Further Developments\n  |date=March 1920\n  |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution Archives\n}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |bgcolor=#F5F5F5 |salign=center |align=right |width=33% |quote=Every vision is a joke until the first man accomplishes it; once realized, it becomes commonplace.|source=&ndash;Response to a reporter's question following criticism in ''The New York Times'', 1920.<ref name=\"Clark University\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www2.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm#nyt\n|title=When was the famous New York Times editorial about Dr. Goddard?\n|publisher=Clark University\n|accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref><ref name=\"NASA\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/f_goddard.html\n|title=Robert Goddard: A Man and His Rocket\n|publisher=NASA\n|accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>}}\n\n===Publicity and criticism===\nThe publication of Goddard's document gained him national attention from U.S. newspapers, most of it negative.

Even the Smithsonian had to abstain from publicity because of the amount of ridiculous correspondence received from the general public.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|113}} David Lasser, who co-founded the [[American Rocket Society]] (ARS), wrote in 1931 that Goddard was subjected in the press to the \"most violent attacks.\"<ref name=\"Lasser\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Lasser|editor1-first=David |editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Godwin |title=The Conquest of Space|year=2002|publisher=Apogee Books|location=Burlington, Ontario|isbn=1-896522-92-0|page=38}}</ref>\n\nOn January 12, 1920, a front-page story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"Believes Rocket Can Reach Moon\", reported a Smithsonian press release about a \"multiple-charge, high-efficiency rocket.\" The chief application envisaged was \"the possibility of sending recording apparatus to moderate and extreme altitudes within the Earth's atmosphere\", the advantage over balloon-carried instruments being ease of recovery, since \"the new rocket apparatus would go straight up and come straight down.\" But it also mentioned a proposal \"to [send] to the dark part of the new moon a sufficiently large amount of the most brilliant flash powder which, in being ignited on impact, would be plainly visible in a powerful telescope.

It is not obvious, however, that the instruments would return to the point of departure; indeed, it is obvious that they would not, for parachutes drift exactly as balloons do.<ref name=\"NYT12\">{{cite news\n  |title=Topics of the Times\n  |url=http://it.is.rice.edu/~rickr/goddard.editorial.html\n  |quote=As a method of sending a missile to the higher, and even highest, part of the earth's atmospheric envelope, Professor Goddard's multiple-charge rocket is a practicable, and therefore promising device.\n  |work=New York Times\n  |date=January 13, 1920 |accessdate=2007-06-21\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217065558/http://it.is.rice.edu/~rickr/goddard.editorial.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nThe article pressed further on Goddard's proposal to launch rockets beyond the atmosphere:\n<blockquote>[A]fter the rocket quits our air and really starts on its longer journey, its flight would be neither accelerated nor maintained by the explosion of the charges it then might have left.

Unbeknownst to the ''Times'', thrust is possible in a vacuum, as the writer would have discovered had he read Goddard's paper.<ref>{{cite book\n|editor=Newton, Isaac\n|title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, 2nd ed\n|publisher=\n|location=London\n|year=1713\n|pages=\n|isbn=\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-principia/}}\n</ref>\n\n====Aftermath====\nA week after the ''New York Times'' editorial, Goddard released a signed statement to the [[Associated Press]], attempting to restore reason to what had become a sensational story:\n<blockquote>Too much attention has been concentrated on the proposed flash pow[d]er experiment, and too little on the exploration of the atmosphere. ... Whatever interesting possibilities there may be of the method that has been proposed, other than the purpose for which it was intended, no one of them could be undertaken without first exploring the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite news |title=Goddard Rockets To Take Pictures |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 19, 1920 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E2DF103AE033A2575AC1A9679C946195D6CF}}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1924, Goddard published an article, \"How my speed rocket can propel itself in vacuum\", in ''[[Popular Science]]'', in which he explained the physics and gave details of the vacuum experiments he had performed to prove the theory.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goddard |first=Robert |title=How my speed rocket can propel itself in vacuum |url=http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=DikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=38 |work=[[Popular Science]] |date=September 1924 |page=38}}</ref> But, no matter how he tried to explain his results, he was not understood by the majority. After one of Goddard's experiments in 1929, a local Worcester newspaper carried the mocking headline \"Moon rocket misses target by 238,799{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;miles.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|editor=Nelson, Craig\n|title=Rocket Men: The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon\n|publisher=\n|location=\n|year=1713\n|pages=\n|isbn=9781101057735\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWMivGgbM7kC&pg=PT96 }}\n</ref>\n\nThough the unimaginitive of the public chuckled at the \"moon man,\" his groundbreaking paper was read seriously by many rocketeers in America, Europe, and Russia who were stirred to build their own rockets. This work was his most important contribution to the quest to \"aim for the stars.\" <ref name= \"Gainor\" />{{rp|50}}\n\nGoddard worked alone with just his team of mechanics and machinists for many years.  This was a result of the harsh criticism from the media and other scientists, and his understanding of the military applications which foreign powers might use. Goddard became increasingly suspicious of others and often worked alone, except during the two World Wars, which limited the impact of much of his work. Another limiting factor was the lack of support from the American government, military and academia, all failing to understand the value of the rocket to study the atmosphere and near space, and for military applications. As Germany became ever more war-like, he refused to communicate with German rocket experimenters, though he received more and more of their correspondence.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|131}}\n\n===='A Correction'====\nForty-nine years after its editorial mocking Goddard, on July 17, 1969\u2014the day after the launch of [[Apollo 11]]\u2014''The New York Times'' published a short item under the headline \"A Correction.\" The three-paragraph statement summarized its 1920 editorial and concluded:\n<blockquote>Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.<ref>''The New York Times'', July 17, 1969, p. 43,</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==First liquid-fueled flight==\n\nGoddard began considering liquid propellants, including hydrogen and oxygen, as early as 1909. He knew that hydrogen and oxygen was the most efficient fuel/oxidizer combination. Liquid hydrogen was not readily available in 1921, however, and he selected gasoline as the safest fuel to handle.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|13}}\n\n===First static tests===\n[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Robert Goddard, bundled against the cold weather of March 16, 1926, holds the launching frame of his most notable invention \u2014 the first liquid-fueled rocket.]]\nGoddard began experimenting with liquid oxidizer, [[liquid fuel rocket]]s in September 1921, and successfully tested the first liquid propellant engine in November 1923.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|520}} It had a cylindrical [[combustion chamber]], using impinging jets to mix and atomize [[liquid oxygen]] and [[gasoline]].<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|499\u2013500}}\n\nIn 1924\u201325, Goddard had problems developing a high-pressure [[piston pump]] to send fuel to the combustion chamber. He wanted to scale up the experiments, but his funding would not allow such growth. He decided to forego the pumps and use a pressurized fuel feed system applying pressure to the fuel tank from a tank of [[inert gas]], a technique used today. The liquid oxygen, some of which evaporated,  provided its own pressure.\n\nOn December 6, 1925, he tested the simpler pressure feed system. He conducted a static test on the firing stand at the Clark University physics laboratory. The engine successfully lifted its own weight in a 27-second test in the static rack. It was a major success for Goddard, proving that a liquid fuel rocket was possible.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|140}} The test moved Goddard an important step closer to launching a rocket with liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard conducted an additional test in December, and two more in January 1926. After that, he began preparing for a possible launch of the rocket system.\n\n===First flight===\nGoddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled ([[bipropellant rocket|gasoline and liquid oxygen]]) rocket on March 16, 1926, in [[Auburn, Massachusetts]]. Present at the launch were his crew chief Henry Sachs, Esther Goddard, and Percy Roope, who was Clark's assistant professor in the physics department. Goddard's diary entry of the event was notable for its understatement:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 16. Went to Auburn with S[achs] in am. E[sther] and Mr. Roope came out at 1 p.m. Tried rocket at 2.30. It rose 41 feet & went 184 feet, in 2.5 secs., after the lower half of the nozzle burned off. Brought materials to lab. ...<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHis diary entry the next day elaborated:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 17, 1926. The first flight with a rocket using liquid propellants was made yesterday at Aunt Effie's farm in Auburn. ... \nEven though the release was pulled, the rocket did not rise at first, but the flame came out, and there was a steady roar. After a number of seconds it rose, slowly until it cleared the frame, and then at express train speed, curving over to the left, and striking the ice and snow, still going at a rapid rate.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe rocket, which was later dubbed \"Nell\", rose just 41&nbsp;feet during a 2.5-second flight that ended 184 feet away in a cabbage field,<ref>{{cite book|last=Streissguth|first=Thomas|title=Rocket man: the story of Robert Goddard|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=1995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37 37]|isbn=0-87614-863-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37}}</ref> but it was an important demonstration that liquid fuels and oxidizers were possible propellants for larger rockets. The launch site is now a [[National Historic Landmark]], the [[Goddard Rocket Launching Site]].\n\nViewers familiar with more modern rocket designs may find it difficult to distinguish the rocket from its launching apparatus in the well-known picture of \"Nell\". The complete rocket is significantly taller than Goddard but does not include the pyramidal support structure which he is grasping. The rocket's [[combustion chamber]] is the small cylinder at the top; the [[nozzle]] is visible beneath it. The fuel tank, which is also part of the rocket, is the larger cylinder opposite Goddard's torso. The fuel tank is directly beneath the nozzle and is protected from the motor's exhaust by an [[asbestos]] cone. Asbestos-wrapped aluminum tubes connect the motor to the tanks, providing both support and fuel transport.<ref>[http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf NASA, ''Discover NASA and You''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527221503/http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }}.</ref> This layout is no longer used, since the experiment showed that this was [[Pendulum rocket fallacy|no more stable]] than placing the combustion chamber and nozzle at the base. By May, after a series of modifications to simplify the plumbing, the combustion chamber and nozzle were placed in the now classic position, at the lower end of the rocket.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|259}}\n\nGoddard determined early that fins alone were not sufficient to stabilize the rocket in flight and keep it on the desired trajectory in the face of winds aloft and other disturbing forces. He added movable vanes in the exhaust, controlled by a gyroscope, to control and steer his rocket. (The Germans used this technique in their V-2.) He also introduced the more efficient swiveling engine in several rockets, basically the method used to steer large liquid-propellant missiles and launchers today.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|263\u20136}}\n\n==Lindbergh and Goddard==\n\nAfter launch of one of Goddard's rockets in July 1929 again gained the attention of the newspapers,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9tbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wlINAAAAIBAJ&dq=rocket%20accident&pg=4275%2C2780242 \"Giant Rocket Alarms Many\"], ''St. Joseph, Missouri Gazette'', July 18, 1929.</ref> [[Charles Lindbergh]] learned of his work in a ''New York Times'' article. At the time, Lindbergh had begun to wonder what would become of [[aviation]] (even space flight) in the distant future and had settled on jet propulsion and rocket flight as a probable next step. After checking with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and being assured that Goddard was a bona fide physicist and not a crackpot, he phoned Goddard in November 1929.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|141}} Professor Goddard met the aviator soon after in his office at Clark University.<ref name=\"lehm\">{{cite journal|last=Lehman|first=Milton|date=October 4, 1963|title=How Lindbergh Gave a Lift to Rocketry|journal=LIFE Magazine|volume=55|issue=14|pages=115\u2013127|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uFIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA115|accessdate=15 Mar 2010}}</ref> Upon meeting Goddard, Lindbergh was immediately impressed by his research, and Goddard was similarly impressed by the flier's interest. He discussed his work openly with Lindbergh, forming an alliance that would last for the rest of his life. While having long since become reticent to share his ideas, Goddard showed complete openness with those few who shared his dream, and whom he felt he could trust.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBy late 1929, Goddard had been attracting additional notoriety with each rocket launch. He was finding it increasingly difficult to conduct his research without unwanted distractions. Lindbergh discussed finding additional financing for Goddard's work and lent his famous name to Goddard's work. In 1930 Lindbergh made several proposals to industry and private investors for funding, which proved all but impossible to find following the recent [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|U.S. stock market crash]] in October 1929.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\n===Guggenheim sponsorship===\nIn the spring of 1930, Lindbergh finally found an ally in the [[Guggenheim family]]. Financier [[Daniel Guggenheim]] agreed to fund Goddard's research over the next four years for a total of $100,000 (~${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1932|r=-5}}}} today). The Guggenheim family, especially [[Harry Frank Guggenheim|Harry Guggenheim]], would continue to support Goddard's work in the years to come. The Goddards soon moved to [[Roswell, New Mexico]] <ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBecause of the military potential of the rocket, Goddard, Lindbergh, Harry Guggenheim, the Smithsonian Institution and others tried in 1940, before the U.S. entered World War II, to convince the Army and Navy of its value. Goddard's services were offered, but there was no interest, initially. Two young, imaginative military officers eventually got the services to attempt to contract with Goddard just prior to the war. The Navy beat the Army to the punch and secured his services to build variable-thrust, liquid-fueled rocket engines for jet-assisted take-off (JATO) of aircraft.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|293\u2013297}} These rocket engines were the precursors to the larger throttlable rocket plane engines that helped launch the space age.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The X-Planes|last=Miller|first=Jay|publisher=Orion Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=43,128\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAstronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] wrote that his father, Edwin Aldrin Sr. \"was an early supporter of Robert Goddard.\"  The elder Aldrin was a student of physics under Goddard at Clark, and worked with Lindbergh to obtain the help of the Guggenheims. Buzz believed that if Goddard had received military support as von Braun's team had in Germany, American rocket technology would have developed much more rapidly in World War II.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Men from Earth|last=Aldrin|first=Buzz|last2=McConnell|first2=Malcolm|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1989|isbn=0-553-05374-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/ xx,21]|url=https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/}}</ref>\n\n===Lack of vision in the United States===\nBefore World War II there was a lack of vision and serious interest in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard's rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|719,746}} Between the World Wars, the [[Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] was the main source of funding for Goddard's research.<ref name=\"Braun\" />{{rp|46,59,60}} Goddard's liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian [[Eugene Emme]], but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans.<ref name=\"Emme\" />{{rp|63}} Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he \"would not be surprised if the research would become something in the nature of a race,\" and he wondered how soon the European \"theorists\" would begin to build rockets.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|136}}\nIn 1936, the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Berlin asked Charles Lindbergh to visit Germany and learn what he could of their progress in aviation. Although the Luftwaffe showed him their factories and were open concerning their growing airpower, they were silent on the subject of rocketry. When Lindbergh told Goddard of this behavior, Goddard said, \"Yes, they must have plans for the rocket. When will our own people in Washington listen to reason?\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|272}}\n\nMost of the U.S.'s largest universities were also slow to realize rocketry's potential. Just before World War II, the head of the aeronautics department at MIT, at a meeting held by the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] to discuss project funding, said that the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) \"can take the Buck Rogers Job [rocket research].\"<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite book|last=Carter|first=John|title=Sex and Rockets|year=1999|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|page=31}}</ref> In 1941, Goddard tried to recruit an engineer for his team from MIT but couldn't find one who was interested.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|326}}  There were some exceptions: MIT was at least teaching basic rocketry,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|264}} and Caltech had courses in rocketry and aerodynamics. After the war, Dr. Jerome Hunsaker of MIT, having studied Goddard's patents, stated that \"Every liquid-fuel rocket that flies is a Goddard rocket.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|363}}\n\nWhile away in Roswell, Goddard was still head of the physics department at Clark University, and Clark allowed him to devote most of his time to rocket research. Likewise, the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) permitted astronomer [[Samuel Herrick (astronomer)|Samuel Herrick]] to pursue research in space vehicle guidance and control, and shortly after the war to teach courses in spacecraft guidance and orbit determination. Herrick began corresponding with Goddard in 1931 and asked if he should work in this new field, which he named [[astrodynamics]]. Herrick said that Goddard had the vision to advise and encourage him in his use of [[celestial mechanics]] \"to anticipate the basic problem of space navigation.\" Herrick's work contributed substantially to America's readiness to control flight of Earth satellites and send men to the Moon and back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=vt/viblbv00753.xml|title=Samuel Herrick Papers 1930-1974|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Roswell, New Mexico==\n[[File:RobertHGoddardRocket TopDown.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Lindbergh]] took this picture of Robert H.

He had consulted a meteorologist as to the best area to do his work, and Roswell seemed ideal. Here they would not endanger anyone, would not be bothered by the curious and would experience a more moderate climate (which was also better for Goddard's health).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|177}} The locals valued personal privacy, knew Goddard desired his, and when travelers asked where Goddard's facilities were located, they would likely be misdirected.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|261}}\n\nBy September 1931, his rockets had the now familiar appearance of a smooth casing with tail-fins. He began experimenting with [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] guidance and made a flight test of such a system in April 1932. A gyroscope mounted on gimbals electrically controlled steering vanes in the exhaust, similar to the system used by the German [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] over 10&nbsp;years later. Though the rocket crashed after a short ascent, the guidance system had worked, and Goddard considered the test a success.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|193\u20135}}\n\nA temporary loss of funding from the Guggenheims, as a result of the depression, forced Goddard in spring of 1932 to return to his much-loathed professorial responsibilities at Clark University.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clary |first1=David |title=Rocket Man |date=2003 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |isbn=978-0786887057 |pages=165\u2013166}}</ref> He remained at the university until the autumn of 1934, when funding resumed.<ref name=\"The Papers of Robert H.

Goddard\"/> Upon his return to Roswell, he began work on his A series of rockets, 4 to 4.5&nbsp;meters long, and powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen pressurized with nitrogen. The gyroscopic control system was housed in the middle of the rocket, between the propellant tanks.<ref name=\"RockDev\">{{cite book|last=Goddard|first=Robert and editors Esther C. Goddard and G. Edward Pendray|title=Rocket Development|year=1961|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|xv,15\u201346}}\n\nThe A-4 used a simpler pendulum system for guidance, as the gyroscopic system was being repaired. On March 8, 1935, it flew up to 1,000 feet, then turned into the wind and, Goddard reported, \"roared in a powerful descent across the prairie, at close to, or at, the speed of sound.\" On March 28, 1935, the A-5 successfully flew vertically to an altitude of (0.91&nbsp;mi; 4,800&nbsp;ft) using his gyroscopic guidance system. It then turned to a nearly horizontal path, flew 13,000 feet and achieved a maximum speed of 550 miles per hour. Goddard was elated because the guidance system kept the rocket on a vertical path so well.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|208}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|978\u20139}}\n\nIn 1936\u20131939, Goddard began work on the K and L series rockets, which were much more massive and designed to reach very high altitude. The K series consisted of static bench tests of a more powerful engine, achieving a thrust of 624&nbsp;lbs in February 1936.<ref name=\"Braun\">{{cite book|last=Von Braun|first=Wernher and Frederick I. Ordway III|title=History of Rocketry and Space Travel, revised Edition|year=1969|publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Co.|location=New York|page=50}}</ref>  This work was plagued by trouble with chamber burn-through. In 1923, Goddard had built a regeneratively cooled engine, which circulated liquid oxygen around the outside of the combustion chamber, but he deemed the idea too complicated. He then used a curtain cooling method that involved spraying excess gasoline, which evaporated around the inside wall of the combustion chamber, but this scheme did not work well, and the larger rockets failed. Goddard returned to a smaller design, and his L-13 reached an altitude of 2.7 kilometers (1.7&nbsp;mi; 8,900&nbsp;ft), the highest of any of his rockets. Weight was reduced by using thin-walled fuel tanks wound with high-tensile-strength wire.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|71\u2013148}}\n\nGoddard experimented with many of the features of today's large rockets, such as multiple combustion chambers and nozzles. In November 1936, he flew the world's first rocket (L-7) with multiple chambers, hoping to increase thrust without increasing the size of a single chamber. It had four combustion chambers, reached a height of 200 feet, and corrected its vertical path using blast vanes until one chamber burned through. This flight demonstrated that a rocket with multiple combustion chambers could fly stably and be easily guided.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|96}} In July 1937 he replaced the guidance vanes with a movable tail section containing a single combustion chamber, as if on gimbals ([[thrust vectoring]]). The flight was of low altitude, but a large disturbance, probably caused by a change in the wind velocity, was corrected back to vertical. In an August test the flight path was corrected seven times by the movable tail and was captured on film by Mrs Goddard.<ref name= \"RockDev\" />{{rp|113\u2013116}}\n\nFrom 1940 to 1941, Goddard worked on the P series of rockets, which used propellant turbopumps (also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen). The lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures, permitting a more powerful engine (greater thrust) and a lighter structure (lighter tanks and no pressurization tank), but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching an altitude of only a few hundred feet. The turbopumps worked well, however, and Goddard was pleased.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|187\u2013215}}\n\nWhen Goddard mentioned the need for turbopumps, Harry Guggenheim suggested that he contact pump manufacturers to aid him. None were interested, as the development cost of these miniature pumps was prohibitive. Goddard's team was therefore left on its own and from September 1938 to June 1940 designed and tested the small turbopumps and gas generators to operate the turbines. Esther later said that the pump tests were \"the most trying and disheartening phase of the research.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274\u20135}}\n\nGoddard was able to flight-test many of his rockets, but many resulted in what the uninitiated would call failures, usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control. Goddard did not consider them failures, however, because he felt that he always learned something from a test.<ref name=\"Gainor\" />{{rp|45}} Most of his work involved static tests, which are a standard procedure today, before a flight test. He wrote to a correspondent:  \"It is not a simple matter to differentiate unsuccessful from successful experiments. ... [Most] work that is finally successful is the result of a series of unsuccessful tests in which difficulties are gradually eliminated.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274}}\n\n===General Jimmy Doolittle===\n[[Jimmy Doolittle]] was introduced to the field of space science at an early point in its history. He recalls in his autobiography, \"I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation. ... While with Shell Oil I worked with him on the development of a type of fuel. ... \"<ref name=Jimmy>{{cite book|last1=Doolittle|first1=James H. \"Jimmy\"|title=I Could Never Be So Lucky Again|date=1991|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|page=515}}</ref> Harry Guggenheim and Charles Lindbergh arranged for (then Major) Doolittle to discuss with Goddard a special blend of gasoline. Doolittle flew himself to Roswell in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddard's shop and a \"short course\" in rocketry.  He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddard's rocket. In closing he said, \"interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away\u2014who knows!\" In July 1941, he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in his rocket propulsion research. The Army was interested only in JATO at this point.

Simply reaching high altitudes was not his primary goal; he was trying, with a methodical approach, to perfect his liquid fuel engine and subsystems such as guidance and control so that his rocket could eventually achieve high altitudes without tumbling in the rare atmosphere, providing a stable vehicle for the experiments it would eventually carry. He had built the necessary turbopumps and was on the verge of building larger, lighter, more reliable rockets to reach extreme altitudes carrying scientific instruments when World War II intervened and changed the path of American history. He hoped to return to his experiments in Roswell after the war.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|206,230,330\u20131}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|923\u20134}}\n\nThough by the end of the Roswell years much of his technology had been replicated independently by others, he introduced new developments to rocketry that were used in this new enterprise: lightweight turbopumps, variable-thrust engine (in U.S.), engine with multiple combustion chambers and nozzles, and curtain cooling of combustion chamber.\n\nAlthough Goddard had brought his work in rocketry to the attention of the [[United States Army]], between World Wars, he was rebuffed, since the Army largely failed to grasp the military application of large rockets and said there was no money for new experimental weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|297}} German military intelligence, by contrast, had paid attention to Goddard's work. The Goddards noticed that some mail had been opened, and some mailed reports had gone missing. An accredited [[military attach\u00e9]] to the US, Friedrich von Boetticher, sent a four-page report to the ''[[Abwehr]]'' in 1936, and the spy Gustav Guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information, claiming to have visited Roswell and witnessed a launch. The ''Abwehr'' was very interested and responded with more questions about Goddard's work.<ref>{{cite book\n  |first=David  |last=Kahn\n  |title=Hitler's Spies: German Military Intelligence in World War II\n  |publisher=Da Capo Press\n  |year=2000\n  |page=77\n  |isbn=0-02-052440-4\n}}</ref>{{rp|77}}<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|227\u20138}} Guellich's reports did include information about fuel mixtures and the important concept of fuel-curtain cooling,<ref>The Game of the Foxes, Ladislas Farago, 1972,</ref>{{rp|39\u201341}} but thereafter the Germans received very little information about Goddard.\n\nThe Soviet Union had a spy in the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics.

Fischer, who had visited Goddard in Roswell earlier and gained his confidence, believed Goddard was doing valuable work and was able to convince the Bureau of Aeronautics in September 1941 that Goddard could build the JATO unit the Navy desired. While still in Roswell, and before the Navy contract took effect, Goddard began in September to apply his technology to build a variable-thrust engine to be attached to a [[PBY]] seaplane. By May 1942, he had a unit that could meet the Navy's requirements and be able to launch a heavily loaded aircraft from a short runway. In February, he received part of a PBY with bullet holes apparently acquired in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack. Goddard wrote to Guggenheim that \"I can think of nothing that would give me greater satisfaction than to have it contribute to the inevitable retaliation.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|322,328\u20139,331,335,337}}\n\nIn April, Fischer notified Goddard that the Navy wanted to do all its rocket work at the Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis. Esther, worried that a move to the climate of Maryland would cause Robert's health to deteriorate faster, objected. But the patriotic Goddard replied, \"Esther, don't you know there's a war on?\" Fischer also questioned the move, as Goddard could work just as well in Roswell. Goddard simply answered, \"I was wondering when you would ask me.\" Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger\u2014a long range missile\u2014but JATO was all he could manage, hoping for a greater project later.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|338,9}} It was a case of a square peg in a round hole, according to a disappointed Goddard.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|209}}\n\nGoddard and his team had already been in Annapolis a month and had tested his constant-thrust JATO engine when he received a Navy telegram, forwarded from Roswell, ordering him to Annapolis. Lt. Fischer asked for a crash effort. By August, his engine was producing 800&nbsp;lbs of thrust for 20 seconds, and Fischer was anxious to try it on a PBY. On the sixth test run, with all bugs worked out, the PBY, piloted by Fischer, was pushed into the air from the Severn River. Fischer landed and prepared to launch again. Goddard had wanted to check the unit, but radio contact with the PBY had been lost. On the seventh try, the engine caught fire. The plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted. Because Goddard had installed a safety feature at the last minute, there was no explosion and no lives were lost. The problem's cause was traced to hasty installation and rough handling. Cheaper, safer solid fuel JATO engines were eventually selected by the armed forces. An engineer later said, \"Putting [Goddard's] rocket on a seaplane was like hitching an eagle to a plow.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|344\u201350}}\n\nMilton Lehman notes:\n<blockquote>\nIn its 1942 crash effort to perfect an aircraft booster, the Navy was beginning to learn its way in rocketry. In similar efforts, the Army Air Corps was also exploring the field [with [[GALCIT]]]. Compared to Germany's massive program, these beginnings were small, yet essential to later progress. They helped develop a nucleus of trained American rocket engineers, the first of the new breed who would follow the professor into the Age of Space.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|350}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn August, 1943, President Atwood at Clark wrote to Goddard that the University was losing the acting head of the Physics Department, was taking on \"emergency work\" for the Army, and he was to \"report for duty or declare the position vacant.\" Goddard replied that he believed he was needed by he Navy, was nearing retirement age, and was unable to lecture because of his throat problem, which did not allow allow him to talk above a whisper. He regretfully resigned as Professor of Physics and expressed his deepest appreciation for all Atwood and the Trustees had done for him and indirectly for the war effort.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1509\u201311}} In June he had gone to see a throat specialist in Baltimore, who recommended that he not talk at all, to give his throat a rest.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1503}}\n  \nThe station, under Lt Commander Robert Truax, was developing another JATO engine in 1942 that used [[hypergolic propellant]]<nowiki/>s, eliminating the need for an ignition system.

The team built a 3000-lb thrust engine using a cluster of four 750-lb thrust motors.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1574,1592}} They also developed 750-lb engines for the Navy's Gorgon guided interceptor missile (experimental [[Project Gorgon]]).

Goddard made improvements to the engine, and in November it was demonstrated to the Navy and some officials from Washington. Fischer invited the spectators to operate the controls; the engine blasted out over the Severn at full throttle with no hesitation, idled, and roared again at various thrust levels. The test was perfect, exceeding the Navy's requirements. The unit was able to be stopped and restarted, and it produced a medium thrust of 600 pounds for 15 seconds and a full thrust of 1,000 pounds for over 15 seconds. A Navy Commander commented that \"It was like being Thor, playing with thunderbolts.\" Goddard had produced the essential propulsion control system of the rocket plane. The Goddards celebrated by attending the Army-Navy football game and attending the Fischers' cocktail party.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|350\u20131}}\n\nThis engine was the basis of the Curtiss-Wright XLR25-CW-1 two-chamber, 15,000-pound variable-thrust engine that powered the [[Bell X-2]] research rocket plane. After World War II, Goddard's team and some patents went to [[Curtiss-Wright]] Corporation. \"Although his death in August 1945 prevented him from participating in the actual development of this engine, it was a direct descendent of his design.\"<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|1606}} Clark University and the Guggenheim Foundation received the royalties from the use of the patents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/curtiss-wright-xlr25-cw-1/page/2/|title=This Day In Aviation|last=Swopes|first=Began R.|date=2017|access-date=2 Sep 2019}}</ref>  In September 1956, the X-2 was the first plane to reach 126,000 feet altitude and in its last flight exceeded Mach 3 (3.2) before losing control and crashing.

Though the design details were not exactly the same, the basic design of the V-2 was similar to one of Goddard's rockets. The V-2, however, was technically far more advanced than the most successful of the rockets designed and tested by Goddard. The [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center|Peenem\u00fcnde rocket group]] led by [[Wernher von Braun]] may have benefited from the pre-1939 contacts to a limited extent,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|387\u20138}} but had also started from the work of their own space pioneer, [[Hermann Oberth]]; they also had the benefit of intensive state funding, large-scale production facilities (using slave labor), and repeated flight-testing that allowed them to refine their designs.

General [[Walter Dornberger]], head of the V-2 project, used the idea that they were in a race with the U.S. and that Goddard had \"disappeared\" (to work with the Navy) as a way to persuade Hitler to raise the priority of the V-2.\n\n== Goddard's secrecy ==\nGoddard avoided sharing details of his work with other scientists and preferred to work alone with his technicians. [[Frank Malina]], who was then studying rocketry at the [[California Institute of Technology]], visited Goddard in August 1936. Goddard hesitated to discuss any of his research, other than that which had already been published in ''Liquid-Propellant Rocket Development''. [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]], Malina's mentor at the time, was unhappy with Goddard's attitude and later wrote, \"Naturally we at Caltech wanted as much information as we could get from Goddard for our mutual benefit. But Goddard believed in secrecy. ... The trouble with secrecy is that one can easily go in the wrong direction and never know it.\" <ref name=\"Burrows\" />{{rp|90}} However, at an earlier point, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n said that Malina was \"highly enthusiastic\" after his visit and that Caltech made changes to their liquid-propellant rocket, based on Goddard's work and patents. Malina remembered his visit as friendly and that he saw all but a few components in Goddard's shop.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|178}}\n\nGoddard's concerns about secrecy led to criticism for failure to cooperate with other scientists and engineers. His approach at that time was that independent development of his ideas without interference would bring quicker results even though he received less technical support. George Sutton, who became a rocket scientist working with von Braun's team in the late 1940s, said that he and his fellow workers had not heard of Goddard or his contributions and that they would have saved time if they had known the details of his work. Sutton admits that it may have been their fault for not looking for Goddard's patents and depending on the German team for knowledge and guidance; he wrote that information about the patents was not well distributed in the U.S. at that early period after World War II, though Germany and the Soviet Union had copies of some of them. (The Patent Office did not release rocket patents during World War II.)<ref name=\"Sutton\">{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, Virginia|pages=267, 269}}</ref> However, the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, an offshoot of the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] at Caltech (GALCIT), filed two patent applications in Sep 1943 referencing Goddard's {{US patent|1102653}} for the multistage rocket.\n\nBy 1939, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's GALCIT had received Army Air Corps funding to develop rockets to assist in aircraft take-off. Goddard learned of this in 1940, and openly expressed his displeasure at not being considered.<ref name=\"Burrows\">{{cite book\n  |last=Burrows |first=William E.\n  |title=This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age\n  |year=1999 |publisher=Modern Library\n  | pages=89\u201392\n  |isbn=0-375-75485-7\n}}</ref> Malina could not understand why the Army did not arrange for an exchange of information between Goddard and Caltech since both were under government contract at the same time. Goddard did not think he could be of that much help to Caltech because they were designing rocket engines mainly with solid fuel, while he was using liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard was concerned with avoiding the public criticism and ridicule he had faced in the 1920s, which he believed had harmed his professional reputation. He also lacked interest in discussions with people who had less understanding of rocketry than he did,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|171}} feeling that his time was extremely constrained.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|23}} Goddard's health was frequently poor, as a result of his earlier bout of tuberculosis, and he was uncertain about how long he had to live<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|65,190}} He felt, therefore, that he hadn't the time to spare arguing with other scientists and the press about his new field of research, or helping all the amateur rocketeers who wrote to him.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61,71,110\u201311,114\u201315}} In 1932 Goddard wrote to H.

There can be no thought of finishing, for \"aiming at the stars\", both literally and figuratively, is a problem to occupy generations, so that no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.<ref name=Stoiko>{{cite book|last=Stoiko|first=Michael|title=Pioneers of Rocketry|year=1974|publisher=Hawthorn Books|location=New York|page=63}}</ref></blockquote>\nGoddard spoke to professional groups, published articles and papers and patented his ideas; but while he discussed basic principles, he was unwilling to reveal the details of his designs until he had flown rockets to high altitudes and thus proven his theory.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|115}} He tended to avoid any mention of space flight, and spoke only of high-altitude research, since he believed that other scientists regarded the subject as unscientific.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|116}} GALCIT saw Goddard's publicity problems and that the word \"rocket\" was \"of such bad repute\" that they used the word \"jet\" in the name of JPL and the related Aerojet Engineering Corporation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History Of Rocket Technology|editor-last=Emme|editor-first=Eugene E.|last1=Malina |first1=Frank J.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=Detroit|pages=52}}</ref>\n\nMany authors writing about Goddard mention his secrecy, but\nneglect the reasons for it. Some reasons have been noted above. Much of his work was for the military and was classified.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1541}} There were some in the U.S. before World War II that called for long-range rockets, and in 1939 Major James Randolph wrote a \"provocative article\" advocating a 3000-mile range missile. Goddard was \"annoyed\" by the unclassified paper as he thought the subject of weapons should be \"discussed in strict secrecy.\" <ref name=\"Don\">{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Don P.|title=Bossart: America's Forgotten Rocket Scientist|year=2016|publisher=Mental Landscape|location=San Bernardino, CA|pages=76}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Goddard's tendency to secrecy was not absolute, nor was he totally uncooperative. In 1945 GALCIT was building the [[WAC Corporal]] for the Army.  But in 1942 they were having trouble with their liquid propellant rocket engine's performance (timely, smooth ignition and explosions). Frank Malina went  to Annapolis in February and consulted with Goddard and Stiff, and they arrived at a solution to the problem (hypergolic propellant), which resulted in the successful launch of the high-altitude research rocket in October 1945.<ref name=\"Heinz\">{{cite book|last=Gartmann|first=Heinz|title=The Men Behind the Space Rockets|year=1955|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|pages=149}}</ref>\n\nDuring the First and Second World Wars, Goddard offered his services, patents, and technology to the military, and made some significant contributions. Just before the Second World War several young Army officers and a few higher-ranking ones believed Goddard's research was important but were unable to generate funds for his work.<ref name=\"Glenn\">{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/rgoddardsite/|title=Robert H.

Samuels''', MD, DSc (hon), FAAN, MACP, FRCP, FANA, is an American [[physician]], [[neurologist]] and [[teacher]] of [[medicine]]. He writes on the relationships between neurology and the rest of medicine, and has linked the [[nervous system]] with cardiac function, highlighting the mechanisms and prevention of [[neurogenic]] [[cardiac disease]].\n\n==Education and training==\nBorn in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] on June 24, 1945, Samuels attended [[Cleveland Heights High School]], where he was an honors graduate and president of the 3,300 student body. He delivered the graduation address, elected by his class, and was later elected to the Cleveland Heights High School Hall of Fame.\n\nSamuels credits his own childhood [[pediatrician]] in Cleveland, Dr. J.W. Epstein, with providing early inspiration for his future career path in medicine. He was also exposed to medicine, and specifically the brain-heart connection, before medical school through his cousin, Matthew Levy, a [[Cardiovascular physiology|cardiovascular physiologist]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, Cleveland|Mount Sinai Hospital]] and [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Western Reserve Medical School]].\n\nSamuels received his Bachelor of Arts degree in biology from [[Williams College]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]] in 1967, where, as elected class speaker, he delivered an address titled \"Lumberjackets and Dogs.\" In 1971 he received his Doctor of Medicine degree from the [[University of Cincinnati College of Medicine]], where he was elected to the Pi Kappa Epsilon Honor Society and was selected as class speaker to deliver an [http://www.med.uc.edu/StudentServices/Registrar/HonorsDay.aspx Honors Day Address] titled \"Mark Hopkins on One End and I on the Other.\" The [[University of Cincinnati]] later awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree (2005). In 2011, Samuels was asked to deliver the Honors Day Address, titled \"Invaders from Mars with Commentary by Robbie Burns,\" to mark the 40th anniversary of his 1971 graduation address. Samuels also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1993.\n\nDuring medical school, Samuels was influenced by a number of mentors, including Benjamin Felson, Richard Vilter, Edward Gall, Roger Crafts, Evelyn Hess, Gustave Eckstein and Charles Aring, the latter of whom drew him into the field of neurology. He spent a period of time in [[hepatology]] and [[immunology]] research with the late Dame Professor [[Sheila Sherlock]] at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in [[London]]. The work resulted in his first scientific publication in [[Gut (journal)|''Gut'']] showing that a serum factor present in patients with [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] was responsible for the [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] nature of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = RA | last2 = Dudley | first2 = JF | last3 = Samuels | first3 = MA | last4 = Milligan | first4 = J | last5 = Sherlock | first5 = S | year = 1973 | title = Lymphocyte transformation in response to phytohemagglutinin in primary biliary cirrhosis: The search for a plasma inhibitory factor | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 89\u201393 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing medical school, Samuels trained first by completing a full residency in [[internal medicine]] at the [[Boston City Hospital]], serving as the medical chief resident in 1974-5, and then as a junior resident in neurology (1973-4), as a fellow in [[neuropathology]] (1975\u201376) and senior resident in neurology (1976\u201377) at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Samuels is board certified in both Internal Medicine and Neurology.\n\n==Clinical career==\nSamuels is the only neurologist cited in all editions of Castle & Connolly ''Best Doctors in America''. He is able to consult on complex problems, particularly in the interface between general medicine and neurology.\n\nFollowing his formal training, Samuels created a new neurology service, of which he served as chief until 1988, at the [[West Roxbury]] (MA) Veterans Administration Medical Center, a [[Harvard Medical School]]-affiliated hospital. There he was instrumental in the merger of two VA hospitals to create the [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]]-West Roxbury VA Medical Center, a model that has since been replicated throughout the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] system.\n\nIn 1988, Samuels was recruited to the [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] to create a Department of Neurology from a small division in the department of medicine. In 1994, the department was formally instituted, with Samuels as its founding chair. Since its launch, the relatively new department has grown to include over 250 academic appointments, including 20 full professors, six with endowed chairs, at the [[Harvard Medical School]]; one of the largest programs in basic, translational and clinical research with over $40,000,000 in annual research support; 15 divisions; an inpatient neurology service; an [[epilepsy]] monitoring unit; a 20-bed neurological-[[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] [[intensive care unit]]; and ambulatory programs in all major areas of neurological medicine. Basic and clinical research from the department comprises work on [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[autoimmunity]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[neuromuscular diseases]], [[epilepsy]], [[stroke]], and [[cancer]] neurology.\n\nIn addition to serving as chairman of the department, Samuels maintains an active clinical practice at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, seeing patients with complex neurological problems. He serves regularly as the attending neurologist for inpatient and consultation services (named the Martin A. Samuels Neurology Consultation Service in 2010) at the Brigham, and regularly provides guidance to neurology residents and students on treating the most complex problems. \n\nIn 2018, after serving for 30 years as Founding Chair of Neurology at the Brigham, Samuels stepped down from the Chair to become the Emeritus Founding Chair of Neurology at the Brigham and Distinguished Miriam Sydney Joseph Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School.  He continues to be a full-time member of the Department of Neurology where he sees patients and teaches residents and students.\n\nFor his clinical accomplishments, Samuels has been honored with Fellowship in the [[American Academy of Neurology]], Fellowship in the [[American Neurological Association]], Fellowship in the [[Royal College of Physicians]] (London) and Mastership in the [[American College of Physicians]]. He has been the discusser in 13 ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' Clinical Pathology Conferences\u2014the most ever discussed by a single person.<ref>\n\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Samuels | first1 = MA | last2 = Kleinman | first2 = GA | year = 1979 | title = Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital.

Samuels.jpg|thumb|400x400px]]\n'''Martin A. Samuels''', MD, DSc (hon), FAAN, MACP, FRCP, FANA, is an American [[physician]], [[neurologist]] and [[teacher]] of [[medicine]]. He writes on the relationships between neurology and the rest of medicine, and has linked the [[nervous system]] with cardiac function, highlighting the mechanisms and prevention of [[neurogenic]] [[cardiac disease]].\n\n==Education and training==\nBorn in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] on June 24, 1945, Samuels attended [[Cleveland Heights High School]], where he was an honors graduate and president of the 3,300 student body. He delivered the graduation address, elected by his class, and was later elected to the Cleveland Heights High School Hall of Fame.\n\nSamuels credits his own childhood [[pediatrician]] in Cleveland, Dr. J.W. Epstein, with providing early inspiration for his future career path in medicine. He was also exposed to medicine, and specifically the brain-heart connection, before medical school through his cousin, Matthew Levy, a [[Cardiovascular physiology|cardiovascular physiologist]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, Cleveland|Mount Sinai Hospital]] and [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Western Reserve Medical School]].\n\nSamuels received his Bachelor of Arts degree in biology from [[Williams College]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]] in 1967, where, as elected class speaker, he delivered an address titled \"Lumberjackets and Dogs.\" In 1971 he received his Doctor of Medicine degree from the [[University of Cincinnati College of Medicine]], where he was elected to the Pi Kappa Epsilon Honor Society and was selected as class speaker to deliver an [http://www.med.uc.edu/StudentServices/Registrar/HonorsDay.aspx Honors Day Address] titled \"Mark Hopkins on One End and I on the Other.\" The [[University of Cincinnati]] later awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree (2005). In 2011, Samuels was asked to deliver the Honors Day Address, titled \"Invaders from Mars with Commentary by Robbie Burns,\" to mark the 40th anniversary of his 1971 graduation address. Samuels also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1993.\n\nDuring medical school, Samuels was influenced by a number of mentors, including Benjamin Felson, Richard Vilter, Edward Gall, Roger Crafts, Evelyn Hess, Gustave Eckstein and Charles Aring, the latter of whom drew him into the field of neurology. He spent a period of time in [[hepatology]] and [[immunology]] research with the late Dame Professor [[Sheila Sherlock]] at the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in [[London]]. The work resulted in his first scientific publication in [[Gut (journal)|''Gut'']] showing that a serum factor present in patients with [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] was responsible for the [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] nature of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = RA | last2 = Dudley | first2 = JF | last3 = Samuels | first3 = MA | last4 = Milligan | first4 = J | last5 = Sherlock | first5 = S | year = 1973 | title = Lymphocyte transformation in response to phytohemagglutinin in primary biliary cirrhosis: The search for a plasma inhibitory factor | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 89\u201393 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing medical school, Samuels trained first by completing a full residency in [[internal medicine]] at the [[Boston City Hospital]], serving as the medical chief resident in 1974-5, and then as a junior resident in neurology (1973-4), as a fellow in [[neuropathology]] (1975\u201376) and senior resident in neurology (1976\u201377) at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Samuels is board certified in both Internal Medicine and Neurology.\n\n==Clinical career==\nSamuels is the only neurologist cited in all editions of Castle & Connolly ''Best Doctors in America''. He is able to consult on complex problems, particularly in the interface between general medicine and neurology.\n\nFollowing his formal training, Samuels created a new neurology service, of which he served as chief until 1988, at the [[West Roxbury]] (MA) Veterans Administration Medical Center, a [[Harvard Medical School]]-affiliated hospital. There he was instrumental in the merger of two VA hospitals to create the [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]]-West Roxbury VA Medical Center, a model that has since been replicated throughout the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] system.\n\nIn 1988, Samuels was recruited to the [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] to create a Department of Neurology from a small division in the department of medicine. In 1994, the department was formally instituted, with Samuels as its founding chair. Since its launch, the relatively new department has grown to include over 250 academic appointments, including 20 full professors, six with endowed chairs, at the [[Harvard Medical School]]; one of the largest programs in basic, translational and clinical research with over $40,000,000 in annual research support; 15 divisions; an inpatient neurology service; an [[epilepsy]] monitoring unit; a 20-bed neurological-[[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] [[intensive care unit]]; and ambulatory programs in all major areas of neurological medicine. Basic and clinical research from the department comprises work on [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[autoimmunity]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[neuromuscular diseases]], [[epilepsy]], [[stroke]], and [[cancer]] neurology.\n\nIn addition to serving as chairman of the department, Samuels maintains an active clinical practice at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, seeing patients with complex neurological problems. He serves regularly as the attending neurologist for inpatient and consultation services (named the Martin A. Samuels Neurology Consultation Service in 2010) at the Brigham, and regularly provides guidance to neurology residents and students on treating the most complex problems. \n\nIn 2018, after serving for 30 years as Founding Chair of Neurology at the Brigham, Samuels stepped down from the Chair to become the Emeritus Founding Chair of Neurology at the Brigham and Distinguished Miriam Sydney Joseph Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School.  He continues to be a full-time member of the Department of Neurology where he sees patients and teaches residents and students.\n\nFor his clinical accomplishments, Samuels has been honored with Fellowship in the [[American Academy of Neurology]], Fellowship in the [[American Neurological Association]], Fellowship in the [[Royal College of Physicians]] (London) and Mastership in the [[American College of Physicians]]. He has been the discusser in 13 ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' Clinical Pathology Conferences\u2014the most ever discussed by a single person.<ref>\n\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Samuels | first1 = MA | last2 = Kleinman | first2 = GA | year = 1979 | title = Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital.

The Martin A. Samuels Professorship in Neurology will be occupied by the future chairs of the Department of Neurology at the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. It is traditional at Harvard to not occupy a chair in one\u2019s own name, so the incumbent is permitted to create a temporary name as long as he is active. Dr. Samuels chose the name Miriam Sydney Joseph Professor of Neurology to honor his parents, Miriam Joseph and Sydney Samuels. As of July 1, 2013 Dr. Samuels became the Miriam Sydney Joseph Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and continues to serve as the Chair of The Department of Neurology and Neurologist-in-Chief, Brigham and Women's Hospital.

They are \"self-governing districts\".\n\nSeveral agencies issue population figures. Locally registered Thai populations as compiled by the '''Department of Local Administration''' (DLA), also known as, \"Locally Registered Thai Population\". These figures reflect the migrant, upcountry, and seasonal nature of Thai labor flows to the capital and tourist hotspots, yet maintain upcountry registration. Figures are very different from those by '''National Statistics Office''' (NSO), which conduct the decennnial census counts that attempt to count total resident Thai population + under 1,000 permanent resident foreigners (\"Total Thai Population\"). Neither of these offices releases municipal level figures that include non-permanent resident, long stay expatriates and figures for contracted foreign ASEAN migrants (a significant labor segment in cities like Bangkok, Pattaya, Chiang Mai, and Phuket, totaling two to three million workers), though increasingly regularized since 2014. The NSO did release projected figures including regularized ASEAN migrants, i.e., \"total resident population\" down to the provincial level for 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thailand: Planning Regions and Provinces |url=http://citypopulation.de/php/thailand-prov-admin.php |website=City Population |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n==City-municipality==\n[[File:Bangkok Night Wikimedia Commons.jpg|165px|thumbnail|Skyscrapers, Bangkok]]\n[[File:Pattaya beach.jpg|165px|thumbnail|[[Pattaya]], the second most visited city after Bangkok]]\n[[File:Sriracha city.jpg|165px|thumbnail|[[Si Racha District]] and [[Chaophraya Surasak]], [[Chon Buri Province]], [[Eastern Thailand]] ]]\n[[File:Nonthaburi.jpg|165px|thumbnail| [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]] clock tower ]]\n[[File:Downtown Korat.JPG|165px|thumbnail|[[Nakhon Ratchasima]] or ''Korat'', the largest metropolitan area in Isan]]\n[[File:Chiang Mai City Sky View 2.jpg|165px|thumbnail|[[Chiang Mai]], the largest metropolitan area in the north]]\n[[File:Skyline of Hat Yai City, June 2012 by.jpg|165px|thumbnail|[[Hat Yai]], the largest metropolitan area in the south]]\n\nThe table below lists '''Department of Local Administration (DLA)''' (local registered Thai) 2019 figures.
