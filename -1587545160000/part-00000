Both are private, Catholic academic institutions within the Metropolitan Manila area. The Ateneo men's varsity team is known as the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], women's varsity team as the [[Ateneo Lady Eagles volleyball team|Ateneo Lady Eagles]], and high school team as the Ateneo Blue Eaglets. The De La Salle men's varsity team is known as the [[De La Salle Green Archers]], women's varsity team as the [[DLSU Lady Spikers|DLSU Lady Archers/Spikers]], and high school team as the [[DLSZ Junior Archers]].\n\n==History==\nDe La Salle and Ateneo were both co-founders of the pre-war NCAA but actively compete in the UAAP. The historied rivalry began when Ateneo lost to De La Salle in a hotly contested championship basketball game during the 16th NCAA Season (1939\u201340). Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hard fought but was not yet tagged by the local sportswriters as the recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries was between Ateneo versus San Beda, and De La Salle versus Letran. The rivalry between De La Salle vs Ateneo then was mostly based on their academic performance, debate, social status, prestige and school pride. When Ateneo and De La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off court. The sports press showed interest and wrote about the school rivalry that always caught the attention of sports loving fans. The basketball games between De La Salle and Ateneo are the most anticipated battles in every UAAP season year after year. A Green Archer versus Blue Eagle fray would always draw huge, loyal crowds of fanatical students, school faculty and officials, notable and influential alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen, justices of the Supreme Court, former Presidents of the Philippines, and several notable people of great influence in Philippine society. Several Ambassadors of the United States of America would gamely attend and watch a De La Salle vs Ateneo basketball game year after year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://humblebola.com/the-rewind-the-past-present-and-future-of-ateneo-la-salle/|title=THE REWIND: THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF ATENEO-LA SALLE|work=Humblebola|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/a-brief-history-of-the-ateneo-la-salle-rivalry-a1993-20170911-lfrm2|title=A Brief History of the Ateneo vs De La Salle rivalry|work=Esquire|access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref> The rivalry started out with the men's basketball games and has since expanded to other sports, particularly in women's volleyball where both teams fought head-to-head in the UAAP Finals for six consecutive times from 2012 to 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.ph/volleyball/uaap-volleyball/1057045/defining-the-2010s-lady-spikers-dynastic-rule-in-the-uaap/|title=Defining the 2010s: Lady Spikers\u2019 dynastic rule in the UAAP|work=Fox Sports|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref> Both universities have also extended their rivalry beyond sports and have gone into their various fields of academic achievements, accomplishments, expertise and contributions to the upliftment of the Philippines.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1925, basketball games between Ateneo and De La Salle were played at an open basketball court at the Padre Faura, Ermita campus of UP and in 1926 at the Nozaleda Park (now called Agrifina Circle which is part of Luneta Park). The venue later moved to the covered courts of the US Army's 31st Infantry Gym and UST Gym.<ref>Suva GT: NCAA 25th Anniversary Souvenir Program, San Juan, Rizal: JCP Publishing, 1949</ref> The games then moved to the pre-war Rizal Memorial Coliseum to accommodate bigger crowds, and at one point, the venues included the Ateneo Loyola Center, the Cuneta Astrodome, the PhilSports Arena. Currently, the Smart Araneta Coliseum and the SM Mall of Asia Arena are the present main venues for their sold out games.

The [[Collegiate Champions League]] (CCL), was then reformatted and became the [[Philippine Collegiate Championship League]] (PCCL). It is currently the national collegiate basketball championship tournament, sanctioned by the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]], the country's official basketball federation. College teams from all over the country participate in the tournament. The tournament also has a Sweet 16 similar to the United States' NCAA Basketball Tournament during \"March Madness.\"\n\nThe Green Archers won the 2008 PCCL title. La Salle defeated the second-seeded NCAA champion [[San Beda Red Lions]] and arranged a finals meeting with the top-seeded UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who defeated the [[Letran Knights]] in the Final Four.

They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012. In 2019, Ateneo achieved another 3-peat and became the first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16\u20130) in the [[UAAP Season 82]] men's basketball tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/20/19/sweep-16-ateneo-wins-uaap-82-title-in-historic-fashion|title=Sweep 16!

The Ateneo Blue Eagles still have the most number of double titles in NCAA history, with four double championships, including the NCAA's second back-to-back double championships in 1975 and 1976 (the first was accomplished by the University of the Philippines in 1925 and 1926).\n\nAteneo holds the distinction of being the only double 3-peat champion in the senior and junior levels whether in the NCAA or UAAP, from 2008 to 2010, and has posted two 4-peats and three back-to-back title streaks in the UAAP juniors' division.\n\nLa Salle does not have any such streaks in the NCAA, but won back-to-back titles once in 1989 and 1990, and also posted a rare 4-peat in UAAP men's basketball from [[UAAP Season 61|1998]] to [[UAAP Season 64|2001]]. La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).\n\nThe Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own from 1999 to 2002 which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era, until the NU Lady Bulldogs achieved their fifth consecutive championship in 2018.\n\nLa Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001. In 2013, La Salle were champions in both divisions again in the [[UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments]].\n\n===NCAA===\nIn 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship.

Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship.

La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the UAAP Finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped of the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a Finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. In 2012, the two teams met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the Finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo\u2013La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in 3 full games that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroning La Salle in the process.\n\n'''2001 Finals: La Salle 4-peat'''<br />\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

In 2003, La Salle forced No. 1 seed Ateneo into a rubber match after a 76\u201372 overtime win, with the game being halted after a brawl erupted between the two teams. With Ateneo's [[LA Tenorio]] and La Salle's [[Ryan Ara\u00f1a]] suspended for the deciding game, Ateneo eliminated La Salle from Finals contention in the deciding game with a 74\u201368 triumph.\n\nIn [[UAAP Season 67|2004]], La Salle and Ateneo finished the elimination round tied for second place, so a playoff game was played to determine which team gets the twice-to-beat advantage. La Salle won the game, and ended Ateneo's season in the semifinals, to face FEU in the Finals. La Salle would win in three games to deny FEU which had defeated Ateneo a season before, a back-to-back championship run.\n\nIn 2005, three teams, La Salle, Ateneo and UE, were all tied for second place. La Salle won the tiebreaker with a superior point differential on games played by the three teams, causing Ateneo and UE to play for the right to face La Salle with the twice-to-win ''disadvantage'' in which the Eagles won. However, La Salle defeated Ateneo in the semifinals to clinch another Finals appearance against FEU.\n\n'''2006: La Salle Suspension'''\n\nAfter FEU swept La Salle in the 2005 championship series, La Salle admitted it fielded two ineligible players from 2003 to 2005, albeit it claimed not to be aware of their ineligibility which caused them to return the 2005 runner-up trophy and the 2004 championship trophy they won against FEU (The league would later award FEU the trophy). The league suspended La Salle in [[UAAP Season 69|2006]] for a year due to negligence, with all of their games during that period also forfeited. Ateneo faced UST in the 2006 Finals, a series UST won in three games.\n\n'''2007: \"Two is Greater than Three\"'''\n\nUpon their return in [[UAAP Season 70|2007]], UE swept the elimination round 14\u20130, with their last game against La Salle going into overtime with the Warriors still prevailing. With Ateneo also losing their last game, the two teams were again tied for second place, and La Salle won the playoff game to clinch the twice-to-beat advantage. Prior to this, Ateneo won the two elimination round games against La Salle.\n\nUnlike earlier match-ups where the team with the advantage won the first game, Ateneo won the first game, with [[Chris Tiu]] playing pivotal roles in crunch time where he scored the winning lay-up with 7.3 seconds remaining to force a deciding game.<ref name=\"GMANews.tv\">{{cite news|title=UAAP: Eagles upset Archers, 65\u201364, to force 1 more game |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/62225/UAAP-Eagles-upset-Archers-65-64-to-force-1-more-game |publisher=GMANews.tv |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2009-06-05 }}</ref> In their fifth meeting of the season, [[Pocholo Villanueva]] scored a three-pointer to add La Salle's lead to nine with less than three minutes in the game left.

With these conditions, the first Ateneo\u2013La Salle game came at the heels of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]]'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66\u201363, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007.  In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4\u20139, the Blue Eagles went on a 10\u20130 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74\u201357.\n\n2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.\n\nIn 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.\n\n'''2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo'''\n\nUpon the departure of Norman Black, [[Bo Perasol|Dolreich \"Bo\" Perasol]], a former member of the [[UP Fighting Maroons|University of the Philippines men's basketball team]] and a seasoned [[Philippine Basketball Association]] head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.\n\nOver at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013\u20132014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.\n\nFor the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82\u201373, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66\u201364, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.\n\nToward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [[UST Growling Tigers]].\n\nAteneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74\u201382, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.\n\nLa Salle, after a disastrous 3\u20134 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10\u20134, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [[NU Bulldogs]] and the [[FEU Tamaraws]]. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [[UAAP Season 71]]. During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [[UAAP Season 76]] men's basketball championship title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/124063/la-salle-beats-ust-in-overtime-for-uaap-title|title= La Salle rallies past UST in OT to win UAAP title|work=Inquirer|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''2016 Finals: Mayhem'''\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When [[La Salle Green Hills]] used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the [[Ateneo de Manila University#High School|Ateneo High School]] and the [[La Salle Green Hills#High School|LSGH High School]] are all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school [[De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School]], the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nIn juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has 6 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 8 in total.\n\nLa Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship.

On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round, defeated the third-seeded (and [[UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments|previous season's]] runner-up) [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Tigresses]] in the semifinals, and entered the finals for the first time since Ateneo De Manila University's 1978 admission into the UAAP.\n\nThe De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in three games to win their 7th UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets but Games Two and Three of the series were won by La Salle, with the DLSU Lady Spikers beating the Ateneo Lady Spikers in four sets during Game Two and in three sets during Game Three. [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] of La Salle was named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while then-graduating La Salle team captain [[Cha Cruz|Charleen Cruz]] was named as Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second consecutive season.<ref>https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/02/29/12/la-salle-blasts-ateneo-retain-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/249851/la-salle-crushes-ateneo-to-repeat-as-uaap-women-s-volleyball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 75 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nAteneo and La Salle faced each other once again during the [[UAAP Season 75 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 75 women's volleyball finals]] after the De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the [[NU Bulldogs|NU Lady Bulldogs]] and the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the [[Adamson Falcons|Adamson Lady Falcons]] during the Final Four matches that were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] on February 23, 2013.\n\nThe UAAP Season 75 women's volleyball finals was the league's first volleyball finals series to be played at the Smart Araneta Coliseum and the Mall of Asia Arena. Game One of the Ateneo-La Salle finals was played before a crowd of 17,342 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on March 2, 2013. The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20\u201325, 17\u201325, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 15\u20136.\n\nPrior to Game Two of the finals, held at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] on March 6, 2013, team captain [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] and teammate [[Victonara Galang]] were named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season. With the game attended by 18,779 paying patrons, La Salle swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25\u201323, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, to finish the series in two games and win their third consecutive (and 8th overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Then-graduating La Salle player [[Michele Gumabao]] was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298005/sports/campussports/uaap-dlsu-defeats-ateneo-for-the-women-s-volleyball-crown-completes-3-peat</ref><ref>https://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/03/06/916692/la-salle-blazes-way-uaap-womens-volleyball-three-peat</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn \"Tai\" Bundit, were able to reach the finals after winning knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17\u201325, 25\u201323, 25\u201313, 25\u201320. Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25\u201314, 25\u201320, 19\u201325, 26\u201324. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].\n\nThe venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted from the Smart Araneta Coliseum to the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25\u201321, 25\u201323, 18\u201325, 16\u201325, 17\u201315, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest championship series in any sport, and the first to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1\u20130 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25\u201323, 26\u201324, 25\u201321, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and win their first UAAP women's volleyball championship title at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.\n\nAteneo's team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and became the first UAAP athlete to win at least 4 awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53094-ateneo-upsets-de-la-salle-wins-first-uaap-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/353812/united-they-fly-how-the-admu-lady-eagles-became-uaap-vball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals]]. For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14\u20130 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's Team Captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25\u201318, 25\u201319, 25\u201319. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201317, 25\u201323, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16\u20130 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [[Amy Ahomiro]] won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/452461/uaap-ateneo-shuts-out-la-salle-for-perfect-season-wins-second-straight-women-s-volleyball-title/story/?ref=related_stories</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/admu/86845-ateneo-sweeps-season-repeat-uaap-volleyball-champion</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [[UAAP Final Four|Regular Final Four]] format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position. After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [[UP Fighting Maroons|UP Lady Maroons]] during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets (the first non-DLSU team to defeat them as UAAP women's volleyball champions) in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [[FEU Tamaraws|FEU Lady Tamaraws]] to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nThe UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU\u2013FEU match-up in [[UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments|Season 71]] to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 25\u201321. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18\u201325, 26\u201328, 25\u201317, 25\u201316, 15\u201311, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201321, 25\u201316, 25\u201316 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nGraduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] earned her third straight Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65. Meanwhile, [[Kim Kianna Dy]] of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2016/04/30/la-salle-ateneo-uaap-volleyball-championship.html</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/131321-ateneo-la-salle-volleyball-game-3-finals-recap-2016-season-78</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season (marking the most recent time that Ateneo won against La Salle in any of their match-ups in UAAP women's volleyball as of the [[UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments|current season]]). In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their (Final Four era) league-record ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nGame One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans.

La Salle's [[Mary Joy Baron]] and [[Desiree Cheng]] were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169078-lady-spikers-win-back-to-back-titles-sweep-ateneo</ref><ref>https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/uaap-season-79-womens-volleyball-la-salle-reigns-for-10th-time-vanquishes-ateneo/84567</ref>\n\nSeason 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six consecutive Ateneo\u2013La Salle match-ups in the UAAP women's volleyball finals since Season 74, after the Lady Eagles were booted out from finals contention in [[UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments|Season 80]] as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws to face the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers in the latter's tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018, and the first all-green (DLSU\u2013FEU) UAAP women's volleyball finals match-up since Season 71.\n\nLa Salle went on to sweep FEU in the finals to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak) in 2018,<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/201607-dlsu-lady-spikers-winner-feu-tamaraws-season-80-finals-game-2</ref> but was dethroned by UST in their Final Four match-up [[UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments|the following year]], ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and 10 consecutive years of appearance in the UAAP Finals, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles won the same year's Final Four match-up against FEU to pose their return to the finals after missing the cut in the previous year. The Lady Eagles went on to win the finals series against UST, 2\u20131, in the first ever Ateneo\u2013UST UAAP women's volleyball finals showdown to claim their third women's volleyball title.<ref>https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2019/05/18/uaap-season-81-finals-lady-eagles-reclaim-throne-56887</ref>\n\n==Women's volleyball tournament results==\n\nHead-to-head championships between the teams have La Salle leading 4 championships to 2.

Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the NCAA were always hard fought but was not yet tagged by the local sportswriters as the recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries was between Ateneo versus San Beda, and De La Salle versus Letran. The rivalry between De La Salle vs Ateneo then was mostly based on their academic performance, debate, social status, prestige and school pride. When Ateneo and De La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off court. The sports press showed interest and wrote about the school rivalry that always caught the attention of sports loving fans. The basketball games between De La Salle and Ateneo are the most anticipated battles in every UAAP season year after year. A Green Archer versus Blue Eagle fray would always draw huge, loyal crowds of fanatical students, school faculty and officials, notable and influential alumni, actors and actresses, musicians, business tycoons, high government officials such as cabinet members, senators, congressmen, justices of the Supreme Court, former Presidents of the Philippines, and several notable people of great influence in Philippine society.

The [[Collegiate Champions League]] (CCL), was then reformatted and became the [[Philippine Collegiate Championship League]] (PCCL). It is currently the national collegiate basketball championship tournament, sanctioned by the [[Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas]], the country's official basketball federation. College teams from all over the country participate in the tournament. The tournament also has a Sweet 16 similar to the United States' NCAA Basketball Tournament during \"March Madness.\"\n\nThe Green Archers won the 2008 PCCL title. La Salle defeated the second-seeded NCAA champion [[San Beda Red Lions]] and arranged a finals meeting with the top-seeded UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who defeated the [[Letran Knights]] in the Final Four. In the championship match, the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] prevailed over the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], 71\u201362.\n\nIn the 2009 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the FEU Tamaraws in three games to clinch their second national title, whereas the Green Archers were eliminated by the Letran Knights in their first game in the round of 16. In the 2010 season, the Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in three games to clinch their third and back-to-back national titles, while the Green Archers settled for 3rd-place beating the UC Webmasters despite having 4 players injured and only 10 players intact in the line-up.\n\nIn the 2013 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Green Archers defeated the South Western University Cobras, via sweep to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2008 and winning their second title in the tournament.\n\nIn the 2018 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the University of Visayas Green Lancers, 95\u201371 to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2010 and winning their fourth title in the tournament.

They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012. In 2019, Ateneo achieved another 3-peat and became the first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16\u20130) in the [[UAAP Season 82]] men's basketball tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/11/20/19/sweep-16-ateneo-wins-uaap-82-title-in-historic-fashion|title=Sweep 16!

The Ateneo Blue Eagles still have the most number of double titles in NCAA history, with four double championships, including the NCAA's second back-to-back double championships in 1975 and 1976 (the first was accomplished by the University of the Philippines in 1925 and 1926).\n\nAteneo holds the distinction of being the only double 3-peat champion in the senior and junior levels whether in the NCAA or UAAP, from 2008 to 2010, and has posted two 4-peats and three back-to-back title streaks in the UAAP juniors' division.\n\nLa Salle does not have any such streaks in the NCAA, but won back-to-back titles once in 1989 and 1990, and also posted a rare 4-peat in UAAP men's basketball from [[UAAP Season 61|1998]] to [[UAAP Season 64|2001]]. La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).\n\nThe Lady Archers also achieved a 4-peat of their own from 1999 to 2002 which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era, until the NU Lady Bulldogs achieved their fifth consecutive championship in 2018.\n\nLa Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001. In 2013, La Salle were champions in both divisions again in the [[UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments]].\n\n===NCAA===\nIn 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship.

Another finals meeting of both schools took place in 1974 with La Salle prevailing over Ateneo in the championship.

La Salle won back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, and won four straight titles from 1998 to 2001, with La Salle beating Ateneo in the 2001 Finals, capping its 4-peat title run. Ateneo subsequently defeated La Salle in the 2002 championship to end its 14-year title drought. In 2003, Ateneo eliminated La Salle in the semifinals, breaking a streak of La Salle appearances in the UAAP Finals. La Salle won the 2004 title after eliminating Ateneo in the semifinals, but was stripped of the title when they were suspended for fielding two ineligible players. La Salle swept the UE Red Warriors to win the 2007 title after the suspension, a season that saw them meet the Blue Eagles five times, lose thrice, but win two crucial games including the one that paved the way for a Finals appearance. Ateneo defeated La Salle in all four encounters in 2008, including the Finals, thereby dethroning DLSU. Ateneo then went on to win all matches against La Salle on the way to winning a running total of five consecutive UAAP titles, except for a lone La Salle victory in the first round of eliminations in 2010. In 2012, the two teams met in a Final Four encounter, where the Blue Eagles defeated the Green Archers, eliminating La Salle from contention. With its 2012 title victory, Ateneo broke its deadlock of UAAP titles with La Salle and exceeded La Salle's championship streak with the longest in the Final Four era, and now has the longest held by only one UAAP school. Ateneo failed to enter the Final Four in 2013 while La Salle won the title for the first time since 2007. Both teams failed to enter the Finals in 2014. In 2015, both teams failed once again to enter the Finals with La Salle missing the Final Four for the first time since 2011, while Ateneo made it to the semifinals but lost to the eventual champions FEU Tamaraws, who also ousted La Salle in their last game (a game in which La Salle needed to win to stay in contention and force a knockout match) for the last Final Four slot in which enabled the erstwhile defending champions NU Bulldogs to grab the #4 position in the playoffs. In 2016 both teams met in the Finals for the first time since 2008 with both schools taking the Top 2 spots at the end of the elimination rounds and having the twice to beat advantage, with La Salle outlasting Adamson in one game, while Ateneo used their twice to beat advantage to take out the defending champions FEU Tamaraws in a hard-fought series with Ateneo winning the second game in an overtime thriller in which both teams did not score more than five points in the extra period. In the Finals the Green Archers swept the Blue Eagles to win their 9th title and break the tie among them for the number of UAAP titles. In 2017, both Ateneo and La Salle met once again in the Finals and the first back-to-back Ateneo\u2013La Salle Finals series since 2002 with Ateneo winning this time in 3 full games that ended their 5-year title drought and dethroning La Salle in the process.\n\n'''2001 Finals: La Salle 4\u2013peat'''<br />\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

With these conditions, the first Ateneo\u2013La Salle game came at the heels of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]]'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66\u201363, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard Sam Marata shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007.  In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4\u20139, the Blue Eagles went on a 10\u20130 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74\u201357.\n\n2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.\n\nIn 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in Gee Abanilla. The two schools met thrice that season- twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, Manny Pangilinan, announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.\n\n'''2013: The End of an Era for Ateneo'''\n\nUpon the departure of Norman Black, [[Bo Perasol|Dolreich \"Bo\" Perasol]], a former member of the [[UP Fighting Maroons|University of the Philippines men's basketball team]] and a seasoned [[Philippine Basketball Association]] head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward Chris Newsome.\n\nOver at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach Juno Sauler as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013\u20132014 UAAP season was Allan Caidic, who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards Jason Perkins and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, Mac Tallo, Fonzo Gotladera and Papot Paredes.\n\nFor the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round. During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena last July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard Almond Vosotros and center Arnold Van Opstal, defeated the Blue Eagles, 82\u201373, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season. The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum last September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66\u201364, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.\n\nToward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling. The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games. Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board. The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [[UST Growling Tigers]].\n\nAteneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74\u201382, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.\n\nLa Salle, after a disastrous 3\u20134 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10\u20134, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [[NU Bulldogs]] and the [[FEU Tamaraws]]. Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced the UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [[UAAP Season 71]]. During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [[UAAP Season 76]] men's basketball championship title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/124063/la-salle-beats-ust-in-overtime-for-uaap-title|title= La Salle rallies past UST in OT to win UAAP title|work=Inquirer|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''2016 Finals: Mayhem'''\n{|class=wikitable align=right\n|-\n!Game !!

The Green Archers finished the elimination round as the top seed with a 13\u20131 record with Ateneo coming in second with a 10\u20134 win-loss record. The only loss of the Green Archers came at the hands of their archivals, the Ateneo Blue Eagles during the second to the last game of the elimination round.

And a similar rivalry, although on much lesser scale, currently exists. When [[La Salle Green Hills]] used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA though, the rivalry between the Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the [[Ateneo de Manila University#High School|Ateneo High School]] and the [[La Salle Green Hills#High School|LSGH High School]] are all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. But this rivalry has since faded, with AHS being in the UAAP and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school [[De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School]], the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.\n\nIn juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has 6 NCAA titles and 2 UAAP titles, for 8 in total.\n\nLa Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Junior Championship. Ateneo High School and [[De La Salle Santiago Zobel School]] (DLSZ) met twice in the UAAP juniors' basketball finals; in [[UAAP Season 70|2007]] in which DLSZ won in two games dethroning the Eaglets in the process, and in [[UAAP Season 72|2009]] in which the Blue Eaglets won the best-of-three series, 2\u20131.

The Blue Eaglet Spikers won championship titles in NCAA Seasons 43, 45, and 48, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 50 to 52. The De La Salle Junior Spikers won 7 championship titles under their membership stint in the NCAA which included a 4-peat championship streak along with the Green Spikers from Seasons 53 to 56. In the UAAP, they were 6-peat champions in the boys' division from Seasons 57 to 62, and have also won the title in Season 66. The Junior Lady Spikers were 5-peat champions from UAAP Seasons 57 to 61, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 73 to 75.

On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round, defeated the third-seeded (and [[UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments|previous season's]] runner-up) [[UST Growling Tigers|UST Tigresses]] in the semifinals, and entered the finals for the first time since Ateneo De Manila University's 1978 admission into the UAAP.\n\nThe De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the Ateneo Lady Eagles in three games to win their 7th UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets but Games Two and Three of the series were won by La Salle, with the DLSU Lady Spikers beating the Ateneo Lady Spikers in four sets during Game Two and in three sets during Game Three.

The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20\u201325, 17\u201325, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 15\u20136.\n\nPrior to Game Two of the finals, held at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]] on March 6, 2013, team captain [[Aby Mara\u00f1o|Abigail Mara\u00f1o]] and teammate [[Victonara Galang]] were named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season. With the game attended by 18,779 paying patrons, La Salle swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25\u201323, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, to finish the series in two games and win their third consecutive (and 8th overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. Then-graduating La Salle player [[Michele Gumabao]] was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/298005/sports/campussports/uaap-dlsu-defeats-ateneo-for-the-women-s-volleyball-crown-completes-3-peat</ref><ref>https://www.philstar.com/sports/2013/03/06/916692/la-salle-blazes-way-uaap-womens-volleyball-three-peat</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals]]. The De La Salle Lady Spikers automatically entered the finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn \"Tai\" Bundit, were able to reach the finals after winning knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17\u201325, 25\u201323, 25\u201313, 25\u201320. Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25\u201314, 25\u201320, 19\u201325, 26\u201324. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].\n\nThe venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted from the Smart Araneta Coliseum to the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25\u201321, 25\u201323, 18\u201325, 16\u201325, 17\u201315, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest championship series in any sport, and the first to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1\u20130 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25\u201323, 26\u201324, 25\u201321, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and win their first UAAP women's volleyball championship title at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.\n\nAteneo's team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and became the first UAAP athlete to win at least 4 awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/53094-ateneo-upsets-de-la-salle-wins-first-uaap-volleyball-crown</ref><ref>https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/353812/united-they-fly-how-the-admu-lady-eagles-became-uaap-vball-champs/story/</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals]]. For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14\u20130 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's Team Captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).\n\nGame One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]] in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25\u201318, 25\u201319, 25\u201319. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]], Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201317, 25\u201323, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16\u20130 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [[Amy Ahomiro]] won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/content/452461/uaap-ateneo-shuts-out-la-salle-for-perfect-season-wins-second-straight-women-s-volleyball-title/story/?ref=related_stories</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/admu/86845-ateneo-sweeps-season-repeat-uaap-volleyball-champion</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [[UAAP Final Four|Regular Final Four]] format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position. After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [[UP Fighting Maroons|UP Lady Maroons]] during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets (the first non-DLSU team to defeat them as UAAP women's volleyball champions) in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [[FEU Tamaraws|FEU Lady Tamaraws]] to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nThe UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU\u2013FEU match-up in [[UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments|Season 71]] to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25\u201322, 25\u201322, 25\u201321. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18\u201325, 26\u201328, 25\u201317, 25\u201316, 15\u201311, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201321, 25\u201316, 25\u201316 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.\n\nGraduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [[Alyssa Valdez]] earned her third straight Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65. Meanwhile, [[Kim Kianna Dy]] of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/sports/2016/04/30/la-salle-ateneo-uaap-volleyball-championship.html</ref><ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/131321-ateneo-la-salle-volleyball-game-3-finals-recap-2016-season-78</ref>\n\n=== UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals ===\n\nFor the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [[UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments|UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals]]. During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season (marking the most recent time that Ateneo won against La Salle in any of their match-ups in UAAP women's volleyball as of the [[UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments|current season]]). In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their (Final Four era) league-record ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.\n\nGame One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers recorded their first victory against Ateneo Lady Eagles during this game for this season in four sets, 21\u201325, 29\u201327, 25\u201322 and 25\u201320. Game Two of the Finals was held again at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 6, 2017 in front of 20,860 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers won against Ateneo Lady Eagles in five sets, 19\u201325, 25\u201314, 18\u201325, 25\u201318 and 15\u201310, to finish the series in two games and earn their second consecutive (and tenth overall) UAAP women's volleyball title. La Salle's [[Mary Joy Baron]] and [[Desiree Cheng]] were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/169078-lady-spikers-win-back-to-back-titles-sweep-ateneo</ref><ref>https://tiebreakertimes.com.ph/tbt/uaap-season-79-womens-volleyball-la-salle-reigns-for-10th-time-vanquishes-ateneo/84567</ref>\n\nSeason 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six consecutive Ateneo\u2013La Salle match-ups in the UAAP women's volleyball finals since Season 74, after the Lady Eagles were booted out from finals contention in [[UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments|Season 80]] as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws to face the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers in the latter's tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018, and the first all-green (DLSU\u2013FEU) UAAP women's volleyball finals match-up since Season 71.\n\nLa Salle went on to sweep FEU in the finals to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak) in 2018,<ref>https://www.rappler.com/sports/university/uaap/201607-dlsu-lady-spikers-winner-feu-tamaraws-season-80-finals-game-2</ref> but was dethroned by UST in their Final Four match-up [[UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments|the following year]], ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and 10 consecutive years of appearance in the UAAP Finals, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles won the same year's Final Four match-up against FEU to pose their return to the finals after missing the cut in the previous year. The Lady Eagles went on to win the finals series against UST, 2\u20131, in the first ever Ateneo\u2013UST UAAP women's volleyball finals showdown to claim their third women's volleyball title.<ref>https://sports.abs-cbn.com/uaap/news/2019/05/18/uaap-season-81-finals-lady-eagles-reclaim-throne-56887</ref>\n\n==Women's volleyball tournament results==\n\nHead-to-head championships between the teams have La Salle leading 4 championships to 2.

From 2001 to 2005, De La Salle Zobel were RIFA 1 and 2 champions 9 times, most of them back to back champions in every year. The only loss De La Salle Zobel encountered was a loss to Xavier high school during the RIFA 2 championship in 2004.\n\n===Badminton===\n\nAteneo has 11 titles whereas La Salle has 6 in terms of total seniors' badminton collegiate championships. The last men's badminton crown for La Salle came in 2007 and for Ateneo in 2013. Ateneo also won championship titles in 1995, 1996, 2001, 2003, and 2011.

In 2006, Ateneo handed La Salle its first humiliating 10-run loss, 17\u20137, on Jonathan Sibal's 2-RBI single off pitcher Jeff Ardio which ended the game prematurely at the 8th inning (mercy rule). La Salle actually led 7\u20134 in the 4th inning before Ateneo exploded for 9 runs and put the game out of reach. In 2009, Ateneo and La Salle combined for what may be the highest scoring game in UAAP Baseball history when Ateneo defeated La Salle, 27\u201314. In [[UAAP Season 78]], La Salle dethroned Ateneo who were the 3-peat defending champions. Both teams would meet again in the [[UAAP Season 81]] Finals, where La Salle won their fifth championship title after defeating Ateneo in Game 3, 11\u20139. In the juniors' division, Ateneo has 2 NCAA titles and 3 UAAP titles for a total of 5 championship titles. La Salle won all 4 of its championship titles in the UAAP.\n\n==Trivia==\nDue to the numerous socialites watching the games live, La Salle head coach [[Franz Pumaren]] said that \"The janitors in the Araneta Coliseum would often say, 'If there's an Ateneo\u2013La Salle game, once everybody's out of the coliseum, it still smells good because of all the socialites watching.\" In the late 1990s, former first daughter and actress [[Kris Aquino]] would call Ateneo head coach [[Joe Lipa]] to check on the team's progress, according to Ricky Dandan, Lipa's former assistant and brother of former [[NU Bulldogs]] coach Manny. [[Joel Banal]], Ateneo's head coach from 2002 to [[UAAP Season 66|2003]], used to have nightmares about La Salle's dreaded [[Full-court press|press]], and considers the 2002 championship as his greatest accomplishment, after which Ateneo alums would pay for his restaurant bills. Moreover, Ateneo alumni installed the playing floor on the [[2000 NBA All-Star Game]] to the [[Moro Lorenzo Sports Center]], while [[ICTSI]] shipping magnate Billionaire [[Enrique K.

After three years, he moved to [[WLW|WLW-AM]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where Merle Travis had formerly worked.\n\nAfter six months, he moved to Raleigh and worked with [[Johnnie and Jack]] before heading for [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he performed with [[Sunshine Sue|Sunshine Sue Workman]]. Atkins's shy personality worked against him, as did the fact that his sophisticated style led many to doubt he was truly \"country\". He was fired often, but was soon able to land another job at another radio station on account of his unique playing ability.<ref name=\"CG\" />\n\nAtkins and [[Jethro Burns]] (of [[Homer and Jethro]]) married twin sisters, Leona and Lois Johnson, who sang as Laverne and Fern Johnson, the Johnson Sisters.

Accessed on March 28, 2008.</ref> Atkins made his first appearance at the Opry in 1946 as a member of Foley's band. He also recorded a single for Nashville-based [[Bullet Records]] that year. That single, \"Guitar Blues\", was fairly progressive, including a clarinet solo by the Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan, with [[Owen Bradley]] on piano. He had a solo spot on the Opry, but when that was cut, Atkins moved on to [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Despite the support of executive [[Si Siman]], however, he soon was fired for not sounding \"country enough\".<ref name=\"CG\" />\n\n===Signing with RCA Victor===\nWhile working with a Western band in [[Denver, Colorado]], Atkins came to the attention of [[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]]. Siman had been encouraging [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]] to sign Atkins, as his style (with the success of Merle Travis as a hit recording artist) was suddenly in vogue. Sholes, A&R director of country music at RCA, tracked Atkins down in Denver.\n\nHe made his first RCA Victor recordings in Chicago in 1947, but they did not sell. He did some studio work for RCA that year, but had relocated to Knoxville again where he worked with Homer and Jethro on WNOX's new Saturday night radio show ''The Tennessee Barn Dance'' and the popular ''Midday Merry Go Round''.\n\nIn 1949, he left WNOX to join [[June Carter]] with Mother Maybelle and the [[The Carter Sisters|Carter Sisters]] on KWTO. This incarnation of the old [[Carter Family]] featured Maybelle Carter and daughters June, Helen, and Anita. Their work soon attracted attention from the Grand Ole Opry. The group relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in the mid-1950s. Atkins began working on recording sessions and performing on [[WSM (AM)|WSM-AM]] and the Opry.<ref name=\"CG\" /> Atkins became a member of the Opry in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Opry Timeline \u2013 1950s\n| url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html\n| date = \n| accessdate = July 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile he had not yet had a hit record for RCA Victor, his stature was growing. He began assisting Sholes as a session leader when the New York\u2013based producer needed help organizing Nashville sessions for RCA Victor artists. Atkins's first hit single was \"[[Mr. Sandman]]\", followed by \"Silver Bell\", which he recorded as a duet with [[Hank Snow]]. His albums also became more popular. He was featured on ABC-TV's ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show]]'' in the summer of 1956 and on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Country Music Jubilee]]'' in 1957 and 1958 (by then renamed ''Jubilee USA'').\n[[File:Gretsch G6122-1958.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins's [[Gretsch]] Country Gentleman, model G6122, 1962]]\n\nIn addition to recording, Atkins was a design consultant for [[Gretsch]], which manufactured a popular Chet Atkins line of electric guitars from 1955\u20131980. He became manager of RCA Victor's Nashville studios, eventually inspiring and seeing the completion of the legendary [[RCA Studio B]], the first studio built specifically for the purpose of recording on the now-famous [[Music Row]]. Also later on, Chet and [[Owen Bradley]] would become instrumental in the creation of studio B\u2019s adjacent building [[RCA Studio A]] as well.<ref name=\"mamg\" />\n\n===Performer and producer===\nWhen Sholes took over pop production in 1957\u2014a result of his success with [[Elvis Presley]]\u2014he put Atkins in charge of RCA Victor's Nashville division. With country music record sales declining as rock and roll became more popular, Atkins and [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] took their cue from [[Owen Bradley]] and eliminated fiddles and steel guitar as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans. This became known as the [[Nashville sound]], which Atkins said was a label created by the media for a style of recording during that period intended to keep country (and their jobs) viable.\n\nAtkins used the [[Jordanaires]] and a rhythm section on hits such as [[Jim Reeves]]'s \"[[Four Walls (Jim Reeves song)|Four Walls]]\" and \"[[He'll Have to Go]]\"<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r245817|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic entry for ''Welcome to My World'', Jim Reeves 1996 box set, Bear Family Records]</ref> and [[Don Gibson]]'s \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]]\" and \"Blue Blue Day\".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1624|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography of Don Gibson]</ref> The once-rare phenomenon of having a country hit [[Crossover (music)|cross over]] to pop success became more common. He and Bradley had essentially put the producer in the driver's seat, guiding an artist's choice of material and the musical background.\n\nAtkins made his own records, which usually visited pop standards and [[jazz]], in a sophisticated home studio, often recording the rhythm tracks at RCA and adding his solo parts at home, refining the tracks until the results satisfied him.<ref name=\"mamg\" /> Guitarists of all styles came to admire various Atkins albums for their unique musical ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas. In this period, he became known internationally as \"Mister Guitar\", inspiring an album, ''[[Mister Guitar]]'', engineered by both Bob Ferris and [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], Ferris's replacement.\n\n[[File:RCA Studio B - Chet Atkins, Bill Porter.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins listening as [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]] adjusts a mix in RCA's Nashville studio]]\nAt the end of March 1959, Porter took over as chief engineer at RCA's Nashville studio, in the space eventually known as [[RCA Studio B|Studio B]] after the facility expanded with a second studio in 1960. (At the time, RCA's sole Nashville studio had no letter designation.) Porter soon helped Atkins get a better reverberation sound from the studio's German effects device, an [[Elektro-Mess-Technik|EMT]] [[Reverberation#Plate reverberators|plate reverb]]. With his [[golden ear]], Porter found the studio's acoustics to be problematic, and he devised a set of acoustic baffles to hang from the ceiling, then selected positions for microphones based on resonant [[room modes]]. The sound of the recordings improved significantly, and the studio achieved a string of successes. The Nashville sound became more [[Dynamic range|dynamic]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ballou|first=Glen|title=Handbook for Sound Engineers|year=1998|publisher=Focal Press|page=1154}}</ref> In later years, when Bradley asked how he achieved his sound, Atkins told him \"it was Porter.\"<ref name=McClellan2004>{{cite book |last1=McClellan |first1=John |last2=Bratic |first2=Deyan |title=Chet Atkins in Three Dimensions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmCUExOXx0MC |volume=2 |year=2004 |publisher=Mel Bay Publications |isbn=978-0-7866-5877-0 |pages=149\u2013152}}</ref> Porter described Atkins as respectful of musicians when recording\u2014if someone was out of tune, he would not single that person out by name. Instead, he would say something like, \"we got a little tuning problem&nbsp;... Everybody check and see what's going on.\"<ref name=McClellan2004/> If that did not work, Atkins would instruct Porter to turn the offending player down in the mix. When Porter left RCA in late-1964, Atkins said, \"the sound was never the same, never as great.\"<ref name=McClellan2004/>\n\nAtkins's trademark \"Atkins style\" of playing uses the thumb and first two or sometimes three fingers of the right hand. He developed this style from listening to Merle Travis,<ref name=pc10>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19758/m1/ |title=Show 10 \u2013 Tennessee Firebird: American Country Music Before and After Elvis. [Part 2] }}</ref> occasionally on a primitive radio. He was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger (which was exactly how Travis played), and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingers\u2014and that was the style he pioneered and mastered.\n\nHe enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians, and they were asked to perform at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1960. That performance was cancelled because of rioting, but a live recording of the group (''[[After the Riot in Newport|After the Riot at Newport]]'') was released. Atkins performed by invitation at the [[White House]] for every U.S. President from John F. Kennedy through to George H. W. Bush. Atkins was a member of the [[Million Dollar Band (country music group)|Million Dollar Band]] during the 1980s. He is also well known for his song \"Yankee Doodle Dixie\", in which he played \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\" and \"[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\" simultaneously, on the same guitar.\n\nBefore his mentor Sholes died in 1968, Atkins had become vice president of RCA's country division. In 1987, he told [[Nine-O-One Network Magazine|''Nine-O-One Network'' magazine]] that he was \"ashamed\" of his promotion: \"I wanted to be known as a guitarist and I know, too, that they give you titles like that in lieu of money. So beware when they want to make you vice president.\"<ref>Nine-O-One Interview, Nine-O-One Network Magazine, December 1987, p.10-11</ref> He had brought [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Bobby Bare]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Jerry Reed]], and [[John Hartford]] to the label in the 1960s and inspired and helped countless others.<ref name=\"RockHall\">[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/chet-atkins \"Chet Atkins\"], Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Accessed on March 28, 2008.</ref> He took a considerable risk during the mid-1960s, when the [[civil rights movement]] sparked violence throughout the South, by signing country music's first African-American singer, [[Charley Pride]], who sang rawer country than the smoother music Atkins had pioneered.\n\nAtkins's biggest hit single came in 1965, with \"Yakety Axe\", an adaptation of \"[[Yakety Sax]]\", by his friend, the saxophonist [[Boots Randolph]]. He rarely performed in those days and eventually hired other RCA producers, such as [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] and [[Felton Jarvis]], to lessen his workload.<ref name=\"mamg\" />\n\n===Later career===\nIn the 1970s, Atkins became increasingly stressed by his executive duties. He produced fewer records, but could still turn out hits such as [[Perry Como]]'s 1973 pop hit \"[[And I Love You So (song)|And I Love You So]]\". He recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker Jerry Reed, who had become a hit artist in his own right. A 1973 diagnosis of [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]], however, led Atkins to redefine his role at RCA, to allow others to handle administration while he went back to his first love, the guitar, often recording with Reed or even Jethro Burns from Homer and Jethro (his brother-in-law) after Homer died in 1971.<ref name=\"mamg\" /> Atkins would turn over his administrative duties to [[Jerry Bradley (record producer)|Jerry Bradley]], son of Owen, in 1973 at RCA.\n\nAtkins did little production work at RCA after stepping down and in fact, had hired producers at the label in the 1960s, among them [[Bob Ferguson (musician)|Bob Ferguson]] and [[Felton Jarvis]]. As a recording artist, Atkins grew disillusioned with RCA in the late 1970s. He felt stifled because the record company would not let him branch into jazz. He had also produced late 60's jazz recordings by Canadian guitarist [[Lenny Breau]], a friend and protege. His mid-1970s collaborations with one of his influences, [[Les Paul]], ''[[Chester and Lester|Chester & Lester]]'' and ''[[Guitar Monsters]]'', had already reflected that interest; ''Chester & Lester'' was one of the best-selling recordings of Atkins's career. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with the direction Gretsch (no longer family-owned) was going and withdrew his authorization for them to use his name and began designing guitars with [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]. Atkins ended his 35-year association with RCA in 1982 and signed with [[Columbia Records]], for whom he produced a debut album in 1983.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" />\n\nJazz had always been a strong love of his, and often in his career he was criticized by \"pure\" country musicians for his jazz influences. He also said on many occasions that he did not like being called a \"country guitarist,\" insisting that he was \"a guitarist, period.\" Although he played [[Playing by ear|by ear]] and was a masterful improviser, he was able to read music and even performed some classical guitar pieces. When [[Roger C. Field]], a friend, suggested to him in 1991 that he record and perform with a female singer, he did so with [[Suzy Bogguss]].<ref name=\"mamg\"/>\n\nHe returned to his country roots for albums he recorded with [[Mark Knopfler]] and Jerry Reed.<ref name=\"mamg\" /> Knopfler had long mentioned Atkins as one of his earliest influences. Atkins also collaborated with Australian guitar legend [[Tommy Emmanuel]]. On being asked to name the ten most influential guitarists of the twentieth century, he named [[Django Reinhardt]] to the first position, and also placed himself on the list.<ref name=\"OfficialSite\">[http://www.misterguitar.com/news/chetsten.html Official Web Site of Chet Atkins]. Accessed on August 27, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn later years, he even went back to radio, appearing on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio program, on [[American Public Media]] radio, even picking up a fiddle from time to time,<ref name=\"mamg\" /> and performing songs such as [[Bob Wills]]'s \"[[Corrina, Corrina (song)|Corrina, Corrina]]\" and [[Willie Nelson]]'s \"[[Seven Spanish Angels]]\" with Nelson on a 1985 broadcast of the show at the Bridges Auditorium on the campus of [[Pomona College]].\n\n==Death and legacy==\nAtkins received numerous awards, including 14 Grammy awards and nine Country Music Association awards for Instrumentalist of the Year.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> In 1993, he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. ''Billboard'' magazine awarded him its Century Award, its \"highest honor for distinguished creative achievement,\" in December 1997.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chetatkins/biography \"Biography&nbsp;\u2013 Chet Atkins\"]. ''Rolling Stone''. Accessed on May 10, 2008.</ref>\n\nAtkins is notable for his broad influence. His love for numerous styles of music can be traced from his early recording of the stride pianist [[James P. Johnson]]'s \"Johnson Rag\", all the way to the rock stylings of [[Eric Johnson (guitarist, born 1954)|Eric Johnson]], an invited guest on Atkins's recording sessions, who, when Atkins attempted to copy his influential rocker \"[[Cliffs of Dover (song)|Cliffs of Dover]]\", led to Atkins's creation of a unique arrangement of \"Londonderry Air (Danny Boy)\".\n\nThe classical guitar selections included on almost all his albums were, for many American artists working in the field today, the first classical guitar they ever heard. He recorded [[smooth jazz]] guitar still played on American airwaves today.\n\nAtkins continued performing in the 1990s, but his health declined after he was diagnosed again with colon cancer in 1996. He died on June 30, 2001, at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 77.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/02/obit.chet.atkins/index.html \"Obituary\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323145021/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/02/obit.chet.atkins/index.html |date=March 23, 2008 }}, CNN, July 2, 2001 Accessed June 21, 2008</ref> His memorial service was held at Ryman Auditorium in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/04/us/guitars-gently-weep-as-nashville-pays-tribute-to-chet-atkins.html|title=Guitars Gently Weep as Nashville Pays Tribute to Chet Atkins|date=July 4, 2001|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}</ref> He was buried at Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens in Nashville.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23366 Chet Atkins at Find a Grave.] Accessed November 24, 2010</ref>\n\nA stretch of [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|Interstate 185]] in southwest [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (between [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] and [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]) is named \"Chet Atkins Parkway\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ganet.org/services/leg/ShowBillPre.cgi?year=1997&filename=1997/HR245.passed |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050128185210/http://www.ganet.org/services/leg/ShowBillPre.cgi?year=1997&filename=1997%2FHR245.passed |archivedate=January 28, 2005 |title=Chet Atkins Parkway Bill Resolution. |accessdate=January 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This stretch of interstate runs through Fortson, where Atkins spent much of his childhood.\n\nIn 2002, Atkins was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"RockHall\" /> His award was presented by [[Marty Stuart]] and [[Brian Setzer]] and accepted by Atkins's grandson, Jonathan Russell.

He was primarily known as a guitarist. He also played the mandolin, fiddle, banjo, and ukulele.\n\nAtkins's signature picking style was inspired by [[Merle Travis]]. Other major guitar influences were [[Django Reinhardt]], [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]], [[Les Paul]], and, later, [[Jerry Reed]].<ref name=pc10/> His distinctive picking style and musicianship brought him admirers inside and outside the country scene, both in the United States and abroad. Atkins spent most of his career at [[RCA Victor]] and produced records for the [[The Browns|Browns]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Porter Wagoner]], [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Dottie West]], [[Perry Como]], [[Floyd Cramer]], [[Elvis Presley]], the [[Everly Brothers]], [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Don Gibson]], [[Jim Reeves]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and many others.\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' credited Atkins with inventing the \"popwise 'Nashville sound' that rescued country music from a commercial slump,\" and ranked him number 21 on their list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists Of All Time.\"<ref name=\"Chet Atkins\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/chet-atkins-20111122 \"Chet Atkins\"].

He also received nine [[Country Music Association]] awards for Instrumentalist of the Year. He was inducted into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]], the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]], and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]]. [[George Harrison]] was also inspired by Chet Atkins; Early Beatles songs such as \"[[All My Loving]]\" show the influence.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Childhood and early life===\nAtkins was born on June 20, 1924, in [[Luttrell, Tennessee]], near [[Clinch Mountain]]. His parents divorced when he was six years old, after which he was raised by his mother. He was the youngest of three boys and a girl. He started out on the [[ukulele]], later moving on to the [[fiddle]], but made a swap with his brother, Lowell, when he was nine: an old pistol and some chores for a [[guitar]].<ref name=\"CMT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/atkins_chet/bio.jhtml |title=Country Music Television biography. |publisher=Cmt.com |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2008}}</ref> He stated in his 1974 autobiography, \"We were so poor and everybody around us was so poor that it was the forties before anyone even knew there had been a depression.\" Forced to relocate to Fortson, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], outside of [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], to live with his father because of a critical [[asthma]] condition, Atkins was a sensitive youth who made music his obsession. Because of his illness, he was forced to sleep in a straight-back chair to breathe comfortably. On those nights, he played his guitar until he fell asleep holding it, a habit that lasted his whole life.<ref name=\"CG\">Atkins, Chet; Neely, Bill (1974). \"Country Gentleman\". Chicago.

After three years, he moved to [[WLW|WLW-AM]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where Merle Travis had formerly worked.\n\nAfter six months, he moved to Raleigh and worked with [[Johnnie and Jack]] before heading for [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he performed with [[Sunshine Sue|Sunshine Sue Workman]]. Atkins's shy personality worked against him, as did the fact that his sophisticated style led many to doubt he was truly \"country\". He was fired often, but was soon able to land another job at another radio station on account of his unique playing ability.<ref name=\"CG\" />\n\nAtkins and [[Jethro Burns]] (of [[Homer and Jethro]]) married twin sisters, Leona and Lois Johnson, who sang as Laverne and Fern Johnson, the Johnson Sisters. Leona Atkins outlived her husband by eight years, dying in 2009 at the age of 85.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=3389 |title=Chet Atkins' Widow Dies |date=October 22, 2009 |work=Country Standard Time |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nTravelling to Chicago, Atkins auditioned for [[Red Foley]], who was leaving his star position on [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]]'s ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name=\"RollingStone\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5931727/chet_atkins_dies/print \"Chet Atkins Dies\"] ''Rolling Stone''. Accessed on March 28, 2008.</ref> Atkins made his first appearance at the Opry in 1946 as a member of Foley's band. He also recorded a single for Nashville-based [[Bullet Records]] that year. That single, \"Guitar Blues\", was fairly progressive, including a clarinet solo by the Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan, with [[Owen Bradley]] on piano. He had a solo spot on the Opry, but when that was cut, Atkins moved on to [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Despite the support of executive [[Si Siman]], however, he soon was fired for not sounding \"country enough\".<ref name=\"CG\" />\n\n===Signing with RCA Victor===\nWhile working with a Western band in [[Denver, Colorado]], Atkins came to the attention of [[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]]. Siman had been encouraging [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]] to sign Atkins, as his style (with the success of Merle Travis as a hit recording artist) was suddenly in vogue. Sholes, A&R director of country music at RCA, tracked Atkins down in Denver.\n\nHe made his first RCA Victor recordings in Chicago in 1947, but they did not sell. He did some studio work for RCA that year, but had relocated to Knoxville again where he worked with Homer and Jethro on WNOX's new Saturday night radio show ''The Tennessee Barn Dance'' and the popular ''Midday Merry Go Round''.\n\nIn 1949, he left WNOX to join [[June Carter]] with Mother Maybelle and the [[The Carter Sisters|Carter Sisters]] on KWTO. This incarnation of the old [[Carter Family]] featured Maybelle Carter and daughters June, Helen, and Anita. Their work soon attracted attention from the Grand Ole Opry. The group relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in the mid-1950s. Atkins began working on recording sessions and performing on [[WSM (AM)|WSM-AM]] and the Opry.<ref name=\"CG\" /> Atkins became a member of the Opry in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Opry Timeline \u2013 1950s\n| url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html\n| date = \n| accessdate = July 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile he had not yet had a hit record for RCA Victor, his stature was growing. He began assisting Sholes as a session leader when the New York\u2013based producer needed help organizing Nashville sessions for RCA Victor artists. Atkins's first hit single was \"[[Mr. Sandman]]\", followed by \"Silver Bell\", which he recorded as a duet with [[Hank Snow]]. His albums also became more popular. He was featured on ABC-TV's ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show]]'' in the summer of 1956 and on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Country Music Jubilee]]'' in 1957 and 1958 (by then renamed ''Jubilee USA'').\n[[File:Gretsch G6122-1958.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins's [[Gretsch]] Country Gentleman, model G6122, 1962]]\n\nIn addition to recording, Atkins was a design consultant for [[Gretsch]], which manufactured a popular Chet Atkins line of electric guitars from 1955\u20131980. He became manager of RCA Victor's Nashville studios, eventually inspiring and seeing the completion of the legendary [[RCA Studio B]], the first studio built specifically for the purpose of recording on the now-famous [[Music Row]]. Also later on, Chet and [[Owen Bradley]] would become instrumental in the creation of studio B\u2019s adjacent building [[RCA Studio A]] as well.<ref name=\"mamg\" />\n\n===Performer and producer===\nWhen Sholes took over pop production in 1957\u2014a result of his success with [[Elvis Presley]]\u2014he put Atkins in charge of RCA Victor's Nashville division. With country music record sales declining as rock and roll became more popular, Atkins and [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] took their cue from [[Owen Bradley]] and eliminated fiddles and steel guitar as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans. This became known as the [[Nashville sound]], which Atkins said was a label created by the media for a style of recording during that period intended to keep country (and their jobs) viable.\n\nAtkins used the [[Jordanaires]] and a rhythm section on hits such as [[Jim Reeves]]'s \"[[Four Walls (Jim Reeves song)|Four Walls]]\" and \"[[He'll Have to Go]]\"<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r245817|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic entry for ''Welcome to My World'', Jim Reeves 1996 box set, Bear Family Records]</ref> and [[Don Gibson]]'s \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]]\" and \"Blue Blue Day\".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1624|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography of Don Gibson]</ref> The once-rare phenomenon of having a country hit [[Crossover (music)|cross over]] to pop success became more common. He and Bradley had essentially put the producer in the driver's seat, guiding an artist's choice of material and the musical background.\n\nAtkins made his own records, which usually visited pop standards and [[jazz]], in a sophisticated home studio, often recording the rhythm tracks at RCA and adding his solo parts at home, refining the tracks until the results satisfied him.<ref name=\"mamg\" /> Guitarists of all styles came to admire various Atkins albums for their unique musical ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas. In this period, he became known internationally as \"Mister Guitar\", inspiring an album, ''[[Mister Guitar]]'', engineered by both Bob Ferris and [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], Ferris's replacement.\n\n[[File:RCA Studio B - Chet Atkins, Bill Porter.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins listening as [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]] adjusts a mix in RCA's Nashville studio]]\nAt the end of March 1959, Porter took over as chief engineer at RCA's Nashville studio, in the space eventually known as [[RCA Studio B|Studio B]] after the facility expanded with a second studio in 1960. (At the time, RCA's sole Nashville studio had no letter designation.) Porter soon helped Atkins get a better reverberation sound from the studio's German effects device, an [[Elektro-Mess-Technik|EMT]] [[Reverberation#Plate reverberators|plate reverb]]. With his [[golden ear]], Porter found the studio's acoustics to be problematic, and he devised a set of acoustic baffles to hang from the ceiling, then selected positions for microphones based on resonant [[room modes]]. The sound of the recordings improved significantly, and the studio achieved a string of successes. The Nashville sound became more [[Dynamic range|dynamic]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ballou|first=Glen|title=Handbook for Sound Engineers|year=1998|publisher=Focal Press|page=1154}}</ref> In later years, when Bradley asked how he achieved his sound, Atkins told him \"it was Porter.\"<ref name=McClellan2004>{{cite book |last1=McClellan |first1=John |last2=Bratic |first2=Deyan |title=Chet Atkins in Three Dimensions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmCUExOXx0MC |volume=2 |year=2004 |publisher=Mel Bay Publications |isbn=978-0-7866-5877-0 |pages=149\u2013152}}</ref> Porter described Atkins as respectful of musicians when recording\u2014if someone was out of tune, he would not single that person out by name. Instead, he would say something like, \"we got a little tuning problem&nbsp;... Everybody check and see what's going on.\"<ref name=McClellan2004/> If that did not work, Atkins would instruct Porter to turn the offending player down in the mix. When Porter left RCA in late-1964, Atkins said, \"the sound was never the same, never as great.\"<ref name=McClellan2004/>\n\nAtkins's trademark \"Atkins style\" of playing uses the thumb and first two or sometimes three fingers of the right hand. He developed this style from listening to Merle Travis,<ref name=pc10>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19758/m1/ |title=Show 10 \u2013 Tennessee Firebird: American Country Music Before and After Elvis. [Part 2] }}</ref> occasionally on a primitive radio. He was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger (which was exactly how Travis played), and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingers\u2014and that was the style he pioneered and mastered.\n\nHe enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians, and they were asked to perform at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1960. That performance was cancelled because of rioting, but a live recording of the group (''[[After the Riot in Newport|After the Riot at Newport]]'') was released. Atkins performed by invitation at the [[White House]] for every U.S. President from John F. Kennedy through to George H. W. Bush. Atkins was a member of the [[Million Dollar Band (country music group)|Million Dollar Band]] during the 1980s. He is also well known for his song \"Yankee Doodle Dixie\", in which he played \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\" and \"[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\" simultaneously, on the same guitar.\n\nBefore his mentor Sholes died in 1968, Atkins had become vice president of RCA's country division. In 1987, he told [[Nine-O-One Network Magazine|''Nine-O-One Network'' magazine]] that he was \"ashamed\" of his promotion: \"I wanted to be known as a guitarist and I know, too, that they give you titles like that in lieu of money. So beware when they want to make you vice president.\"<ref>Nine-O-One Interview, Nine-O-One Network Magazine, December 1987, p.10-11</ref> He had brought [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Bobby Bare]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Jerry Reed]], and [[John Hartford]] to the label in the 1960s and inspired and helped countless others.<ref name=\"RockHall\">[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/chet-atkins \"Chet Atkins\"], Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Accessed on March 28, 2008.</ref> He took a considerable risk during the mid-1960s, when the [[civil rights movement]] sparked violence throughout the South, by signing country music's first African-American singer, [[Charley Pride]], who sang rawer country than the smoother music Atkins had pioneered.\n\nAtkins's biggest hit single came in 1965, with \"Yakety Axe\", an adaptation of \"[[Yakety Sax]]\", by his friend, the saxophonist [[Boots Randolph]]. He rarely performed in those days and eventually hired other RCA producers, such as [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] and [[Felton Jarvis]], to lessen his workload.<ref name=\"mamg\" />\n\n===Later career===\nIn the 1970s, Atkins became increasingly stressed by his executive duties. He produced fewer records, but could still turn out hits such as [[Perry Como]]'s 1973 pop hit \"[[And I Love You So (song)|And I Love You So]]\". He recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker Jerry Reed, who had become a hit artist in his own right. A 1973 diagnosis of [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]], however, led Atkins to redefine his role at RCA, to allow others to handle administration while he went back to his first love, the guitar, often recording with Reed or even Jethro Burns from Homer and Jethro (his brother-in-law) after Homer died in 1971.<ref name=\"mamg\" /> Atkins would turn over his administrative duties to [[Jerry Bradley (record producer)|Jerry Bradley]], son of Owen, in 1973 at RCA.\n\nAtkins did little production work at RCA after stepping down and in fact, had hired producers at the label in the 1960s, among them [[Bob Ferguson (musician)|Bob Ferguson]] and [[Felton Jarvis]]. As a recording artist, Atkins grew disillusioned with RCA in the late 1970s. He felt stifled because the record company would not let him branch into jazz. He had also produced late 60's jazz recordings by Canadian guitarist [[Lenny Breau]], a friend and protege. His mid-1970s collaborations with one of his influences, [[Les Paul]], ''[[Chester and Lester|Chester & Lester]]'' and ''[[Guitar Monsters]]'', had already reflected that interest; ''Chester & Lester'' was one of the best-selling recordings of Atkins's career. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with the direction Gretsch (no longer family-owned) was going and withdrew his authorization for them to use his name and began designing guitars with [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]. Atkins ended his 35-year association with RCA in 1982 and signed with [[Columbia Records]], for whom he produced a debut album in 1983.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" />\n\nJazz had always been a strong love of his, and often in his career he was criticized by \"pure\" country musicians for his jazz influences. He also said on many occasions that he did not like being called a \"country guitarist,\" insisting that he was \"a guitarist, period.\" Although he played [[Playing by ear|by ear]] and was a masterful improviser, he was able to read music and even performed some classical guitar pieces. When [[Roger C. Field]], a friend, suggested to him in 1991 that he record and perform with a female singer, he did so with [[Suzy Bogguss]].<ref name=\"mamg\"/>\n\nHe returned to his country roots for albums he recorded with [[Mark Knopfler]] and Jerry Reed.<ref name=\"mamg\" /> Knopfler had long mentioned Atkins as one of his earliest influences. Atkins also collaborated with Australian guitar legend [[Tommy Emmanuel]]. On being asked to name the ten most influential guitarists of the twentieth century, he named [[Django Reinhardt]] to the first position, and also placed himself on the list.<ref name=\"OfficialSite\">[http://www.misterguitar.com/news/chetsten.html Official Web Site of Chet Atkins]. Accessed on August 27, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn later years, he even went back to radio, appearing on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio program, on [[American Public Media]] radio, even picking up a fiddle from time to time,<ref name=\"mamg\" /> and performing songs such as [[Bob Wills]]'s \"[[Corrina, Corrina (song)|Corrina, Corrina]]\" and [[Willie Nelson]]'s \"[[Seven Spanish Angels]]\" with Nelson on a 1985 broadcast of the show at the Bridges Auditorium on the campus of [[Pomona College]].\n\n==Death and legacy==\nAtkins received numerous awards, including 14 Grammy awards and nine Country Music Association awards for Instrumentalist of the Year.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> In 1993, he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. ''Billboard'' magazine awarded him its Century Award, its \"highest honor for distinguished creative achievement,\" in December 1997.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chetatkins/biography \"Biography&nbsp;\u2013 Chet Atkins\"]. ''Rolling Stone''. Accessed on May 10, 2008.</ref>\n\nAtkins is notable for his broad influence. His love for numerous styles of music can be traced from his early recording of the stride pianist [[James P.
