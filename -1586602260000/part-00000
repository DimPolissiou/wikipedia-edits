The third-century BC Egyptian priest [[Manetho]] grouped the long line of kings from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today. He began his official history with the king named \"Meni\" (or ''[[Menes]]'' in Greek) who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]].<ref>Clayton (1994) p. 6</ref>\n[[File:NarmerPalette ROM-gamma.jpg|thumb|The [[Narmer Palette]] depicts the unification\nof the Two Lands.<ref>Robins (1997) p. 32</ref>]]\nThe transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have been the king [[Narmer]], who is depicted wearing [[Regalia|royal regalia]] on the ceremonial ''Narmer Palette,'' in a symbolic act of unification.<ref>Clayton (1994) pp. 12\u201313</ref> In the Early Dynastic Period, which began about 3000&nbsp;BC, the first of the Dynastic kings solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], from which he could control the [[labour force]] and agriculture of the fertile delta region, as well as the lucrative and critical [[trade route]]s to the [[Levant]]. The increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate [[mastaba]] tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 70</ref> The strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html|title=Early Dynastic Egypt|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080304143847/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html| archivedate= 4 March 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Old Kingdom (2686\u20132181 BC)===\n{{Main|Old Kingdom of Egypt}}\nMajor advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the [[Old Kingdom]], fueled by the increased [[agricultural productivity]] and resulting population, made possible by a well-developed central administration.<ref>James (2005) p. 40</ref> Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements, the [[Giza Necropolis|Giza pyramids]] and [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]], were constructed during the Old Kingdom. Under the direction of the [[vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]], state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve [[crop yield]], drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a [[Criminal law|justice system]] to maintain peace and order.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 102</ref> [[File:Khafre statue.jpg|thumb|right|[[Khafre]] Enthroned]]\n\nWith the rising importance of central administration in Egypt a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services. Kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of Egypt, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.<ref>Shaw (2002) pp. 116\u201317</ref> As the power of the kings diminished, regional governors called [[nomarch]]s began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king.

Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the king, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces. Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer\u2014which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 120</ref> In bursts of creativity, provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the Old Kingdom, and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the [[optimism]] and originality of the period.<ref name=\"Shaw146\">Shaw (2002) p. 146</ref>\n\nFree from their loyalties to the king, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and [[political power]]. By 2160&nbsp;BC, rulers in [[Herakleopolis]] controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], the [[Intef I|Intef family]], took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055&nbsp;BC the northern Theban forces under [[Mentuhotep II|Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II]] finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].<ref>Clayton (1994) p. 29</ref>\n\n===Middle Kingdom (2134\u20131690 BC)===\n{{Main|Middle Kingdom of Egypt}}\n\n[[File:Egypte louvre 231 visage.jpg|thumb|upright|Amenemhat III, the last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom]]\n\nThe kings of the Middle Kingdom restored the country's stability and prosperity, thereby stimulating a resurgence of art, literature, and monumental building projects.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 148</ref> Mentuhotep II and his [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]] successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier [[Amenemhat I]], upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] around 1985&nbsp;BC, shifted the kingdom's capital to the city of [[Itjtawy]], located in [[Faiyum Oasis|Faiyum]].<ref>Clayton (1994) p. 79</ref> From Itjtawy, the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a far-sighted [[land reclamation]] and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region. Moreover, the military reconquered territory in [[Nubia]] that was rich in quarries and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the Eastern Delta, called the \"[[Walls-of-the-Ruler]]\", to defend against foreign attack.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 158</ref>\n\nWith the kings having secured the country militarily and politically and with vast agricultural and mineral wealth at their disposal, the nation's population, arts, and religion flourished. In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, the Middle Kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety.<ref>Shaw (2002) pp. 179\u201382</ref> Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style.<ref name=\"Shaw146\"/> The [[relief]] and portrait sculpture of the period captured subtle, individual details that reached new heights of technical sophistication.<ref>Robins (1997) p. 90</ref>\n\nThe last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, [[Amenemhat III]], allowed [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking [[Canaan]]ite settlers from the [[Near East]] into the Delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with severe [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline, the [[Canaan]]ite settlers began to assume greater control of the Delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the [[Hyksos]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 188</ref>\n\n===Second Intermediate Period (1674\u20131549 BC) and the Hyksos===\n{{Main|Second Intermediate Period of Egypt}}\n[[File:Egypt NK edit.svg|upright|thumb|The maximum territorial extent of ancient Egypt (15th century BC)]]\nAround 1785&nbsp;BC, as the power of the Middle Kingdom kings weakened, a [[Western Asia]]n people called the [[Hyksos]], who had already settled in the Delta, seized control of Egypt and established their capital at [[Avaris]], forcing the former central government to retreat to Thebes.

Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern [[Canaan]], much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest.

Around 727&nbsp;BC the Kushite king [[Piye]] invaded northward, seizing control of Thebes and eventually the Delta.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 345</ref>\n\nEgypt's far-reaching prestige declined considerably toward the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its foreign allies had fallen under the [[Assyria]]n sphere of influence, and by 700&nbsp;BC war between the two states became inevitable. Between 671 and 667&nbsp;BC the Assyrians began their attack on Egypt. The reigns of both [[Taharqa]] and his successor, [[Tantamani|Tanutamun]], were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians, against whom Egypt enjoyed several victories. Ultimately, the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia, occupied Memphis, and [[Sack of Thebes|sacked the temples of Thebes]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 358</ref>\n\n===Late Period (672\u2013332 BC)===\n{{Main|Late Period of ancient Egypt|History of Achaemenid Egypt}}\n\nThe Assyrians left control of Egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the Saite kings of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-Sixth Dynasty]]. By 653&nbsp;BC, the Saite king [[Psamtik I]] was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries, who were recruited to form Egypt's first navy. [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek influence]] expanded greatly as the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Naucratis|Naukratis]] became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525&nbsp;BC, the powerful Persians, led by [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses II]], began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh [[Psamtik III]] at the battle of [[Pelusium]]. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from Iran, leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy. A few successful revolts against the Persians marked the 5th century BC, but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 383</ref>\n\nFollowing its annexation by Persia, Egypt was joined with [[Cyprus]] and [[Phoenicia]] in the sixth [[satrap]]y of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]]. This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the Twenty-Seventh dynasty, ended in 402&nbsp;BC, when Egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties. The last of these dynasties, the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth]], proved to be the last native royal house of ancient Egypt, ending with the kingship of [[Nectanebo II]]. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the [[Achaemenid Empire|Thirty-First Dynasty]], began in 343&nbsp;BC, but shortly after, in 332&nbsp;BC, the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to [[Alexander the Great]] without a fight.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 385</ref>\n\n===Ptolemaic period (332\u201330 BC)===\n{{Main|History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Alexander the Great, 100 B.C.E. \u2013 100 C.E., 54.162.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Alexander the Great]], 100&nbsp;BC \u2013 100&nbsp;AD, 54.162, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nIn 332&nbsp;BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt with little resistance from the [[Persia]]ns and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new [[Capital (political)|capital city]] of [[Alexandria]]. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a [[Seat of Wisdom|seat of learning]] and culture, centered at the famous [[Library of Alexandria]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 405</ref> The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city\u2014as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 411</ref>\n\n[[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic culture]] did not supplant native Egyptian culture, as the Ptolemies supported time-honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace. They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs. Some traditions merged, as Greek and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian gods]] were [[Syncretic religion|syncretized]] into composite deities, such as [[Serapis]], and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs. Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy IV]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 418</ref> In addition, as [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] took great interest in the political situation in the country. Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful opponents from the [[Near East]] made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire.<ref>James (2005) p. 62</ref>\n\n===Roman period (30 BC\u2013641 AD)===\n{{Main|Egypt (Roman province)}}\n\n[[File:Fayum-22.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|The [[Fayum mummy portraits]] epitomize the meeting of Egyptian and Roman cultures.]]\n\nEgypt became a province of the [[Roman Empire]] in 30&nbsp;BC, following the defeat of [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]] and [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] Queen [[Cleopatra VII]] by [[Octavian]] (later [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] Augustus) in the [[Battle of Actium]]. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the [[Roman legion|Roman army]], under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period.<ref>James (2005) p. 63</ref> Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 426</ref>\n\nAlthough the Romans had a more hostile attitude than the Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued.<ref name=\"Shaw422\">Shaw (2002) p. 422</ref> The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.<ref name=\"Shaw422\"/>\n\nFrom the mid-first century AD, [[Christianity]] took root in Egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian Religion]] and [[Greco-Roman]] religion and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of [[Diocletian]] starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out.<ref>Shaw (2003) p. 431</ref> In 391 the Christian Emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.<ref>\"''The Church in Ancient Society''\", [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], p. 373, Oxford University Press US, 2001, {{ISBN|0-19-924695-5}}</ref> Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.<ref>\"''Christianizing the Roman Empire A.D 100\u2013400\"'', [[Ramsay MacMullen]], p. 63, Yale University Press, 1984, {{ISBN|0-300-03216-1}}</ref> As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population certainly continued to speak [[Egyptian language|their language]], the ability to read [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic writing]] slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to [[church (building)|churches]] or abandoned to the desert.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 445</ref>\n\nIn the fourth century, as the Roman Empire divided, Egypt found itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. In the waning years of the Empire, Egypt fell to the [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanian Persian]] army (618\u2013628 AD), was recaptured by the Roman Emperor [[Heraclius]] (629\u2013639 AD), and then was finally captured by [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Rashidun army]] in 639\u2013641 AD, ending Roman rule.\n\n==Government and economy==\n\n===Administration and commerce===\n[[File:Pharaoh.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The pharaoh was usually depicted wearing symbols of royalty and power.]]\n\nThe [[pharaoh]] was the absolute monarch of the country and, at least in theory, wielded complete control of the land and its resources. The king was the supreme [[Commander|military commander]] and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command, the [[vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]], who acted as the king's representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the [[archives]].<ref name=\"Manuelian358\">Manuelian (1998) p. 358</ref> At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] each governed by a [[nomarch]], who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The [[Egyptian temple|temples]] formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they [[Place of worship|houses of worship]], but were also responsible for collecting and storing the kingdom's wealth in a system of [[granary|granaries]] and treasuries administered by [[Supervisor|overseers]], who redistributed grain and goods.<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 363</ref>\n\nMuch of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled.

Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading; for example a shirt cost five copper deben, while a cow cost 140&nbsp;deben.<ref name=\"Manuelian372\"/> Grain could be traded for other goods, according to the fixed price list.<ref name=\"Manuelian372\"/> During the fifth century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad. At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of [[precious metal]] rather than true money, but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage.<ref>Walbank (1984) p. 125</ref>\n\n===Social status===\nEgyptian society was highly stratified, and [[social status]] was expressly displayed. Farmers made up the bulk of the population, but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state, temple, or [[Nobility|noble family]] that owned the land.<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 383</ref> Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a [[corv\u00e9e]] system.<ref>James (2005) p. 136</ref> Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt, known as the \"white kilt class\" in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank.<ref>Billard (1978) p. 109</ref> The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature. Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field.

Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts, which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end. Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece, Rome, and even more modern places around the world, ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices and opportunities for achievement. Women such as [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Cleopatra VII]] even became pharaohs, while others wielded power as [[God's Wife of Amun|Divine Wives of Amun]].

Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.<ref>Oakes (2003) p. 472</ref>\n\nPunishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family.<ref name=\"Manuelian358\"/> Beginning in the New Kingdom, [[oracle]]s played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \"yes\" or \"no\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an [[ostracon]].<ref>McDowell (1999) p. 168</ref>\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian agriculture}} {{see also|Ancient Egyptian cuisine|Gardens of ancient Egypt}}\n[[File:Tomb of Nakht (2).jpg|thumb|upright|A tomb relief depicts workers plowing the fields, harvesting the crops, and threshing the grain under the direction of an overseer, painting in the tomb of [[TT52|Nakht]].]]\n[[File:Measure and Harvest005.jpg|thumb|left|Measuring and recording the harvest is shown in a wall painting in the tomb of [[TT69|Menna]], at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (Eighteenth Dynasty).]]\n\nA combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich [[fertile soil]] resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. [[Land management]] was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 361</ref>\n\nFarming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: ''Akhet'' (flooding), ''Peret'' (planting), and ''Shemu'' (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the [[growing season]] lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 514</ref> From March to May, farmers used [[sickle]]s to harvest their crops, which were then [[Threshing|threshed]] with a [[flail]] to separate the straw from the grain. [[Winnowing]] removed the [[chaff]] from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 506</ref>\n\nThe ancient Egyptians cultivated [[emmer]] and [[barley]], and several other cereal grains, all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 510</ref> [[Flax]] plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of [[linen]] and to make clothing. [[Papyrus]] growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.<ref>Nicholson (2000) pp. 577 and 630</ref>\n\n====Animals====\n[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|left|Sennedjem plows his fields with a pair of oxen, used as beasts of burden and a source of food.]]\nThe Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and [[animal]]s was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.<ref name=\"Strouhal117\">Strouhal (1989) p. 117</ref> Animals, both [[Domestication|domesticated]] and [[Wildlife|wild]], were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. [[Poultry]], such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.<ref name=\"Manuelian381\">Manuelian (1998) p. 381</ref> The Nile provided a plentiful source of [[fish]].

The [[Wadi Hammamat]] was a notable source of granite, [[greywacke]], and gold. [[Flint]] was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 28</ref> Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as [[sulfur]] as cosmetic substances.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

There was a change from the older [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] [[word order]] to [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].<ref>Loprieno (1995b) pp. 2137\u201338</ref> The Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], [[hieratic]], and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic [[Coptic alphabet]]. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Orthodox Church]], and traces of it are found in modern [[Egyptian Arabic]].<ref>Vittman (1991) pp. 197\u2013227</ref>\n\n===Sounds and grammar===\nAncient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages. These include [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] and [[Emphatic consonant|emphatic]] consonants, voiced and voiceless stops, voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] and voiced and voiceless [[Affricate consonant|affricates]]. It has three long and three short vowels, which expanded in Late Egyptian to about nine.<ref>Loprieno (1995a) p. 46</ref> The basic word in Egyptian, similar to Semitic and Berber, is a [[Semitic root|triliteral]] or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the [[Grammatical person|person]]. For example, the triconsonantal skeleton '''{{transl|egy|S-\u1e0e-M}}''' is the semantic core of the word 'hear'; its basic conjugation is ''{{transl|egy|s\u1e0fm}}'', 'he hears'. If the subject is a noun, suffixes are not added to the verb:<ref>Loprieno (1995a) p. 74</ref> ''{{transl|egy|s\u1e0fm \u1e25mt}}'', 'the woman hears'.\n\nAdjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call ''[[Arabic grammar|nisbation]]'' because of its similarity with Arabic.<ref>Loprieno (2004) p. 175</ref> The word order is {{smallcaps|predicate\u2013subject}} in verbal and adjectival sentences, and {{smallcaps|subject\u2013predicate}} in nominal and adverbial sentences.<ref>Allen (2000) pp. 67, 70, 109</ref> The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.<ref>Loprieno (2005) p. 2147</ref> Verbs and nouns are negated by the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''n'', but ''nn'' is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, which can be open (CV) or closed (CVC).<ref>Loprieno (2004) p. 173</ref>\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Heiroglyphs.jpg|thumb|Hieroglyphs on a funerary stela in [[Manchester Museum]]]]\n\n[[File:Rosetta Stone BW.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Rosetta Stone]] (ca 196&nbsp;BC) enabled linguists to begin the process of [[decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts|deciphering ancient Egyptian scripts]].<ref>Allen (2000) p. 13</ref>]]\n\n[[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieroglyphic writing]] dates from c. 3000&nbsp;BC, and is composed of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called [[hieratic]], which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], became the prevalent writing style, and it is this form of writing\u2014along with formal hieroglyphs\u2014that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.<ref>Loprieno (1995a) pp. 10\u201326</ref>\n\nAround the first century AD, the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified [[Greek alphabet]] with the addition of some Demotic signs.<ref>Allen (2000) p. 7</ref> Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine<ref>Loprieno (2004) p. 166</ref> and Islamic periods in Egypt,<ref>El-Daly (2005) p. 164</ref> but only in the 1820s, after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and years of research by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]], were hieroglyphs [[decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts|substantially deciphered]].<ref>Allen (2000) p. 8</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian literature}}\n[[File:Edwin Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith surgical papyrus]] (c. 16th century BC) describes anatomy and medical treatments and is written in hieratic.]]\n\nWriting first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the ''Per Ankh'' institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories.<ref>Strouhal (1989) p. 235</ref> Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the [[Pyramid Texts|Pyramid]] and [[Coffin Texts]], were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300&nbsp;BC. Late Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in [[Ramesside Period|Ramesside]] administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of [[Harkhuf]] and [[Weni the Elder|Weni]]. The genre known as ''[[Sebayt]]'' (\"instructions\") was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the [[Ipuwer Papyrus|Ipuwer papyrus]], a poem of lamentations describing [[natural disaster]]s and social upheaval, is a famous example.\n\nThe [[Story of Sinuhe]], written in [[Middle Egyptian]], might be the classic of Egyptian literature.<ref>Lichtheim (1975) p. 11</ref> Also written at this time was the [[Westcar Papyrus]], a set of stories told to [[Khufu]] by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests.<ref>Lichtheim (1975) p. 215</ref> The [[Instruction of Amenemope]] is considered a masterpiece of Near Eastern literature.<ref>\"''Wisdom in Ancient Israel\"'', John Day, /John Adney Emerton, /Robert P. Gordon/ Hugh Godfrey/Maturin Williamson, p. 23, Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-521-62489-4}}</ref> Towards the end of the New Kingdom, the [[Late Egyptian|vernacular language]] was more often employed to write popular pieces like the [[Story of Wenamun]] and the [[Instruction of Any]]. The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700&nbsp;BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the [[Greco-Roman]] period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]].<ref>Lichtheim (1980) p. 159</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Daily life===\n[[File:Ostracon04-RamessidePeriod MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|Ostraca of hunting a [[African lion#Cultural significance|lion]] with a spear, aided by a dog]]\n[[File:LowClassAncientEgyptianStatuettes.png|thumb|Statues depicting lower-class ancient Egyptian occupations]]\n{{further|Clothing in ancient Egypt | Dance in ancient Egypt|Music of Egypt#Old Kingdom}}\nMost ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land. Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of [[Mudbrick|mud-brick]] designed to remain cool in the heat of the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread.<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 401</ref> Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 403</ref>\n\nThe ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance. Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from [[animal fat]] and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 405</ref> Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and [[Beauty and Cosmetics in Ancient Egypt|cosmetics]]. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's [[income]].<ref>Manuelian (1998) pp. 406\u201307</ref>\n[[File:\u00c4gyptischer Maler um 1400 v.

The staple diet consisted of bread and beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.<ref>Manuelian (1998) pp. 399\u2013400</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n<!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' -->\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}\nThe architecture of ancient Egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world: the [[Giza pyramid complex|Great Pyramids of Giza]] and the [[Karnak|temples at Thebes]]. Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the wide-ranging power of the pharaoh. The ancient Egyptians were skilled builders; using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments, architects could build large [[stone structures]] with great accuracy and precision that is still envied today.<ref>Clarke (1990) pp. 94\u201397</ref>\n\nThe domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mud bricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, such as those in [[Malkata]] and [[Amarna]], show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs.<ref>Badawy (1968) p. 50</ref> Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mud bricks. The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building, [[Djoser]]'s mortuary complex, include [[post and lintel]] supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.\n\nThe earliest preserved ancient [[Egyptian temples]], such as those at Giza, consist of single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. In the New Kingdom, architects added the [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]], the open [[courtyard]], and the enclosed [[hypostyle]] hall to the front of the temple's sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Greco-Roman period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/temple/typestime.html|title=Types of temples in ancient Egypt|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080319233620/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/temple/typestime.html| archivedate= 19 March 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the [[mastaba]], a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground [[Chamber tomb|burial chamber]].

For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change.<ref>Robins (1997) p. 29</ref> These artistic standards\u2014simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth\u2014created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The [[Narmer Palette]], for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.<ref>Robins (1997) p. 21</ref> Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.<ref>Robins (2001) p. 12</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptian artisans used stone as a medium for carving statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with [[gum arabic]] as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 105</ref>\n\nPharaohs used [[relief]]s to record victories in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes. Common citizens had access to pieces of [[funerary art]], such as [[Ushabti|shabti]] statues and books of the dead, which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.<ref name=\"James122\">James (2005) p. 122</ref> During the Middle Kingdom, wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats, and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.<ref>Robins (1998) p. 74</ref>\n\nDespite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]-style frescoes were found in [[Avaris]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 216</ref> The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to [[Akhenaten]]'s revolutionary religious ideas.<ref>Robins (1998) p. 149</ref> This style, known as [[Amarna art]], was quickly abandoned after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.<ref>Robins (1998) p. 158</ref>\n\n===Religious beliefs===\n<!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' -->\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian religion}}\n[[File:The judgement of the dead in the presence of Osiris.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Book of the Dead]] was a guide to the deceased's journey in the afterlife.]]\n\nBeliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule was based on the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right of kings]]. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by [[Egyptian pantheon|gods]] who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting [[Egyptian mythology|myths]] and stories into a coherent system.<ref>James (2005) p. 102</ref> These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.<ref>\"''The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology''\", edited by [[Donald B.

At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.<ref>James (2005) p. 117</ref> After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of [[oracle]]s to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.<ref name=\"Shaw313\">Shaw (2002) p. 313</ref>\n\nThe Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or ''aspects''. In addition to the body, each person had a ''\u0161wt'' (shadow), a ''ba'' (personality or soul), a ''ka'' (life-force), and a ''name''.<ref>Allen (2000) pp. 79, 94\u201395</ref> The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ''ka'' and ''ba'' and become one of the \"blessed dead\", living on as an ''akh'', or \"effective one\". For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a \"[[Maat#The afterlife|feather of truth]].\" If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.<ref>Wasserman, ''et al.''

These customs involved preserving the body by [[Mummy|mummification]], performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.<ref name=\"James122\"/> Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by [[desiccation]]. The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]], wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in [[canopic jar]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/ok.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Old Kingdom|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}</ref>\n\nBy the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called [[natron]]. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Late Period, Ptolemaic, Roman and Christian Period |accessdate=9 March 2008 |publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080330041612/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html| archivedate= 30 March 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased.

The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of [[Buhen]] on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the [[Levant]]. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] and parts of the Levant.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 245</ref>\n\nTypical military equipment included [[Bow (weapon)|bows and arrows]], spears, and round-topped shields made by stretching [[Leather|animal skin]] over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom, the military began using [[Chariotry in ancient Egypt|chariots]] that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle, spears were tipped with a bronze point, and the [[Khopesh]] was adopted from Asiatic soldiers.<ref>Manuelian (1998) pp. 366\u201367</ref> The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army; it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs, such as [[Seqenenre Tao II]] and his sons, did do so.<ref>Clayton (1994) p. 96</ref> However, it has also been argued that \"kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders, fighting alongside their troops.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Garry J.|title=The Death of King Seqenenre Tao|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|year=2009|volume=45}}</ref> Soldiers were recruited from the general population, but during, and especially after, the New Kingdom, mercenaries from Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 400</ref>\n\n==Technology, medicine, and mathematics==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Civilization]] -->\n\n===Technology===\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian technology}}\n[[File:Egyptian glass jar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Glassmaking was a highly developed art.]]\n\nIn technology, medicine, and mathematics, ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional [[empiricism]], as evidenced by the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith]] and [[Ebers Papyrus|Ebers papyri]] (c. 1600&nbsp;BC), is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and [[decimal|decimal system]].\n\n===Faience and glass===\n[[File:Ancient Egyptian medical instruments.jpg|thumb|upright|Ancient Egyptian medical instruments depicted in a Ptolemaic period inscription on the temple at Kom Ombo]]\n\nEven before the Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as [[Egyptian faience|faience]], which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], small amounts of [[Calcium oxide|lime]] and [[Sodium oxide|soda]], and a colorant, typically copper.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 177</ref> The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as [[Egyptian blue|Egyptian Blue]], also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or [[sintering]]) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 109</ref>\n\nThe ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill, but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 195</ref> It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding [[Micromineral|trace elements]] to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 215</ref>\n\n===Medicine===\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian medicine}}\nThe medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from [[malaria]] and debilitating [[schistosomiasis]] parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to [[abscess]]es (though [[dental caries|caries]] were rare).<ref>Filer (1995) p. 94</ref>\n\nThe diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars, which promoted [[Periodontitis|periodontal disease]].<ref>Filer (1995) pp. 78\u201380</ref> Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.<ref>Filer (1995) p. 21</ref> Adult [[life expectancy]] was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.<ref>Figures are given for ''adult'' life expectancy and do not reflect life expectancy ''at birth.'' Filer (1995) p. 25</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills, and some, such as [[Imhotep]], remained famous long after their deaths.<ref>Filer (1995) p. 39</ref> [[Herodotus]] remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians, with some treating only the head or the stomach, while others were eye-doctors and dentists.<ref>Strouhal (1989) p. 243</ref> Training of physicians took place at the ''Per Ankh'' or \"House of Life\" institution, most notably those headquartered in [[Bubastis|Per-Bastet]] during the New Kingdom and at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] and [[Sais, Egypt|Sa\u00efs]] in the Late period. [[Medical papyri]] show [[Empirical evidence|empirical knowledge]] of anatomy, injuries, and practical treatments.<ref>Stroual (1989) pp. 244\u201346</ref>\n\nWounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection,<ref>Stroual (1989) p. 250</ref> while [[opium]] [[thyme]] and [[Atropa belladonna|belladona]] were used to relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers were made to the goddess [[Isis]]. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pe\u0107anac M |author2=Janji\u0107 Z |author3=Komarcevi\u0107 A |author4=Paji\u0107 M |author5=Dobanovacki D |author6=Miskovi\u0107 SS |journal=Medicinski Pregled|date=May\u2013Jun 2013|title=Burns treatment in ancient times|pmid=23888738|doi=10.1016/s0264-410x(02)00603-5|volume=66|issue=5\u20136|pages=263\u201367 }}</ref> Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve [[asthma]] symptoms.

The [[Archaeological Institute of America]] reports that the oldest [[Plank (wood)|planked]] [[ship]]s known are the [[Abydos boats]].<ref name=\"AIA\">Ward, Cheryl. \"[http://www.archaeology.org/0105/abstracts/abydos3.html World's Oldest Planked Boats]\", in''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' (Volume 54, Number 3, May/June 2001).

The ship dating to 3000&nbsp;BC was {{convert|75|ft|m}} long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh, perhaps one as early as [[Hor-Aha]].<ref name=\"AIA2\"/>\n\nEarly Egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with [[treenail]]s to fasten them together, using [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] for [[caulking]] the seams. The \"[[Khufu ship]]\", a {{convert|43.6|m|ft|adj=on}} vessel sealed into a pit in the [[Giza pyramid complex]] at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] around 2500&nbsp;BC, is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a [[solar barque]].

Imhausen ''et al.'' (2007) p. 13</ref> The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain.<ref>Imhausen ''et al.'' (2007) p. 11</ref> Texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\u2014use fractions, calculate the areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles and compute the volumes of boxes, columns and pyramids. They understood basic concepts of [[algebra]] and [[geometry]], and could solve simple sets of [[simultaneous equations]].<ref>Clarke (1990) p. 222</ref>\n\n{{hiero | {{frac|2|3}} | <hiero>D22</hiero>| align=right| era=default}}\n\n[[Mathematical notation]] was decimal, and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively.<ref>Clarke (1990) p. 217</ref> Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write [[Egyptian fraction|fractions]] as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction ''two-fifths'' into the sum of ''one-third'' + ''one-fifteenth''. Standard tables of values facilitated this.<ref>Clarke (1990) p. 218</ref> Some [[Vulgar fraction|common fractions]], however, were written with a special glyph\u2014the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.<ref>Gardiner (1957) p. 197</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptian mathematicians knew the [[Pythagorean theorem]] as an empirical formula.

What's more, the genetics of the mummies remained remarkably consistent even as different powers\u2014including Nubians, Greeks, and Romans\u2014conquered the empire.\" Later, however, something did alter the genomes of Egyptians. Some 15% to 20% of modern Egyptians' DNA reflects sub-Saharan ancestry, but the ancient mummies had only 6\u201315% sub-Saharan DNA.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/ncomms15694| pmid=28556824| pmc=5459999| title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods| journal=Nature Communications| volume=8| page=15694| year=2017| last1=Schuenemann| first1=Verena J.| last2=Peltzer| first2=Alexander| last3=Welte| first3=Beatrix| last4=Van Pelt| first4=W.

The cult of the goddess [[Isis]], for example, became popular in the [[Roman Empire]], as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.<ref>Siliotti (1998) p. 8</ref> The Romans also imported [[building material]]s from Egypt to erect Egyptian-style structures. Early historians such as [[Herodotus]], [[Strabo]], and [[Diodorus Siculus]] studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.<ref>Siliotti (1998) p. 10</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later [[Islam]], but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] and [[al-Maqrizi]].<ref>El-Daly (2005) p. 112</ref> In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of [[Egyptomania]] across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.<ref>Siliotti (1998) p. 13</ref>\n\nAlthough the European [[colonialism|colonial]] occupation of Egypt destroyed a significant portion of the country's historical legacy, some foreigners left more positive marks. [[Napoleon]], for example, arranged the first studies in [[Egyptology]] when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's [[natural history]], which was published in the ''[[Description de l'\u00c9gypte]]''.<ref>Siliotti (1998) p. 100</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations.

The third-century BC Egyptian priest [[Manetho]] grouped the long line of kings from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today. He began his official history with the king named \"Meni\" (or ''[[Menes]]'' in Greek) who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]].<ref>Clayton (1994) p. 6</ref>\n[[File:NarmerPalette ROM-gamma.jpg|thumb|The [[Narmer Palette]] depicts the unification\nof the Two Lands.<ref>Robins (1997) p. 32</ref>]]\nThe transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented, and there is no contemporary record of Menes. Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have been the king [[Narmer]], who is depicted wearing [[Regalia|royal regalia]] on the ceremonial ''Narmer Palette,'' in a symbolic act of unification.<ref>Clayton (1994) pp. 12\u201313</ref> In the Early Dynastic Period, which began about 3000&nbsp;BC, the first of the Dynastic kings solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], from which he could control the [[labour force]] and agriculture of the fertile delta region, as well as the lucrative and critical [[trade route]]s to the [[Levant]]. The increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate [[mastaba]] tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 70</ref> The strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html|title=Early Dynastic Egypt|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080304143847/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/archaicegypt/info.html| archivedate= 4 March 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Old Kingdom (2686\u20132181 BC)===\n{{Main|Old Kingdom of Egypt}}\nMajor advances in architecture, art, and technology were made during the [[Old Kingdom]], fueled by the increased [[agricultural productivity]] and resulting population, made possible by a well-developed central administration.<ref>James (2005) p. 40</ref> Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements, the [[Giza Necropolis|Giza pyramids]] and [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]], were constructed during the Old Kingdom.

Kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of Egypt, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.<ref>Shaw (2002) pp. 116\u201317</ref> As the power of the kings diminished, regional governors called [[nomarch]]s began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king.

Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars. Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the king, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces.

By 2160&nbsp;BC, rulers in [[Herakleopolis]] controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], the [[Intef I|Intef family]], took control of Upper Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055&nbsp;BC the northern Theban forces under [[Mentuhotep II|Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II]] finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands.

Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern [[Canaan]], much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the [[Precinct of Amun-Re|temple of Amun]] in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.<ref>James (2005) p. 54</ref>\n\n===Third Intermediate Period (1069\u2013653 BC)===\n{{Main|Third Intermediate Period of Egypt}}\n\nFollowing the death of [[Ramesses XI]] in 1078 BC, [[Smendes]] assumed authority over the northern part of Egypt, ruling from the city of [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]]. The south was effectively controlled by the [[Theban High Priests of Amun (21st and 22nd Dynasty)|High Priests of Amun at Thebes]], who recognized Smendes in name only.<ref>Cerny (1975) p. 645</ref> During this time, Libyans had been settling in the western delta, and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under [[Shoshenq I]] in 945 BC, founding the so-called Libyan or Bubastite dynasty that would rule for some 200&nbsp;years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in [[Leontopolis]], and [[Cushi|Kushites]] threatened from the south. Around 727&nbsp;BC the Kushite king [[Piye]] invaded northward, seizing control of Thebes and eventually the Delta.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 345</ref>\n\nEgypt's far-reaching prestige declined considerably toward the end of the Third Intermediate Period. Its foreign allies had fallen under the [[Assyria]]n sphere of influence, and by 700&nbsp;BC war between the two states became inevitable. Between 671 and 667&nbsp;BC the Assyrians began their attack on Egypt. The reigns of both [[Taharqa]] and his successor, [[Tantamani|Tanutamun]], were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians, against whom Egypt enjoyed several victories.

By 653&nbsp;BC, the Saite king [[Psamtik I]] was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries, who were recruited to form Egypt's first navy. [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek influence]] expanded greatly as the [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Naucratis|Naukratis]] became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta. The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525&nbsp;BC, the powerful Persians, led by [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses II]], began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh [[Psamtik III]] at the battle of [[Pelusium]]. Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from Iran, leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy.

This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the Twenty-Seventh dynasty, ended in 402&nbsp;BC, when Egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties. The last of these dynasties, the [[Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth]], proved to be the last native royal house of ancient Egypt, ending with the kingship of [[Nectanebo II]]. A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the [[Achaemenid Empire|Thirty-First Dynasty]], began in 343&nbsp;BC, but shortly after, in 332&nbsp;BC, the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to [[Alexander the Great]] without a fight.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 385</ref>\n\n===Ptolemaic period (332\u201330 BC)===\n{{Main|History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Alexander the Great, 100 B.C.E. \u2013 100 C.E., 54.162.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Alexander the Great]], 100&nbsp;BC \u2013 100&nbsp;AD, 54.162, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nIn 332&nbsp;BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Egypt with little resistance from the [[Persia]]ns and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer.

However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian Religion]] and [[Greco-Roman]] religion and threatened popular religious traditions.

Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.<ref>Oakes (2003) p. 472</ref>\n\nPunishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines, beatings, facial mutilation, or exile, depending on the severity of the offense. Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake. Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family.<ref name=\"Manuelian358\"/> Beginning in the New Kingdom, [[oracle]]s played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases. The procedure was to ask the god a \"yes\" or \"no\" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue. The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgment by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an [[ostracon]].<ref>McDowell (1999) p. 168</ref>\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian agriculture}} {{see also|Ancient Egyptian cuisine|Gardens of ancient Egypt}}\n[[File:Tomb of Nakht (2).jpg|thumb|upright|A tomb relief depicts workers plowing the fields, harvesting the crops, and threshing the grain under the direction of an overseer, painting in the tomb of [[TT52|Nakht]].]]\n[[File:Measure and Harvest005.jpg|thumb|left|Measuring and recording the harvest is shown in a wall painting in the tomb of [[TT69|Menna]], at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (Eighteenth Dynasty).]]\n\nA combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich [[fertile soil]] resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. [[Land management]] was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 361</ref>\n\nFarming in Egypt was dependent on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: ''Akhet'' (flooding), ''Peret'' (planting), and ''Shemu'' (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the [[growing season]] lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 514</ref> From March to May, farmers used [[sickle]]s to harvest their crops, which were then [[Threshing|threshed]] with a [[flail]] to separate the straw from the grain. [[Winnowing]] removed the [[chaff]] from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 506</ref>\n\nThe ancient Egyptians cultivated [[emmer]] and [[barley]], and several other cereal grains, all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 510</ref> [[Flax]] plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of [[linen]] and to make clothing. [[Papyrus]] growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.<ref>Nicholson (2000) pp. 577 and 630</ref>\n\n====Animals====\n[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|left|Sennedjem plows his fields with a pair of oxen, used as beasts of burden and a source of food.]]\nThe Egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and [[animal]]s was an essential element of the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole.<ref name=\"Strouhal117\">Strouhal (1989) p. 117</ref> Animals, both [[Domestication|domesticated]] and [[Wildlife|wild]], were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. [[Poultry]], such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them.<ref name=\"Manuelian381\">Manuelian (1998) p. 381</ref> The Nile provided a plentiful source of [[fish]]. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 409</ref>\n\nThe ancient Egyptians used donkeys and [[oxen]] as [[Working animal|beasts of burden]], and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual.<ref name=\"Manuelian381\"/> Horses were introduced by the [[Hyksos]] in the [[Second Intermediate Period]]. Camels, although known from the New Kingdom, were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that [[North African elephant|elephants]] were briefly utilized in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of [[grazing]] land.<ref name=\"Manuelian381\"/> Dogs, cats, and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n [[lion]]s,<ref name=\"Geptner1972\">{{cite book |author1=Heptner, V.G. |author2=Sludskij, A.A. |orig-year=1972 |year=1992 |title=Mlekopitaju\u0161\u010die Sovetskogo Soiuza.

These [[natural resource]]s allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and [[fashion jewelry]].<ref>Greaves (1929) p. 123</ref> [[Embalming|Embalmers]] used salts from the [[Wadi El Natrun|Wadi Natrun]] for [[mummy|mummification]], which also provided the [[gypsum]] needed to make plaster.<ref>Lucas (1962) p. 413</ref> Ore-bearing [[rock formation]]s were found in distant, inhospitable [[wadi]]s in the [[Arabian Desert|eastern desert]] and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive [[Gold mining|gold mines]] in [[Nubia]], and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The [[Wadi Hammamat]] was a notable source of granite, [[greywacke]], and gold. [[Flint]] was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 28</ref> Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as [[sulfur]] as cosmetic substances.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 166</ref> High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], greywacke, [[alabaster]], and [[carnelian]] dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked deposits of [[emerald]]s in Wadi Sikait and [[amethyst]] in [[Wadi el-Hudi]].<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 51</ref>\n\n===Trade===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian trade}}\n[[File:Relief of Hatshepsut's expedition to the Land of Punt by \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2.jpg|thumb|Hatshepsut's trading expedition to the [[Land of Punt]]]]\nThe ancient Egyptians engaged in trade with their [[Foreign contacts of ancient Egypt|foreign neighbors]] to obtain rare, exotic goods not found in Egypt.

By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 322</ref> Egypt relied on trade with [[Anatolia]] for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone [[lapis lazuli]], which had to be imported from far-away [[Afghanistan]]. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of [[olive oil]].<ref>Manuelian (1998) p. 145</ref> In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects.<ref>Harris (1990) p. 13</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Egyptian language}}\n\n===Historical development===\n{{Hiero | ''r n kmt''<br /> 'Egyptian language' | <hiero>r:Z1 n km m t:O49</hiero> | align=right | era=default}}\n\nThe [[Egyptian language]] is a northern [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language closely related to the [[Berber languages|Berber]] and [[Semitic languages]].<ref>Loprieno (1995b) p. 2137</ref> It has the second longest known history of any language (after [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]), having been written from c. 3200&nbsp;BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are [[Old Egyptian]], [[Middle Egyptian]] (Classical Egyptian), [[Late Egyptian]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]].<ref>Loprieno (2004) p. 161</ref> Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.<ref>Loprieno (2004) p. 162</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptian was a [[synthetic language]], but it became more [[Analytic language|analytic]] later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite [[Article (grammar)|articles]], which replaced the older inflectional [[suffix]]es. There was a change from the older [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] [[word order]] to [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].<ref>Loprieno (1995b) pp. 2137\u201338</ref> The Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]], [[hieratic]], and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic [[Coptic alphabet]]. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Orthodox Church]], and traces of it are found in modern [[Egyptian Arabic]].<ref>Vittman (1991) pp. 197\u2013227</ref>\n\n===Sounds and grammar===\nAncient Egyptian has 25 consonants similar to those of other Afro-Asiatic languages. These include [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] and [[Emphatic consonant|emphatic]] consonants, voiced and voiceless stops, voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] and voiced and voiceless [[Affricate consonant|affricates]]. It has three long and three short vowels, which expanded in Late Egyptian to about nine.<ref>Loprieno (1995a) p. 46</ref> The basic word in Egyptian, similar to Semitic and Berber, is a [[Semitic root|triliteral]] or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants. Suffixes are added to form words. The verb conjugation corresponds to the [[Grammatical person|person]]. For example, the triconsonantal skeleton '''{{transl|egy|S-\u1e0e-M}}''' is the semantic core of the word 'hear'; its basic conjugation is ''{{transl|egy|s\u1e0fm}}'', 'he hears'. If the subject is a noun, suffixes are not added to the verb:<ref>Loprieno (1995a) p. 74</ref> ''{{transl|egy|s\u1e0fm \u1e25mt}}'', 'the woman hears'.\n\nAdjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call ''[[Arabic grammar|nisbation]]'' because of its similarity with Arabic.<ref>Loprieno (2004) p. 175</ref> The word order is {{smallcaps|predicate\u2013subject}} in verbal and adjectival sentences, and {{smallcaps|subject\u2013predicate}} in nominal and adverbial sentences.<ref>Allen (2000) pp. 67, 70, 109</ref> The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.<ref>Loprieno (2005) p. 2147</ref> Verbs and nouns are negated by the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''n'', but ''nn'' is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences.

A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called [[hieratic]], which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], became the prevalent writing style, and it is this form of writing\u2014along with formal hieroglyphs\u2014that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.<ref>Loprieno (1995a) pp. 10\u201326</ref>\n\nAround the first century AD, the Coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified [[Greek alphabet]] with the addition of some Demotic signs.<ref>Allen (2000) p. 7</ref> Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine<ref>Loprieno (2004) p. 166</ref> and Islamic periods in Egypt,<ref>El-Daly (2005) p. 164</ref> but only in the 1820s, after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and years of research by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]], were hieroglyphs [[decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts|substantially deciphered]].<ref>Allen (2000) p. 8</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian literature}}\n[[File:Edwin Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith surgical papyrus]] (c. 16th century BC) describes anatomy and medical treatments and is written in hieratic.]]\n\nWriting first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs. It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the ''Per Ankh'' institution or the House of Life. The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories.<ref>Strouhal (1989) p. 235</ref> Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the [[Pyramid Texts|Pyramid]] and [[Coffin Texts]], were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300&nbsp;BC. Late Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in [[Ramesside Period|Ramesside]] administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts. During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of [[Harkhuf]] and [[Weni the Elder|Weni]]. The genre known as ''[[Sebayt]]'' (\"instructions\") was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the [[Ipuwer Papyrus|Ipuwer papyrus]], a poem of lamentations describing [[natural disaster]]s and social upheaval, is a famous example.\n\nThe [[Story of Sinuhe]], written in [[Middle Egyptian]], might be the classic of Egyptian literature.<ref>Lichtheim (1975) p. 11</ref> Also written at this time was the [[Westcar Papyrus]], a set of stories told to [[Khufu]] by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests.<ref>Lichtheim (1975) p. 215</ref> The [[Instruction of Amenemope]] is considered a masterpiece of Near Eastern literature.<ref>\"''Wisdom in Ancient Israel\"'', John Day, /John Adney Emerton, /Robert P.

From about 700&nbsp;BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the [[Greco-Roman]] period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]].<ref>Lichtheim (1980) p. 159</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Daily life===\n[[File:Ostracon04-RamessidePeriod MetropolitanMuseum.png|thumb|Ostraca of hunting a [[African lion#Cultural significance|lion]] with a spear, aided by a dog]]\n[[File:LowClassAncientEgyptianStatuettes.png|thumb|Statues depicting lower-class ancient Egyptian occupations]]\n{{further|Clothing in ancient Egypt | Dance in ancient Egypt|Music of Egypt#Old Kingdom}}\nMost ancient Egyptians were farmers tied to the land.

For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change.<ref>Robins (1997) p. 29</ref> These artistic standards\u2014simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth\u2014created a sense of order and balance within a composition. Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues. The [[Narmer Palette]], for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs.<ref>Robins (1997) p. 21</ref> Because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance, ancient Egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity.<ref>Robins (2001) p. 12</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptian artisans used stone as a medium for carving statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with [[gum arabic]] as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 105</ref>\n\nPharaohs used [[relief]]s to record victories in battle, royal decrees, and religious scenes. Common citizens had access to pieces of [[funerary art]], such as [[Ushabti|shabti]] statues and books of the dead, which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.<ref name=\"James122\">James (2005) p. 122</ref> During the Middle Kingdom, wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats, and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.<ref>Robins (1998) p. 74</ref>\n\nDespite the homogeneity of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]-style frescoes were found in [[Avaris]].<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 216</ref> The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to [[Akhenaten]]'s revolutionary religious ideas.<ref>Robins (1998) p. 149</ref> This style, known as [[Amarna art]], was quickly abandoned after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.<ref>Robins (1998) p. 158</ref>\n\n===Religious beliefs===\n<!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' -->\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian religion}}\n[[File:The judgement of the dead in the presence of Osiris.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Book of the Dead]] was a guide to the deceased's journey in the afterlife.]]\n\nBeliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule was based on the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right of kings]]. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by [[Egyptian pantheon|gods]] who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting [[Egyptian mythology|myths]] and stories into a coherent system.<ref>James (2005) p. 102</ref> These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.<ref>\"''The Oxford Guide: Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology''\", edited by [[Donald B. Redford]], p. 106, [[Berkley Books]], 2003, {{ISBN|0-425-19096-X}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ka Statue of horawibra.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Ka statue]] provided a physical place for the Ka to manifest.]]\n[[File:tutmask.jpg|thumb|upright|Pharaohs' tombs were provided with vast quantities of wealth, such as the [[Tutankhamun's mask|golden mask from the mummy of Tutankhamun]].]]\nGods were worshiped in cult [[Egyptian temple|temples]] administered by priests acting on the king's behalf. At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos.<ref>James (2005) p. 117</ref> After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of [[oracle]]s to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.<ref name=\"Shaw313\">Shaw (2002) p. 313</ref>\n\nThe Egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or ''aspects''. In addition to the body, each person had a ''\u0161wt'' (shadow), a ''ba'' (personality or soul), a ''ka'' (life-force), and a ''name''.<ref>Allen (2000) pp. 79, 94\u201395</ref> The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions. After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home. The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ''ka'' and ''ba'' and become one of the \"blessed dead\", living on as an ''akh'', or \"effective one\". For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a \"[[Maat#The afterlife|feather of truth]].\" If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form.<ref>Wasserman, ''et al.'' (1994) pp. 150\u201353</ref>\n\n===Burial customs===\n<!-- this section is intended as a brief overview, more details under 'see also' -->\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian burial customs}}\n[[File:Anubis attending the mummy of Sennedjem.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anubis]] was the ancient Egyptian god associated with mummification and burial rituals; here, he attends to a mummy.]]\n\nThe ancient Egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by [[Mummy|mummification]], performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife.<ref name=\"James122\"/> Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by [[desiccation]]. The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]], wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in [[canopic jar]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/ok.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Old Kingdom|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}</ref>\n\nBy the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called [[natron]]. The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin. Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted [[cartonnage]] mummy cases. Actual preservation practices declined during the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy, which was decorated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html|title=Mummies and Mummification: Late Period, Ptolemaic, Roman and Christian Period |accessdate=9 March 2008 |publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080330041612/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/mummy/late.html| archivedate= 30 March 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWealthy Egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased. [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts|Funerary texts]] were often included in the grave, and, beginning in the New Kingdom, so were [[Ushabti|shabti]] statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/shabtis.html|title=Shabtis|accessdate=9 March 2008|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080324044813/http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/shabtis.html| archivedate= 24 March 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.<ref>James (2005) p. 124</ref>\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Military of ancient Egypt}}\n[[File:Egyptian-Chariot.png|thumb|right|A [[chariot]]]]\nThe ancient Egyptian military was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion, and for maintaining Egypt's domination in the [[ancient Near East]]. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of [[Buhen]] on the way to Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the [[Levant]]. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack and conquer [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] and parts of the Levant.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 245</ref>\n\nTypical military equipment included [[Bow (weapon)|bows and arrows]], spears, and round-topped shields made by stretching [[Leather|animal skin]] over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom, the military began using [[Chariotry in ancient Egypt|chariots]] that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders. Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle, spears were tipped with a bronze point, and the [[Khopesh]] was adopted from Asiatic soldiers.<ref>Manuelian (1998) pp. 366\u201367</ref> The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army; it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs, such as [[Seqenenre Tao II]] and his sons, did do so.<ref>Clayton (1994) p. 96</ref> However, it has also been argued that \"kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders, fighting alongside their troops.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Garry J.|title=The Death of King Seqenenre Tao|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|year=2009|volume=45}}</ref> Soldiers were recruited from the general population, but during, and especially after, the New Kingdom, mercenaries from Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt.<ref>Shaw (2002) p. 400</ref>\n\n==Technology, medicine, and mathematics==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Civilization]] -->\n\n===Technology===\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian technology}}\n[[File:Egyptian glass jar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Glassmaking was a highly developed art.]]\n\nIn technology, medicine, and mathematics, ancient Egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional [[empiricism]], as evidenced by the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus|Edwin Smith]] and [[Ebers Papyrus|Ebers papyri]] (c. 1600&nbsp;BC), is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and [[decimal|decimal system]].\n\n===Faience and glass===\n[[File:Ancient Egyptian medical instruments.jpg|thumb|upright|Ancient Egyptian medical instruments depicted in a Ptolemaic period inscription on the temple at Kom Ombo]]\n\nEven before the Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had developed a glassy material known as [[Egyptian faience|faience]], which they treated as a type of artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of [[Silicon dioxide|silica]], small amounts of [[Calcium oxide|lime]] and [[Sodium oxide|soda]], and a colorant, typically copper.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 177</ref> The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as [[Egyptian blue|Egyptian Blue]], also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or [[sintering]]) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 109</ref>\n\nThe ancient Egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill, but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 195</ref> It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding [[Micromineral|trace elements]] to control the color of the finished glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.<ref>Nicholson (2000) p. 215</ref>\n\n===Medicine===\n{{Main|Ancient Egyptian medicine}}\nThe medical problems of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from [[malaria]] and debilitating [[schistosomiasis]] parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to [[abscess]]es (though [[dental caries|caries]] were rare).<ref>Filer (1995) p. 94</ref>\n\nThe diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars, which promoted [[Periodontitis|periodontal disease]].<ref>Filer (1995) pp. 78\u201380</ref> Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence.<ref>Filer (1995) p. 21</ref> Adult [[life expectancy]] was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.<ref>Figures are given for ''adult'' life expectancy and do not reflect life expectancy ''at birth.''

[[Medical papyri]] show [[Empirical evidence|empirical knowledge]] of anatomy, injuries, and practical treatments.<ref>Stroual (1989) pp. 244\u201346</ref>\n\nWounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection,<ref>Stroual (1989) p. 250</ref> while [[opium]] [[thyme]] and [[Atropa belladonna|belladona]] were used to relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers were made to the goddess [[Isis]].

The \"[[Khufu ship]]\", a {{convert|43.6|m|ft|adj=on}} vessel sealed into a pit in the [[Giza pyramid complex]] at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] around 2500&nbsp;BC, is a full-size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a [[solar barque]].

Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively.<ref>Clarke (1990) p. 217</ref> Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write [[Egyptian fraction|fractions]] as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction ''two-fifths'' into the sum of ''one-third'' + ''one-fifteenth''. Standard tables of values facilitated this.<ref>Clarke (1990) p. 218</ref> Some [[Vulgar fraction|common fractions]], however, were written with a special glyph\u2014the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.<ref>Gardiner (1957) p. 197</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptian mathematicians knew the [[Pythagorean theorem]] as an empirical formula.

The cult of the goddess [[Isis]], for example, became popular in the [[Roman Empire]], as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.<ref>Siliotti (1998) p. 8</ref> The Romans also imported [[building material]]s from Egypt to erect Egyptian-style structures. Early historians such as [[Herodotus]], [[Strabo]], and [[Diodorus Siculus]] studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.<ref>Siliotti (1998) p. 10</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later [[Islam]], but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] and [[al-Maqrizi]].<ref>El-Daly (2005) p. 112</ref> In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of [[Egyptomania]] across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.<ref>Siliotti (1998) p. 13</ref>\n\nAlthough the European [[colonialism|colonial]] occupation of Egypt destroyed a significant portion of the country's historical legacy, some foreigners left more positive marks. [[Napoleon]], for example, arranged the first studies in [[Egyptology]] when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's [[natural history]], which was published in the ''[[Description de l'\u00c9gypte]]''.<ref>Siliotti (1998) p. 100</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, the Egyptian Government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations. The [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] now approves and oversees all excavations, which are aimed at finding information rather than treasure. The council also supervises museums and monument reconstruction programs designed to preserve the historical legacy of Egypt.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:The Sphinx and Pyramid of Khafre (8838365561).jpg|Tourists at the [[Pyramid of Khafre|pyramid complex of Khafre]] near the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]]\nFile:EgyptFrontispiece.jpg|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] of ''[[Description de l'\u00c9gypte]]'', published in 38 volumes between 1809 and 1829.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal-inline|Ancient Egypt}}\n* [[Glossary of ancient Egypt artifacts]]\n* [[Index of ancient Egypt-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of ancient Egypt]]\n* [[List of ancient Egyptians]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|22em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |author=Aldred, Cyril |title=Akhenaten, King of Egypt |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=978-0-500-05048-4 |doi=}}\n* {{Cite book |author=Allen, James P. |title=Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge|year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-77483-3}}\n* {{Cite book | last=Badawy | first=Alexander | title=A History of Egyptian Architecture.

The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; it is in the [[British Library]] as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the ''[[Liber Wigorniensis]]'', is a collection of [[Anglo-Saxon charters]] and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, ''Hemming's Cartulary'' proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.\n\nThe two works are bound together in one surviving manuscript, the earliest surviving cartulary from medieval England. A major theme is the losses suffered by Worcester at the hands of royal officials and local landowners. Included amongst the despoilers are kings such as [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] and [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], and nobles such as [[Eadric Streona]] and [[Urse d'Abetot]]. Also included are accounts of lawsuits waged by the Worcester monks in an effort to regain their lost lands. The two sections of the cartulary were first printed in 1723. The original manuscript was slightly damaged by fire in 1733, and required rebinding. A new printed edition is in production as of 2010.\n\n==Authorship and composition==\nAlthough the monk Hemming has traditionally been credited with all the works in the manuscript, the cartulary contains two works that were collected together, only one of which is by Hemming. The two works were bound together to form the manuscript (abbreviated MS) [[Cotton Tiberius A xiii]], now held in the [[Cotton library|Cotton Library]], a collection in the British Library.<ref name=BASE/> Together, the two works form the first surviving cartulary from medieval England.<ref name=Clanchy101>Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' pp. 101\u2013102</ref> The first part is the so-called ''Liber Wigorniensis'', or ''Book of Worcester'', which takes up [[wikt:folio|folios]] 1\u2013118 of the manuscript.<ref name=Intro11f38>Brooks \"Introduction\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' p. 11 footnote 38</ref> The second is Hemming's work, and takes up folios 119\u2013142, 144\u2013152 and 154\u2013200.<ref name=Intro11>Brooks \"Introduction\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 11\u201313</ref> MS [[Cotton Nero E i]] and British Library MS Add 46204 may also contain charters collected as part of Hemming's work, as they have been identified by some scholars as having been produced during Hemming's lifetime,<ref name=Intro11/> although others identify them as a copy of the ''Liber Wigorniensis''.<ref name=Forge106>Barrow \"Forgery Production\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 106\u2013107 and footnote 7</ref>\n\n===Manuscript condition===\nThe original manuscript containing the cartulary was damaged in a fire in 1733,<ref name=DNB/> but the damage was not serious. The edges of the manuscript were burned, which resulted in a few words being lost on the margins. Because of the fire damage, the manuscript was rebound in the 19th century, and each leaf was mounted separately.<ref name=Ker51>Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' p. 51</ref> In addition to the two main sections, there are three smaller parchment pages bound in with the manuscript: folios 110, 143, and 153.<ref name=Ker51/> The first of them, folio 110, measures {{convert|70|mm|in}} high by {{convert|90|mm|in}} wide and lists eight names, probably witnesses to a lease. The second inserted folio, 143, measures {{convert|130|mm|in}} high by {{convert|180|mm|in}} wide and gives a list of jurors in a late 11th-century hand. The last inserted folio, 153, measures {{convert|58|mm|in}} high by {{convert|180|mm|in}} wide and gives the boundaries of a manor in [[Old English]], rather than Latin; it is written in a 12th-century hand.<ref name=Ker62>Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History' p. 62</ref>\n\n===''Liber Wigorniensis''===\nThe first part of the work is an early 11th-century collection of older charters, arranged geographically, with a section on late 10th-century land leases tacked on the end.<ref name=BASE/> The historian {{nowrap|[[H. P. R. Finberg]]}} gave this section of the work the title ''Liber Wigorniensis'' in 1961 to distinguish it from the later section actually assembled by Hemming.<ref name=Tinti234>Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 234</ref> Dates for the compilation of the work include the suggestion by historian [[Neil Ripley Ker|Neil Ker]] that it dates from between 1002 and 1016, when [[Wulfstan II|Wulfstan]] (the earlier Wulfstan&nbsp;\u2013 later a saint&nbsp;\u2013 who is not the Wulfstan who encouraged Hemming to compile the cartulary) held both the [[Archbishop of York|archbishopric of York]] and the [[Bishop of Worcester|bishopric of Worcester]]. Another historian, [[Vivian Hunter Galbraith|V. H. Galbraith]], suggests that instead of being compiled in Wulfstan's episcopate, it was created during the episcopate of [[Ealdwulf (died 1002)|Ealdwulf]], Wulfstan's predecessor in both [[Episcopal see|sees]]. A third historian, [[David Dumville]], argues that because no leases later than 996 are mentioned, it must date to a time-frame between 996 and 1016.<ref name=Tinti235>Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 235</ref> There are 155&nbsp;charters in the ''Liber'', of which 10 are later insertions; the date of their incorporation ranges from the early to the late 11th century.<ref name=Barrow108/> Ker, who studied the original manuscript, has identified five main scribes involved in the manuscript in the first section. The [[Hand (handwriting)|scribal hand]]s used are small and not very rounded, and resemble the type of writing prevalent in England during the early part of the 11th century.<ref name=Ker49>Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' p. 49</ref> This section consists of 117&nbsp;leaves in the original manuscript, each page with 26&nbsp;lines of text. The written area is approximately {{convert|190|mm|in}} tall by {{convert|100|mm|in}} wide.<ref name=Ker51/> A few blank areas in the original manuscript copy have been filled with information in the later 11th and 12th centuries, mainly related to properties owned by the cathedral.<ref name=Ker52>Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 52\u201355</ref>\n\n===Hemming's cartulary proper===\nHemming was the author of the second and later part, a collection of lands and rights belonging to the cathedral chapter of Worcester, as well as a narrative of the deeds of [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]], the Bishop of Worcester who died in 1095, and Archbishop [[Ealdred (archbishop)|Ealdred]] of York. In this part of the work is a preface known as the ''Enucleatio libelli'', where Hemming names himself as the person responsible for compiling the work, and names Wulfstan as the inspiration for his work.<ref name=BASE/> Another section, known as the ''Prefatio istius libelli'', now much later in the manuscript but possibly meant as an introduction to the ''Codicellus'', is a shorter introduction that gives the purpose of the collection.<ref name=Tinti239>Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 239</ref> Historians usually take the two prefaces to mean that Wulfstan commissioned the work,<ref name=Feudal35>Barlow ''Feudal Kingdom of England'' p. 35</ref><ref name=Williams145>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 145</ref> but it is unclear whether it was created before or after Wulfstan's death. It may have been produced during the vacancy after Wulfstan's death, and before the appointment of the next bishop, [[Samson (Bishop of Worcester)|Samson]]. Historian [[Nicholas Brooks]], along with Vivian Galbraith, argues that Hemming's work was a response to the problems encountered by the diocese during the vacancy, when royal officials administered the lands of the bishopric. According to Brooks, the claim that Wulfstan ordered the composition of the cartulary was inaccurate, and was made to appeal to the authority of the bishop.<ref name=Intro11/> The historian [[Julia Barrow]] believes that the inspiration for the work was the creation of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in 1086, although she agrees that the work was completed after Wulfstan's death. Hemming's work contains over 50&nbsp;charters, some of which are duplicates of ones in the ''Liber''.<ref name=Barrow114>Barrow \"Forgery Production\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nThe second section of the work is not just a collection of deeds and charters but includes other historical information of importance, especially for Hemming's monastery.<ref name=BASE>Keynes \"Hemming\" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 231\u2013232</ref> The documents are connected by a narrative explaining why and how the cartulary was created; the narrative is usually given the title of ''Codicellus possessionum''.<ref name=Tinti235/> This section of the work also includes the ''[[hagiography|Life]]'' of the later Wulfstan,<ref name=DNB>Mason \"Hemming\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> one of two contemporary records of Wulfstan's life.{{efn|The other record the ''[[Vita Wulfstani]]'' written by [[William of Malmesbury]] during the early 12th century, which is a translation of a work by Coleman, Wulfstan's chaplain.<ref name=Monastic74/>}}<ref name=Monastic74>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 74 footnote 2</ref> The organization is broadly geographical, with some information grouped by topic.<ref name=Cart83/> In two sections, which are sometimes entitled \"Indiculum Libertatis\" and \"Oswald's Indiculum\",<ref name=Tinti244>Tinti \"From Monastic Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 244\u2013245</ref> the work not only draws on charters but also incorporates regional information from a different type of source recording the holdings of tenants-in-chief. This has been identified as the documentation assembled at the shire-courts for the so-called Domesday survey, commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1085. More famously, the same records were later used for the compilation of Domesday Book.<ref name=Cart83/> Some of the documents are in Latin, others are in Old English.<ref name=Cart83>Fleming \"Christ Church Canterbury's Anglo-Norman Cartulary\" ''Anglo-Norman Political Culture'' pp. 82\u201383</ref> Ker has identified the second part of the manuscript as being created by three scribes, describing their writing as \"round and fairly large\", in a style belonging to a period of transition between the late 11th and early 12th century.<ref name=Ker49/> There are 80&nbsp;leaves in the original manuscript. Most pages in this section of the manuscript have 28&nbsp;lines of writing, and the written area is approximately {{convert|190|mm|in}} high by {{convert|108|mm|in}} wide.<ref name=Ker51/> A few blank areas in the original manuscript were filled with information ranging from contemporary notes on landholdings of the cathedral to notes on the [[Dissolution of the monasteries|dissolution]] of [[Worcester Priory]] in the 16th century.<ref name=Ker58>Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 58\u201362</ref>\n\n==Themes and contents==\nBoth the ''Liber Wigorniensis'' and Hemming's work contain a number of forged charters.<ref name=Intro11/> The historian Julia Barrow has determined that at least 25 of the 155&nbsp;charters in the ''Liber'' are forged, but cautions that this is the minimum estimate.<ref name=Barrow108>Barrow \"Forgery Production\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 108\u2013109</ref> Barrow identifies more than 30 of the charters in Hemming's work as forgeries, including some that are duplicates from the ''Liber''.<ref name=Barrow114/> Some of the stories that form Hemming's narrative do not always agree with other sources, and Ker says \"it is safer to trust to the main facts than to the details of his [Hemming's] stories\".<ref name=Ker64>Ker \"Heming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 64\u201365</ref>\n\n===Contents of the ''Liber Wigorniensis''===\nThe main goal of the ''Liber'' was to document the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to the property of the church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the ''Liber'' should be seen as a working document, compiled for the use of the bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The ''Liber'' was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.<ref name=Davies145>Davies ''Book of Llandaf'' p. 145</ref>\n\nThe charters constitute valuable evidence for [[prosopography|prosopographical]] research and the study of land tenure in late Anglo-Saxon England. According to [[Donald A. Bullough]], they also offer a window on the kind of social bonds which could be created by \"neighbourhood\". In the 10th century, the Bishop of Worcester leased out various small estates attached to the Church in the three counties (Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Warwickshire) to several high-ranking men and women, usually for three lifespans.<ref name=Friends19>Bullough ''Friends, Neighours and Fellow-drinkers'' pp. 19\u201321</ref> The pattern may be taken to suggest that this way of association served to \"create a network, an inter-meshing, of high-status 'neighbours' ... with its central knot in Worcester and the ''domus'' of the bishop\".<ref name=Friends21/> In the bishop's residence or at home, the lessees may have come together to participate in convivial drinking, just as the Norman successors to these lands are envisaged as doing in [[William of Malmesbury]]'s ''Life'' of St Wulfstan.<ref name=Friends21>Bullough ''Friends, Neighours and Fellow-drinkers'' pp. 21\u201322</ref> Further, some of the [[thegn]]s served in the royal army (''fyrd'') under the command of Bishop [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]] or his successors, which presupposes the creation of a personal warband and possibly one with the secondary purpose of protecting the bishop's properties.<ref name=Friends22>Bullough ''Friends, Neighours and Fellow-drinkers'' p. 22</ref>\n\n===Hemming's work===\n\n====Purpose====\nHemming's introduction to his work (''Prefatio'') claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: <blockquote>about the things which have been committed to their care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men\u2014first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans in our own time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.<ref name=QSouthern249>Quoted and translated in Southern \"Aspects of the European Tradition of Historical Writing\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' pp. 249\u2013250</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe historian [[Richard Southern]] argues that, notwithstanding the stated aim of the work, it was not produced to be used in lawsuits, but rather as a kind of utopian picture of what was in the past. The goal was to depict those things that were beyond human recovery but that were \"laid up in heaven\".<ref name=Southern249>Southern \"Aspects of the European Tradition of Historical Writing\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' pp. 249\u2013250</ref> Because of its narrative structure, it should be seen not only as a documentation of the various landholdings of the diocese, but as a historical work as well. Unlike the ''Liber'', it was not revised as the property changed hands, and this lack of revision has been seen as emphasizing the commemorative nature of the work. The historian [[John Reuben Davies]] sees a close parallel between Hemming's work and the Welsh medieval document ''[[Book of Llandaff|The Book of Llandaf]]''.<ref name=Davies145/> Other similar works were the Norman ''[[pancartes]]'', which were compilations of gifts to a monastery, connected by a narrative which was then presented to the dukes to secure confirmation of the gifts. These Norman works date from the early 11th century, and like Hemming's work, they are of great interest to the historian as sources for the study of medieval history.<ref name=Houts117>van Houts \"Historical Writing\" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 117</ref> Also noting that Hemming's part of the compilation does not appear to have been revised or updated to meet new circumstances, Patrick Geary describes it as \"a commemorative, historical volume, not a working administrative tool\" and associates the work with counterparts produced in the continental West, such as [[Folcuin]]'s chronicle cartulary ''Gesta abbatum S. Bertini Sithiensium''.<ref name=Phandom101>Geary ''Phantoms of Remembrance'' pp. 101\u2013102</ref>\n\nMore recently, Francesca Tinti has arrived at a different conclusion, arguing instead that Hemming's work, more so than the ''Liber Wigorniensis'', came to serve very real needs, and that these specifically concerned the monastic community at Worcester. Although the ''Prefatio'' is silent about monks, the ''Enucleatio'' is explicit that Bishop Wulfstan had commissioned the work to defend the estates assigned for the sustenance of the monks (''ad victum monachorum''). She relates these concerns to the rapid growth of the community during Bishop Wulfstan's episcopate in the second half of the 11th century.{{efn|One of the bishop's charters included in the work states that the number of monks had gone up from 12 to 50.<ref name=Tinti257>Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 257</ref>}}<ref name=Tinti257/> The coming of the Norman newcomer, Samson, who had been involved in the dissolution of [[Westbury-on-Trym]], would have given the enlarged community a particular incentive to safeguard its property and rights.<ref name=Tinti237>Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 237, 258\u2013261</ref>\n\n====Contents====\nOne of the themes of Hemming's work is the depredations suffered by his monastery at the hands of royal officials. One such notorious official from the last decade of King \u00c6thelred's reign is Eadric ''Streona'' (\"Grasper\"), [[ealdorman]] of [[Mercia]], blamed for having appropriated land held by the church in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire and for having incorporated the [[Ancient counties of England|ancient county]] of [[Winchcombeshire]] into Gloucestershire.<ref name=Baxter23>Baxter ''Earls of Mercia'', pp. 23 and 107, citing ''Hemming's Cartulary'', ed. Hearne, pp. 280\u2013281</ref> Hemming may have invented Eadric's [[byname]] of ''Streona'', as it is not attested before appearing in Hemming's work.<ref name=Aeth70>Williams ''\u00c6thelred the Unready'' p. 70</ref>\n\nHemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror as being especially damaging.<ref name=Uni22>Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 22</ref> He claims that the work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several [[Manorialism|manor]]s that were listed in ''Domesday Book'' as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims.<ref name=Lawson729>Lawson \"Collection\" ''English Historical Journal'' p. 729 footnote 12</ref> It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 [[mark (money)|marks]] of gold to recover their belongings.<ref name=Dove32/> Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric]], Earl of Mercia, and other members of his family.<ref name=Spoil387>Williams \"Spoliation of Worcester\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XIX'' pp. 386\u2013387</ref>\n\nThe historian Ted Johnson Smith points out that the ''Codicellus'' has strong parallels to the ''[[Historia de Sancto Cuthberto]]''.<ref name=Introduction12>Smith \"Introduction\" ''Historia de Sancto Cuthberto'' pp. 12\u201314</ref> The ''Historia'' was written in Durham in the mid-10th century, and is a history of the monastery of St. Cuthbert from foundation until about 945. Like the ''Codicellus'', it is a narrative concerned mainly to defend the patrimony of the monks against depredations.<ref name=Introduction12/><ref name=Grandsen76>Gransden ''Historical Writing in England'' pp. 76\u201377</ref>\n\nAlso contained in Hemming's work is a description of the lawsuit between the diocese of Worcester and [[Evesham Abbey]], which took place between 1078 and 1085. Although only Hemming relates the course of the proceedings, the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham]]'', or ''Evesham Chronicle'', also gives background information on the dispute. The litigation involved lands that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire, but that the diocese maintained were actually part of one of the bishopric's manors. Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of \u00c6thelwig, when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of lands previously held from the diocese. After \u00c6thelwig's death, most of these lands passed to [[Odo of Bayeux]], but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth, which became the basis of the dispute. The lawsuit was complicated because part of the land had been granted by an earlier bishop, [[Beorhtheah]], to a kinsman, Azur. After the Conquest, Azur's lands were given to Urse d'Abetot, the Sheriff of Worcester. Following \u00c6thelwig's death, Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with \u00c6thelwig's successor Walter. The settlement, which was concluded in 1086, granted the lands to the abbey, but the diocese was the overlord of the lands, for which the abbey owed military service.<ref name=Dove32>Williams \"Cunning of the Dove\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 32\u201335</ref>\n\n===Contents of the manuscript===\nA brief overview of the contents of the manuscript follows, with the main sectioning and a general idea of the contents of each section.<ref name=Table>The information in the table is drawn from Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 49\u201375 and Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 233\u2013261</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; it is in the [[British Library]] as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the ''[[Liber Wigorniensis]]'', is a collection of [[Anglo-Saxon charters]] and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, ''Hemming's Cartulary'' proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.\n\nThe two works are bound together in one surviving manuscript, the earliest surviving cartulary from medieval England. A major theme is the losses suffered by Worcester at the hands of royal officials and local landowners. Included amongst the despoilers are kings such as [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] and [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], and nobles such as [[Eadric Streona]] and [[Urse d'Abetot]]. Also included are accounts of lawsuits waged by the Worcester monks in an effort to regain their lost lands. The two sections of the cartulary were first printed in 1723. The original manuscript was slightly damaged by fire in 1733, and required rebinding. A new printed edition is in production as of 2010.\n\n==Authorship and composition==\nAlthough the monk Hemming has traditionally been credited with all the works in the manuscript, the cartulary contains two works that were collected together, only one of which is by Hemming. The two works were bound together to form the manuscript (abbreviated MS) [[Cotton Tiberius A xiii]], now held in the [[Cotton library|Cotton Library]], a collection in the British Library.<ref name=BASE/> Together, the two works form the first surviving cartulary from medieval England.<ref name=Clanchy101>Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' pp. 101\u2013102</ref> The first part is the so-called ''Liber Wigorniensis'', or ''Book of Worcester'', which takes up [[wikt:folio|folios]] 1\u2013118 of the manuscript.<ref name=Intro11f38>Brooks \"Introduction\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' p. 11 footnote 38</ref> The second is Hemming's work, and takes up folios 119\u2013142, 144\u2013152 and 154\u2013200.<ref name=Intro11>Brooks \"Introduction\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 11\u201313</ref> MS [[Cotton Nero E i]] and British Library MS Add 46204 may also contain charters collected as part of Hemming's work, as they have been identified by some scholars as having been produced during Hemming's lifetime,<ref name=Intro11/> although others identify them as a copy of the ''Liber Wigorniensis''.<ref name=Forge106>Barrow \"Forgery Production\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 106\u2013107 and footnote 7</ref>\n\n===Manuscript condition===\nThe original manuscript containing the cartulary was damaged in a fire in 1733,<ref name=DNB/> but the damage was not serious. The edges of the manuscript were burned, which resulted in a few words being lost on the margins. Because of the fire damage, the manuscript was rebound in the 19th century, and each leaf was mounted separately.<ref name=Ker51>Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' p. 51</ref> In addition to the two main sections, there are three smaller parchment pages bound in with the manuscript: folios 110, 143, and 153.<ref name=Ker51/> The first of them, folio 110, measures {{convert|70|mm|in}} high by {{convert|90|mm|in}} wide and lists eight names, probably witnesses to a lease. The second inserted folio, 143, measures {{convert|130|mm|in}} high by {{convert|180|mm|in}} wide and gives a list of jurors in a late 11th-century hand. The last inserted folio, 153, measures {{convert|58|mm|in}} high by {{convert|180|mm|in}} wide and gives the boundaries of a manor in [[Old English]], rather than Latin; it is written in a 12th-century hand.<ref name=Ker62>Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History' p. 62</ref>\n\n===''Liber Wigorniensis''===\nThe first part of the work is an early 11th-century collection of older charters, arranged geographically, with a section on late 10th-century land leases tacked on the end.<ref name=BASE/> The historian {{nowrap|[[H. P. R. Finberg]]}} gave this section of the work the title ''Liber Wigorniensis'' in 1961 to distinguish it from the later section actually assembled by Hemming.<ref name=Tinti234>Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 234</ref> Dates for the compilation of the work include the suggestion by historian [[Neil Ripley Ker|Neil Ker]] that it dates from between 1002 and 1016, when [[Wulfstan II|Wulfstan]] (the earlier Wulfstan&nbsp;\u2013 later a saint&nbsp;\u2013 who is not the Wulfstan who encouraged Hemming to compile the cartulary) held both the [[Archbishop of York|archbishopric of York]] and the [[Bishop of Worcester|bishopric of Worcester]]. Another historian, [[Vivian Hunter Galbraith|V. H. Galbraith]], suggests that instead of being compiled in Wulfstan's episcopate, it was created during the episcopate of [[Ealdwulf (died 1002)|Ealdwulf]], Wulfstan's predecessor in both [[Episcopal see|sees]]. A third historian, [[David Dumville]], argues that because no leases later than 996 are mentioned, it must date to a time-frame between 996 and 1016.<ref name=Tinti235>Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 235</ref> There are 155&nbsp;charters in the ''Liber'', of which 10 are later insertions; the date of their incorporation ranges from the early to the late 11th century.<ref name=Barrow108/> Ker, who studied the original manuscript, has identified five main scribes involved in the manuscript in the first section. The [[Hand (handwriting)|scribal hand]]s used are small and not very rounded, and resemble the type of writing prevalent in England during the early part of the 11th century.<ref name=Ker49>Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' p. 49</ref> This section consists of 117&nbsp;leaves in the original manuscript, each page with 26&nbsp;lines of text. The written area is approximately {{convert|190|mm|in}} tall by {{convert|100|mm|in}} wide.<ref name=Ker51/> A few blank areas in the original manuscript copy have been filled with information in the later 11th and 12th centuries, mainly related to properties owned by the cathedral.<ref name=Ker52>Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 52\u201355</ref>\n\n===Hemming's cartulary proper===\nHemming was the author of the second and later part, a collection of lands and rights belonging to the cathedral chapter of Worcester, as well as a narrative of the deeds of [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan]], the Bishop of Worcester who died in 1095, and Archbishop [[Ealdred (archbishop)|Ealdred]] of York. In this part of the work is a preface known as the ''Enucleatio libelli'', where Hemming names himself as the person responsible for compiling the work, and names Wulfstan as the inspiration for his work.<ref name=BASE/> Another section, known as the ''Prefatio istius libelli'', now much later in the manuscript but possibly meant as an introduction to the ''Codicellus'', is a shorter introduction that gives the purpose of the collection.<ref name=Tinti239>Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 239</ref> Historians usually take the two prefaces to mean that Wulfstan commissioned the work,<ref name=Feudal35>Barlow ''Feudal Kingdom of England'' p. 35</ref><ref name=Williams145>Williams ''English and the Norman Conquest'' p. 145</ref> but it is unclear whether it was created before or after Wulfstan's death. It may have been produced during the vacancy after Wulfstan's death, and before the appointment of the next bishop, [[Samson (Bishop of Worcester)|Samson]]. Historian [[Nicholas Brooks]], along with Vivian Galbraith, argues that Hemming's work was a response to the problems encountered by the diocese during the vacancy, when royal officials administered the lands of the bishopric. According to Brooks, the claim that Wulfstan ordered the composition of the cartulary was inaccurate, and was made to appeal to the authority of the bishop.<ref name=Intro11/> The historian [[Julia Barrow]] believes that the inspiration for the work was the creation of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' in 1086, although she agrees that the work was completed after Wulfstan's death. Hemming's work contains over 50&nbsp;charters, some of which are duplicates of ones in the ''Liber''.<ref name=Barrow114>Barrow \"Forgery Production\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nThe second section of the work is not just a collection of deeds and charters but includes other historical information of importance, especially for Hemming's monastery.<ref name=BASE>Keynes \"Hemming\" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 231\u2013232</ref> The documents are connected by a narrative explaining why and how the cartulary was created; the narrative is usually given the title of ''Codicellus possessionum''.<ref name=Tinti235/> This section of the work also includes the ''[[hagiography|Life]]'' of the later Wulfstan,<ref name=DNB>Mason \"Hemming\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> one of two contemporary records of Wulfstan's life.{{efn|The other record the ''[[Vita Wulfstani]]'' written by [[William of Malmesbury]] during the early 12th century, which is a translation of a work by Coleman, Wulfstan's chaplain.<ref name=Monastic74/>}}<ref name=Monastic74>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 74 footnote 2</ref> The organization is broadly geographical, with some information grouped by topic.<ref name=Cart83/> In two sections, which are sometimes entitled \"Indiculum Libertatis\" and \"Oswald's Indiculum\",<ref name=Tinti244>Tinti \"From Monastic Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 244\u2013245</ref> the work not only draws on charters but also incorporates regional information from a different type of source recording the holdings of tenants-in-chief. This has been identified as the documentation assembled at the shire-courts for the so-called Domesday survey, commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1085. More famously, the same records were later used for the compilation of Domesday Book.<ref name=Cart83/> Some of the documents are in Latin, others are in Old English.<ref name=Cart83>Fleming \"Christ Church Canterbury's Anglo-Norman Cartulary\" ''Anglo-Norman Political Culture'' pp. 82\u201383</ref> Ker has identified the second part of the manuscript as being created by three scribes, describing their writing as \"round and fairly large\", in a style belonging to a period of transition between the late 11th and early 12th century.<ref name=Ker49/> There are 80&nbsp;leaves in the original manuscript. Most pages in this section of the manuscript have 28&nbsp;lines of writing, and the written area is approximately {{convert|190|mm|in}} high by {{convert|108|mm|in}} wide.<ref name=Ker51/> A few blank areas in the original manuscript were filled with information ranging from contemporary notes on landholdings of the cathedral to notes on the [[Dissolution of the monasteries|dissolution]] of [[Worcester Priory]] in the 16th century.<ref name=Ker58>Ker \"Hemming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 58\u201362</ref>\n\n==Themes and contents==\nBoth the ''Liber Wigorniensis'' and Hemming's work contain a number of forged charters.<ref name=Intro11/> The historian Julia Barrow has determined that at least 25 of the 155&nbsp;charters in the ''Liber'' are forged, but cautions that this is the minimum estimate.<ref name=Barrow108>Barrow \"Forgery Production\" ''St Wulfstan and His World'' pp. 108\u2013109</ref> Barrow identifies more than 30 of the charters in Hemming's work as forgeries, including some that are duplicates from the ''Liber''.<ref name=Barrow114/> Some of the stories that form Hemming's narrative do not always agree with other sources, and Ker says \"it is safer to trust to the main facts than to the details of his [Hemming's] stories\".<ref name=Ker64>Ker \"Heming's Cartulary\" ''Studies in Medieval History'' pp. 64\u201365</ref>\n\n===Contents of the ''Liber Wigorniensis''===\nThe main goal of the ''Liber'' was to document the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to the property of the church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the ''Liber'' should be seen as a working document, compiled for the use of the bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The ''Liber'' was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.<ref name=Davies145>Davies ''Book of Llandaf'' p. 145</ref>\n\nThe charters constitute valuable evidence for [[prosopography|prosopographical]] research and the study of land tenure in late Anglo-Saxon England. According to [[Donald A. Bullough]], they also offer a window on the kind of social bonds which could be created by \"neighbourhood\". In the 10th century, the Bishop of Worcester leased out various small estates attached to the Church in the three counties (Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Warwickshire) to several high-ranking men and women, usually for three lifespans.<ref name=Friends19>Bullough ''Friends, Neighours and Fellow-drinkers'' pp. 19\u201321</ref> The pattern may be taken to suggest that this way of association served to \"create a network, an inter-meshing, of high-status 'neighbours' ... with its central knot in Worcester and the ''domus'' of the bishop\".<ref name=Friends21/> In the bishop's residence or at home, the lessees may have come together to participate in convivial drinking, just as the Norman successors to these lands are envisaged as doing in [[William of Malmesbury]]'s ''Life'' of St Wulfstan.<ref name=Friends21>Bullough ''Friends, Neighours and Fellow-drinkers'' pp. 21\u201322</ref> Further, some of the [[thegn]]s served in the royal army (''fyrd'') under the command of Bishop [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]] or his successors, which presupposes the creation of a personal warband and possibly one with the secondary purpose of protecting the bishop's properties.<ref name=Friends22>Bullough ''Friends, Neighours and Fellow-drinkers'' p. 22</ref>\n\n===Hemming's work===\n\n====Purpose====\nHemming's introduction to his work (''Prefatio'') claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: <blockquote>about the things which have been committed to their care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men\u2014first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans in our own time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.<ref name=QSouthern249>Quoted and translated in Southern \"Aspects of the European Tradition of Historical Writing\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' pp. 249\u2013250</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe historian [[Richard Southern]] argues that, notwithstanding the stated aim of the work, it was not produced to be used in lawsuits, but rather as a kind of utopian picture of what was in the past. The goal was to depict those things that were beyond human recovery but that were \"laid up in heaven\".<ref name=Southern249>Southern \"Aspects of the European Tradition of Historical Writing\" ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' pp. 249\u2013250</ref> Because of its narrative structure, it should be seen not only as a documentation of the various landholdings of the diocese, but as a historical work as well. Unlike the ''Liber'', it was not revised as the property changed hands, and this lack of revision has been seen as emphasizing the commemorative nature of the work. The historian [[John Reuben Davies]] sees a close parallel between Hemming's work and the Welsh medieval document ''[[Book of Llandaff|The Book of Llandaf]]''.<ref name=Davies145/> Other similar works were the Norman ''[[pancartes]]'', which were compilations of gifts to a monastery, connected by a narrative which was then presented to the dukes to secure confirmation of the gifts. These Norman works date from the early 11th century, and like Hemming's work, they are of great interest to the historian as sources for the study of medieval history.<ref name=Houts117>van Houts \"Historical Writing\" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 117</ref> Also noting that Hemming's part of the compilation does not appear to have been revised or updated to meet new circumstances, Patrick Geary describes it as \"a commemorative, historical volume, not a working administrative tool\" and associates the work with counterparts produced in the continental West, such as [[Folcuin]]'s chronicle cartulary ''Gesta abbatum S. Bertini Sithiensium''.<ref name=Phandom101>Geary ''Phantoms of Remembrance'' pp. 101\u2013102</ref>\n\nMore recently, Francesca Tinti has arrived at a different conclusion, arguing instead that Hemming's work, more so than the ''Liber Wigorniensis'', came to serve very real needs, and that these specifically concerned the monastic community at Worcester. Although the ''Prefatio'' is silent about monks, the ''Enucleatio'' is explicit that Bishop Wulfstan had commissioned the work to defend the estates assigned for the sustenance of the monks (''ad victum monachorum''). She relates these concerns to the rapid growth of the community during Bishop Wulfstan's episcopate in the second half of the 11th century.{{efn|One of the bishop's charters included in the work states that the number of monks had gone up from 12 to 50.<ref name=Tinti257>Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 257</ref>}}<ref name=Tinti257/> The coming of the Norman newcomer, Samson, who had been involved in the dissolution of [[Westbury-on-Trym]], would have given the enlarged community a particular incentive to safeguard its property and rights.<ref name=Tinti237>Tinti \"From Episcopal Conception\" ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 237, 258\u2013261</ref>\n\n====Contents====\nOne of the themes of Hemming's work is the depredations suffered by his monastery at the hands of royal officials. One such notorious official from the last decade of King \u00c6thelred's reign is Eadric ''Streona'' (\"Grasper\"), [[ealdorman]] of [[Mercia]], blamed for having appropriated land held by the church in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire and for having incorporated the [[Ancient counties of England|ancient county]] of [[Winchcombeshire]] into Gloucestershire.<ref name=Baxter23>Baxter ''Earls of Mercia'', pp. 23 and 107, citing ''Hemming's Cartulary'', ed. Hearne, pp. 280\u2013281</ref> Hemming may have invented Eadric's [[byname]] of ''Streona'', as it is not attested before appearing in Hemming's work.<ref name=Aeth70>Williams ''\u00c6thelred the Unready'' p. 70</ref>\n\nHemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror as being especially damaging.<ref name=Uni22>Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 22</ref> He claims that the work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several [[Manorialism|manor]]s that were listed in ''Domesday Book'' as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims.<ref name=Lawson729>Lawson \"Collection\" ''English Historical Journal'' p. 729 footnote 12</ref> It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 [[mark (money)|marks]] of gold to recover their belongings.<ref name=Dove32/> Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric]], Earl of Mercia, and other members of his family.<ref name=Spoil387>Williams \"Spoilation of Worcester\" ''Anglo-Norman Studies XIX'' pp. 386\u2013387</ref>\n\nThe historian Ted Johnson Smith points out that the ''Codicellus'' has strong parallels to the ''[[Historia de Sancto Cuthberto]]''.<ref name=Introduction12>Smith \"Introduction\" ''Historia de Sancto Cuthberto'' pp. 12\u201314</ref> The ''Historia'' was written in Durham in the mid-10th century, and is a history of the monastery of St. Cuthbert from foundation until about 945. Like the ''Codicellus'', it is a narrative concerned mainly to defend the patrimony of the monks against depredations.<ref name=Introduction12/><ref name=Grandsen76>Gransden ''Historical Writing in England'' pp. 76\u201377</ref>\n\nAlso contained in Hemming's work is a description of the lawsuit between the diocese of Worcester and [[Evesham Abbey]], which took place between 1078 and 1085. Although only Hemming relates the course of the proceedings, the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham]]'', or ''Evesham Chronicle'', also gives background information on the dispute. The litigation involved lands that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire, but that the diocese maintained were actually part of one of the bishopric's manors. Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of \u00c6thelwig, when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of lands previously held from the diocese. After \u00c6thelwig's death, most of these lands passed to [[Odo of Bayeux]], but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth, which became the basis of the dispute. The lawsuit was complicated because part of the land had been granted by an earlier bishop, [[Beorhtheah]], to a kinsman, Azur. After the Conquest, Azur's lands were given to Urse d'Abetot, the Sheriff of Worcester. Following \u00c6thelwig's death, Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with \u00c6thelwig's successor Walter.

There are annotations in the manuscript by [[John Joscelyn]], who was secretary to [[Matthew Parker]] (d. 1575), the [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabethan]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], but whether Parker owned the manuscript is uncertain.<ref name=Cotton105>Tite ''Early Records of Sir Robert Cotton's Library'' p. 105</ref>{{efn|Parker was noted for keeping many of the manuscripts his staff annotated, but he did not keep all of them, as another Worcester Priory document, now [[Bodleian Library]] Junius 121 was also annotated by Parker himself, but remained at Worcester until the 17th century.<ref name=Graham327>Graham \"Matthew Parker's manuscripts\" ''Cambridge History of Libraries'' p. 327</ref>}} The manuscript thus became part of the Cotton library, which passed into public ownership in 1702 on the death of Cotton's grandson on the basis of an act of Parliament of 1701.<ref name=Panizzi33>Tite \"Development of the Manuscript Collection\" ''Manuscript Library'' p. 33</ref><ref name=BLCL>Staff \"History of the Cotton Library\" ''Help for Researchers''</ref> The manuscript itself is now part of the British Library's holdings.<ref name=BL>Staff \"Manuscript Description of Cotton Tiberius A.xii\" ''British Library Catalogue''</ref>\n\nThe manuscript was originally published in 1723 as ''Hemingi chartularium ecclesi\u00e6 Wigorniensis'', in two volumes edited by [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]].<ref name=DNB/> This was part of the ''Chronica Anglia'' series put out between 1709 and 1735, which included many chronicles and records in 20&nbsp;volumes.<ref name=Graves139>Graves ''Bibliography'' p. 139</ref> Hearne printed his edition from a transcription made for the antiquary [[Richard Graves]].<ref name=Tinti234/> This transcript, known as MS Rawlinson B.445, is not a completely accurate transcription of the Cotton Tiberius manuscript, as some items were omitted, and [[marginalia]] were not always transcribed.

'''LegCo''' is the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe legislature is a body comprising 70 members, 35 of whom are directly elected through five [[geographical constituencies]] (GCs) under the [[proportional representation system]] with [[largest remainder method]] and [[Hare quota]], while the other 35 are indirectly elected through interest-group-based [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]] (FCs) with limited electorates.<ref name=\"today\">{{cite

package]] passed in 2010, 5 of the 35 members elected from functional constituencies are from the [[District Council (Second)]] functional constituency, with candidates nominated by the [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Councillors]] and elected by territory-wide electorates.\n\nThe Legislative Council was first established in 1843 under the Charter of the [[British Hong Kong|British colony of Hong Kong]] as an advisory council to the [[Governor of Hong Kong|Governor]]. The powers and functions of the legislature expanded throughout its history.<ref name=\"Official History\"/> Today the main functions of the Legislative Council are to enact, amend or repeal laws; examine and approve budgets, taxation and public expenditure; and raise questions on the work of the government. In addition, the Legislative Council is also given the power to endorse the appointment and removal of the judges of the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] and the Chief Judge of the [[High Court of Hong Kong|High Court]], as well as the power to impeach the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]].<ref name=\"today\" /><ref name=\"Official History\" />\n\nBefore the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] in 1997, a [[Provisional Legislative Council]] (PLC) was unilaterally set up in Shenzhen by the Government of the People's Republic of China  as opposed to the [[1995 Hong Kong legislative election|1995 elected colonial legislature]]. The PLC moved to Hong Kong and replaced the legislature after the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] of 1997, until the [[1998 Hong Kong legislative election|next general election]] in 1998. Since 2000, the terms of the Legislative Council are four years.\n\nArticle 68 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] states the ultimate aim is the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by [[universal suffrage]]. This and a [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|similar article dealing with election of the Chief Executive]] have made universal suffrage for the council and the Chief Executive the dominant issue in Hong Kong politics.\n\n==History==\nThe Legislative Council of Hong Kong was set up in 1843 as a colonial legislature under British rule. Hong Kong's first constitution,<ref name=\"Official History\"/> in the form of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Letters Patent]] (see [[Hong Kong Letters Patent]]), issued on 27 June 1843 and titled the Charter of the Colony of Hong Kong, authorised the establishment of the Legislative Council to advise the [[Governor of Hong Kong]]'s administration. The council had four official members including the governor who was [[President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong|president of the council]] when it was first established. The letters patent of 1888, which replaced the 1843 charter, added the significant words \"and consent\" after the words \"with the advice\".<ref name=\"Official History\">{{cite web |title = History of the Legislature |website = Legislative Council |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/intro/hist_lc.htm |access-date=30 April 2013 }}</ref> The Legislative Council was initially set up as the advisory body to the governor, and for the most of the time, consisted half of official members, who were the government officials seating in the council, and half of [[Unofficial Member|unofficial members]] who were appointed by the governor.\n\nAfter the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] was signed on 19 December 1984 (in which the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the [[People's Republic of China]] on 1 July 1997), the Hong Kong government decided to start the process of democratisation based on the consultative document, ''[[Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong]]'' on 18 July 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/procedur/companion/chapter_3/chapter_3.html |title = A Companion to the history, rules and practices of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - Part I: An introduction to the Legislative Council, its history, organisation and procedure - Chapter 3 |work = Legislative Council Commission }}</ref> The first elections to the Council [[1985 Hong Kong legislative election|were held in 1985]], followed by the [[1991 Hong Kong legislative election|first direct elections of the Legislative Council]] held in 1991.

Therefore, it withdrew the previous so-called \"through-train\" policy that would have meant that members elected to the colonial Legislative Council would automatically become members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (\"HKSAR\") legislature. Instead, the Chinese government resolved to set up an alternative legislative council in preparation for the return of the sovereignty of Hong Kong from Britain to China. This body, the [[Provisional Legislative Council]], was established by the [[Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] (HKSAR) under the [[National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr97-98/english/est/estab.htm|title=Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region -  The Establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council|work=The Legislative Council Commission}}</ref> The Provisional Legislative Council, in operation from 25 January 1997 to 30 June 1998, initially held its meetings in [[Shenzhen]] until 30 June 1997.\n\nThe Legislative Council of the HKSAR was established on 1 October 1998 under [[Hong Kong Basic Law|The Basic Law of the HKSAR]]. The first meeting of the Council was held in July of the same year in Hong Kong. Since the Basic Law came into effect, five Legislative Council elections have been held, with the most recent election being held on [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|4 September 2016]].\n\nIn 2010, the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|government's constitutional reform proposal]] became the first and only constitutional move was passed by the Legislative Council in the SAR era with the support of the [[pro-democracy camp|pro-democracy]] [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] after the Chinese government accepted the modified package as presented by the party, which increased the composition of the Legislative Council from 60 to 70 seats; increasing five extra seats in the directly elected [[geographical constituencies]] and five new [[District Council (Second)]] [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituency]] seats which are nominated by the [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Councillors]] and elected by all registered electorates. The [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|most recent constitutional reform proposal]], which suggested the electoral method of the Legislative Council remained unchanged, was vetoed in 2015.\n\n==The Legislative Council Building==\n{{main|Legislative Council Complex}}\nThe first meetings of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, from 1844 to 1846, were likely convened in the residence of Governor Pottinger (later to be the French Mission Building), still standing at Government Hill. From 1848 to 1954 (interrupted by renovation in 1928-9 and the Japanese occupation in 1941-5), it was housed on the upper floor of the Colonial Secretariat Building, Lower Albert Road, replaced in 1957 by the Annex to the Central Government Offices Main Wing, on the same site.<ref name=\"Heritage Impact Assessment\">{{cite web|title=Heritage Impact Assessment|work=LWK Conservation Ltd|url=http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/159meeting/AAB%2040%202011-12%20%28Annex%20C%29.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031045705/http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/159meeting/AAB%2040%202011-12%20%28Annex%20C%29.pdf|archive-date=31 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1985, LegCo moved down to the nearby [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Old Supreme Court building]] in [[Central and Western District|Central Hong Kong]] where it remained until November 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/sec/library/0203in26e.pdf|title=The Legislative Council Building|work=Legislative Council Secretariat}}</ref> It took up residence in its present accommodation at the Legislative Block of the [[Central Government Complex, Tamar]] in December 2011.\n\nUnlike many other former and current Commonwealth legislatures, the Hong Kong Legislative Council does not have a [[ceremonial mace]] placed in its chambers. However, the high courts of Hong Kong use a mace to open sessions, and it represents the authority and powers of the court.\n\nTo provide a long-term solution to the space shortage problem facing both the Government and the Legislative Council, the Government commissioned the Tamar Development for the design and construction of the [[Central Government Complex, Tamar|Central Government Complex]], the [[Legislative Council Complex]] and other ancillary facilities in 2008. The Legislative Council Complex comprises a low block and a high block: the low block, which will be named the Council Block, mainly houses conference facilities including the Chamber, major conference rooms, and communal facilities such as library, cafeteria and education facilities. The range of education facilities for visit by the public includes video corner, visitors' sharing area, exhibition area, children's corner, viewing gallery and access corridors, memory lane, education activities rooms and education galleries. The high block, which will be named as the Office Block, mainly houses offices for members and staff of the Legislative Council Secretariat. Officially opened on 1 August 2011, administrative staff had already taken occupation on 15 January 2011.\n\n==Membership composition==\n{{See also|List of LegCo members elected in Hong Kong legislative election, 2016}}\nThe Legislative Council consists of 70 elected members. The term of office of a member is four years, except for the first term (1998 to 2000) when it was set to be two years (Article 69 of The Basic Law).\n\nIn both the 2008 and 2004 elections, 30 members were directly elected by [[universal suffrage]] from geographical constituencies (GCs) and 30 were elected from functional constituencies (FCs). In the 2000 election, 24 were directly elected, six elected from an 800-member [[electoral college]] known as the [[Election Committee of Hong Kong]], and 30 elected from FCs. Since the 2004 election, all the seats are equally divided between geographical and functional constituencies.\n\nAccording to The [[Basic Law]], while the method for forming the Legislative Council shall be specified in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress, the ultimate aim is to elect all Council members by [[universal suffrage]] ([[Article 68 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong|Article 68 of The Basic Law of Hong Kong]]).\n\n===Geographical constituencies===\nThe GC seats are returned by [[universal suffrage]]. The voting system adopted in the electoral districts is a system of [[party-list proportional representation]], with seats allocated by the [[largest remainder method]] using the [[Hare quota]] as the quota for election.\n\nThe party-list proportional representation system is the most widely used form of proportional representation systems to facilitate the formation of a representative legislature.

The Letters Patent of 1917 changed such practice by requiring the Governor to act \"with advice and consent\" of the Legislative Council.\n\nUnder the Basic Law (Article 72), the President has the powers and functions to preside over meetings, decide on the agenda, including giving priority to government bills for inclusion in the agenda, decide on the time of meetings, call special sessions during the recess, call emergency sessions on the request of the Chief Executive, and exercise other powers and functions as prescribed in the rules of procedure of the Legislative Council. However, the president of the legislative council may not vote in most situations regarding government bills, and is encouraged to remain impartial towards all matters in the LegCo. The President of the Legislative Council has to meet the eligibility requirements set out in the Basic Law that he or she shall be a Chinese citizen of not less than 40 years of age, who is a permanent resident of the HKSAR with no right of abode in any foreign country and has ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=President of the Legislative Council|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/members/president.html|work=The Legislative Council Commission}}</ref>\n\nThe President is elected by and from among Council members. The first President (1997\u20132008) was [[Rita Fan]]; the incumbent President, elected in 2016, is [[Andrew Leung]] of the pro-Beijing [[Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong]].\n\n===Primacy of President===\nIn a controversial move directed at reining in democratic legislators (most of whom were elected by universal suffrage and six of whose seats had been vacated by a controversial court order of disqualification), amendments to the Rules of Procedure were passed on 15 December 2017 giving sweeping powers to the President to control the business of the legislature.  Among them is the power to vet proposed motions and amendments to bills, require legislators to explain them and to reject or merge them.  Prior notice must be given of any notice of motion and the President may reconvene the chamber immediately after any failure to meet quorum.<ref name=\"Changes\">{{cite news|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|date=15 December 2017|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/12/15/legislature-passes-controversial-house-rule-amendments-taking-powers-lawmakers/|title=Hong Kong legislature passes controversial house rule changes taking powers from lawmakers|last=Cheng|first=Kris|access-date=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Procedure==\nThe quorum for meetings of the Council is 20, i.e. only 28 per cent of membership, having been reduced from 35 on 15 December 2017.<ref name=\"Changes\" />\n\nPassing of government bills requires only a simple majority whereas private members' bills and motions have to be passed by [[majorities]] of members in both the geographical and functional constituencies independently, entrenching pro-Beijing interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/english/education/files/Factsheet/Factsheet7.pdf|title=HOW LAWS ARE MADE|work=Legislative Council of Hong Kong}}</ref>  After the 15 December 2017 amendments to procedure, the setting up of investigative committees requires 35 signatures of members, effectively blocking democrat-sponsored scrutiny of government action.<ref name=\"Changes\" />\n\nAmendments to the Basic Law require a [[two-thirds vote]] in the Legislative Council, without a specific requirement in each group of constituencies.

Additional support later came from other administrative units, i.e. the Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils (UMELCO) Secretariat and its variants, in consideration of the gradually rising volume of work in Council business.\n\nWith the establishment of UMELCO in 1963, public officers were seconded to UMELCO to assist members to deal with public complaints and build up public relations with the local community. During their secondments, public officers took instructions only from Council members. The practice remained when the [[The Office of the Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils|Office of the Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils]] (OMELCO) replaced UMELCO in 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr98-99/english/hc/sub_com/redress/papers/cp166e03.pdf |title=Possible duplication of work of the LegCo Redress System with the work of The Office of The Ombudsman |website=Legislative Council of Hong Kong}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the OMELCO Secretariat was incorporated. As a result of the complete separation of membership of the Executive and Legislative Councils, OMELCO was renamed the Office of Members of Legislative Council (OMLEGCO).\n\nThe Legislative Council Commission, a statutory body independent of the Government, was established under The Legislative Council Commission Ordinance on 1 April 1994. The Commission integrated the administrative support and services to the Council by the Office of the Clerk to the Legislative Council and the OMLEGCO Secretariat into an independent Legislative Council Secretariat. The Commission replaced all civil servants by contract staff in the 1994\u20131995 session.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/lcc/lcc_0812.htm |title = The Legislative

'''LegCo''' is the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe legislature is a body comprising 70 members, 35 of whom are directly elected through five [[geographical constituencies]] (GCs) under the [[proportional representation system]] with [[largest remainder method]] and [[Hare quota]], while the other 35 are indirectly elected through interest-group-based [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]] (FCs) with limited electorates.<ref name=\"today\">{{cite

Councils of Hong Kong|District Councillors]] and elected by territory-wide electorates.\n\nThe Legislative Council was first established in 1843 under the Charter of the [[British Hong Kong|British colony of Hong Kong]] as an advisory council to the [[Governor of Hong Kong|Governor]]. The powers and functions of the legislature expanded throughout its history.<ref name=\"Official History\"/> Today the main functions of the Legislative Council are to enact, amend or repeal laws; examine and approve budgets, taxation and public expenditure; and raise questions on the work of the government. In addition, the Legislative Council is also given the power to endorse the appointment and removal of the judges of the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] and the Chief Judge of the [[High Court of Hong Kong|High Court]], as well as the power to impeach the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]].<ref name=\"today\" /><ref name=\"Official History\" />\n\nBefore the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] in 1997, a [[Provisional Legislative Council]] (PLC) was unilaterally set up in Shenzhen by the Government of the People's Republic of China  as opposed to the [[1995 Hong Kong legislative election|1995 elected colonial legislature]]. The PLC moved to Hong Kong and replaced the legislature after the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] of 1997, until the [[1998 Hong Kong legislative election|next general election]] in 1998. Since 2000, the terms of the Legislative Council are four years.\n\nArticle 68 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] states the ultimate aim is the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by [[universal suffrage]]. This and a [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|similar article dealing with election of the Chief Executive]] have made universal suffrage for the council and the Chief Executive the dominant issue in Hong Kong politics.\n\n==History==\nThe Legislative Council of Hong Kong was set up in 1843 as a colonial legislature under British rule. Hong Kong's first constitution,<ref name=\"Official History\"/> in the form of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Letters Patent]] (see [[Hong Kong Letters Patent]]), issued on 27 June 1843 and titled the Charter of the Colony of Hong Kong, authorised the establishment of the Legislative Council to advise the [[Governor of Hong Kong]]'s administration. The council had four official members including the governor who was [[President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong|president of the council]] when it was first established. The letters patent of 1888, which replaced the 1843 charter, added the significant words \"and consent\" after the words \"with the advice\".<ref name=\"Official History\">{{cite web |title = History of the Legislature |website = Legislative Council |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/intro/hist_lc.htm |access-date=30 April 2013 }}</ref> The Legislative Council was initially set up as the advisory body to the governor, and for the most of the time, consisted half of official members, who were the government officials seating in the council, and half of [[Unofficial Member|unofficial members]] who were appointed by the governor.\n\nAfter the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]] was signed on 19 December 1984 (in which the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the [[People's Republic of China]] on 1 July 1997), the Hong Kong government decided to start the process of democratisation based on the consultative document, ''[[Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong]]'' on 18 July 1984.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/procedur/companion/chapter_3/chapter_3.html |title = A Companion to the history, rules and practices of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - Part I: An introduction to the Legislative Council, its history, organisation and procedure - Chapter 3 |work = Legislative Council Commission }}</ref> The first elections to the Council [[1985 Hong Kong legislative election|were held in 1985]], followed by the [[1991 Hong Kong legislative election|first direct elections of the Legislative Council]] held in 1991.

Therefore, it withdrew the previous so-called \"through-train\" policy that would have meant that members elected to the colonial Legislative Council would automatically become members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (\"HKSAR\") legislature. Instead, the Chinese government resolved to set up an alternative legislative council in preparation for the return of the sovereignty of Hong Kong from Britain to China. This body, the [[Provisional Legislative Council]], was established by the [[Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] (HKSAR) under the [[National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr97-98/english/est/estab.htm|title=Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region -  The Establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council|work=The Legislative Council Commission}}</ref> The Provisional Legislative Council, in operation from 25 January 1997 to 30 June 1998, initially held its meetings in [[Shenzhen]] until 30 June 1997.\n\nThe Legislative Council of the HKSAR was established on 1 October 1998 under [[Hong Kong Basic Law|The Basic Law of the HKSAR]]. The first meeting of the Council was held in July of the same year in Hong Kong. Since the Basic Law came into effect, five Legislative Council elections have been held, with the most recent election being held on [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|4 September 2016]].\n\nIn 2010, the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|government's constitutional reform proposal]] became the first and only constitutional move was passed by the Legislative Council in the SAR era with the support of the [[pro-democracy camp|pro-democracy]] [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] after the Chinese government accepted the modified package as presented by the party, which increased the composition of the Legislative Council from 60 to 70 seats; increasing five extra seats in the directly elected [[geographical constituencies]] and five new [[District Council (Second)]] [[functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituency]] seats which are nominated by the [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Councillors]] and elected by all registered electorates. The [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|most recent constitutional reform proposal]], which suggested the electoral method of the Legislative Council remained unchanged, was vetoed in 2015.\n\n==The Legislative Council Building==\n{{main|Legislative Council Complex}}\nThe first meetings of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, from 1844 to 1846, were likely convened in the residence of Governor Pottinger (later to be the French Mission Building), still standing at Government Hill. From 1848 to 1954 (interrupted by renovation in 1928-9 and the Japanese occupation in 1941-5), it was housed on the upper floor of the Colonial Secretariat Building, Lower Albert Road, replaced in 1957 by the Annex to the Central Government Offices Main Wing, on the same site.<ref name=\"Heritage Impact Assessment\">{{cite web|title=Heritage Impact Assessment|work=LWK Conservation Ltd|url=http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/159meeting/AAB%2040%202011-12%20%28Annex%20C%29.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031045705/http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/159meeting/AAB%2040%202011-12%20%28Annex%20C%29.pdf|archive-date=31 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1985, LegCo moved down to the nearby [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Old Supreme Court building]] in [[Central and Western District|Central Hong Kong]] where it remained until November 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/sec/library/0203in26e.pdf|title=The Legislative Council Building|work=Legislative Council Secretariat}}</ref> It took up residence in its present accommodation at the Legislative Block of the [[Central Government Complex, Tamar]] in December 2011.\n\nUnlike many other former and current Commonwealth legislatures, the Hong Kong Legislative Council does not have a [[ceremonial mace]] placed in its chambers. However, the high courts of Hong Kong use a mace to open sessions, and it represents the authority and powers of the court.\n\nTo provide a long-term solution to the space shortage problem facing both the Government and the Legislative Council, the Government commissioned the Tamar Development for the design and construction of the [[Central Government Complex, Tamar|Central Government Complex]], the [[Legislative Council Complex]] and other ancillary facilities in 2008. The Legislative Council Complex comprises a low block and a high block: the low block, which will be named the Council Block, mainly houses conference facilities including the Chamber, major conference rooms, and communal facilities such as library, cafeteria and education facilities. The range of education facilities for visit by the public includes video corner, visitors' sharing area, exhibition area, children's corner, viewing gallery and access corridors, memory lane, education activities rooms and education galleries. The high block, which will be named as the Office Block, mainly houses offices for members and staff of the Legislative Council Secretariat. Officially opened on 1 August 2011, administrative staff had already taken occupation on 15 January 2011.\n\n==Membership composition==\n{{See also|List of LegCo members elected in Hong Kong legislative election, 2016}}\nThe Legislative Council consists of 70 elected members. The term of office of a member is four years, except for the first term (1998 to 2000) when it was set to be two years (Article 69 of The Basic Law).\n\nIn both the 2008 and 2004 elections, 30 members were directly elected by [[universal suffrage]] from geographical constituencies (GCs) and 30 were elected from functional constituencies (FCs). In the 2000 election, 24 were directly elected, six elected from an 800-member [[electoral college]] known as the [[Election Committee of Hong Kong]], and 30 elected from FCs. Since the 2004 election, all the seats are equally divided between geographical and functional constituencies.\n\nAccording to The [[Basic Law]], while the method for forming the Legislative Council shall be specified in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress, the ultimate aim is to elect all Council members by [[universal suffrage]] ([[Article 68 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong|Article 68 of The Basic Law of Hong Kong]]).\n\n===Geographical constituencies===\nThe GC seats are returned by [[universal suffrage]]. The voting system adopted in the electoral districts is a system of [[party-list proportional representation]], with seats allocated by the [[largest remainder method]] using the [[Hare quota]] as the quota for election.\n\nThe party-list proportional representation system is the most widely used form of proportional representation systems to facilitate the formation of a representative legislature.

The Letters Patent of 1917 changed such practice by requiring the Governor to act \"with advice and consent\" of the Legislative Council.\n\nUnder the Basic Law (Article 72), the President has the powers and functions to preside over meetings, decide on the agenda, including giving priority to government bills for inclusion in the agenda, decide on the time of meetings, call special sessions during the recess, call emergency sessions on the request of the Chief Executive, and exercise other powers and functions as prescribed in the rules of procedure of the Legislative Council. However, the president of the legislative council may not vote in most situations regarding government bills, and is encouraged to remain impartial towards all matters in the LegCo. The President of the Legislative Council has to meet the eligibility requirements set out in the Basic Law that he or she shall be a Chinese citizen of not less than 40 years of age, who is a permanent resident of the HKSAR with no right of abode in any foreign country and has ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=President of the Legislative Council|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/members/president.html|work=The Legislative Council Commission}}</ref>\n\nThe President is elected by and from among Council members.

[[Neuroendocrine cells]] in the hypothalamus project [[axons]] to the [[median eminence]], at the base of the brain. At this site, these cells can release substances into small blood vessels that travel directly to the anterior pituitary gland (the [[Hypophyseal portal system|hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal vessels]]).\n:;Other Control Mechanisms\nAside from hypothalamic control of the anterior pituitary, other systems in the body have been shown to regulate the anterior pituitary\u2019s function. [[GABA]] can either stimulate or inhibit the secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[growth hormone]] (GH) and can stimulate the secretion of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH). [[Prostaglandin]]s are now known to inhibit [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and also to stimulate TSH, GH and LH release.<ref>Hedge, G.A. (1977) Roles for the prostaglandins in the regulation of anterior pituitary secretion. Life Sci. Jan 1;20(1):17-33.</ref> GABA, through action with the hypothalamus, has been shown experimentally to influence the level of GH secretion. Clinical evidence supports the experimental findings of the excitatory and inhibitory effects GABA has on [[Growth hormone|GH]] secretion, dependent on GABA\u2019s site of action within the hypothalamic-pituitary unit.<ref>Racagni, G; Apud, J.A; Cocchi, D; Locatelli, V; Muller, E.E.

Increased plasma levels of [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] induce [[hyperthermia]] through a mechanism involving increased [[metabolism]] and [[cutaneous]] [[vasodilation]]. Increased levels of [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] also result in [[hypothermia]] but through a decreased metabolism action. [[ACTH]] increase metabolism and induce cutaneous vasoconstriction, increased plasma levels also result in [[hyperthermia]] and  [[prolactin]] decreases with decreasing temperature values. [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) also may cause [[hypothermia]] if increased beyond homeostatic levels through an increased metabolic mechanism only.<ref>Lin, M.T; Ho, L.T; and Uang, W.N.

The anterior wall of Rathke's pouch proliferates, filling most of the pouch to form the pars distalis and the pars tuberalis. The posterior wall of the anterior pituitary forms the pars intermedia. Its formation from the soft tissues of the upper palate contrasts with the posterior pituitary, which originates from [[neuroectoderm]].<ref name=\"Nelson, R. J. 2011\">Nelson, R. J.

[[Neuroendocrine cells]] in the hypothalamus project [[axons]] to the [[median eminence]], at the base of the brain. At this site, these cells can release substances into small blood vessels that travel directly to the anterior pituitary gland (the [[Hypophyseal portal system|hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal vessels]]).\n:;Other Control Mechanisms\nAside from hypothalamic control of the anterior pituitary, other systems in the body have been shown to regulate the anterior pituitary\u2019s function. [[GABA]] can either stimulate or inhibit the secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[growth hormone]] (GH) and can stimulate the secretion of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH). [[Prostaglandin]]s are now known to inhibit [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and also to stimulate TSH, GH and LH release.<ref>Hedge, G.A. (1977) Roles for the prostaglandins in the regulation of anterior pituitary secretion. Life Sci. Jan 1;20(1):17-33.</ref> GABA, through action with the hypothalamus, has been shown experimentally to influence the level of GH secretion. Clinical evidence supports the experimental findings of the excitatory and inhibitory effects GABA has on [[Growth hormone|GH]] secretion, dependent on GABA\u2019s site of action within the hypothalamic-pituitary unit.<ref>Racagni, G; Apud, J.A; Cocchi, D; Locatelli, V; Muller, E.E.

Increased plasma levels of [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] induce [[hyperthermia]] through a mechanism involving increased [[metabolism]] and [[cutaneous]] [[vasodilation]]. Increased levels of [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] also result in [[hypothermia]] but through a decreased metabolism action. [[ACTH]] increase metabolism and induce cutaneous vasoconstriction, increased plasma levels also result in [[hyperthermia]] and  [[prolactin]] decreases with decreasing temperature values. [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) also may cause [[hypothermia]] if increased beyond homeostatic levels through an increased metabolic mechanism only.<ref>Lin, M.T; Ho, L.T; and Uang, W.N.

The reason for this is that the graphics are bypassing the normal screen and going to a high-speed graphics processor on the [[graphics card]] by using a method called [[hardware overlay]]. Generally, there is no way to extract a computed image back out of the graphics card,{{citation needed|reason=Opengl provides a way to read the buffer. This is also not a problem for non-windows systems, so generally, this cannot be true|date=April 2013}} though software may exist for special cases or specific video cards.\n\nOne way these images can be captured is to turn off the hardware overlay. Because many computers have no hardware overlay, most programs are built to work without it, just a little slower. In Windows XP, this is disabled by opening the Display Properties menu, clicking on the \"Settings\" tab, clicking, \"Advanced\", \"Troubleshoot\", and moving the Hardware Acceleration Slider to \"None.\"\n\n[[Free software]] media players may also use the overlay but often have a setting to avoid it or have dedicated screenshot functions.\n\n===Screen recording===\n{{main|Screencast}}\n\nThe screen recording capability of some screen capture programs is a time-saving way to create instructions and presentations, but the resulting files are often large.\n\nA common problem with video recordings is the action jumps, instead of flowing smoothly, due to low [[frame rate]]. Though getting faster all the time, ordinary PCs are not yet fast enough to play videos and simultaneously capture them at professional frame rates, ''i.e.'' 30 frame/s. For many cases, high frame rates are needed for a pleasant experience.\n\n==Copyright issues==\n\nSome companies believe the use of screenshots is an [[Copyright infringement|infringement of copyright]] on their program, as it is a [[derivative work]] of the [[GUI widget|widgets]] and other art created for the software.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Screen Shots (Excluding Xbox)\n| work = Use of Microsoft Copyrighted Content\n| accessdate = 2007-08-22\n| url = http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/permissions//default.mspx#E3C\n}}http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ph/windows/take-screen-capture-print-screen</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Question: What are screenshots, and is using them copyright infringement?\n| work = FAQ about Copyright -- [[Chilling Effects (group)|Chilling Effects]] Clearinghouse\n| accessdate = 2007-08-22\n| url = http://www.chillingeffects.org/copyright/faq.cgi#QID809\n}}</ref> Regardless of copyright, screenshots may still be legally used under the principle of [[fair use]] in the U.S. or [[fair dealing]] and similar laws in other countries.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Copyright in screenshots?

Windows 7 and later also include Problem Step Recorder as part of their troubleshooting platforms that once started, automatically captures a screenshot at mouse clicks.<ref>{{cite web|title=How do I use Problem Steps Recorder?|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-use-Problem-Steps-Recorder|work=Windows Help|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere are exceptions to what can be captured by this method.

The reason for this is that the graphics are bypassing the normal screen and going to a high-speed graphics processor on the [[graphics card]] by using a method called [[hardware overlay]]. Generally, there is no way to extract a computed image back out of the graphics card,{{citation needed|reason=Opengl provides a way to read the buffer. This is also not a problem for non-windows systems, so generally, this cannot be true|date=April 2013}} though software may exist for special cases or specific video cards.\n\nOne way these images can be captured is to turn off the hardware overlay. Because many computers have no hardware overlay, most programs are built to work without it, just a little slower. In Windows XP, this is disabled by opening the Display Properties menu, clicking on the \"Settings\" tab, clicking, \"Advanced\", \"Troubleshoot\", and moving the Hardware Acceleration Slider to \"None.\"\n\n[[Free software]] media players may also use the overlay but often have a setting to avoid it or have dedicated screenshot functions.\n\n===Screen recording===\n{{main|Screencast}}\n\nThe screen recording capability of some screen capture programs is a time-saving way to create instructions and presentations, but the resulting files are often large.\n\nA common problem with video recordings is the action jumps, instead of flowing smoothly, due to low [[frame rate]]. Though getting faster all the time, ordinary PCs are not yet fast enough to play videos and simultaneously capture them at professional frame rates, ''i.e.'' 30 frame/s. For many cases, high frame rates are needed for a pleasant experience.\n\n==Copyright issues==\n\nSome companies believe the use of screenshots is an [[Copyright infringement|infringement of copyright]] on their program, as it is a [[derivative work]] of the [[GUI widget|widgets]] and other art created for the software.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Screen Shots (Excluding Xbox)\n| work = Use of Microsoft Copyrighted Content\n| accessdate = 2007-08-22\n| url = http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/permissions//default.mspx#E3C\n}}http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ph/windows/take-screen-capture-print-screen</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Question: What are screenshots, and is using them copyright infringement?\n| work = FAQ about Copyright -- [[Chilling Effects (group)|Chilling Effects]] Clearinghouse\n| accessdate = 2007-08-22\n| url = http://www.chillingeffects.org/copyright/faq.cgi#QID809\n}}</ref> Regardless of copyright, screenshots may still be legally used under the principle of [[fair use]] in the U.S. or [[fair dealing]] and similar laws in other countries.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Copyright in screenshots?

She served 12 years in Swatantra Party, during which time she was a prominent critic of [[Indira Gandhi]]'s government. After her departure from politics, she lived a quiet life in her large estate, spending time with her grandchildren and on hobbies and leisure.\n\nShe died on 29 July 2009 in Jaipur, at the age of 90.

She also owned several Rolls-Royces and an aircraft. Gayatri Devi had one child, [[Prince Jagat Singh]] of Jaipur, late Raja of Isarda, born on 15 October 1949, who was granted his uncle's fief as a subsidiary title.

In 1967 the Swatantra party joined hands with Jan Sangh that was led by [[Bhairon Singh Shekhawat]]. The alliance won a large number of seats in the 1967 election. In the assembly election Gayatri Devi lost to Damodar Lal Vyas, in [[Malpura]] constituency, but won the Lok Sabha election.\n\nThe privy purses were abolished in 1971, terminating all royal privileges and titles.

She was also the focus of the film ''Memoirs of a Hindu Princess'', directed by Francois Levie.\n\nThere were rumours that she might re-enter politics as late as 1999, when the Cooch Behar [[Trinamool Congress]] nominated her as their candidate for the Lok Sabha elections, but she did not respond to the offer.<ref>Gayatri Devi may contest polls from Cooch Behar, ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'', 12 June 1999.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nShe had one son, Prince Jagat Singh, Raja of Isarda (15 October 1949 \u2013 5 February 1997), who was granted his paternal uncle's (father's elder brother) fief of Isarda as a subsidiary title. Jagat Singh was married on 10 May 1978 to [[Mom Rajawongse]] Priyanandana Rangsit (b. 1952), daughter of Prince Piyarangsit Rangsit and Princess [[Vibhavadi Rangsit]] (n\u00e9e Rajani) of Thailand. The marriage produced two children:\n* Rajkumari Lalitya Kumari (b. 1979)\n* Maharaj Devraj Singh, Raja of Isarda (b. 1981)\nToday, they are her only surviving descendants, and as such, have claimed to be heirs of their paternal grandmother.\nMaharaj Jagat Singh was thus half-brother to [[Bhawani Singh of Jaipur]], the eldest son of the late Maharaja by his first wife, a Jodhpur princess.\n\n===Family relationships===\n[[File:Cecil Beaton Photographs- Political and Military Personalities IB698.jpg|thumb|200px|Gayatri Devi pictured by [[Cecil Beaton]] in 1940.]]\nMaharani Gayatri Devi was related to several other erstwhile royal families in India. She was herself not from the Rajput community, but from a dynasty native to Cooch Behar in Bengal and was daughter of [[Jitendra Narayan|Maharaja Jitendra Narayan]] and [[Indira Devi|Maharani Indira Raje]], who was daughter of [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] and [[Maharani Chimnabai]] belonging to the [[Gaekwad]] dynasty of the [[Marathas]]. Her grand-nephew, along with his wife (Poonam Singh Mewar) and 2 sons died in a car crash.\n\nHer grandparents were the Maharaja [[Nripendra Narayan|Nripendra Narayan Bhup Bahadur]] and Maharani [[Suniti Devi]] of Cooch Behar.  Maharani Suniti Devi was the daughter of the [[Brahmo Samaj|Brahmo]] social reformer [[Keshab Chandra Sen]].\n\nShe had two brothers, [[Jagaddipendra Narayan]] and Indrajitendra Narayan of whom Jagaddipendra Narayan became Maharaja of Cooch Behar in his infancy after the death of their father in 1922.\n\nThus she was closely connected maternally with [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] of [[Baroda State]]. Further, her sister Ila Devi was married into the [[Tripura (princely state)|Tripura]] royal family, and her younger sister Menaka Devi was married in [[Dewas State|Dewas Jr.]] State. Thus through various interconnections, she was related to the royal houses of [[Kota State|Kota]], [[Sawantwadi State|Sawantwadi]], [[Akkalkot State]], [[Jath State]], Dewas Jr., [[Jasdan State]], and [[Sandur (princely state)|Sandur]], [[Tehri-Garhwal]], [[Mayurbhanj]], [[Dhar State]], [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]], [[Lunawada State]], [[Baria State|Baria]] and Raja of [[Payagpur]], which was normal amongst the royalties of India.\n\n== Polo sport ==\nGayatri Devi is known for her equestrian skills and polo-playing abilities. She was associated with Polo since childhood. In 1933, she participated in her first Polo match in [[Calcutta Polo Club|Calcutta]]. She was the chief patron of Jaipur Riding and Polo Club during her later years. After her death in 2009, she and her quintessential polo skills were honoured by \"Rajmata Gayatri Devi Memorial Cup\" sponsored by [[Rambagh Palace]] and \"Maharani Polo Club\", which is celebrated every year in [[Argentine Polo Association|Argentina]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Death==\nShe developed gastric problems in Tihar jail during the infamous [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] imposed by Congress Party led by then PM Indira Gandhi. Later her gastric problem grew worse and so she was admitted to King Edward's Hospital in London. She was being treated for the gastric disorder there and had expressed her desire to return to Jaipur. Gayatri Devi was flown in an [[air ambulance]] to Jaipur. She was admitted at [[Santokba Durlabhji Memorial hospital]] (SDMH) on 17 July 2009. She died at the age of 90 on 29 July 2009, reportedly due to lung failure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/PoliticsNation/Gayatri-Devi-is-dead/articleshow/4834131.cms|title=Gayatri Devi, former Jaipur queen, is dead|accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Gayatri-Devi-A-maharani-and-a-beauty/articleshow/4834040.cms|title=Gayatri Devi: A maharani and a beauty &#124; India News - Times of India|website=The Times of India|accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Titles==\nGayatri Devi held the following titles:\n\n'''1919&ndash;1940''': ''Her Highness Princess Gayatri Devi of Cooch Behar'' <br>\n'''1940&ndash;1949''': ''Her Highness The Maharani of Jaipur'' <br>\n'''1949&ndash;1970''': ''Her Highness Maharani Gayatri Devi'' <br>\n'''1970&ndash;2009''': ''Her Highness Rajmata of Jaipur''\n\n== Filmography ==\n* [[Stephane Bern]].

Gayatri Devi was also celebrated for her [[classical beauty]] and became something of a fashion icon in her adulthood. She served 12 years in Swatantra Party, during which time she was a prominent critic of [[Indira Gandhi]]'s government. After her departure from politics, she lived a quiet life in her large estate, spending time with her grandchildren and on hobbies and leisure.\n\nShe died on 29 July 2009 in Jaipur, at the age of 90. She was suffering from [[Ileus#Paralytic ileus|paralytic ileus]] and a lung infection. She left an estate estimated at nearly half a billion USD, which were passed on to her grandchildren.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/a-battle-of-wills-gayatri-devis-pound250m-legacy-1790048.html|title=A battle of wills: Gayatri Devi's \u00a3250m legacy|date=19 September 2009|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=3 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:GayetriDevini\u00f1a.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gayatri Devi as a child]]\nEthnically born in a [[Koch Rajbongshi people|Koch Rajbongshi]] Hindu family, her father, Prince Jitendra Narayan of [[Cooch Behar]], presently in [[West Bengal]], was the younger brother of the [[Yuvaraja]] (Crown Prince). Her mother was Maratha Princess [[Indira of Baroda|Indira Raje]] of [[Baroda]], the only daughter of [[Maratha]] King, [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III]], an extremely beautiful princess and a legendary socialite. Early in her life, her uncle's death led to her father ascending the throne (gaddi).

Sir [[Sawai Man Singh II]] of Jaipur), when she was 12 and he had come to Calcutta to play polo and stayed with their family.<ref>{{cite web |title='I Had Shot My First Panther Before I Turned Thirteen': Gayatri Devi turned 13 in 1932 |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?238724 |date=20 October 2008|publisher=[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]] }}</ref> She married Sawai Man Singh II Bahadur on 9 May 1940.<ref name=k/>\n\nMaharani Gayatri Devi was a particularly avid [[Equestrianism|equestrienne]]. She was an excellent rider and an able Polo player. She was a good shot and enjoyed many days out on 'Shikars'. Her Highness was fond of cars and is credited with importing the first [[Mercedes-Benz W126]], a 500 SEL to India which was later shipped to Malaysia. She also owned several Rolls-Royces and an aircraft. Gayatri Devi had one child, [[Prince Jagat Singh]] of Jaipur, late Raja of Isarda, born on 15 October 1949, who was granted his uncle's fief as a subsidiary title. Jagat Singh was the half-brother to [[Bhawani Singh]], who was the eldest son of his father born by his father's first wife.<ref name=k/>\n\nRajmata saheb was once included in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine's Ten Most Beautiful Women list.<ref name=\"sahwney2004\">Sahwney, Anubha (2004) I've never felt beautiful: Gayatri Devi.

Rajagopalachari]],<ref name=\"elec\" /> running against the [[Indian National Congress]] party.\n\nIn 1965, during a meeting with Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]], Gayatri Devi was again asked to join Congress. This was the time when, despite the fact that her husband was being made ambassador to [[Spain]], she stuck to her principles and decided not to join the party. In 1967 the Swatantra party joined hands with Jan Sangh that was led by [[Bhairon Singh Shekhawat]]. The alliance won a large number of seats in the 1967 election. In the assembly election Gayatri Devi lost to Damodar Lal Vyas, in [[Malpura]] constituency, but won the Lok Sabha election.\n\nThe privy purses were abolished in 1971, terminating all royal privileges and titles. Gayatri Devi was arrested during the [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] due to an alleged political vendetta on the false accusation of violating tax laws, and served 5 months in [[Tihar Jail]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Last Maharani of Gwalior: An Autobiography By Manohar Malgonkar|date=1987|pages=233, 242\u2013244|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sbNaTBhe5nUC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=bhawani+singh+arrested+Emergency#v=onepage&q=Gayatri%20Devi&f=false|isbn=9780887066597|last1=Malgonkar|first1=Manohar}}</ref> She retired from politics and published her biography, ''A Princess Remembers'', written by Santha Rama Rau, in 1976. She was also the focus of the film ''Memoirs of a Hindu Princess'', directed by Francois Levie.\n\nThere were rumours that she might re-enter politics as late as 1999, when the Cooch Behar [[Trinamool Congress]] nominated her as their candidate for the Lok Sabha elections, but she did not respond to the offer.<ref>Gayatri Devi may contest polls from Cooch Behar, ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'',  12 June 1999.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nShe had one son, Prince Jagat Singh, Raja of Isarda (15 October 1949 \u2013 5 February 1997), who was granted his paternal uncle's (father's elder brother) fief of Isarda as a subsidiary title. Jagat Singh was married on 10 May 1978 to [[Mom Rajawongse]] Priyanandana Rangsit (b. 1952), daughter of Prince Piyarangsit Rangsit and Princess [[Vibhavadi Rangsit]] (n\u00e9e Rajani) of Thailand. The marriage produced two children:\n* Rajkumari Lalitya Kumari (b. 1979)\n* Maharaj Devraj Singh, Raja of Isarda (b. 1981)\nToday, they are her only surviving descendants, and as such, have claimed to be heirs of their paternal grandmother.\nMaharaj Jagat Singh was thus half-brother to [[Bhawani Singh of Jaipur]], the eldest son of the late Maharaja by his first wife, a Jodhpur princess.\n\n===Family relationships===\n[[File:Cecil Beaton Photographs- Political and Military Personalities IB698.jpg|thumb|200px|Gayatri Devi pictured by [[Cecil Beaton]] in 1940.]]\nMaharani Gayatri Devi was related to several other erstwhile royal families in India. She was herself not from the Rajput community, but from a dynasty native to Cooch Behar in Bengal and was daughter of [[Jitendra Narayan|Maharaja Jitendra Narayan]] and [[Indira Devi|Maharani Indira Raje]], who was daughter of [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] and [[Maharani Chimnabai]] belonging to the [[Gaekwad]] dynasty of the [[Marathas]]. Her grand-nephew, along with his wife (Poonam Singh Mewar) and 2 sons died in a car crash.\n\nHer grandparents were the Maharaja [[Nripendra Narayan|Nripendra Narayan Bhup Bahadur]] and Maharani [[Suniti Devi]] of Cooch Behar.  Maharani Suniti Devi was the daughter of the [[Brahmo Samaj|Brahmo]] social reformer [[Keshab Chandra Sen]].\n\nShe had two brothers, [[Jagaddipendra Narayan]] and Indrajitendra Narayan of whom Jagaddipendra Narayan became Maharaja of Cooch Behar in his infancy after the death of their father in 1922.\n\nThus she was closely connected maternally with [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] of [[Baroda State]]. Further, her sister Ila Devi was married into the [[Tripura (princely state)|Tripura]] royal family, and her younger sister Menaka Devi was married in [[Dewas State|Dewas Jr.]] State. Thus through various interconnections, she was related to the royal houses of [[Kota State|Kota]], [[Sawantwadi State|Sawantwadi]], [[Akkalkot State]], [[Jath State]], Dewas Jr., [[Jasdan State]], and [[Sandur (princely state)|Sandur]], [[Tehri-Garhwal]], [[Mayurbhanj]], [[Dhar State]], [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]], [[Lunawada State]], [[Baria State|Baria]] and Raja of [[Payagpur]], which was normal amongst the royalties of India.\n\n== Polo sport ==\nGayatri Devi is known for her equestrian skills and polo-playing abilities. She was associated with Polo since childhood. In 1933, she participated in her first Polo match in [[Calcutta Polo Club|Calcutta]]. She was the chief patron of Jaipur Riding and Polo Club during her later years. After her death in 2009, she and her quintessential polo skills were honoured by \"Rajmata Gayatri Devi Memorial Cup\" sponsored by [[Rambagh Palace]] and \"Maharani Polo Club\", which is celebrated every year in [[Argentine Polo Association|Argentina]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Death==\nShe developed gastric problems in Tihar jail during the infamous [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] imposed by Congress Party led by then PM Indira Gandhi. Later her gastric problem grew worse and so she was admitted to King Edward's Hospital in London. She was being treated for the gastric disorder there and had expressed her desire to return to Jaipur. Gayatri Devi was flown in an [[air ambulance]] to Jaipur. She was admitted at [[Santokba Durlabhji Memorial hospital|Santokba Durlabhji Memorial Hospital]] (SDMH) on 17 July 2009. She died at the age of 90 on 29 July 2009, reportedly due to lung failure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/PoliticsNation/Gayatri-Devi-is-dead/articleshow/4834131.cms|title=Gayatri Devi, former Jaipur queen, is dead|accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Gayatri-Devi-A-maharani-and-a-beauty/articleshow/4834040.cms|title=Gayatri Devi: A maharani and a beauty &#124; India News - Times of India|website=The Times of India|accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Titles==\nGayatri Devi held the following titles:\n\n'''1919&ndash;1940''': ''Her Highness Princess Gayatri Devi of Cooch Behar'' <br>\n'''1940&ndash;1949''': ''Her Highness The Maharani of Jaipur'' <br>\n'''1949&ndash;1970''': ''Her Highness Maharani Gayatri Devi'' <br>\n'''1970&ndash;2009''': ''Her Highness Rajmata of Jaipur''\n\n== Filmography ==\n* [[Stephane Bern]].
