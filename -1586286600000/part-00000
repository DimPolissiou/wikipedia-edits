The generative network's training objective is to increase the error rate of the discriminative network (i.e., \"fool\" the discriminator network by producing novel candidates that the discriminator thinks are not synthesized (are part of the true data distribution)).<ref name=\"GANnips\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Luc|first=Pauline|last2=Couprie|first2=Camille|last3=Chintala|first3=Soumith|last4=Verbeek|first4=Jakob|date=2016-11-25|title=Semantic Segmentation using Adversarial Networks|journal=NIPS Workshop on Adversarial Training, Dec, Barcelona, Spain|volume=2016|arxiv=1611.08408|bibcode=2016arXiv161108408L}}</ref>\n\nA known dataset serves as the initial training data for the discriminator. Training it involves presenting it with samples from the training dataset, until it achieves acceptable accuracy. The generator trains based on whether it succeeds in fooling the discriminator. Typically the generator is seeded with randomized input that is sampled from a predefined [[latent variable|latent space]] (e.g. a [[multivariate normal distribution]]). Thereafter, candidates synthesized by the generator are evaluated by the discriminator. [[Backpropagation]] is applied in both networks so that the generator produces better images, while the discriminator becomes more skilled at flagging synthetic images.<ref

To further leverage the symmetry of them, an auxiliary GAN is introduced and adopts generator and discriminator models of original one as its own discriminator and generator respectively.

Typically, the generative network learns to map from a [[latent variable|latent space]] to a data distribution of interest, while the discriminative network distinguishes candidates produced by the generator from the true data distribution. The generative network's training objective is to increase the error rate of the discriminative network (i.e., \"fool\" the discriminator network by producing novel candidates that the discriminator thinks are not synthesized (are part of the true data distribution)).<ref name=\"GANnips\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Luc|first=Pauline|last2=Couprie|first2=Camille|last3=Chintala|first3=Soumith|last4=Verbeek|first4=Jakob|date=2016-11-25|title=Semantic Segmentation using Adversarial Networks|journal=NIPS Workshop on Adversarial Training, Dec, Barcelona, Spain|volume=2016|arxiv=1611.08408|bibcode=2016arXiv161108408L}}</ref>\n\nA known dataset serves as the initial training data for the discriminator. Training it involves presenting it with samples from the training dataset, until it achieves acceptable accuracy. The generator trains based on whether it succeeds in fooling the discriminator. Typically the generator is seeded with randomized input that is sampled from a predefined [[latent variable|latent space]] (e.g. a [[multivariate normal distribution]]). Thereafter, candidates synthesized by the generator are evaluated by the discriminator. [[Backpropagation]] is applied in both networks so that the generator produces better images, while the discriminator becomes more skilled at flagging synthetic images.<ref

To satisfy this property, generator and discriminator are both designed to model the joint probability of sentence pairs, with the difference that, the generator decomposes the joint probability with a source language model and a source-to-target translation model, while the discriminator is formulated as a target language model and a target-to-source translation model. To further leverage the symmetry of them, an auxiliary GAN is introduced and adopts generator and discriminator models of original one as its own discriminator and generator respectively. Two GANs are alternately trained to update the parameters. The resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning.<ref>{{Cite web|author1=Zhirui Zhang |author2=Shujie Liu |author3=Mu Li |author4=Ming Zhou |author5=Enhong Chen|date=October 2018|title=Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks for Neural Machine Translation|url=https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K18-1019.pdf|journal=|volume=Proceedings of the 22nd Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning|pages=190\u2013199|via=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Art|Photography}}\n* {{cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603216/5-big-predictions-for-artificial-intelligence-in-2017/|title=5 Big Predictions for Artificial Intelligence in 2017|last=Knight|first=Will|newspaper=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-01-05}}\n* [https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948 A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks]\n* [https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/ This Person Does Not Exist]{{snd}} photorealistic images of people who do not exist, generated by [[StyleGAN]]\n* [https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01529 \"Generative Adversarial Networks: A Survey and Taxonomy\", recent review by Zhengwei Wang, Qi She, Tomas E.

December 1928]]\n{{see also|Philips (family)}}\nThe Philips Company was founded in 1891, by [[Gerard Philips]] and his father Frederik Philips. Frederik, a banker based in [[Zaltbommel]], financed the purchase and setup of an empty factory building in Eindhoven, where the company started the production of carbon-filament lamps and other electro-technical products in 1892. This first factory has since been adapted and is used as a museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philips-museum.com/uk/|title=Philips Museum|website=Philips-museum.com|accessdate=30 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021024613/http://www.philips-museum.com/uk/|archive-date=21 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895, after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy, the Philipses brought in [[Anton Philips|Anton]], Gerard's younger brother by sixteen years. Though he had earned a degree in engineering, Anton started work as a sales representative; soon, however, he began to contribute many important business ideas. With Anton's arrival, the family business began to expand rapidly, resulting in the founding of Philips Metaalgloeilampfabriek N.V. (Philips Metal Filament Lamp Factory Ltd.) in Eindhoven in 1908, followed in 1912, by the foundation of Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V. (Philips Lightbulb Factories Ltd.). After Gerard and Anton Philips changed their family business by founding the Philips [[corporation]], they laid the foundations for the later electronics [[multinational corporation|multinational]].\n\nIn the 1920s, the company started to manufacture other products, such as [[vacuum tubes]]. In 1939, they introduced their electric [[razor]], the ''[[Philishave]]'' (marketed in the US using the [[Norelco]] brand name). The \"Chapel\" is a radio with built-in loudspeaker, which was designed during the early 1930s.\n\n===Philips Radio===\n[[File:Philips 930.jpg|thumb|upright|Philips 'Chapel' radio model 930A, 1931|alt=Curved, triangular radio with brown wooden cabinet]]\nOn 11 March 1927, Philips went on the air with shortwave radio station [[PCJJ]] (later PCJ) which was joined in 1929 by sister station PHOHI (Philips Omroep Holland-Indi\u00eb). PHOHI broadcast in Dutch to the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) while PCJJ broadcast in English, Spanish and German to the rest of the world.\n\nThe international program on Sundays commenced in 1928, with host Eddie Startz hosting the ''[[Happy Station]]'' show, which became the world's longest-running shortwave program. Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the German invasion in May 1940. The Germans commandeered the transmitters in [[Huizen]] to use for pro-[[Nazi broadcasts]], some originating from Germany, others concerts from Dutch broadcasters under German control.\n\nPhilips Radio was absorbed shortly after [[Emancipation|liberation]] when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in 1947 and renamed [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]], the Dutch International Service. Some PCJ programs, such as ''[[Happy Station]]'', continued on the new station.\n\n===Stirling engine===\nPhilips was instrumental in the revival of the [[Stirling engine]] when, in the early 1930s, the management decided that offering a low-power portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain. Engineers at the company's research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten Stirling engine would be most suitable, citing its quiet operation (both audibly and in terms of radio interference) and ability to run on a variety of heat sources (common lamp oil&nbsp;\u2013 \"cheap and available everywhere\"&nbsp;\u2013 was favored).<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991). ''The Philips Stirling Engine''. [[Elsevier Science]]. {{ISBN|0-444-88463-7}}. pp.28\u201330</ref> They were also aware that, unlike steam and internal combustion engines, virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the Stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and know-how should enable great improvements.<ref>''Philips Technical Review'' Vol.9 No.4-page 97 (1947)</ref>\n\nEncouraged by their first experimental engine, which produced 16&nbsp;W of shaft power from a bore and stroke of {{nowrap|30 mm \u00d7 25 mm}},<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991), Fig. 3</ref> various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout [[World War II]]. By the late 1940s, the 'Type 10' was ready to be handed over to Philips's subsidiary Johan de Witt in Dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned. The result, rated at 180/200&nbsp;W electrical output from a bore and stroke of {{nowrap|55 mm \u00d7 27 mm}}, was designated MP1002CA (known as the \"Bungalow set\"). Production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951, but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price, besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing. Approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced.<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991), p.61</ref>\n\nIn parallel with the generator set, Philips developed experimental Stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s, though the only commercial success was the 'reversed Stirling engine' [[Applications of the Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|cryocooler]]. However, they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information, which they later licensed to other companies.<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991), p.77</ref>\n\n===Shavers===\nThe first Philips shaver was introduced in the 1930s, and was simply called [[Philishave]]. In the US, it was called [[Norelco]]. The Philishave has remained part of the Philips product line-up until the present.\n\n===World War II===\nOn 9 May 1940, the Philips directors learned that the German [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion]] of the [[Netherlands]] was to take place the following day. Having prepared for this, [[Anton Philips]] and his son in law [[Frans Otten]], as well as other Philips family members, fled to the United States, taking a large amount of the company capital with them. Operating from the US as the '''North American Philips Company,''' they managed to run the company throughout the war. At the same time, the company was moved (on paper) to the [[Netherlands Antilles]] to keep it out of German hands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philips Electronics NV {{!}} Dutch manufacturer|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Philips-Electronics-NV|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 December 1942, the British [[No. 2 Group RAF]] undertook [[Operation Oyster (1942)|Operation Oyster]], which heavily damaged the Philips Radio factory in Eindhoven with few casualties among the Dutch workers and civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/61/a3537461.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 WW2 People's War \u2013 Operation Oyster, Part 1|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212204359/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/61/a3537461.shtml|archive-date=12 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Philips works in Eindhoven was bombed again by the RAF on 30 March 1943.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eDoRBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&dq=philips%20+%20eindhoven%20+%20bombed%20+%20march%20+%201943#v=onepage&q=philips%20+%20eindhoven%20+%20bombed%20+%20march%20+%201943&f=false|title=The Bomber Command War Diaries: An Operational Reference Book|first1=Chris|last1=Everitt|first2=Martin|last2=Middlebrook|date=2 April 2014|publisher=Pen and Sword|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781473834880}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wehrmacht-history.com/timeline/1943/30th-march-1943-wwii-timeline.htm|title=30th March 1943 WWII Timeline|first=Mr A I|last=Bruce|website=Wehrmacht-history.com|accessdate=30 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212105810/http://www.wehrmacht-history.com/timeline/1943/30th-march-1943-wwii-timeline.htm|archive-date=12 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Frits Philips]], the son of Anton, was the only Philips family member to stay in the Netherlands.

Compact cassettes were initially used for [[dictation machines]] for office typing [[shorthand|steno]]graphers and professional journalists. As their sound quality improved, cassettes would also be used to record sound and became the second mass media alongside [[vinyl records]] used to sell recorded music.\n\n[[File:PHILIPS D6350.jpg|thumb|right|An early portable Compact Cassette recorder by Philips (model D6350)]]\nPhilips introduced the first combination [[portable radio]] and cassette recorder, which was marketed as the \"radiorecorder\", and is now better known as the [[boom box]]. Later, the cassette was used in telephone [[answering machine]]s, including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop. The C-cassette was used as the first [[mass storage device]] for early personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Philips reduced the cassette size for professional needs with the [[Mini-Cassette]], although it would not be as successful as the [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] [[Microcassette]].  This became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully [[digital dictation]] machines.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Philips continued with computers through the early 1990s (see separate article: [[Philips Computers]]).\n\nIn 1972, Philips launched the world's first home [[video cassette recorder]], in the UK, the N1500. Its relatively bulky video cassettes could record 30 minutes or 45 minutes. Later one-hour tapes were also offered. As competition came from [[Sony]]'s [[Betamax]] and the [[VHS]] group of manufacturers, Philips introduced the N1700 system which allowed double-length recording.

Philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the [[Video 2000]] system, with tapes that could be used on both sides and had 8 hours of total recording time. As Philips only sold its systems on the PAL standard and in Europe, and the Japanese makers sold globally, the scale advantages of the Japanese proved insurmountable and Philips withdrew the V2000 system and joined the VHS Coalition.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n[[File:Philips CD-100.JPG|thumb|right|Philips CD-100, the second ever commercially released CD player (after partner Sony's [[Sony CDP-101|CDP-101]])]]\nPhilips had developed a [[LaserDisc]] early on for selling movies, but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales.

Philips owns the naming rights to [[Philips Stadion]] in [[Eindhoven]], which is the home ground of PSV Eindhoven.\n\nOutside of the Netherlands, Philips sponsors and has sponsored numerous sports clubs, sports facilities and events. In November 2008, Philips renewed and extended its [[F1]] partnership with [[AT&T Williams]]. Philips owns the [[naming rights]] to the ''Philips Championship'', the premier basketball league in Australia, traditionally known as the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]]. From 1988 to 1993, Philips was the principal sponsor of the [[Australian rugby league]] team [[The Balmain Tigers]] and Indonesian football club side [[Persiba Balikpapan]]. From 1998 to 2000, Philips sponsored the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Winston Cup]] No. 7 entry for [[Geoff Bodine Racing]], later [[Ultra Motorsports]], for drivers [[Geoff Bodine]] and [[Michael Waltrip]]. From 1999 to 2018, Philips held the naming rights to [[Philips Arena]] in [[Atlanta]], home of the [[Atlanta Hawks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] and former home of the defunct [[Atlanta Thrashers]] of the [[National Hockey League]].\n\nOutside of sports, Philips sponsors the international ''Philips [[Monsters of Rock]] festival''.\n\n==Environmental record==\n===Circular economy===\nPhilips and its CEO, [[Frans van Houten]], hold several global leadership positions in advancing the [[circular economy]], including as a founding member and co-chair of the board of directors for the [[Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy]] (PACE),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acceleratecirculareconomy.org/|title=Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy|website=Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy|language=en-US|access-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402084939/https://www.acceleratecirculareconomy.org/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> applying circular approaches in its capital equipment business,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/news/archive/standard/news/articles/2018/20180124-philips-spearheads-the-circular-economy-with-firm-2020-pledge.html|title=https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/news/archive/standard/news/articles/2018/20180124-philips-spearheads-the-circular-economy-with-firm-2020-pledge.html|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and as a global partner of the [[Ellen MacArthur Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-story/milestones|title=History of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation|website=ellenmacarthurfoundation.org|access-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402112509/https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-story/milestones|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Green initiatives===\nPhilips also runs the EcoVision initiative, which commits to a number of environmentally positive improvements, focusing on energy efficiency.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ford tops Interbrand's fourth annual ranking as the \"greenest\" brand in 2014 |url=http://popsop.com/2014/08/ford-crowns-interbrands-forth-annual-ranking-as-the-greenest-brand-in-2014/ |website=POPSOP |accessdate=6 March 2019 |date=13 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306234940/http://popsop.com/2014/08/ford-crowns-interbrands-forth-annual-ranking-as-the-greenest-brand-in-2014/ |archive-date=6 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAlso, Philips marks its \"green\" products with the Philips Green Logo, identifying them as products that have a significantly better environmental performance than their competitors or predecessors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philips.com/about/sustainability/ourgreenproducts/index.page |title=Philips \u2013 Our Green Products| publisher=Philips |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===L-Prize competition===\nIn 2011, Philips won a $10 million cash prize from the [[US Department of Energy]] for winning its [[L Prize|L-Prize]] competition, to produce a high-efficiency, long operating life replacement for a standard 60-W [[incandescent lightbulb]].<ref name=\"L-prize\">Margery Conner, EE Times. \"[http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4218485/-10M-L-Prize-goes-to-Philips-for-60W-replacement-LED-bulb $10M L Prize goes to Philips for 60W replacement LED bulb] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930202611/http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4218485/-10M-L-Prize-goes-to-Philips-for-60W-replacement-LED-bulb |date=30 September 2011 }}.\" 3 August 2011.

December 1928]]\n{{see also|Philips (family)}}\nThe Philips Company was founded in 1891, by [[Gerard Philips]] and his father Frederik Philips. Frederik, a banker based in [[Zaltbommel]], financed the purchase and setup of an empty factory building in Eindhoven, where the company started the production of carbon-filament lamps and other electro-technical products in 1892. This first factory has since been adapted and is used as a museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philips-museum.com/uk/|title=Philips Museum|website=Philips-museum.com|accessdate=30 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021024613/http://www.philips-museum.com/uk/|archive-date=21 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895, after a difficult first few years and near bankruptcy, the Philipses brought in [[Anton Philips|Anton]], Gerard's younger brother by sixteen years. Though he had earned a degree in engineering, Anton started work as a sales representative; soon, however, he began to contribute many important business ideas. With Anton's arrival, the family business began to expand rapidly, resulting in the founding of Philips Metaalgloeilampfabriek N.V. (Philips Metal Filament Lamp Factory Ltd.) in Eindhoven in 1908, followed in 1912, by the foundation of Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V. (Philips Lightbulb Factories Ltd.). After Gerard and Anton Philips changed their family business by founding the Philips [[corporation]], they laid the foundations for the later electronics [[multinational corporation|multinational]].\n\nIn the 1920s, the company started to manufacture other products, such as [[vacuum tubes]]. In 1939, they introduced their electric [[razor]], the ''[[Philishave]]'' (marketed in the US using the [[Norelco]] brand name). The \"Chapel\" is a radio with built-in loudspeaker, which was designed during the early 1930s.\n\n===Philips Radio===\n[[File:Philips 930.jpg|thumb|upright|Philips 'Chapel' radio model 930A, 1931|alt=Curved, triangular radio with brown wooden cabinet]]\nOn 11 March 1927, Philips went on the air with shortwave radio station [[PCJJ]] (later PCJ) which was joined in 1929 by sister station PHOHI (Philips Omroep Holland-Indi\u00eb). PHOHI broadcast in Dutch to the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) while PCJJ broadcast in English, Spanish and German to the rest of the world.\n\nThe international program on Sundays commenced in 1928, with host Eddie Startz hosting the ''[[Happy Station]]'' show, which became the world's longest-running shortwave program. Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the German invasion in May 1940. The Germans commandeered the transmitters in [[Huizen]] to use for pro-[[Nazi broadcasts]], some originating from Germany, others concerts from Dutch broadcasters under German control.\n\nPhilips Radio was absorbed shortly after [[Emancipation|liberation]] when its two shortwave stations were nationalised in 1947 and renamed [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]], the Dutch International Service. Some PCJ programs, such as ''[[Happy Station]]'', continued on the new station.\n\n===Stirling engine===\nPhilips was instrumental in the revival of the [[Stirling engine]] when, in the early 1930s, the management decided that offering a low-power portable generator would assist in expanding sales of its radios into parts of the world where mains electricity was unavailable and the supply of batteries uncertain. Engineers at the company's research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten Stirling engine would be most suitable, citing its quiet operation (both audibly and in terms of radio interference) and ability to run on a variety of heat sources (common lamp oil&nbsp;\u2013 \"cheap and available everywhere\"&nbsp;\u2013 was favored).<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991). ''The Philips Stirling Engine''. [[Elsevier Science]]. {{ISBN|0-444-88463-7}}. pp.28\u201330</ref> They were also aware that, unlike steam and internal combustion engines, virtually no serious development work had been carried out on the Stirling engine for many years and asserted that modern materials and know-how should enable great improvements.<ref>''Philips Technical Review'' Vol.9 No.4-page 97 (1947)</ref>\n\nEncouraged by their first experimental engine, which produced 16&nbsp;W of shaft power from a bore and stroke of {{nowrap|30 mm \u00d7 25 mm}},<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991), Fig. 3</ref> various development models were produced in a program which continued throughout [[World War II]]. By the late 1940s, the 'Type 10' was ready to be handed over to Philips's subsidiary Johan de Witt in Dordrecht to be produced and incorporated into a generator set as originally planned. The result, rated at 180/200&nbsp;W electrical output from a bore and stroke of {{nowrap|55 mm \u00d7 27 mm}}, was designated MP1002CA (known as the \"Bungalow set\"). Production of an initial batch of 250 began in 1951, but it became clear that they could not be made at a competitive price, besides with the advent of transistor radios with their much lower power requirements meant that the original rationale for the set was disappearing. Approximately 150 of these sets were eventually produced.<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991), p.61</ref>\n\nIn parallel with the generator set, Philips developed experimental Stirling engines for a wide variety of applications and continued to work in the field until the late 1970s, though the only commercial success was the 'reversed Stirling engine' [[Applications of the Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|cryocooler]]. However, they filed a large number of patents and amassed a wealth of information, which they later licensed to other companies.<ref>C.M. Hargreaves (1991), p.77</ref>\n\n===Shavers===\nThe first Philips shaver was introduced in the 1930s, and was simply called [[Philishave]]. In the US, it was called [[Norelco]]. The Philishave has remained part of the Philips product line-up until the present.\n\n===World War II===\nOn 9 May 1940, the Philips directors learned that the German [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion]] of the [[Netherlands]] was to take place the following day. Having prepared for this, [[Anton Philips]] and his son in law [[Frans Otten]], as well as other Philips family members, fled to the United States, taking a large amount of the company capital with them. Operating from the US as the '''North American Philips Company,''' they managed to run the company throughout the war. At the same time, the company was moved (on paper) to the [[Netherlands Antilles]] to keep it out of German hands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philips Electronics NV {{!}} Dutch manufacturer|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Philips-Electronics-NV|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 December 1942, the British [[No. 2 Group RAF]] undertook [[Operation Oyster (1942)|Operation Oyster]], which heavily damaged the Philips Radio factory in Eindhoven with few casualties among the Dutch workers and civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/61/a3537461.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 WW2 People's War \u2013 Operation Oyster, Part 1|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212204359/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/61/a3537461.shtml|archive-date=12 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Philips works in Eindhoven was bombed again by the RAF on 30 March 1943.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eDoRBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&dq=philips%20+%20eindhoven%20+%20bombed%20+%20march%20+%201943#v=onepage&q=philips%20+%20eindhoven%20+%20bombed%20+%20march%20+%201943&f=false|title=The Bomber Command War Diaries: An Operational Reference Book|first1=Chris|last1=Everitt|first2=Martin|last2=Middlebrook|date=2 April 2014|publisher=Pen and Sword|accessdate=30 December 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781473834880}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wehrmacht-history.com/timeline/1943/30th-march-1943-wwii-timeline.htm|title=30th March 1943 WWII Timeline|first=Mr A I|last=Bruce|website=Wehrmacht-history.com|accessdate=30 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212105810/http://www.wehrmacht-history.com/timeline/1943/30th-march-1943-wwii-timeline.htm|archive-date=12 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Frits Philips]], the son of Anton, was the only Philips family member to stay in the Netherlands.

Compact cassettes were initially used for [[dictation machines]] for office typing [[shorthand|steno]]graphers and professional journalists. As their sound quality improved, cassettes would also be used to record sound and became the second mass media alongside [[vinyl records]] used to sell recorded music.\n\n[[File:PHILIPS D6350.jpg|thumb|right|An early portable Compact Cassette recorder by Philips (model D6350)]]\nPhilips introduced the first combination [[portable radio]] and cassette recorder, which was marketed as the \"radiorecorder\", and is now better known as the [[boom box]]. Later, the cassette was used in telephone [[answering machine]]s, including a special form of cassette where the tape was wound on an endless loop. The C-cassette was used as the first [[mass storage device]] for early personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Philips reduced the cassette size for professional needs with the [[Mini-Cassette]], although it would not be as successful as the [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] [[Microcassette]].  This became the predominant dictation medium up to the advent of fully [[digital dictation]] machines.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Philips continued with computers through the early 1990s (see separate article: [[Philips Computers]]).\n\nIn 1972, Philips launched the world's first home [[video cassette recorder]], in the UK, the N1500. Its relatively bulky video cassettes could record 30 minutes or 45 minutes. Later one-hour tapes were also offered. As competition came from [[Sony]]'s [[Betamax]] and the [[VHS]] group of manufacturers, Philips introduced the N1700 system which allowed double-length recording. For the first time, a 2-hour movie could fit onto one video cassette.  In 1977, the company unveiled a special promotional film for this system in the UK, featuring comedy writer and presenter [[Denis Norden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/105150|title=BFI \u2013 Film & TV Database \u2013 The Philips Time Machine (1977)|work=The [[British Film Institute]] Web Database|accessdate=16 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919185932/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/105150|archive-date=19 September 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The concept was quickly copied by the Japanese makers, whose tapes were significantly cheaper. Philips made one last attempt at a new standard for video recorders with the [[Video 2000]] system, with tapes that could be used on both sides and had 8 hours of total recording time. As Philips only sold its systems on the PAL standard and in Europe, and the Japanese makers sold globally, the scale advantages of the Japanese proved insurmountable and Philips withdrew the V2000 system and joined the VHS Coalition.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n[[File:Philips CD-100.JPG|thumb|right|Philips CD-100, the second ever commercially released CD player (after partner Sony's [[Sony CDP-101|CDP-101]])]]\nPhilips had developed a [[LaserDisc]] early on for selling movies, but delayed its commercial launch for fear of cannibalizing its video recorder sales. Later Philips joined with [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] to launch the first commercial LaserDisc standard and players. In 1982, Philips teamed with Sony to launch the [[Compact Disc]]; this format evolved into the [[CD-R]], [[CD-RW]], [[DVD]] and later [[Blu-ray]], which Philips launched with Sony in 1997{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and 2006 respectively.\n\nIn 1984, the Dutch Philips Group bought out nearly a one-third share and took over the management of German company [[Grundig]].\n\nIn 1984, Philips split off its activities on the field of [[Photolithography|photolithographic]] integrated circuit production equipment, the so-called wafer steppers, into a joint venture with [[ASM International]], located in [[Veldhoven]] under the name [[ASML Holding|ASML]].

Philips owns the naming rights to [[Philips Stadion]] in [[Eindhoven]], which is the home ground of PSV Eindhoven.\n\nOutside of the Netherlands, Philips sponsors and has sponsored numerous sports clubs, sports facilities and events. In November 2008, Philips renewed and extended its [[F1]] partnership with [[AT&T Williams]]. Philips owns the [[naming rights]] to the ''Philips Championship'', the premier basketball league in Australia, traditionally known as the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]]. From 1988 to 1993, Philips was the principal sponsor of the [[Australian rugby league]] team [[The Balmain Tigers]] and Indonesian football club side [[Persiba Balikpapan]]. From 1998 to 2000, Philips sponsored the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Winston Cup]] No. 7 entry for [[Geoff Bodine Racing]], later [[Ultra Motorsports]], for drivers [[Geoff Bodine]] and [[Michael Waltrip]]. From 1999 to 2018, Philips held the naming rights to [[Philips Arena]] in [[Atlanta]], home of the [[Atlanta Hawks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] and former home of the defunct [[Atlanta Thrashers]] of the [[National Hockey League]].\n\nOutside of sports, Philips sponsors the international ''Philips [[Monsters of Rock]] festival''.\n\n==Environmental record==\n===Circular economy===\nPhilips and its CEO, [[Frans van Houten]], hold several global leadership positions in advancing the [[circular economy]], including as a founding member and co-chair of the board of directors for the [[Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy]] (PACE),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acceleratecirculareconomy.org/|title=Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy|website=Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy|language=en-US|access-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402084939/https://www.acceleratecirculareconomy.org/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> applying circular approaches in its capital equipment business,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/news/archive/standard/news/articles/2018/20180124-philips-spearheads-the-circular-economy-with-firm-2020-pledge.html|title=https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/news/archive/standard/news/articles/2018/20180124-philips-spearheads-the-circular-economy-with-firm-2020-pledge.html|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and as a global partner of the [[Ellen MacArthur Foundation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-story/milestones|title=History of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation|website=ellenmacarthurfoundation.org|access-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402112509/https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/our-story/milestones|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Green initiatives===\nPhilips also runs the EcoVision initiative, which commits to a number of environmentally positive improvements, focusing on energy efficiency.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ford tops Interbrand's fourth annual ranking as the \"greenest\" brand in 2014 |url=http://popsop.com/2014/08/ford-crowns-interbrands-forth-annual-ranking-as-the-greenest-brand-in-2014/ |website=POPSOP |accessdate=6 March 2019 |date=13 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306234940/http://popsop.com/2014/08/ford-crowns-interbrands-forth-annual-ranking-as-the-greenest-brand-in-2014/ |archive-date=6 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAlso, Philips marks its \"green\" products with the Philips Green Logo, identifying them as products that have a significantly better environmental performance than their competitors or predecessors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philips.com/about/sustainability/ourgreenproducts/index.page |title=Philips \u2013 Our Green Products| publisher=Philips |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===L-Prize competition===\nIn 2011, Philips won a $10 million cash prize from the [[US Department of Energy]] for winning its [[L Prize|L-Prize]] competition, to produce a high-efficiency, long operating life replacement for a standard 60-W [[incandescent lightbulb]].<ref name=\"L-prize\">Margery Conner, EE Times. \"[http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4218485/-10M-L-Prize-goes-to-Philips-for-60W-replacement-LED-bulb $10M L Prize goes to Philips for 60W replacement LED bulb] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930202611/http://eetimes.com/electronics-news/4218485/-10M-L-Prize-goes-to-Philips-for-60W-replacement-LED-bulb |date=30 September 2011 }}.\" 3 August 2011.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight.

All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">[https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670 Aviation Safety Org Mishap Database]</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Dean Boys' History of EC-121|url =http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm|website = www.dean-boys.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">[https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670 Aviation Safety Org Mishap Database]</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.
