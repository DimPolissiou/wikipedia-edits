They also have a culture of counting only older members of the family. For example, the Nuer believe that counting the number of children one has could result in misfortune and prefer to report fewer children than they have. Their Ethiopian counterparts are the Horn peninsula's westernmost Horners.<ref>Johnson, Douglas H. \"On the Nilotic frontier: imperial Ethiopia in the southern Sudan, 1898-1936.\" (1986): 219-245.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Nuer people are said to have originally been a section of the Dinka people that migrated out of the [[Gezira (state)|Gezira]] south into a barren dry land that they called \"Kwer Kwong\"\", which was in southern Kordofan. Centuries of isolation and influence from Luo peoples caused them to be a distinct ethnic group from the Dinka. The Arrival of Bagarra Arabs and their subsequent slave raids in the late 1700s caused the Nuer to migrate en masse from southern Kordofan into what is now [[Northern Liech State |Bentiu]]. In around 1850, further slave raids as well as flooding and overpopulation caused them to migrate even further out of [[Northern Liech State|Bentiu]] and eastwards all the way into the western fringes of Ethiopia, Displacing and Absorbing many Dinka, Anyuak and Burun in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&id=r61i6BD0Vw0C&q=nuer#v=snippet&q=nuer&f=false |website=[https://books.google.com/]|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe intrusion of the [[British Empire|British]] in the 19th century greatly Greatly halted the Nuers aggressive territorial expansion against the Dinka and Anyuak.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&id=ye9vjk9D8LIC&q=british+#v=snippet&q=british%20border&f=false |website=[https://books.google.com/]|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThere are different accounts of the origin of the conflict between the Nuer and the Dinka, South Sudan's two largest ethnic groups. Anthropologist Peter J. Newcomer suggests that the Nuer are actually Dinka. He argues that hundreds of years of population growth created expansion, which eventually led to raids and wars.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Newcomer|first=Peter J.|year=1972|title=The Nuer Are Dinka: An Essay on Origins and Environmental Determinism|journal=Man|series=New Series |volume=7|issue=1|pages= 5\u201311|jstor=2799852}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 the Nuer were the tribe that [[Disarmament of the Lou Nuer|resisted disarmament most strongly]]; members of the [[Nuer White Army]], a group of armed youths often autonomous from tribal elders' authority, refused to lay down their weapons, which led SPLA soldiers to confiscate Nuer cattle, destroying their economy.

Sharon Hutchinson writes that \"among Nuer people the difference between people and cattle was continually underplayed.\"<ref name=HUTCH1992/> Cattle are particularly important in their role as bride wealth, where they are given by a husband's lineage to his wife's lineage. This exchange of cattle ensures that the children will be considered to belong to the husband's lineage. The classical Nuer institution of ghost marriage, in which a man can \"father\" children after his death, is based on this definition of relations of [[kinship and descent]] by cattle exchange. In their turn, cattle given over to the wife's patrilineage enable the male children of that patrilineage to marry and thereby ensure the continuity of her patrilineage. An infertile woman can even take a wife of her own, whose children, biologically fathered by men from other unions, then become members of her patrilineage, and she is legally and culturally their father, allowing her to metaphorically participate in reproduction.\n\n=== Cattle ===\nNuer life revolves around [[cattle]], which has made them [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]], but they are known to sometimes resort to [[horticulture]] as well, especially when their cattle are threatened by disease. Due to seasonal harsh weather, the Nuer move around to ensure that their livelihood is safe. They tend to travel when heavy seasons of rainfall come to protect the cattle from hoof disease, and when resources for the cattle are scarce. British anthropologist [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] wrote, \u201cThey depend on the herds for their very existence...Cattle are the thread that runs through Nuer [[Institution|institutions,]] [[language]], [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], [[politics]], [[economy]], and [[allegiance]]s.\u201c{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|pp=164\u2013165}}\n\nThe Nuer are able to structure their entire [[culture]] around cattle and still have what they need. Before development the Nuer used every single piece of cattle to their advantage. According to Evans-Pritchard, cattle helped evolve the Nuer culture into what it is today. They shaped the Nuer's daily duties, as they dedicate themselves to protecting the cattle. For example, each month they blow air into their cattle's rectums to relieve or prevent constipation. Cattle are no good to the Nuer if [[Constipation|constipated]] because they are restricted from producing primary resources that families need to survive. Evans-Pritchard wrote, \"The importance of cattle in Nuer life and thought is further exemplified in personal names.\"{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016|p=18}} They form their children's names from biological features of the cattle.\n\nEvans-Pritchard wrote, \"I have already indicated that this obsession\u2014for such it seems to an outsider is due not only to the great economic value of cattle but also to the fact that they are links in numerous social relationships.\"{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016|p=19}} All their raw materials come from cattle, including for drums, rugs, clothing, spears, shields, containers, and leather goods. Even daily essentials like toothpaste and mouthwash are created from the cattle's dung and urine. The dung is chopped into pieces and left out to harden, then used for containers, toothpaste, or even to protect the cattle themselves by burning it to produce more smoke, keeping insects away to prevent disease.\n\nThe Nuer people never eat cattle just because they want to. Cattle are very sacred to them, therefore when they do eat cattle they honor its ghost. They typically just eat the cattle that is up in age or dying because of sickness. But even if they do so, they all gather together performing rituals, dances or songs before and after they slaughter the cattle. Never do they just kill cattle for the fun of it. \u201cNever do Nuer slaughter animals solely because the desire to eat meat. There is the danger of the ox\u2019s spirit visiting a curse on any individual who would slaughter it without ritual intent, aiming only to use it for food. Any animal that dies of natural causes is eaten.\u201d{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|pp=164\u2013165}} Many times it may not even just be cattle that they consume, it could be any animal they have scavenged upon that has died because of natural causes. There are a few other food sources that are available for the Nuer to consume. The Nuer diet primarily consists of fish and millet. \u201cTheir staple crop is millet.\"{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|p=160}} [[Millet]] is formally consumed as [[porridge]] or beer. The Nuer turn to this staple product in seasons of rainfall when they move their cattle up to higher ground. They might also turn to millet when the cattle are performing well enough to support their family.\n\n=== Kinship ===\nTo a Nuer individual, his parents and siblings are not considered mar (blood relatives) kin. He doesn't refer to them as kin. To him they are considered gol{{clarify|date=March 2020}} which is far more intimate and significant. There are kinship categories in the Nuer society. Those categories depend on the payment to them. There is a balance between the mother and father's side that is acknowledged through particular formal occasions such as marriage.<ref name=EP1951>{{Cite book|title=Kinship and Marriage among the Nuer|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=E.E|publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press|year=1951|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nNuer girls usually marry at 17 or 18. If a young girl gets engaged at an early age,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} the wedding and consummation ceremonies are essentially delayed. Women generally give birth to their first children when they are mature enough to bear them. As long as a girl marries a man with cattle, she is able to freely choose her husband, however her parents may choose a spouse for her.<ref name=EP1951/>\n\n==== Kinship roles ====\n[[Kinship]] among the Nuer is very important to them, they refer to their blood relatives as ``gol\u201d. Kinship within the Nuer is formed off of one's neighbors or their entire culture. During E.E.Evans-Pritchard's ethnographic observation, he described the role of kinship as: \u201cKinship obligations include caring for the children of one\u2019s kin and neighbors. He also observed that,\"The network of kinship ties which links members of local communities is brought about by the operation of exogamous rules, often stated in terms of cattle.\"{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016|p=17}} This is never thought to be the sole responsibility of the child's parents.\"{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|p=163}} Cattle are judged by how much milk they can produce which is a necessity in their culture. If possible they create the excess of milk into cheese. But if a family\u2019s herd cannot produce the amount of milk a family needs then they turn to other around them to give them what they need. It\u2019s seen as their responsibility to step in and help the family since it\u2019s not really their fault on how much their cattle can produce. The entire Nuer society is basically watching after each other, for example, as Evans-Pritchard noted that,\u201cWhen one household has a surplus, it is shared with neighbors. Amassing wealth is not an aim. Although a man who owns a large herd of cattle may be envied, his possession of numerous animals does not garner him any special privilege or treatment.\u201d{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|p=165}} In this tribe there is no special treatment for how one is treated because of their abundance in cattle. Just because one might have more cattle than another doesn't mean they have a higher prestige. If one might have more than enough to provide for themselves then they also provide that to other kin that are in need, as it is a part of their role in kinship.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] studied the Nuer and made very detailed accounts of his interactions. He also describes Nuer [[cosmology]] and religion in his books.\n\nNuer Online indicates that, \"Nuer (Nu\u00e4\u00e4r) believes that God is the spirit of the sky or the spirit who is in the sky\u201d Kuoth Nhial\u201d (God in Heaven) the creator, but Nuers believe in the coming of God through rain, lightning and thunder, and that the rainbow is the necklace of God. The sun and the moon as well as other material entities are also manifestation or sign of God, who after all is a spirit.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe spirits of the air above are believed to be the most powerful of the lesser spirits, while there are also spirits associated with clan-spears names such as WiW, a spirit of war, associated with thunder. Nuers believe that when a man or a woman dies, the flesh, the life and the soul separate. The flesh is committed to the earth, while the breath or life goes back to God (Kuoth). The soul that signifies the human individuality and personality remains alive as a shadow or a reflection, and departs together with the ox sacrificed, to the place of the ghosts.\".\n\nIn the 1940s, missionaries began to attempt to evangelize the Nuer. The book of Genesis was translated and published in 1954, with the whole New Testament following in 1968. By the 1970s, there were nearly 200 Nuer congregations established. However, reporting{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} indicates that only around 1% of Nuer identify as Christian.\n\n=== Role of Cattle ===\nIn the 1990s, Sharon Hutchinson returned to [[Nuerland]] to update E.E. Evans-Pritchard's account. She found that the Nuer had placed strict limits on the convertibility of money and cattle in order to preserve the special status of cattle as objects of bride wealth exchange and as mediators to the divine.  She also found that as a result of endemic warfare with the [[Sudan|Sudanese state]], guns had acquired much of the symbolic and ritual importance previously held by cattle.\n\n=== Language ===\nThe people speak the [[Nuer language|Nuer language / Thoknath]] which belongs to the [[Nilo-Saharan]] [[Phylum (linguistics)|language phylum]].\n\n=== Ritual ===\nThe Nuer receive facial markings (called ''gaar'') as part of their initiation into adulthood.\nThe pattern of Nuer [[scarification]] varies within specific subgroups. The most common initiation pattern among males consists of six parallel horizontal lines which are cut across the forehead with a razor, often with a dip in the lines above the nose. Dotted patterns are also common (especially among the Bul Nuer and among females).{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSome Nuer have begun practicing [[circumcision]] after being assimilated or partially assimilated in other ethnic groups. The Nuer are not historically known to circumcise, but sometimes circumcise people who have engaged in incest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nTypical foods eaten by the Nuer tribe include beef, goat, cow's milk, [[mango]]s, and [[sorghum]] in one of three forms: \"ko\u0331p\" finely ground, handled until balled and boiled, \"walwal\" ground, lightly balled and boiled to a solid porridge, and [[injera / Y\u0254ty\u0254t]], a large, pancake-like [[yeast]]-risen [[flatbread]].\n\nIn the early 1990s about 25,000 African refugees were [[third country resettlement|resettled]] in the United States throughout different locations such as South Dakota, Tennessee and Minnesota. In particular, 4,288 refugees from Sudan were resettled among 36 different states between 1990 and 1997 with the highest number in Texas at 17 percent of the refugee population from Sudan.{{sfnp|Shandy|2006|p=65}}\n\nThe Nuer refugees in the United States and those in Africa continue to observe their social obligations to one another. They use different means ranging from letters to new technologically advanced communication methods in order to stay connected to their families in Africa. Nuer in the United States provide assistance for family members\u2019 paperwork to help their migration process to the United States. Furthermore, Nuer in the United States observe family obligations by sending money for those still in Africa.{{sfnp|Shandy|2006|p=160}}\n\n== Nuer military and political leaders ==\nSome important Nuer politicians are Both Diu was the first Nuer and South Sudan Politician from 1947 and follow by Gai Tut in Military is Bol Nyawan who fought against the [[Khartoum]] government in [[Bentiu]]; he was killed in 1985 by the current president of Sudan. Commander Ruai and Liah Diu Deng were responsible for the attack that forced Chevron to suspend activities in the oil field around 1982.\n\n==Naming conventions==\n* ''(Nya) Nyada meaning \"daughter all females begin with (Nya) of\", is the standard prefix used for female names. ''Gat'', meaning \"son of\", is a common prefix for male names.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n* Children are commonly given names to mark historical events (\"D\u0254maac\" meaning \"bullet\", or ''Mac'' meaning \"fire or gun\" given to a child born during times of war or from another man in the name of the deceased father who legally married the mother ).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n* ''Nhial'' means \"sky\u201d, and is a common name for males and females. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n*Many Nuer have been exposed to missionaries and carry a Christian first name. Their second name is a given name and always in Nuer. The father's given name follows the child's given name, which is then followed by the grandfather's name, and so on. Many Nuer can easily recount ten generations of paternal lineage because they carry those names themselves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n*When a Nuer comes to the Western world, which wants a first and last name, it is their custom to give their name as their first name followed by their father's name as their middle name and their grandfather's name as their last name.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n* After the civil war, the Nuer began accepting cash currency into their economy, changing the dynamics of their cattle and how they were viewed. Each type of cattle is titled according to how they are acquired such as: \"the cattle of money\" (purchased with cash currency) and \"the cattle of girls/daughters\" (bridewealth).<ref name=HUTCH1992/>\n\nMost Nuer people are named after their cattle. The boys usually chose the name of their favorite cattle based on the form and color of the ox. The girls are named after the cows that they milk. Sometimes the cow names are passed down.{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016}}\n\n==Impact of Oil Economy on Nuer==\nOil exploration and drilling began in 1975 and 1976 by companies such as Chevron.  In 1979 the first oil production took place in the southern regions of Darfur. In the early 1980s when the North-South war was happening, Chevron was interested in the reserves in the south.  In 1984 guerrillas of SPLA (Sudan People's Liberation Army) attacked the drilling site of the north at Bentiu.  In return, Chevron cleared Nuer and Dinka people in the oil fields area to ensure security for their operations.{{sfnp|Lobban|2010|p=104}}\n\nThe Nuer-Dinka struggle in oil fields continued in late 1990s into the early 2000s. The struggle for oil production was not only manifested in North-South fight, but also in Nuer-Dinka and many internal conflicts among Nuer.{{sfnp|Lobban|2010|p=106}}\n\nAs part of Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), 50 percent of net revenues of southern oil fields were given to the government of southern Sudan as a solution to one of the sources of decades of civil conflict.{{sfnp|Shandy|2006|p=21}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lost Boys of Sudan]]\n*[[Dinka tribe]]\n*[[Anuak people]]\n*[[Nuer White Army]]\n*[[Sudanese nomadic conflicts]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Kuajien Lual Wechtuor, Yual Doctor Chiek and Peter Gai Manyuon, ''The Nuer Nation'', 2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, {{ISBN|978-1540632364}}\n*The works of [[E.

The White Army was finally put down in mid-2006,<ref name=\"sas\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/pdfs/HSBA-SWP-5-White-Army.pdf|publisher=Small Arms Survey|title=The White Army: An Introduction and Overview|first=John|last=Young|date=June 2007|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> though a successor organisation self-styling itself as a White Army formed in 2011 to fight the [[Murle people|Murle]] tribe (see [[2011\u20132012 South Sudan tribal clashes]]), as well as the Dinka and [[United Nations Mission in South Sudan|UNMISS]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/S-Sudan-youth-planning-to-attack-tribe-20111226|agency=News24|title=Sudan youth 'planning to attack tribe'|website=News24.com|date=27 December 2011|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nCattle have historically been of the highest symbolic, religious and economic value to the Nuer. Sharon Hutchinson writes that \"among Nuer people the difference between people and cattle was continually underplayed.\"<ref name=HUTCH1992/> Cattle are particularly important in their role as bride wealth, where they are given by a husband's lineage to his wife's lineage. This exchange of cattle ensures that the children will be considered to belong to the husband's lineage. The classical Nuer institution of ghost marriage, in which a man can \"father\" children after his death, is based on this definition of relations of [[kinship and descent]] by cattle exchange. In their turn, cattle given over to the wife's patrilineage enable the male children of that patrilineage to marry and thereby ensure the continuity of her patrilineage. An infertile woman can even take a wife of her own, whose children, biologically fathered by men from other unions, then become members of her patrilineage, and she is legally and culturally their father, allowing her to metaphorically participate in reproduction.\n\n=== Cattle ===\nNuer life revolves around [[cattle]], which has made them [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]], but they are known to sometimes resort to [[horticulture]] as well, especially when their cattle are threatened by disease. Due to seasonal harsh weather, the Nuer move around to ensure that their livelihood is safe. They tend to travel when heavy seasons of rainfall come to protect the cattle from hoof disease, and when resources for the cattle are scarce. British anthropologist [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] wrote, \u201cThey depend on the herds for their very existence...Cattle are the thread that runs through Nuer [[Institution|institutions,]] [[language]], [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], [[politics]], [[economy]], and [[allegiance]]s.\u201c{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|pp=164\u2013165}}\n\nThe Nuer are able to structure their entire [[culture]] around cattle and still have what they need. Before development the Nuer used every single piece of cattle to their advantage. According to Evans-Pritchard, cattle helped evolve the Nuer culture into what it is today. They shaped the Nuer's daily duties, as they dedicate themselves to protecting the cattle. For example, each month they blow air into their cattle's rectums to relieve or prevent constipation. Cattle are no good to the Nuer if [[Constipation|constipated]] because they are restricted from producing primary resources that families need to survive. Evans-Pritchard wrote, \"The importance of cattle in Nuer life and thought is further exemplified in personal names.\"{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016|p=18}} They form their children's names from biological features of the cattle.\n\nEvans-Pritchard wrote, \"I have already indicated that this obsession\u2014for such it seems to an outsider is due not only to the great economic value of cattle but also to the fact that they are links in numerous social relationships.\"{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016|p=19}} All their raw materials come from cattle, including for drums, rugs, clothing, spears, shields, containers, and leather goods. Even daily essentials like toothpaste and mouthwash are created from the cattle's dung and urine. The dung is chopped into pieces and left out to harden, then used for containers, toothpaste, or even to protect the cattle themselves by burning it to produce more smoke, keeping insects away to prevent disease.\n\nThe Nuer people never eat cattle just because they want to. Cattle are very sacred to them, therefore when they do eat cattle they honor its ghost. They typically just eat the cattle that is up in age or dying because of sickness. But even if they do so, they all gather together performing rituals, dances or songs before and after they slaughter the cattle. Never do they just kill cattle for the fun of it. \u201cNever do Nuer slaughter animals solely because the desire to eat meat. There is the danger of the ox\u2019s spirit visiting a curse on any individual who would slaughter it without ritual intent, aiming only to use it for food. Any animal that dies of natural causes is eaten.\u201d{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|pp=164\u2013165}} Many times it may not even just be cattle that they consume, it could be any animal they have scavenged upon that has died because of natural causes. There are a few other food sources that are available for the Nuer to consume. The Nuer diet primarily consists of fish and millet. \u201cTheir staple crop is millet.\"{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|p=160}} [[Millet]] is formally consumed as [[porridge]] or beer. The Nuer turn to this staple product in seasons of rainfall when they move their cattle up to higher ground. They might also turn to millet when the cattle are performing well enough to support their family.\n\n=== Kinship ===\nTo a Nuer individual, his parents and siblings are not considered mar (blood relatives) kin. He doesn't refer to them as kin. To him they are considered gol{{clarify|date=March 2020}} which is far more intimate and significant. There are kinship categories in the Nuer society. Those categories depend on the payment to them. There is a balance between the mother and father's side that is acknowledged through particular formal occasions such as marriage.<ref name=EP1951>{{Cite book|title=Kinship and Marriage among the Nuer|last=Evans-Pritchard|first=E.E|publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press|year=1951|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nNuer girls usually marry at 17 or 18. If a young girl gets engaged at an early age,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} the wedding and consummation ceremonies are essentially delayed. Women generally give birth to their first children when they are mature enough to bear them. As long as a girl marries a man with cattle, she is able to freely choose her husband, however her parents may choose a spouse for her.<ref name=EP1951/>\n\n==== Kinship roles ====\n[[Kinship]] among the Nuer is very important to them, they refer to their blood relatives as ``gol\u201d. Kinship within the Nuer is formed off of one's neighbors or their entire culture. During E.E.Evans-Pritchard's ethnographic observation, he described the role of kinship as: \u201cKinship obligations include caring for the children of one\u2019s kin and neighbors. He also observed that,\"The network of kinship ties which links members of local communities is brought about by the operation of exogamous rules, often stated in terms of cattle.\"{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016|p=17}} This is never thought to be the sole responsibility of the child's parents.\"{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|p=163}} Cattle are judged by how much milk they can produce which is a necessity in their culture. If possible they create the excess of milk into cheese. But if a family\u2019s herd cannot produce the amount of milk a family needs then they turn to other around them to give them what they need. It\u2019s seen as their responsibility to step in and help the family since it\u2019s not really their fault on how much their cattle can produce. The entire Nuer society is basically watching after each other, for example, as Evans-Pritchard noted that,\u201cWhen one household has a surplus, it is shared with neighbors. Amassing wealth is not an aim. Although a man who owns a large herd of cattle may be envied, his possession of numerous animals does not garner him any special privilege or treatment.\u201d{{sfnp|Peters-Golden|2012|p=165}} In this tribe there is no special treatment for how one is treated because of their abundance in cattle. Just because one might have more cattle than another doesn't mean they have a higher prestige. If one might have more than enough to provide for themselves then they also provide that to other kin that are in need, as it is a part of their role in kinship.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] studied the Nuer and made very detailed accounts of his interactions. He also describes Nuer [[cosmology]] and religion in his books.\n\nNuer Online indicates that, \"Nuer (Nu\u00e4\u00e4r) believes that God is the spirit of the sky or the spirit who is in the sky\u201d Kuoth Nhial\u201d (God in Heaven) the creator, but Nuers believe in the coming of God through rain, lightning and thunder, and that the rainbow is the necklace of God. The sun and the moon as well as other material entities are also manifestation or sign of God, who after all is a spirit.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe spirits of the air above are believed to be the most powerful of the lesser spirits, while there are also spirits associated with clan-spears names such as WiW, a spirit of war, associated with thunder. Nuers believe that when a man or a woman dies, the flesh, the life and the soul separate. The flesh is committed to the earth, while the breath or life goes back to God (Kuoth). The soul that signifies the human individuality and personality remains alive as a shadow or a reflection, and departs together with the ox sacrificed, to the place of the ghosts.\".\n\nIn the 1940s, missionaries began to attempt to evangelize the Nuer. The book of Genesis was translated and published in 1954, with the whole New Testament following in 1968. By the 1970s, there were nearly 200 Nuer congregations established. However, reporting{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} indicates that only around 1% of Nuer identify as Christian.\n\n=== Role of Cattle ===\nIn the 1990s, Sharon Hutchinson returned to [[Nuerland]] to update E.E. Evans-Pritchard's account. She found that the Nuer had placed strict limits on the convertibility of money and cattle in order to preserve the special status of cattle as objects of bride wealth exchange and as mediators to the divine.  She also found that as a result of endemic warfare with the [[Sudan|Sudanese state]], guns had acquired much of the symbolic and ritual importance previously held by cattle.\n\n=== Language ===\nThe people speak the [[Nuer language|Nuer language / Thoknath]] which belongs to the [[Nilo-Saharan]] [[Phylum (linguistics)|language phylum]].\n\n=== Ritual ===\nThe Nuer receive facial markings (called ''gaar'') as part of their initiation into adulthood.\nThe pattern of Nuer [[scarification]] varies within specific subgroups. The most common initiation pattern among males consists of six parallel horizontal lines which are cut across the forehead with a razor, often with a dip in the lines above the nose. Dotted patterns are also common (especially among the Bul Nuer and among females).{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSome Nuer have begun practicing [[circumcision]] after being assimilated or partially assimilated in other ethnic groups. The Nuer are not historically known to circumcise, but sometimes circumcise people who have engaged in incest.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nTypical foods eaten by the Nuer tribe include beef, goat, cow's milk, [[mango]]s, and [[sorghum]] in one of three forms: \"ko\u0331p\" finely ground, handled until balled and boiled, \"walwal\" ground, lightly balled and boiled to a solid porridge, and [[injera / Y\u0254ty\u0254t]], a large, pancake-like [[yeast]]-risen [[flatbread]].\n\nIn the early 1990s about 25,000 African refugees were [[third country resettlement|resettled]] in the United States throughout different locations such as South Dakota, Tennessee and Minnesota. In particular, 4,288 refugees from Sudan were resettled among 36 different states between 1990 and 1997 with the highest number in Texas at 17 percent of the refugee population from Sudan.{{sfnp|Shandy|2006|p=65}}\n\nThe Nuer refugees in the United States and those in Africa continue to observe their social obligations to one another. They use different means ranging from letters to new technologically advanced communication methods in order to stay connected to their families in Africa. Nuer in the United States provide assistance for family members\u2019 paperwork to help their migration process to the United States. Furthermore, Nuer in the United States observe family obligations by sending money for those still in Africa.{{sfnp|Shandy|2006|p=160}}\n\n== Nuer military and political leaders ==\nSome important Nuer politicians are Both Diu was the first Nuer and South Sudan Politician from 1947 and follow by Gai Tut in Military is Bol Nyawan who fought against the [[Khartoum]] government in [[Bentiu]]; he was killed in 1985 by the current president of Sudan. Commander Ruai and Liah Diu Deng were responsible for the attack that forced Chevron to suspend activities in the oil field around 1982.\n\n==Naming conventions==\n* ''(Nya) Nyada meaning \"daughter all females begin with (Nya) of\", is the standard prefix used for female names. ''Gat'', meaning \"son of\", is a common prefix for male names.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n* Children are commonly given names to mark historical events (\"D\u0254maac\" meaning \"bullet\", or ''Mac'' meaning \"fire or gun\" given to a child born during times of war or from another man in the name of the deceased father who legally married the mother ).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n* ''Nhial'' means \"sky\u201d, and is a common name for males and females. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n*Many Nuer have been exposed to missionaries and carry a Christian first name. Their second name is a given name and always in Nuer. The father's given name follows the child's given name, which is then followed by the grandfather's name, and so on. Many Nuer can easily recount ten generations of paternal lineage because they carry those names themselves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n*When a Nuer comes to the Western world, which wants a first and last name, it is their custom to give their name as their first name followed by their father's name as their middle name and their grandfather's name as their last name.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n* After the civil war, the Nuer began accepting cash currency into their economy, changing the dynamics of their cattle and how they were viewed. Each type of cattle is titled according to how they are acquired such as: \"the cattle of money\" (purchased with cash currency) and \"the cattle of girls/daughters\" (bridewealth).<ref name=HUTCH1992/>\n\nMost Nuer people are named after their cattle. The boys usually chose the name of their favorite cattle based on the form and color of the ox. The girls are named after the cows that they milk. Sometimes the cow names are passed down.{{sfnp|Evans-Pritchard|2016}}\n\n==Impact of Oil Economy on Nuer==\nOil exploration and drilling began in 1975 and 1976 by companies such as Chevron.  In 1979 the first oil production took place in the southern regions of Darfur. In the early 1980s when the North-South war was happening, Chevron was interested in the reserves in the south.  In 1984 guerrillas of SPLA (Sudan People's Liberation Army) attacked the drilling site of the north at Bentiu.  In return, Chevron cleared Nuer and Dinka people in the oil fields area to ensure security for their operations.{{sfnp|Lobban|2010|p=104}}\n\nThe Nuer-Dinka struggle in oil fields continued in late 1990s into the early 2000s. The struggle for oil production was not only manifested in North-South fight, but also in Nuer-Dinka and many internal conflicts among Nuer.{{sfnp|Lobban|2010|p=106}}\n\nAs part of Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), 50 percent of net revenues of southern oil fields were given to the government of southern Sudan as a solution to one of the sources of decades of civil conflict.{{sfnp|Shandy|2006|p=21}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lost Boys of Sudan]]\n*[[Dinka tribe]]\n*[[Anuak people]]\n*[[Nuer White Army]]\n*[[Sudanese nomadic conflicts]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Kuajien Lual Wechtuor, Yual Doctor Chiek and Peter Gai Manyuon, ''The Nuer Nation'', 2016, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, {{ISBN|978-1540632364}}\n*The works of [[E.

It is the most populated local council in the United Kingdom (excluding counties) with, following a reorganisation of boundaries in June 2004, 120 [[List of Birmingham City councillors|Birmingham City councillors]] representing over one million people, in 40 [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]].<ref name=\"wards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/wards|title=Birmingham City Council: Wards|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> This means that Birmingham is technically the largest city in the United Kingdom. The council headquarters are at the [[Council House, Birmingham|Council House]] in the city centre. The council is responsible for running nearly all local services, with the exception of those run by [[Joint-board|joint boards]]. The provision of certain services has in recent years been devolved to several council constituencies,<ref name=\"constituencies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/constituencies|title=Birmingham City Council: Constituencies|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> which each have a [[constituency committee]] made up of councillors from that district.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Common seal of the Mayor, Aldermen + Burgesses of the Borough of Birmingham.jpg|thumb|Common seal of the Mayor, Aldermen + Burgesses of the Borough of Birmingham, used after 1838 and until 1889]]\n\nThe original [[Charter of Incorporation]], dated 31 October 1838, was received in Birmingham on 1 November, then read in the [[Birmingham Town Hall|Town Hall]] on 5 November with elections for the first Town Council being held on 26 December. Sixteen Aldermen and 48 Councillors were elected and the Borough was divided into 13 wards. [[William Scholefield]] became the first Mayor and William Redfern was appointed as Town Clerk.\n\nIt was not until 14 January 1889 that another Charter conferred the rank of City on Birmingham. On 9 November 1891, the districts of [[Balsall Heath]], [[Harborne]], [[Saltley]] and [[Little Bromwich]] were absorbed into the City. The dignity of a [[Lord Mayor of Birmingham|Lord Mayor]] was conferred in 1896 and Sir James Smith Kt was appointed as the City's first Lord Mayor on 3 June 1896. The parish of [[Quinton, Birmingham|Quinton]] became part of Birmingham on 9 November 1909 and two years later, under what was termed 'The Greater Birmingham Scheme', the Boroughs of [[Aston Manor]], the [[Urban District of Handsworth]] and [[Urban District of Erdington|of Erdington]], part of the [[Urban District of Kings Norton and Northfield]] and the [[Rural District of Yardley]] were all incorporated. Such was the expansion involved that the Council Chamber, originally designed to accommodate 80 members, had to be modified to seat the representatives of the new wards. Further additions occurred on 1 April 1928 (part of the [[Urban District of Perry Barr]]) and 1 April 1931 (parts of the Parishes of [[Solihull]], [[Castle Bromwich]], [[Minworth]] and [[Sheldon, West Midlands|Sheldon]]). By 1972, there were 39 Wards each represented by an Alderman and 3 Councillors, a total of 156 Members.\n\nA major national re-organisation of local government was implemented in 1974 and saw the City of Birmingham being combined with the [[Borough of Sutton Coldfield]] to form the new Birmingham District Council consisting of 42 Wards each with 3 elected Councillors (in 1982 the number of Wards was reduced to 39). On 1 July 1986, the title was changed to Birmingham City Council. Part of [[Bromsgrove District]] known as [[Frankley and Kitwell Estates]] were added to the City on 1 April 1995. A review of the Ward boundaries on 10 June 2004 resulted in an increase from 39 Wards to 40 Wards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=SystemAdmin%2FCFPageLayout&cid=1223092734590&packedargs=website%3D4&pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FCFWrapper&rendermode=Live |title=History of the Council |publisher=Birmingham.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Women ===\n\nThe first woman elected  to the council, on 1 November 1911, was [[Ellen Pinsent]].<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite web|url=https://theironroom.wordpress.com/2015/03/04/my-whole-time-is-given-to-the-service-of-my-fellow-citizens-the-first-women-elected-to-birmingham-city-council/|title=\u2018My whole time is given to the service of my fellow citizens\u2019 \u2013 the first women elected to Birmingham City Council|last=Roberts|first=Sian|date=4 March 2015|publisher=[[Library of Birmingham]]|accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> She represented the Edgbaston Ward as a [[Liberal Unionist]].<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She had earlier been co-opted as a member of the council's Education Committee and served as Chairman of the Special School Sub-Committee.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She stood down from the council in October 1913 upon appointment as Commissioner for the [[Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency]].<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nPinsent's time on the council overlapped with that of [[Margaret Frances Pugh]], who was elected on 22 November 1911 to serve the in North Erdington ward.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She resigned in November 1913.<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nBirmingham's third woman councillor, [[Clara Martineau]], was elected on 14 October 1913 in the Edgbaston ward, and served until 1932, when she died, aged 57.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> Her father was former Mayor Sir [[Thomas Martineau]], Lord Mayor [[Ernest Martineau]] was her brother, and Alderman Sir [[George Kenrick]] was her uncle.<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nMary E.

They lost overall control in 2003 but continued to run the council as a minority administration for the following year. At the election of 10 June 2004, the 121 seats were divided between the Labour, (53 councillors), [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (39) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (28) parties. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat groups then formed a governing coalition, moving Labour into opposition.\n\nIn 2005, [[Richard Mawrey]] QC (as an election commissioner) ruled invalid Birmingham City Council elections in two wards, Aston and Bordesley Green, held the year before, and required re-votes. He blamed most of the [[electoral fraud]] on [[absentee ballot]] manipulation, and implicated the returning officer and six Labour councillors. By-elections and defections in 2005 altered the distribution of seats within the council with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] holding 46 seats, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] holding 40, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] holding 30, the [[People's Justice Party (UK)|People's Justice Party]] holding 2 and independent councillors holding a further 2.\n\nIn 2006, the People's Justice Party disbanded, with their two councillors joining the Liberal Democrats, and Councillor Ann Holtom defected from Labour to the Liberal Democrats. In the [[2006 United Kingdom local elections|2006 local elections]] the [[British National Party]] initially gained a seat, but it soon transpired their candidate's election had been caused by a counting error and the result was subsequently overturned in favour of the previously third-placed Labour party candidate following an election petition.<ref name=\"Post-2006-07-27\">{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Jonathan|date=27 July 2006|title=BNP never won seat on city council|journal=Birmingham Post|url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/news/tm_objectid=17458343&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=bnp-never-won-seat-on-city-council-name_page.html |accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[2008 Birmingham Council election|local elections on 1 May 2008]], there remained no overall control, with the 120 seats divided between [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (49 councillors), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], (36), [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (32) and [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]] (3).<ref name=\"birmingham.gov.uk\">[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/elections Birmingham City Council election service] Birmingham.gov.uk</ref> After the 2010 elections the seats were divided between [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (45 councillors), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], (41), [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (31) and [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]] (3).<ref name=\"birmingham.gov.uk\"/> The Conservatives' main local strongholds are in the [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Edgbaston]] constituencies.

It is the most populated local council in the United Kingdom (excluding counties) with, following a reorganisation of boundaries in June 2004, 120 [[List of Birmingham City councillors|Birmingham City councillors]] representing over one million people, in 40 [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]].<ref name=\"wards\">{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/wards|title=Birmingham City Council: Wards|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> This means that Birmingham is technically the largest city in the United Kingdom. The council headquarters are at the [[Council House, Birmingham|Council House]] in the city centre. The council is responsible for running nearly all local services, with the exception of those run by [[Joint-board|joint boards]]. The provision of certain services has in recent years been devolved to several council constituencies,<ref name=\"constituencies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/constituencies|title=Birmingham City Council: Constituencies|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> which each have a [[constituency committee]] made up of councillors from that district.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Common seal of the Mayor, Aldermen + Burgesses of the Borough of Birmingham.jpg|thumb|Common seal of the Mayor, Aldermen + Burgesses of the Borough of Birmingham, used after 1838 and until 1889]]\n\nThe original [[Charter of Incorporation]], dated 31 October 1838, was received in Birmingham on 1 November, then read in the [[Birmingham Town Hall|Town Hall]] on 5 November with elections for the first Town Council being held on 26 December. Sixteen Aldermen and 48 Councillors were elected and the Borough was divided into 13 wards. [[William Scholefield]] became the first Mayor and William Redfern was appointed as Town Clerk.\n\nIt was not until 14 January 1889 that another Charter conferred the rank of City on Birmingham. On 9 November 1891, the districts of [[Balsall Heath]], [[Harborne]], [[Saltley]] and [[Little Bromwich]] were absorbed into the City. The dignity of a [[Lord Mayor of Birmingham|Lord Mayor]] was conferred in 1896 and Sir James Smith Kt was appointed as the City's first Lord Mayor on 3 June 1896. The parish of [[Quinton, Birmingham|Quinton]] became part of Birmingham on 9 November 1909 and two years later, under what was termed 'The Greater Birmingham Scheme', the Boroughs of [[Aston Manor]], the [[Urban District of Handsworth]] and [[Urban District of Erdington|of Erdington]], part of the [[Urban District of Kings Norton and Northfield]] and the [[Rural District of Yardley]] were all incorporated. Such was the expansion involved that the Council Chamber, originally designed to accommodate 80 members, had to be modified to seat the representatives of the new wards. Further additions occurred on 1 April 1928 (part of the [[Urban District of Perry Barr]]) and 1 April 1931 (parts of the Parishes of [[Solihull]], [[Castle Bromwich]], [[Minworth]] and [[Sheldon, West Midlands|Sheldon]]). By 1972, there were 39 Wards each represented by an Alderman and 3 Councillors, a total of 156 Members.\n\nA major national re-organisation of local government was implemented in 1974 and saw the City of Birmingham being combined with the [[Borough of Sutton Coldfield]] to form the new Birmingham District Council consisting of 42 Wards each with 3 elected Councillors (in 1982 the number of Wards was reduced to 39). On 1 July 1986, the title was changed to Birmingham City Council. Part of [[Bromsgrove District]] known as [[Frankley and Kitwell Estates]] were added to the City on 1 April 1995. A review of the Ward boundaries on 10 June 2004 resulted in an increase from 39 Wards to 40 Wards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=SystemAdmin%2FCFPageLayout&cid=1223092734590&packedargs=website%3D4&pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FCFWrapper&rendermode=Live |title=History of the Council |publisher=Birmingham.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Women ===\n\nThe first woman elected  to the council, on 1 November 1911, was [[Ellen Pinsent]].<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite web|url=https://theironroom.wordpress.com/2015/03/04/my-whole-time-is-given-to-the-service-of-my-fellow-citizens-the-first-women-elected-to-birmingham-city-council/|title=\u2018My whole time is given to the service of my fellow citizens\u2019 \u2013 the first women elected to Birmingham City Council|last=Roberts|first=Sian|date=4 March 2015|publisher=[[Library of Birmingham]]|accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> She represented the Edgbaston Ward as a [[Liberal Unionist]].<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She had earlier been co-opted as a member of the council's Education Committee and served as Chairman of the Special School Sub-Committee.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She stood down from the council in October 1913 upon appointment as Commissioner for the [[Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency]].<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nPinsent's time on the council overlapped with that of [[Margaret Frances Pugh]], who was elected on 22 November 1911 to serve the in North Erdington ward.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> She resigned in November 1913.<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nBirmingham's third woman councillor, [[Clara Martineau]], was elected on 14 October 1913 in the Edgbaston ward, and served until 1932, when she died, aged 57.<ref name=\"Roberts\" /> Her father was former Mayor Sir [[Thomas Martineau]], Lord Mayor [[Ernest Martineau]] was her brother, and Alderman Sir [[George Kenrick]] was her uncle.<ref name=\"Roberts\" />\n\nMary E.

They lost overall control in 2003 but continued to run the council as a minority administration for the following year. At the election of 10 June 2004, the 121 seats were divided between the Labour, (53 councillors), [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (39) and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (28) parties. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat groups then formed a governing coalition, moving Labour into opposition.\n\nIn 2005, [[Richard Mawrey]] QC (as an election commissioner) ruled invalid Birmingham City Council elections in two wards, Aston and Bordesley Green, held the year before, and required re-votes. He blamed most of the [[electoral fraud]] on [[absentee ballot]] manipulation, and implicated the returning officer and six Labour councillors. By-elections and defections in 2005 altered the distribution of seats within the council with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] holding 46 seats, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] holding 40, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] holding 30, the [[People's Justice Party (UK)|People's Justice Party]] holding 2 and independent councillors holding a further 2.\n\nIn 2006, the People's Justice Party disbanded, with their two councillors joining the Liberal Democrats, and Councillor Ann Holtom defected from Labour to the Liberal Democrats. In the [[2006 United Kingdom local elections|2006 local elections]] the [[British National Party]] initially gained a seat, but it soon transpired their candidate's election had been caused by a counting error and the result was subsequently overturned in favour of the previously third-placed Labour party candidate following an election petition.<ref name=\"Post-2006-07-27\">{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Jonathan|date=27 July 2006|title=BNP never won seat on city council|journal=Birmingham Post|url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/news/tm_objectid=17458343&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=bnp-never-won-seat-on-city-council-name_page.html |accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[2008 Birmingham Council election|local elections on 1 May 2008]], there remained no overall control, with the 120 seats divided between [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (49 councillors), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], (36), [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (32) and [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]] (3).<ref name=\"birmingham.gov.uk\">[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/elections Birmingham City Council election service] Birmingham.gov.uk</ref> After the 2010 elections the seats were divided between [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (45 councillors), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], (41), [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] (31) and [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]] (3).<ref name=\"birmingham.gov.uk\"/> The Conservatives' main local strongholds are in the [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Edgbaston]] constituencies.

As a [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt freshman]] in [[2004 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|2004]], Adibi backed up Mikal Baquee.  He was injured during the first game against [[2004 USC Trojans football team|USC]] and returned for a Thursday night game against [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] in [[Atlanta]].  Against Georgia Tech, Adibi had a prolific game, making eight [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]], including two [[Quarterback sack|sacks]].  He had a key game-saving sack on a Georgia Tech fourth quarter scoring drive.  Georgia Tech had an opportunity to ice the game away, but Adibi's sack of [[Reggie Ball]] forced a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] and kept it a one-score game, which Virginia Tech would ultimately rally to win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.techsideline.com/football/2004/games/gtrecap.htm|title= Virginia Tech 34, Georgia Tech 20|last=Stewart|first=Will|date=October 28, 2004|accessdate=July 26, 2007|publisher=TechSideline}}</ref>\n\nAdibi earned the starting inside linebacker<ref>Adibi plays the \"backer\" position in Tech's defense, which aligns as the linebacker closest to the short side of the field, normally lining up between the two defensive tackles or between the tackle and end on the short side of the field.

The river is known for this valley and for its long thin [[River delta|delta]] entering Lake Mweru, usually referred to as the Luapula Swamps. The well-populated part of the valley starts north from Mambilima Falls, and along the rest of its length is nicknamed 'Mwapoleni Road', after the [[Chibemba]] greeting called out as people pass each other.<ref name=\"Lammond\" />\n\nFor many practical study purposes the lower Luapula and Mweru can be considered as one entity. They lie in a [[rift valley]] or [[graben]] once considered separate from the [[East African Rift]] but now seen as a branch of it. Mweru however drains not into [[Lake Tanganyika]] in the [[Albertine Rift]] but via the [[Luvua River]], which has cut a deep, narrow zigzag valley to join the [[Lualaba River]], as the upper Congo is named. The Luapula is part of the longest tributary of the Congo, and hence, by convention, is part of its source, even though the upper Lualaba carries more water.\n\nOverlying the edge of the rift valley 60&nbsp;km west of the Luapula Swamps is the [[Luizi crater|Luizi structure]], a 12.6&nbsp;km wide series of concentric rings. It has been recently confirmed as a [[Astrobleme|meteoritic impact crater (an astrobleme)]] formed less than 600 million years ago.<ref>{{Cite Earth Impact DB | name = Luizi | accessdate = 2016-04-08}}</ref><ref name=\"Master\">\n[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2001/pdf/5182.pdf P Master, P.

The Luizi structure can be seen on Google Earth at decimal latitude/longitude 10.16 S, 28.00 E.</ref>\n\n== The Luapula Swamps ==\n\nThe swamps stretch along the last 100&nbsp;km of the river before it reaches the lake, and for much of that they are 30&nbsp;km wide, covering an area of about 2500&nbsp;km\u00b2. There are four inhabited islands in the DR Congo part of the delta, including the largest in the system which is connected to dry land in the dry season. Zambia has three inhabited islands in the delta including Chisenga Island. There are also many lagoons, the largest of which is [[Mofwe Lagoon]] on the Zambian side.<ref name=\"Google\" />\n\nAs in the Bangweulu Swamps, floating beds of [[papyrus]] are a feature of the swamps, which often block channels and change the shape of lagoons. However, the main river channel does not get blocked and stays consistently about 400&nbsp;m wide. It has not developed the branching channels typical of river deltas.<ref name=\"Google\" />\n\nVery tall [[Phragmites|reeds]] grow at the edge of the swamps in most places, making it difficult to see over the lagoons from land or to find the way to the maze of narrow channels used by [[Dugout (boat)|dugout]] canoes. Guides are needed to navigate through them, and they are a haven for smuggling between the two countries sharing the swamps.\n\n[[Crocodile]] and [[hippopotamus]] are common and a hazard for fishermen and travellers. However, the Shila people used to hunt hippopotamus using nothing more than harpoons thrown from canoes.<ref name=\"Lammond\" />\n\nOn the western side of the delta in DR Congo is a broad grassy floodplain covering about 1600&nbsp;km\u00b2. At the end of the rainy season the combined Luapula wetlands exceed 4000&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref name=\"Google\" /> The floodplain was home to herds of [[lechwe]] and the shy [[sitatunga]], the famous semi-aquatic antelopes of the region, but both are believed extinct in the lower Luapula due to hunting and the lack of wildlife management.\n\n== Human settlement ==\n\nThe upper and middle reaches of the Luapula are quite sparsely populated.\n\nThe natural resources of the lower valley, which include fisheries in the river, lagoons and wetlands with fertile farmland at the margins, attracted the [[Eastern Lunda|Lunda]] invaders of [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]] to settle there around 1750. Their present capital is at [[Mwansabombwe]] on the edge of the delta. [[Arab]] traders and slavers from [[Zanzibar]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders from [[Mozambique]] were attracted to the area in the 18th and 19th Centuries. [[David Livingstone]] was the first [[United Kingdom|Briton]] to visit in 1867. He did not explore the river but in his hunt for the origin of the [[Nile]], Mwata Kazembe was the first to tell him that the Luapula connects the Chambeshi/Bangweulu and Mweru/Luvua/Lualaba systems. Livingstone wrongly believed the Lualaba then flowed to the Nile rather than to the River Congo.<ref name=\"DL\" />\n\nSome of the first missionaries in Central Africa were also attracted to the valley. The first was the [[Garanganze Mission]] of the [[Plymouth Brethren]] at Mambilima around 1892, followed by the [[London Missionary Society]] at [[Mbereshi]] in 1900.<ref>Bwalya S Chuba: \"Mbeleshi in a history of the London Missionary Society\", Pula Press, Gaborone (2000).</ref>\n\nThe first large town of the colonial era was the river port, [[Kasenga]], in DR Congo, which grew prosperous in the 1930s from supplying fish to [[Lubumbashi|Elizabethville]] and other towns of the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] [[Copperbelt]] via the first motor road to reach the valley. Most of the fish was caught in Lake Mweru and brought by boat up the Luapula to Kasenga, where it was packed in ice produced in several plants. Although the fish catch has declined and most now travels on the better roads of Zambia, Kasenga remains the only port on the river.<ref name=\"Lammond\" /> For more on the [[Fishery|fisheries]] of the area, see ''[[Lake Mweru]]''.\n\nOn the Zambian side of the Luapula, an outbreak of [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] made the [[British Empire|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial]] authorities move their Fort Rosebery [[Boma (enclosure)|boma]] out of the valley onto the plateau at [[Mansa, Zambia|Mansa]],<ref name=\"Lammond\" /> while fears of [[malaria]] in the Luapula Swamps made them establish the next on the plateau at [[Kawambwa]]. Consequently, the towns and villages in the valley, such as the largest, [[Mwansabombwe]], do not have the same ex-colonial character as the administrative towns. However, following the lead of missionary builders and Mwata Kazembe, from the early 1900s most housing in the valley was of solid brick construction, [[mudbrick|sun-dried brick]] mainly, but with some burnt brick.<ref name=\"Lammond\" />\n\n== Water transport on the Luapula ==\n\nBefore the advent of road transport, people travelled by canoe along the river between lakes Bangweulu and Mweru.<ref name=\"DL\" />\n\nThe lower river between Kasenga and Kilwa on Mweru is now the only stretch of the river carrying much boat transport and most of that is now for DR Congo, where roads are frequently impassable. Up to the late 1940s, the upper Luapula from Kapalala to Lake Bangweulu and the Chambeshi River was one of the most important stretches for river transport in the then [[Northern Rhodesia]]. Goods travelled by road from the [[railhead]] at Sakania 10&nbsp;km north of [[Ndola]] to Kapalala to be loaded onto dugout canoes and small boats. During [[World War I]], a fleet of 1885 such craft were used to convey [[mat\u00e9riel]] to Chambeshi from where it went on a military road to [[Mbala, Zambia|Mbala]] for the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]]. Unfortunately the floating papyrus and other vegetation frequently choked the channels through the Bangweulu swamps joining the lake, the Luapula and the Chambeshi, making it difficult to use larger motorboats.<ref>[http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V3N3/V3N3.htm NRZAM website: H.

None remain, though a passenger ferry operates between Kasenga and Kashiba, Zambia. Around 1950 the [[Chembe Ferry]] on the [[Congo Pedicle road]] became on the main vehicle crossing. The river there is 400&nbsp;m wide but can flood to 1&nbsp;km wide in a heavy rainy season. In 1983 the first bridge over the river was built, the 2.5-kilometre long [[Luapula Bridge]] on the [[Samfya]]-[[Serenje]] Road. The bridge approaches include nearly 20&nbsp;km of elevated causeway over wetlands and another 40&nbsp;km of embankment over flood plain.<ref name=\"Google\" /> The second bridge over the river, the 320-metre long [[Chembe Bridge]] is under construction for completion in 2008.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Lake Mweru]]\n* [[Mofwe Lagoon]]\n* [[Lake Bangweulu]] ''includes a similar satellite map''\n* [[Chambeshi River]]\n* [[Congo Pedicle]] ''with map showing the river's course''\n* [[Luvua River]]\n* [[Congo River]]\n* [[Katanga Province]]\n* [[Luapula Province]]\n* [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* Camerapix: \"Spectrum Guide to Zambia.\" Camerapix International Publishing, Nairobi, 1996.\n\n{{Rivers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\n{{Rivers of Zambia}}\n\n{{coord|9.41384|S|28.52188|E|type:river_region:ZM|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Luapula River| ]]\n[[Category:International rivers of Africa]]\n[[Category:Rivers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Zambia]]\n[[Category:Lake Bangweulu]]\n[[Category:Lake Mweru]]\n[[Category:Miombo]]\n[[Category:Border rivers]]\n[[Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2013Zambia border]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Luvua - Luapula - Chambeshi River DRC.svg|thumb|The Luapula River is the middle stretch in red.]]\n[[File:Mweru-Luapula.jpg|thumb|260px|The lower Luapula River, its delta where it enters Lake Mweru, and Mweru's outlet, the Luvua River going on north to the Lualaba and Congo rivers.

Although the fish catch has declined and most now travels on the better roads of Zambia, Kasenga remains the only port on the river.<ref name=\"Lammond\" /> For more on the [[Fishery|fisheries]] of the area, see ''[[Lake Mweru]]''.\n\nOn the Zambian side of the Luapula, an outbreak of [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] made the [[British Empire|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial]] authorities move their Fort Rosebery [[Boma (enclosure)|boma]] out of the valley onto the plateau at [[Mansa, Zambia|Mansa]],<ref name=\"Lammond\" /> while fears of [[malaria]] in the Luapula Swamps made them establish the next on the plateau at [[Kawambwa]]. Consequently, the towns and villages in the valley, such as the largest, [[Mwansabombwe]], do not have the same ex-colonial character as the administrative towns. However, following the lead of missionary builders and Mwata Kazembe, from the early 1900s most housing in the valley was of solid brick construction, [[mudbrick|sun-dried brick]] mainly, but with some burnt brick.<ref name=\"Lammond\" />\n\n== Water Transport on the Luapula ==\n\nBefore the advent of road transport, people travelled by canoe along the river between lakes Bangweulu and Mweru.<ref name=\"DL\" />\n\nThe lower river between Kasenga and Kilwa on Mweru is now the only stretch of the river carrying much boat transport and most of that is now for DR Congo, where roads are frequently impassable. Up to the late 1940s, the upper Luapula from Kapalala to Lake Bangweulu and the Chambeshi River was one of the most important stretches for river transport in the then [[Northern Rhodesia]]. Goods travelled by road from the [[railhead]] at Sakania 10&nbsp;km north of [[Ndola]] to Kapalala to be loaded onto dugout canoes and small boats. During [[World War I]], a fleet of 1885 such craft were used to convey [[mat\u00e9riel]] to Chambeshi from where it went on a military road to [[Mbala, Zambia|Mbala]] for the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]]. Unfortunately the floating papyrus and other vegetation frequently choked the channels through the Bangweulu swamps joining the lake, the Luapula and the Chambeshi, making it difficult to use larger motorboats.<ref>[http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V3N3/V3N3.htm NRZAM website: H.

None remain, though a passenger ferry operates between Kasenga and Kashiba, Zambia. Around 1950 the [[Chembe Ferry]] on the [[Congo Pedicle road]] became on the main vehicle crossing. The river there is 400&nbsp;m wide but can flood to 1&nbsp;km wide in a heavy rainy season. In 1983 the first bridge over the river was built, the 2.5-kilometre long [[Luapula Bridge]] on the [[Samfya]]-[[Serenje]] Road. The bridge approaches include nearly 20&nbsp;km of elevated causeway over wetlands and another 40&nbsp;km of embankment over flood plain.<ref name=\"Google\" /> The second bridge over the river, the 320-metre long [[Chembe Bridge]] is under construction for completion in 2008.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Lake Mweru]]\n* [[Mofwe Lagoon]]\n* [[Lake Bangweulu]] ''includes a similar satellite map''\n* [[Chambeshi River]]\n* [[Congo Pedicle]] ''with map showing the river's course''\n* [[Luvua River]]\n* [[Congo River]]\n* [[Katanga Province]]\n* [[Luapula Province]]\n* [[Kazembe|Mwata Kazembe]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* Camerapix: \"Spectrum Guide to Zambia.\" Camerapix International Publishing, Nairobi, 1996.\n\n{{Rivers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\n{{Rivers of Zambia}}\n\n{{coord|9.41384|S|28.52188|E|type:river_region:ZM|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Luapula River| ]]\n[[Category:International rivers of Africa]]\n[[Category:Rivers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Zambia]]\n[[Category:Lake Bangweulu]]\n[[Category:Lake Mweru]]\n[[Category:Miombo]]\n[[Category:Border rivers]]\n[[Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2013Zambia border]]\n", "name_user": "DB1729", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:SECTIONCAPS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luapula_River"}
