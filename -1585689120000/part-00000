Correspondingly, the GDP per capita doubled from $1400 per person in 2000 to an estimated $2,800 per person in 2012 (again, with the inclusion of the informal sector, it is estimated that GDP per capita hovers around $3,900 per person). (Population increased from 120 million in 2000 to 160 million in 2010).

The purpose of the NEEDS was to raise the country's [[standard of living]] through a variety of reforms, including macroeconomic stability, [[deregulation]], [[liberalization]], [[privatization]], transparency, and accountability.\n\nThe NEEDS addressed basic deficiencies, such as the lack of freshwater for household use and irrigation, unreliable power supplies, decaying infrastructure, impediments to private enterprise, and corruption. NEEDS was intended to create 7 million new jobs, diversify the economy, boost non-energy exports, increase industrial capacity utilization, and improve agricultural productivity. A related initiative on the state level is the State Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (SEEDS).\n\nA longer-term economic development program is the United Nations (UN)-sponsored National Millennium Goals for Nigeria. Under the program, which covers the years from 2000 to 2015, Nigeria is committed to achieving a wide range of ambitious objectives involving poverty reduction, education, gender equality, health, the environment, and international development cooperation. In an update released in 2004, the UN found that Nigeria was making progress toward achieving several goals but was falling short on others.\n\nSpecifically, Nigeria had advanced efforts to provide universal primary education, protect the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christenseninstitute.org/blog/why-innovation-must-be-the-new-development-strategy/|title=Why innovation must be the new development strategy|date=2017-01-19|website=Christensen Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourcommonwealth.org/uncategorized/nigerias-challenge-universal-primary-education/|title=\u201cNigeria\u2019s challenge \u2013 universal primary education\u201d {{!}} YourCommonwealth|website=www.yourcommonwealth.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\nA prerequisite for achieving many of these worthwhile objectives is curtailing endemic corruption, which stymies development and taints Nigeria's business environment. President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]'s campaign against corruption, which includes the arrest of officials accused of misdeeds and recovering stolen funds, has won praise from the [[World Bank]]. In September 2005, Nigeria, with the assistance of the World Bank, began to recover US$458 million of illicit funds that had been deposited in Swiss banks by the late military dictator Sani Abacha, who ruled Nigeria from 1993 to 1998. However, while broad-based progress has been slow, these efforts have begun to become evident in international surveys of corruption. Nigeria's ranking has consistently improved since 2001 ranking 147 out of 180 countries in [[Transparency International]]'s 2007 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].\n\nThe Nigerian economy suffers from an ongoing [[Nigerian energy supply crisis|supply crisis in the power sector]]. Despite a rapidly growing economy, some of the world's [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|largest deposits of coal, oil and gas]] and the country's status as Africa's largest oil producer, power supply difficulties are frequently experienced by residents.\n\n== Economic history ==\n{{Further|Economic history of Nigeria}}\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Nigeria at market prices estimated<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 estimated]</ref> by the [[International Monetary Fund]] with figures in USD billions. Figures before 2000 are backwards projections from the 2000\u20132012 numbers, based on historical growth rates, and should be replaced when data becomes available. The figure for 2014 is derived from a rebasing of economical activity earlier in the year.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This rate ranged from a high of 520 in March 2017 to a low of 350 in August 2017, due to a scarcity of forex (oil earnings had dropped by half), and to speculative activity as alleged by the Central Bank. All the while the official rate was pegged at 360.\n\nPer capita income (as % of USA) is calculated using data from estimates in the PPP link above, and from census estimates, based on growth rates between census periods. For instance 2017 GDPs were 1,125 Billion (Nigeria) vs. 19,417 Billion (USA) and populations were estimated at 320 million vs 190 million.

Nigeria's goal under the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS) program is to reduce inflation to the single digits. By 2015, Nigeria's inflation stood at 9%. In 2005, the federal government had expenditures of US$13.54 billion but revenues of only US$12.86 billion, resulting in a budget deficit of 5%.

[[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] production, mostly from obsolete varieties and overage trees has increased from around 180,000 tons annually to 350,000 tons.\n\nMajor agricultural products include [[Cassava production in Nigeria|cassava]] (tapioca), corn, cocoa, millet, palm oil, peanuts, rice, rubber, sorghum, and yams. In 2003, livestock production, in order of metric tonnage, featured eggs, milk, beef and veal, poultry, and pork, respectively. In the same year, the total fishing catch was 505.8 metric tons. Roundwood removals totaled slightly less than 70 million cubic meters, and sawnwood production was estimated at 2 million cubic meters. The agricultural sector suffers from extremely low productivity, reflecting reliance on antiquated methods. Agriculture has failed to keep pace with Nigeria's rapid population growth, so that the country, which once exported food, now imports a significant amount of food to sustain itself. However, efforts are being made towards making the country food sufficient again.\n\n===Oil===\n{{Further|Petroleum industry in Nigeria}}\nNigeria's proven [[oil reserves]] are estimated to be {{convert|35|Goilbbl|m3}}; natural gas reserves are well over {{convert|100|Tcuft|km3}}. Nigeria is a member of the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC). The types of [[crude oil]] exported by Nigeria are [[Bonny light oil]], [[Forcados crude oil]], [[Qua Ibo crude oil]] and [[Brass River crude oil]]. Poor corporate relations with indigenous communities, vandalism of oil infrastructure, severe ecological damage, and personal security problems throughout the [[Niger Delta]] oil-producing region continue to plague Nigeria's oil sector.\n\nEfforts are underway{{When|date=April 2017}} to reverse these troubles. A new entity, the [[Niger Delta Development Commission]] (NDDC), has been created to help catalyze economic and social development in the region. The U.S. remains Nigeria's largest buyer of crude oil, accounting for 40% of the country's total oil exports; Nigeria provides about 10% of overall U.S. oil imports and ranks as the fifth-largest source for U.S. imported oil.\n\nThe United Kingdom is Nigeria's largest trading partner followed by the United States. Although the trade balance overwhelmingly favors Nigeria, thanks to oil exports, a large portion of U.S. exports to Nigeria is believed to enter the country outside of the Nigerian government's official statistics, due to importers seeking to avoid Nigeria's tariffs. To counter smuggling and under-invoicing by importers, in May 2001, the Nigerian government instituted a full inspection program for all imports, and enforcement has been sustained.\n\nOn the whole, Nigerian high tariffs and non-tariff barriers are gradually being reduced,{{When|date=April 2017}} but much progress remains to be made.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} The government also has been encouraging the expansion of foreign investment, although the country's investment climate remains daunting to all but the most determined.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} The stock of U.S. investment is nearly $7 billion, mostly in the energy sector. [[Exxon Mobil]] and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] are the two largest U.S. corporations in offshore oil and gas production. Significant exports of liquefied natural gas started in late 1999 and are slated to expand as Nigeria seeks to eliminate gas flaring by 2008.\n\nThe pump price of P.M.S. currently{{When|date=April 2017}} stands at around \u20a6145 at fueling stations across Nigeria. An initial increase in the price of petrol (Premium Motor Spirit) from around \u20a665 to \u20a6140 triggered by the removal of fuel subsidies on January 1, 2012, triggered a total strike and massive protests across the country. Then President [[Goodluck Ebele Jonathan]] later reached an agreement with the [[Nigerian Labour Congress]] and reduced the pump price to 97 naira. The pump price was further reduced by 10 naira to 87 naira in the run-up to the 2015 general elections. However, after the elections of [[Muhammadu Buhari]], the fuel subsidies was removed again, and the pump price increased again, despite the fall in oil price.\n \nSince the fall in oil prices in 2015 and 2016, the government exchange rate policy has limited devaluation of the naira due to inflation concerns by the President Muhammadu Buhari.<ref name=\"Can you spare a dollar\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21695065-how-make-hard-currency-shortage-worse-can-you-spare-dollar|title=Can you spare a dollar?|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pulse.ng/local/buhari-why-president-should-devalue-naira-chuba-ezekwesili-video-id4824955.html|title=Buhari: Why President should devalue naira \u2013 Chuba Ezekwesili [VIDEO]|last=Sotubo|first='Jola|website=pulse.ng|access-date=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Services===\nNigeria [[List of countries by GDP sector composition|ranks 27th]] worldwide and first in Africa in services' output.\n\nSince undergoing severe distress in the mid-1990s, Nigeria's banking sector has witnessed significant growth over the last few years{{When|date=April 2017}} as new banks enter the financial market.\n\nPrivate sector-led economic growth remains stymied by the high cost of doing business in Nigeria, including the need to duplicate essential infrastructure, the lack of effective due process, and nontransparent economic decision making, especially in government contracting. While corrupt practices are endemic, they are generally less flagrant than during military rule, and there are signs of improvement. Meanwhile, since 1999 the Nigerian Stock Exchange has enjoyed strong performance, although equity as a means to foster corporate growth is being more utilized by Nigeria's private sector.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Transport====\n{{main|Transport in Nigeria}}\n\n[[File:Lagos Life goes on.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Minibuses in Lagos]]\nNigeria's publicly owned transportation infrastructure is a major constraint to economic development. Principal ports are at [[Lagos]] ([[Apapa]] and [[Tin Can Island]]), [[Port Harcourt]] (Onne), and [[Calabar]].\n\nExtensive road repairs and new construction activities are gradually being implemented as state governments, in particular, spend their portions of enhanced government revenue allocations.\n\nFive of Nigeria's airports (Lagos, [[Kano]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Enugu]] and [[Abuja]]) currently fly to international destinations. The [[Nigerian Airforce]] began a new airline called United Nigeria, with a [[Boeing 737-500]] in 2013.

On the African continent, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Libya and South Africa are important source countries of remittance flows to Nigeria, while China is the biggest remittance-sending country in Asia.\n\n==Labour force==\nIn 2015, Nigeria had a labour force of 74 million. In 2003, the unemployment rate was 10.8% overall; by 2015, unemployment stood at 6.4%.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.punchng.com/business/business-economy/only-4-67-million-nigerians-are-unemployed-nbs/ | title=Only 4.67 million Nigerians are unemployed \u2014NBS | publisher=The Punch Newspaper | date=15 May 2015 | access-date=17 May 2015 | author=Onuba, Ifeanyi | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526214618/http://www.punchng.com/business/business-economy/only-4-67-million-nigerians-are-unemployed-nbs/ | archivedate=26 May 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSince 1999, the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) a union umbrella organization, has called six general strikes to protest domestic fuel price increases. However, in March 2005 the government introduced legislation ending the NLC's monopoly over union organizing. In December 2005, the NLC was lobbying for an increase in the minimum wage for federal workers. The existing minimum wage, which was introduced six years earlier but has not been adjusted since, has been whittled away by inflation to only US$42.80 per month.\n\nAccording to the [[International Organization for Migration]], the number of [[immigrants]] residing in Nigeria has more than doubled in recent decades \u2013 from 477,135 in 1991 to 971,450 in 2005. The majority of immigrants in Nigeria (74%) are from neighbouring [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), and that this number has increased considerably over the last decade, from 63% in 2001 to 97% in 2005.\n\n===Human capital===\n{{Further|Education in Nigeria}}\nThe [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) shows in 2012 that Nigeria is ranked 156 with the value of 0.459 among 187 countries. As of 2015, Nigeria's HDI is ranked 152nd at 0.514.

The expected years of schooling in Nigeria is 9.0 (16.00 in the US), while the mean years of schooling for adults over 25 years is 5.2 years (12.4 years in the US). Additionally, Nigeria is also facing a relatively high inequality, worsening the problem regarding the formation of human capital. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report|title=World's 26 richest people own as much as poorest 50%, says Oxfam|last=Elliott|first=Larry|date=2019-01-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldpoverty.io/|title=World Poverty Clock|website=worldpoverty.io|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n== Government policy ==\n\n=== Inflation ===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2017}}In the light of highly expansionary public sector fiscal policies in 2001, the government sought ways to head off higher inflation, leading to the implementation of stronger monetary policies by the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] (CBN) and underspending of budgeted amounts. As a result of the CBN's efforts, the official exchange rate for the Naira had stabilized at about 112 Naira to the dollar. The combination of CBN's efforts to prop up the value of the Naira and excess liquidity resulting from government spending led the currency to be discounted by around 20% on the parallel (non-official) market.\n\nA key condition of the Stand-by Arrangement has been closure of the gap between the official and parallel market exchange rates. The [[Inter Bank Foreign Exchange Market]] (IFEM) is closely tied to the official rate. Under IFEM, banks, oil companies, and the CBN can buy or sell their foreign exchange at government-influenced rates. Much of the informal economy, however, can only access foreign exchange through the parallel market. Companies can hold domiciliary accounts in private banks, and account holders have unfettered use of the funds.\n\nExpanded government spending also has led to upward pressure on consumer prices. Inflation which had almost disappeared in April 2000 reached 14.5% by the end of the year and 18.7% in August 2001. In 2000, high oil prices resulted in government revenue of over $16 billion, about double the 1999 level. State and local governments demanded access to this \"windfall\" revenue, creating a tug-of-war between the federal government, which sought to control spending, and state governments desiring augmented budgets, preventing the government from making provision for periods of lower oil prices.\n\nIn 2016, the black market exchange rate of the Naira was about 60% above the official rate. The central bank releases about $200 million each week at the official exchange rate. However, some companies cite that budgets now include a 30% \u201cpremium\u201d to be paid to central bank officials to get dollars.<ref name=\"Can you spare a dollar\"/>\n\n===Gradual reform===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2017}}The Obasanjo government supported \"private-sector\" led, \"market oriented\" [[economic growth]] and began extensive economic reform efforts. Although the government's anti-corruption campaign was left wanting, progress in injecting transparency and accountability into economic decision-making was notable. The dual exchange rate mechanism formally abolished in the 1999 budget remains in place in actuality.\n\nDuring 2000 the government's privatization program showed signs of life and real promise with successful turnover to the private sector of state-owned banks, fuel distribution companies, and cement plants. However, the privatization process has slowed somewhat as the government confronts key parastatals such as the state telephone company [[NITEL]] and Nigerian Airways. The successful auction of GSM telecommunications licenses in January 2001 has encouraged investment in this vital sector.\n\nAlthough the government has been stymied so far in its desire to deregulate downstream petroleum prices, state refineries, almost paralyzed in 2000, are producing at much higher capacities. By August 2001, gasoline lines disappeared throughout much of the country. The government still intends to pursue deregulation despite significant internal opposition, particularly from the [[Nigeria Labour Congress]]. To meet market demand the government incurs large losses importing gasoline to sell at subsidized prices.\n\n==Foreign economic relations==\nNigeria's foreign economic relations revolve around its role in supplying the world economy with oil and natural gas, even as the country seeks to diversify its exports, harmonize tariffs in line with a potential [[customs union]] sought by the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), and encourage inflows of foreign portfolio and direct investment. In October 2005, Nigeria implemented the ECOWAS [[common external tariff]], which reduced the number of tariff bands.\n\nPrior to this revision, tariffs constituted Nigeria's second largest source of revenue after oil exports. In 2005 Nigeria achieved a major breakthrough when it reached an agreement with the Paris Club to eliminate its bilateral debt through a combination of write-downs and buybacks. Nigeria joined the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] in July 1971 and the [[World Trade Organization]] in January 1995.\n\n===External trade===\n[[Image:2006Nigeria exports.PNG|thumb|upright=2|Nigeria's exports in 2006.]]\n[[File:Nigeria Export Treemap (2011).png|upright=2|thumb|A proportional representation of Nigeria's exports.]]\nIn 2017, Nigeria imported about US$34.2 billion of goods.

In 2005, Nigeria achieved a positive current account balance of US$9.6 billion. The Nigerian currency is the [[naira]] (NGN). As of June 2006, the [[exchange rate]] was about US$1=NGN128.4. As of June 2019, it stands at US$1 =NGN357. In recent years, Nigeria has expanded its trade relations with other developing countries such as India.

The purpose of the NEEDS was to raise the country's [[standard of living]] through a variety of reforms, including macroeconomic stability, [[deregulation]], [[liberalization]], [[privatization]], transparency, and accountability.\n\nThe NEEDS addressed basic deficiencies, such as the lack of freshwater for household use and irrigation, unreliable power supplies, decaying infrastructure, impediments to private enterprise, and corruption. NEEDS was intended to create 7 million new jobs, diversify the economy, boost non-energy exports, increase industrial capacity utilization, and improve agricultural productivity. A related initiative on the state level is the State Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (SEEDS).\n\nA longer-term economic development program is the United Nations (UN)-sponsored National Millennium Goals for Nigeria. Under the program, which covers the years from 2000 to 2015, Nigeria is committed to achieving a wide range of ambitious objectives involving poverty reduction, education, gender equality, health, the environment, and international development cooperation. In an update released in 2004, the UN found that Nigeria was making progress toward achieving several goals but was falling short on others.\n\nSpecifically, Nigeria had advanced efforts to provide universal primary education, protect the environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christenseninstitute.org/blog/why-innovation-must-be-the-new-development-strategy/|title=Why innovation must be the new development strategy|date=2017-01-19|website=Christensen Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourcommonwealth.org/uncategorized/nigerias-challenge-universal-primary-education/|title=\u201cNigeria\u2019s challenge \u2013 universal primary education\u201d {{!}} YourCommonwealth|website=www.yourcommonwealth.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\nA prerequisite for achieving many of these worthwhile objectives is curtailing endemic corruption, which stymies development and taints Nigeria's business environment. President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]'s campaign against corruption, which includes the arrest of officials accused of misdeeds and recovering stolen funds, has won praise from the [[World Bank]]. In September 2005, Nigeria, with the assistance of the World Bank, began to recover US$458 million of illicit funds that had been deposited in Swiss banks by the late military dictator Sani Abacha, who ruled Nigeria from 1993 to 1998. However, while broad-based progress has been slow, these efforts have begun to become evident in international surveys of corruption. Nigeria's ranking has consistently improved since 2001 ranking 147 out of 180 countries in [[Transparency International]]'s 2007 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].\n\nThe Nigerian economy suffers from an ongoing [[Nigerian energy supply crisis|supply crisis in the power sector]]. Despite a rapidly growing economy, some of the world's [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|largest deposits of coal, oil and gas]] and the country's status as Africa's largest oil producer, power supply difficulties are frequently experienced by residents.\n\n== Economic history ==\n{{Further|Economic history of Nigeria}}\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Nigeria at market prices estimated<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 estimated]</ref> by the [[International Monetary Fund]] with figures in USD billions. Figures before 2000 are backwards projections from the 2000\u20132012 numbers, based on historical growth rates, and should be replaced when data becomes available.

This rate ranged from a high of 520 in March 2017 to a low of 350 in August 2017, due to a scarcity of forex (oil earnings had dropped by half), and to speculative activity as alleged by the Central Bank. All the while the official rate was pegged at 360.\n\nPer capita income (as % of USA) is calculated using data from estimates in the PPP link above, and from census estimates, based on growth rates between census periods. For instance 2017 GDPs were 1,125 Billion (Nigeria) vs. 19,417 Billion (USA) and populations were estimated at 320 million vs 190 million. The ratio is therefore (1125/19417) / (190/320), which roughly comes to 0.0975.

Nigeria's goal under the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS) program is to reduce inflation to the single digits. By 2015, Nigeria's inflation stood at 9%. In 2005, the federal government had expenditures of US$13.54 billion but revenues of only US$12.86 billion, resulting in a budget deficit of 5%.

[[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] production, mostly from obsolete varieties and overage trees has increased from around 180,000 tons annually to 350,000 tons.\n\nMajor agricultural products include [[Cassava production in Nigeria|cassava]] (tapioca), corn, cocoa, millet, palm oil, peanuts, rice, rubber, sorghum, and yams. In 2003, livestock production, in order of metric tonnage, featured eggs, milk, beef and veal, poultry, and pork, respectively. In the same year, the total fishing catch was 505.8 metric tons. Roundwood removals totaled slightly less than 70 million cubic meters, and sawnwood production was estimated at 2 million cubic meters. The agricultural sector suffers from extremely low productivity, reflecting reliance on antiquated methods. Agriculture has failed to keep pace with Nigeria's rapid population growth, so that the country, which once exported food, now imports a significant amount of food to sustain itself. However, efforts are being made towards making the country food sufficient again.\n\n===Oil===\n{{Further|Petroleum industry in Nigeria}}\nNigeria's proven [[oil reserves]] are estimated to be {{convert|35|Goilbbl|m3}}; natural gas reserves are well over {{convert|100|Tcuft|km3}}. Nigeria is a member of the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC). The types of [[crude oil]] exported by Nigeria are [[Bonny light oil]], [[Forcados crude oil]], [[Qua Ibo crude oil]] and [[Brass River crude oil]]. Poor corporate relations with indigenous communities, vandalism of oil infrastructure, severe ecological damage, and personal security problems throughout the [[Niger Delta]] oil-producing region continue to plague Nigeria's oil sector.\n\nEfforts are underway{{When|date=April 2017}} to reverse these troubles. A new entity, the [[Niger Delta Development Commission]] (NDDC), has been created to help catalyze economic and social development in the region. The U.S. remains Nigeria's largest buyer of crude oil, accounting for 40% of the country's total oil exports; Nigeria provides about 10% of overall U.S. oil imports and ranks as the fifth-largest source for U.S. imported oil.\n\nThe United Kingdom is Nigeria's largest trading partner followed by the United States. Although the trade balance overwhelmingly favors Nigeria, thanks to oil exports, a large portion of U.S. exports to Nigeria is believed to enter the country outside of the Nigerian government's official statistics, due to importers seeking to avoid Nigeria's tariffs. To counter smuggling and under-invoicing by importers, in May 2001, the Nigerian government instituted a full inspection program for all imports, and enforcement has been sustained.\n\nOn the whole, Nigerian high tariffs and non-tariff barriers are gradually being reduced,{{When|date=April 2017}} but much progress remains to be made.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} The government also has been encouraging the expansion of foreign investment, although the country's investment climate remains daunting to all but the most determined.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} The stock of U.S. investment is nearly $7 billion, mostly in the energy sector. [[Exxon Mobil]] and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] are the two largest U.S. corporations in offshore oil and gas production. Significant exports of liquefied natural gas started in late 1999 and are slated to expand as Nigeria seeks to eliminate gas flaring by 2008.\n\nThe pump price of P.M.S. currently{{When|date=April 2017}} stands at around \u20a6145 at fueling stations across Nigeria. An initial increase in the price of petrol (Premium Motor Spirit) from around \u20a665 to \u20a6140 triggered by the removal of fuel subsidies on January 1, 2012, triggered a total strike and massive protests across the country. Then President [[Goodluck Ebele Jonathan]] later reached an agreement with the [[Nigerian Labour Congress]] and reduced the pump price to 97 naira. The pump price was further reduced by 10 naira to 87 naira in the run-up to the 2015 general elections. However, after the elections of [[Muhammadu Buhari]], the fuel subsidies was removed again, and the pump price increased again, despite the fall in oil price.\n \nSince the fall in oil prices in 2015 and 2016, the government exchange rate policy has limited devaluation of the naira due to inflation concerns by the President Muhammadu Buhari.<ref name=\"Can you spare a dollar\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21695065-how-make-hard-currency-shortage-worse-can-you-spare-dollar|title=Can you spare a dollar?|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pulse.ng/local/buhari-why-president-should-devalue-naira-chuba-ezekwesili-video-id4824955.html|title=Buhari: Why President should devalue naira \u2013 Chuba Ezekwesili [VIDEO]|last=Sotubo|first='Jola|website=pulse.ng|access-date=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Services===\nNigeria [[List of countries by GDP sector composition|ranks 27th]] worldwide and first in Africa in services' output.\n\nSince undergoing severe distress in the mid-1990s, Nigeria's banking sector has witnessed significant growth over the last few years{{When|date=April 2017}} as new banks enter the financial market.\n\nPrivate sector-led economic growth remains stymied by the high cost of doing business in Nigeria, including the need to duplicate essential infrastructure, the lack of effective due process, and nontransparent economic decision making, especially in government contracting. While corrupt practices are endemic, they are generally less flagrant than during military rule, and there are signs of improvement. Meanwhile, since 1999 the Nigerian Stock Exchange has enjoyed strong performance, although equity as a means to foster corporate growth is being more utilized by Nigeria's private sector.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Transport====\n{{main|Transport in Nigeria}}\n\n[[File:Lagos Life goes on.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Minibuses in Lagos]]\nNigeria's publicly owned transportation infrastructure is a major constraint to economic development. Principal ports are at [[Lagos]] ([[Apapa]] and [[Tin Can Island]]), [[Port Harcourt]] (Onne), and [[Calabar]].\n\nExtensive road repairs and new construction activities are gradually being implemented as state governments, in particular, spend their portions of enhanced government revenue allocations.\n\nFive of Nigeria's airports (Lagos, [[Kano]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Enugu]] and [[Abuja]]) currently fly to international destinations. The [[Nigerian Airforce]] began a new airline called United Nigeria, with a [[Boeing 737-500]] in 2013.

However, in March 2005 the government introduced legislation ending the NLC's monopoly over union organizing. In December 2005, the NLC was lobbying for an increase in the minimum wage for federal workers. The existing minimum wage, which was introduced six years earlier but has not been adjusted since, has been whittled away by inflation to only US$42.80 per month.\n\nAccording to the [[International Organization for Migration]], the number of [[immigrants]] residing in Nigeria has more than doubled in recent decades \u2013 from 477,135 in 1991 to 971,450 in 2005. The majority of immigrants in Nigeria (74%) are from neighbouring [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), and that this number has increased considerably over the last decade, from 63% in 2001 to 97% in 2005.\n\n===Human capital===\n{{Further|Education in Nigeria}}\nThe [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) shows in 2012 that Nigeria is ranked 156 with the value of 0.459 among 187 countries.

Additionally, Nigeria is also facing a relatively high inequality, worsening the problem regarding the formation of human capital. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report|title=World's 26 richest people own as much as poorest 50%, says Oxfam|last=Elliott|first=Larry|date=2019-01-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldpoverty.io/|title=World Poverty Clock|website=worldpoverty.io|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n== Government policy ==\n\n=== Inflation ===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2017}}In the light of highly expansionary public sector fiscal policies in 2001, the government sought ways to head off higher inflation, leading to the implementation of stronger monetary policies by the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] (CBN) and underspending of budgeted amounts. As a result of the CBN's efforts, the official exchange rate for the Naira had stabilized at about 112 Naira to the dollar. The combination of CBN's efforts to prop up the value of the Naira and excess liquidity resulting from government spending led the currency to be discounted by around 20% on the parallel (non-official) market.\n\nA key condition of the Stand-by Arrangement has been closure of the gap between the official and parallel market exchange rates. The [[Inter Bank Foreign Exchange Market]] (IFEM) is closely tied to the official rate. Under IFEM, banks, oil companies, and the CBN can buy or sell their foreign exchange at government-influenced rates. Much of the informal economy, however, can only access foreign exchange through the parallel market. Companies can hold domiciliary accounts in private banks, and account holders have unfettered use of the funds.\n\nExpanded government spending also has led to upward pressure on consumer prices. Inflation which had almost disappeared in April 2000 reached 14.5% by the end of the year and 18.7% in August 2001. In 2000, high oil prices resulted in government revenue of over $16 billion, about double the 1999 level. State and local governments demanded access to this \"windfall\" revenue, creating a tug-of-war between the federal government, which sought to control spending, and state governments desiring augmented budgets, preventing the government from making provision for periods of lower oil prices.\n\nIn 2016, the black market exchange rate of the Naira was about 60% above the official rate. The central bank releases about $200 million each week at the official exchange rate. However, some companies cite that budgets now include a 30% \u201cpremium\u201d to be paid to central bank officials to get dollars.<ref name=\"Can you spare a dollar\"/>\n\n===Gradual reform===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2017}}The Obasanjo government supported \"private-sector\" led, \"market oriented\" [[economic growth]] and began extensive economic reform efforts. Although the government's anti-corruption campaign was left wanting, progress in injecting transparency and accountability into economic decision-making was notable. The dual exchange rate mechanism formally abolished in the 1999 budget remains in place in actuality.\n\nDuring 2000 the government's privatization program showed signs of life and real promise with successful turnover to the private sector of state-owned banks, fuel distribution companies, and cement plants. However, the privatization process has slowed somewhat as the government confronts key parastatals such as the state telephone company [[NITEL]] and Nigerian Airways. The successful auction of GSM telecommunications licenses in January 2001 has encouraged investment in this vital sector.\n\nAlthough the government has been stymied so far in its desire to deregulate downstream petroleum prices, state refineries, almost paralyzed in 2000, are producing at much higher capacities. By August 2001, gasoline lines disappeared throughout much of the country. The government still intends to pursue deregulation despite significant internal opposition, particularly from the [[Nigeria Labour Congress]]. To meet market demand the government incurs large losses importing gasoline to sell at subsidized prices.\n\n==Foreign economic relations==\nNigeria's foreign economic relations revolve around its role in supplying the world economy with oil and natural gas, even as the country seeks to diversify its exports, harmonize tariffs in line with a potential [[customs union]] sought by the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), and encourage inflows of foreign portfolio and direct investment. In October 2005, Nigeria implemented the ECOWAS [[common external tariff]], which reduced the number of tariff bands.\n\nPrior to this revision, tariffs constituted Nigeria's second largest source of revenue after oil exports. In 2005 Nigeria achieved a major breakthrough when it reached an agreement with the Paris Club to eliminate its bilateral debt through a combination of write-downs and buybacks. Nigeria joined the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] in July 1971 and the [[World Trade Organization]] in January 1995.\n\n===External trade===\n[[Image:2006Nigeria exports.PNG|thumb|upright=2|Nigeria's exports in 2006.]]\n[[File:Nigeria Export Treemap (2011).png|upright=2|thumb|A proportional representation of Nigeria's exports.]]\nIn 2017, Nigeria imported about US$34.2 billion of goods.

Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Babylonian]], [[Phoenicia under Assyrian rule|Assyrian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Phoenicia]]n rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mDnQwCJXUowC&q=babylonian+lebanon&dq=babylonian+lebanon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfhdL4x8XoAhVKShUIHd_KCCEQ6AEIzQEwFA|title=Lebanon a country study|date=1989|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Lebanese cuisine was influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ&dq=history+of+lebanese+food&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlh_218_zQAhXMTSYKHRHfB9kQ6AEIGjAA|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=9789953007533|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136&dq=lebanese+food+worldwide&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJlerR1MLoAhVIKuwKHYm0AbEQ6AEIPzAD#v=onepage&q=lebanese%20food%20worldwide&f=false|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the Bekaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as [[Sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets.  \n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 2\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6517.jpg\n| image2 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6520.jpg\n| image3 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6518.jpg\n| image4 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6519.jpg\n| footer = Typical Lebanese dining, with [[mezze]] and wine, taken in a restaurant in Beirut, Lebanon (1950)\n| align = \n| direction = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food.

From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence.

Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the Bekaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as [[Sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets.  \n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 2\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6517.jpg\n| image2 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6520.jpg\n| image3 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6518.jpg\n| image4 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6519.jpg\n| footer = Typical Lebanese dining, with [[mezze]] and wine, taken in a restaurant in Beirut, Lebanon (1950)\n| align = \n| direction = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated.\"</ref> The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.<ref name=Smith7 /><ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes [[Th\u00e9ophraste Renaudot]]: \"History is the record of things accomplished. A ''Gazette'' is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true.\"</ref><ref name=Pettegree3>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 3. \"Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market\u2014and by the sixteenth century it was a real market\u2014was humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information.\"</ref> Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.<ref name=Park675>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), pp. 675\u2013676. \"News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences.\"</ref> News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past\u2014or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some \"peg\", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.<ref name=Park675 /><ref>Schudson, \"When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History\"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff & Schudson; pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.<ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13\u201314.</ref> Hence the famous dictum that \"Dog Bites Man\" is not news, but \"Man Bites Dog\" is.<ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 678.</ref>\n\nAnother corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. \"It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced.\"</ref>\n\n===Commodity===\nAccording to some theories, \"news\" is whatever the news industry sells.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. \"... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public.\"</ref> Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. \"The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news.\"</ref><ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. \"[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media.\"</ref> From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.<ref>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. \"News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity.\"</ref> A news agency supplies this resource \"wholesale\" and publishers enhance it for retail.<ref name=Globalization6>Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. \"News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism.\"</ref><ref name=MacGregor>Phil MacGregor, \"International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\n===Tone===\nMost purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.<ref>Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. \"Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. [\u2026] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report.

In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322\u20131325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary.

News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals. Millions of people in countries such as the United States and South Korea have taken up blogging.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself.

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of \"impartiality\" on news broadcasters.<ref name=Wallace>Sue Wallace, \"Impartiality in the News\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref> Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20\u201323.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = \"The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880\u20131930\"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture & Society | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 557\u2013573 | year= 2000 | doi = 10.1177/016344300022005002 }}</ref> These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 15, 35.</ref> Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.<ref>Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.</ref>\n\nEven in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests.

The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others.

When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\">{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A.

After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.</ref>\n\nNews is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}</ref> The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98\u201399.</ref> The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. \"When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues.\"</ref> The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Influence of sponsorship==\nIt has been acknowledged that [[sponsorship]] has historically influenced various news stories.<ref name=marketrevealed>https://www.marketingweek.com/brands-set-to-stay-classy-with-anchorman-2/</ref><ref name=theweekreports>https://theweek.com/articles/453933/how-nonstop-marketing-killed-buzz-anchorman-2</ref><ref name=startribunereports>http://www.startribune.com/don-shelby-an-anchorman-s-take-on-anchorman-2/236808001/</ref> This history gained widespread attention following the release of the film [[Anchorman 2]].<ref name=marketrevealed /><ref name=theweekreports /><ref name=startribunereports /> One example in recent time is  the fact that Facebook has invested heavily in news sources and purchasing time on local news media outlets.<ref name=facebookbust>https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/</ref><ref name=nbcreports /> Tech Crunch journalist Josh Constine even stated in February 2018 that the company \"stole the news business\" and used sponsorship to make many news publishers its \"ghostwriters.\"<ref name=facebookbust /> In January 2019, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he will spend $300 million in local news buys over a three year period.<ref name=nbcreports>https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-announces-300-million-investment-local-news-n958726</ref><ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-investing-300-million-to-bolster-local-news/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Toronto School of communication theory]] [http://wikiglobals.com wikiglobals]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n* Allan, Stuart, ''News Culture''.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood.

In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322\u20131325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary.

Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day. Because the crier, or his agent, was compensated for his assistance in getting the advertising message out in the context of the news, there are interesting parallels with the newspaper of today (Applegate, 1993; Roche, 1993; Schramm, 1988).\"</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Ottoman Empire]], official messages were regularly distributed at mosques, by traveling holy men, and by secular criers.

A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself.

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias.

Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting.

[\u2026] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhiliration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is ''really happening'', right now, to real people.\"</ref> As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.<ref name=SilverblattZlobin28>Silverblatt & Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 28\u201331. \"A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence\u2014regardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 percent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, ''Family Circle'' and ''McCall's''' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels.\"</ref>\n\n===Public sphere===\nThis collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or [[public sphere]].<ref name=Starr24 /><ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 677.</ref> In this view, the news media constitute a [[fourth estate]] which serves to check and balance the operations of government.<ref name=\"Allen47\"/>\n\nThis idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.<ref>Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 140\u2013144.</ref> According to one interpretation of the [[CNN effect]], instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 179\u2013185.</ref> In 1989, local and global communications media enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. The news about Tiananmen Square traveled over fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.<ref>Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 70\u201372.</ref>\n\n===News events===\nAs the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the [[collective memory]] of a society.<ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 211\u2013213.</ref><ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), pp. 685\u2013686. \"In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events\u2014at least as listener if not as spectator\u2014as they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics, so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world.\"</ref>\n\nOne type of news event, the [[media event]], is a scripted pageant organized for mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 1\u201314.</ref> These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 25\u201353.</ref> Usually they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), p. 196.</ref> Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence, can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Chris | last2 = Andresen | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Hoxha | first3 = Abit | title = \"The manufacture of an international news event: The day Kosovo was born\"; | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103\u2013120 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1177/1464884911400846}}</ref>\n\nThe perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 57\u201361.</ref> Crises can also increase the effect of news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to \"rally\" behind its current leadership.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 73\u201376.</ref> The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of [[terrorism]] and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the [[Iran hostage crisis|capture of American hostages in Iran]] dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a \"crisis\", and influenced a presidential election.<ref>Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 73\u201377.</ref>\n\nSouth Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.<ref>Danie Du Plessis, \"What's News in South Africa?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 303. \"Virtually all references to political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response.\"</ref> In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]]), the 1969 [[moon landing]], the 1986 Challenger explosion, the 1997 death of Princess Diana, the [[Bush v. Gore|intervention of the Supreme Court]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] and the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>Elizabeth A. Skewes and Heather Black, \"What's News in the United States?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 329.</ref> In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of [[King Hussein]], Princess Diana, and [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin]]. Positive news stories found memorable by Jordanians featured political events affecting their lives and families\u2014such as the [[South Lebanon security belt|Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon]], and the [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty]].<ref>Mohammed Issa Taha Ali, \"What's News in Jordan?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 252.</ref>\n\nNews coverage can also shape collective memory in retrospect. A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.<ref>Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, \"Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory\"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed.

When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\">{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A. Schuster, et al., \"A National Survey of Stress Reactions After the September 11, 2011, Terrorist Attacks\", ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 345.20, 15 November 2001.</ref> Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Terr |display-authors=etal  | title = Children's symptoms in the wake of Challenger: a field study of distant-traumatic effects and an outline of related conditions | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 10| year = 1999 | pmid = 10518163 | doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536 | pages=1536\u201344}}</ref> Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.<ref>Gavin Rees, \"The Trauma Factor\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\nResearch also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Altheide | first1 = David L. | title = The News Media, the Problem Frame, and the Production of Fear | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 647\u2013668 | year= 1997 | doi = 10.1111/j.1533-8525.1997.tb00758.x }}</ref>\n\n===Influence===\nThe content and style of news delivery certainly have effects on the general public, with the magnitude and precise nature of these effects being tough to determine experimentally.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 1\u201310.</ref> In Western societies, television viewing has been so ubiquitous that its total effect on psychology and culture leave few alternatives for comparison.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 12. \"Some media may be so pervasive and so consistent in their effects that their impact is not noticeable. After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.</ref>\n\nNews is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}</ref> The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98\u201399.</ref> The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. \"When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues.\"</ref> The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Influence of sponsorship==\nIt has been acknowledged that [[sponsorship]] has historically influenced various news stories.<ref name=marketrevealed>https://www.marketingweek.com/brands-set-to-stay-classy-with-anchorman-2/</ref><ref name=theweekreports>https://theweek.com/articles/453933/how-nonstop-marketing-killed-buzz-anchorman-2</ref><ref name=startribunereports>http://www.startribune.com/don-shelby-an-anchorman-s-take-on-anchorman-2/236808001/</ref> This history gained widespread attention following the release of the film [[Anchorman 2]].<ref name=marketrevealed /><ref name=theweekreports /><ref name=startribunereports /> One example in recent time is  the fact that Facebook has invested heavily in news sources and purchasing time on local news media outlets.<ref name=facebookbust>https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/</ref><ref name=nbcreports /> Tech Crunch journalist Josh Constine even stated in February 2018 that the company \"stole the news business\" and used sponsorship to make many news publishers its \"ghostwriters.\"<ref name=facebookbust /> In January 2019, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he will spend $300 million in local news buys over a three year period.<ref name=nbcreports>https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-announces-300-million-investment-local-news-n958726</ref><ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-investing-300-million-to-bolster-local-news/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Toronto School of communication theory]] [http://wikiglobals.com wikiglobals]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n* Allan, Stuart, ''News Culture''.

From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence.

Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the Bekaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as [[Sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets.  \n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 2\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6517.jpg\n| image2 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6520.jpg\n| image3 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6518.jpg\n| image4 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6519.jpg\n| footer = Typical Lebanese dining, with [[mezze]] and wine, taken in a restaurant in Beirut, Lebanon (1950)\n| align = \n| direction = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food.

From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence.

Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the Bekaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as [[Sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets.  \n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 2\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6517.jpg\n| image2 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6520.jpg\n| image3 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6518.jpg\n| image4 = Lunch met het gerecht Meze, Bestanddeelnr 255-6519.jpg\n| footer = Typical Lebanese dining, with [[mezze]] and wine, taken in a restaurant in Beirut, Lebanon (1950)\n| align = \n| direction = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food.

There was much anticipation for the band, but after one LP and only five gigs, the band folded during sessions in Munich for a second album, momentous because it was in Munich that Marsden met David Coverdale for the first time.\n\n==Whitesnake==\nAfter Paice Ashton Lord folded, in 1978, Marsden formed a new band with former Deep Purple vocalist David Coverdale and guitarist [[Micky Moody]]. The band started as David Coverdale's Whitesnake, which then became [[Whitesnake]]. Bernie played on the first e.p, first five albums and a live album: ''Snakebite'' (1978), ''Trouble'' (1978), ''Lovehunter'' (1979), ''Ready & Willing'' (1980), ''Live In The Heart Of The City'' (1980), ''Come An' Get It'' (1981) and ''Saints & Sinners'' (1982).Contributing many of the songs with David Coverdale and sometimes Moody. \nMarsden and Coverdale would go on to create Whitesnake's anthem \"Here I Go Again\" in 1982, a song that sold many millions all over the world in on Whitesnake '1987'.\nBoth writers have received many awards for the song. As of 2018 the song has been counted at 6 million USA radio plays.\n\n==Post-Whitesnake bands==\nFollowing his departure from Whitesnake, Marsden formed a short-lived band called Bernie Marsden's SOS.  Not long after, Bernie Marsden's [[Alaska (band)|Alaska]] was formed with Robert Hawthorne on vocals and Richard Bailey on keyboards.\nAlaska released two melodic rock albums, Heart of the Storm (1984) and The Pack (1985), before splitting.<ref name=\"Bernie Marsden Biography\"/>\nIn 1986, he put together MGM with former-Whitesnake members [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] and his replacement guitarist in Whitesnake Mel Galley. \nThe band, very briefly, also included former [[Toto (band)|Toto]] vocalist Bobby Kimball.  Recordings were made but still remain unreleased.\nIn 1989, Bernie Marsden reunited with Whitesnake guitarist Moody to form the Moody Marsden band recording an acoustic live album in Norway called 'Live In Hell' and an electric live album recorded in England 'Never Turn Our Back On The Blues' that featured Zak Starkey on drums. \nTouring throughout Europe, recording one studio album called 'Real Faith'.\nNext up for Bernie was The Company Of Snakes. \nAs it turned out, the name was a little misleading as former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart didn't actually make the record with the others, Marsden, Moody and Neil Murray with John Lingwood playing drums decided to continue.\nThis band eventually released a double-album of [[Whitesnake]] songs called 'Here They Go Again', and later produced a studio album called 'Burst The Bubble' that also featured ex Hammer and Rainbow and now Deep Purple keyboard player [[Don Airey]].\nTCOS ended and evolved into M3.\nThis revamped line up included Bernie, Moody and Murray, all ex Whitesnake and master drummer [[Jimmy Copley]], keyboard player [[Mark Stanway]] and Swedish vocalist Stefan Berggren.\nM3 produced a triple-CD DVD called 'Rough 'n' Ready' which again features the songs from their Whitesnake legacy.\n\n==Solo career==\nBernie Marsden released two solo albums during his time in Whitesnake.

There was much anticipation for the band, but after one LP and only five gigs, the band folded during sessions in Munich for a second album, momentous because it was in Munich that Marsden met David Coverdale for the first time.\n\n==Whitesnake==\nAfter Paice Ashton Lord folded, in 1978, Marsden formed a new band with former Deep Purple vocalist David Coverdale and guitarist [[Micky Moody]]. The band started as David Coverdale's Whitesnake, which then became [[Whitesnake]]. Bernie played on the first e.p, first five albums and a live album: ''Snakebite'' (1978), ''Trouble'' (1978), ''Lovehunter'' (1979), ''Ready & Willing'' (1980), ''Live In The Heart Of The City'' (1980), ''Come An' Get It'' (1981) and ''Saints & Sinners'' (1982).Contributing many of the songs with David Coverdale and sometimes Moody. \nMarsden and Coverdale would go on to create Whitesnake's anthem \"Here I Go Again\" in 1982, a song that sold many millions all over the world in on Whitesnake '1987'.\nBoth writers have received many awards for the song. As of 2018 the song has been counted at 6 million USA radio plays.\n\n==Post-Whitesnake bands==\nFollowing his departure from Whitesnake, Marsden formed a short-lived band called Bernie Marsden's SOS.  Not long after, Bernie Marsden's [[Alaska (band)|Alaska]] was formed with Robert Hawthorne on vocals and Richard Bailey on keyboards.\nAlaska released two melodic rock albums, Heart of the Storm (1984) and The Pack (1985), before splitting.<ref name=\"Bernie Marsden Biography\"/>\nIn 1986, he put together MGM with former-Whitesnake members [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] and his replacement guitarist in Whitesnake Mel Galley. \nThe band, very briefly, also included former [[Toto (band)|Toto]] vocalist Bobby Kimball.  Recordings were made but still remain unreleased.\nIn 1989, Bernie Marsden reunited with Whitesnake guitarist Moody to form the Moody Marsden band recording an acoustic live album in Norway called 'Live In Hell' and an electric live album recorded in England 'Never Turn Our Back On The Blues' that featured Zak Starkey on drums. \nTouring throughout Europe, recording one studio album called 'Real Faith'.\nNext up for Bernie was The Company Of Snakes. \nAs it turned out, the name was a little misleading as former Bad Company vocalist Robert Hart didn't actually make the record with the others, Marsden, Moody and Neil Murray with John Lingwood playing drums decided to continue.\nThis band eventually released a double-album of [[Whitesnake]] songs called 'Here They Go Again', and later produced a studio album called 'Burst The Bubble' that also featured ex Hammer and Rainbow and now Deep Purple keyboard player [[Don Airey]].\nTCOS ended and evolved into M3.\nThis revamped line up included Bernie, Moody and Murray, all ex Whitesnake and master drummer [[Jimmy Copley]], keyboard player [[Mark Stanway]] and Swedish vocalist Stefan Berggren.\nM3 produced a triple-CD DVD called 'Rough 'n' Ready' which again features the songs from their Whitesnake legacy.\n\n==Solo career==\nBernie Marsden released two solo albums during his time in Whitesnake.
