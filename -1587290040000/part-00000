It was announced during [[E3 2019]] as \"'''Project Scarlett'''\" and scheduled for release in late 2020.\n\nThe console is one of the planned fourth-generation family of [[Xbox]] hardware, succeeding the current [[Xbox One]] line, and expected to have improved hardware for higher display resolutions and frame rate and reduced loading times. Microsoft plans to have this be a soft transition to its next generation of hardware; the Xbox Series X is expected to be fully compatible with all games, controllers, and accessories that are currently supported by Xbox One, including selected [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]] games already backward compatible on the Xbox One. Further, Microsoft's internal [[Xbox Game Studios]] does not plan to immediately produce titles exclusive for the Xbox Series X, but instead will produce titles that are compatible on both the Xbox One and Xbox Series X, with certain titles having enhanced features on the new console.\n\n== History and development ==\nWhen Microsoft's Xbox team started work on the successor to the Xbox One consoles, their primary targets were to at minimum double the graphic performance of the [[Xbox One X]] as measured by its [[FLOPS|floating point operations per second (FLOPS)]], and increasing CPU performance by a four-fold compared to Xbox One X while maintaining the same acoustic performance from the Xbox One consoles.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-constructing-xbox-series-x-a-revolution-in-console-design | title = Building Xbox Series X: why Microsoft redefined the console form factor | first = Richard | last = Leadbetter | date = March 28, 2020 | accessdate = March 29, 2020 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> As the engineers collected power requirements to meet these specifications, they saw these parts would draw a large amount of internal power (approximately 315&nbsp;[[watt|W]]) and would generate a good amount of heat. This lead to the decision to split the components onto two separate circuit boards; one housing the CPU/GPU, memory, and power regulators, and a second board to act as a [[Southbridge (computing)|Southbridge]] board for slower [[input/output]] (I/O) functions. The boards mounted on opposite sides of an aluminum chassis helped to create air channels for cooling. The remaining components - the [[heat sink]], the [[Electromagnetic shielding|electric shielding]], the [[power supply]], the [[optical drive]], and the [[cooling fan]] were then arranged in a ''[[Tetris]]''-like fashion, according to Microsoft designer Chris Kujawski, to achieve a compact form factor, resulting in the tower-like structure.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\"/> To meet the acoustics factor, the system includes numerous sensors for controls the speed of the fan, and the large open top was necessary to assure good air flow through the system.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\"/> While certain elements like the optical drive, air flow requirements, and heat sink size fixed certain dimensions in the overall form factor, they were satisified they were able to end up with a square footprint for the unit.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\"/>\n\nMicrosoft first teased new Xbox hardware under the codename \"Project Scarlett\" during its [[E3 2019]] press conference,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18658147/microsoft-xbox-scarlet-teaser-e3-2019|title=Microsoft hints at next-generation Xbox \u2018Scarlet\u2019 in E3 teasers|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=2019-06-08|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609004254/https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18658147/microsoft-xbox-scarlet-teaser-e3-2019|archive-date=2019-06-09|url-status=live}}</ref> The company estimated that Scarlett would be four times as powerful as Xbox One X,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/9/18656608/microsoft-new-xbox-hardware-specs-price-release-date-e3-2019|title=Microsoft\u2019s next-generation Xbox: 8K graphics, SSD storage, and ray tracing for 2020|first=Tom|last=Warren|date=June 9, 2019|website=The Verge}}</ref> with support for [[8K resolution]], real-time [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-tracing]], and 120 frames-per-second rendering.<ref name=\":3\" /> Microsoft said they wanted a soft transition from Xbox One to Scarlett, with Scarlett supporting [[backward compatibility]] with all games and most hardware supported on the Xbox One.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/368875/microsoft-teases-xbox-project-scarlett-tons-of-games-keanu|title=Microsoft Teases Xbox Project Scarlett, Tons of Games, Keanu|last=Greenwald|first=Will|website=PCmag.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref> The console was formally unveiled as the Xbox Series X during [[The Game Awards]] 2019, as well as its final design and a late-2020 release date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-exclusive-details-meet-microsofts-ne/1100-6472190/|title=Xbox Series X Exclusive Details: Meet Microsoft's Next-Gen Console|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref><ref name=\"verge series x\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console|title=Microsoft\u2019s next Xbox is Xbox Series X, coming holiday 2020|first=Tom|last=Warren|date=December 12, 2019|accessdate=December 12, 2019|website=[[The Verge]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213021743/https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console|archive-date=December 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the unveiling, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that Xbox Series X constituted an entry in a fourth generation of Xbox hardware, which will be branded simply as \"Xbox\" with no subtitle.<ref name=\"xbox g4 naming\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/xbox-scarlett/2019/12/16/21025133/xbox-series-x-name-scarlett|title=The next generation of Xbox is just called ...

It was announced during [[E3 2019]] as \"'''Project Scarlett'''\" and scheduled for release in late 2020.\n\nThe console is one of the planned fourth-generation family of [[Xbox]] hardware, succeeding the current [[Xbox One]] line, and expected to have improved hardware for higher display resolutions and frame rate and reduced loading times. Microsoft plans to have this be a soft transition to its next generation of hardware; the Xbox Series X is expected to be fully compatible with all games, controllers, and accessories that are currently supported by Xbox One, including selected [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]] games already backward compatible on the Xbox One. Further, Microsoft's internal [[Xbox Game Studios]] does not plan to immediately produce titles exclusive for the Xbox Series X, but instead will produce titles that are compatible on both the Xbox One and Xbox Series X, with certain titles having enhanced features on the new console.\n\n== History and development ==\nWhen Microsoft's Xbox team started work on the successor to the Xbox One consoles, their primary targets were to at minimum double the graphic performance of the [[Xbox One X]] as measured by its [[FLOPS|floating point operations per second (FLOPS)]], and increasing CPU performance by a four-fold compared to Xbox One X while maintaining the same acoustic performance from the Xbox One consoles.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-constructing-xbox-series-x-a-revolution-in-console-design | title = Building Xbox Series X: why Microsoft redefined the console form factor | first = Richard | last = Leadbetter | date = March 28, 2020 | accessdate = March 29, 2020 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> As the engineers collected power requirements to meet these specifications, they saw these parts would draw a large amount of internal power (approximately 315&nbsp;[[watt|W]]) and would generate a good amount of heat. This lead to the decision to split the components onto two separate circuit boards; one housing the CPU/GPU, memory, and power regulators, and a second board to act as a [[Southbridge (computing)|Southbridge]] board for slower [[input/output]] (I/O) functions. The boards mounted on opposite sides of an aluminum chassis helped to create air channels for cooling. The remaining components - the [[heat sink]], the [[Electromagnetic shielding|electric shielding]], the [[power supply]], the [[optical drive]], and the [[cooling fan]] were then arranged in a ''[[Tetris]]''-like fashion, according to Microsoft designer Chris Kujawski, to achieve a compact form factor, resulting in the tower-like structure.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\"/> To meet the acoustics factor, the system includes numerous sensors for controls the speed of the fan, and the large open top was necessary to assure good air flow through the system.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\"/> While certain elements like the optical drive, air flow requirements, and heat sink size fixed certain dimensions in the overall form factor, they were satisified they were able to end up with a square footprint for the unit.<ref name=\"eurogamer design\"/>\n\nMicrosoft first teased new Xbox hardware under the codename \"Project Scarlett\" during its [[E3 2019]] press conference,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18658147/microsoft-xbox-scarlet-teaser-e3-2019|title=Microsoft hints at next-generation Xbox \u2018Scarlet\u2019 in E3 teasers|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=2019-06-08|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609004254/https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/8/18658147/microsoft-xbox-scarlet-teaser-e3-2019|archive-date=2019-06-09|url-status=live}}</ref> The company estimated that Scarlett would be four times as powerful as Xbox One X,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/9/18656608/microsoft-new-xbox-hardware-specs-price-release-date-e3-2019|title=Microsoft\u2019s next-generation Xbox: 8K graphics, SSD storage, and ray tracing for 2020|first=Tom|last=Warren|date=June 9, 2019|website=The Verge}}</ref> with support for [[8K resolution]], real-time [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray-tracing]], and 120 frames-per-second rendering.<ref name=\":3\" /> Microsoft said they wanted a soft transition from Xbox One to Scarlett, with Scarlett supporting [[backward compatibility]] with all games and most hardware supported on the Xbox One.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/368875/microsoft-teases-xbox-project-scarlett-tons-of-games-keanu|title=Microsoft Teases Xbox Project Scarlett, Tons of Games, Keanu|last=Greenwald|first=Will|website=PCmag.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref> The console was formally unveiled as the Xbox Series X during [[The Game Awards]] 2019, as well as its final design and a late-2020 release date.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-exclusive-details-meet-microsofts-ne/1100-6472190/|title=Xbox Series X Exclusive Details: Meet Microsoft's Next-Gen Console|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref><ref name=\"verge series x\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console|title=Microsoft\u2019s next Xbox is Xbox Series X, coming holiday 2020|first=Tom|last=Warren|date=December 12, 2019|accessdate=December 12, 2019|website=[[The Verge]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213021743/https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console|archive-date=December 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the unveiling, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that Xbox Series X constituted an entry in a fourth generation of Xbox hardware, which will be branded simply as \"Xbox\" with no subtitle.<ref name=\"xbox g4 naming\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/xbox-scarlett/2019/12/16/21025133/xbox-series-x-name-scarlett|title=The next generation of Xbox is just called ...

The Huntly name was adopted in the 1870s when the postmaster named it after [[Huntly, Scotland|Huntly, Aberdeenshire]] in [[Scotland]]. He used an old 'Huntley Lodge' stamp to stamp mail from the early European settlement. The ''Lodge'' was later dropped and the spelling changed to also drop the additional 'e'.<ref>[http://huntly.co.nz/history.htm About Huntly \u2013 History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070731085104/http://www.huntly.co.nz/history.htm |date=31 July 2007 }} (from the 'huntly.co.nz' website.

The Huntly name was adopted in the 1870s when the postmaster named it after [[Huntly, Scotland|Huntly, Aberdeenshire]] in [[Scotland]]. He used an old 'Huntley Lodge' stamp to stamp mail from the early European settlement. The ''Lodge'' was later dropped and the spelling changed to also drop the additional 'e'.<ref>[http://huntly.co.nz/history.htm About Huntly \u2013 History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070731085104/http://www.huntly.co.nz/history.htm |date=31 July 2007 }} (from the 'huntly.co.nz' website.

His influential work and passion for architectural academia earned him the 2012 AIA/ACSA Topaz Medallion for Excellence in Architectural Education.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Education==\nBaird was born in Toronto, and received his [[Bachelor of Architecture]] (B.Arch.) degree from the University of Toronto School of Architecture in 1962. He carried out postgraduate research at University College, London.  While he was at University College, Baird co-edited the book ''Meaning in Architecture'' with [[Charles Jencks]].\n\n==Career==\nBaird returned to Canada by 1967 and joined the faculty of the School of Architecture at the University of Toronto, remaining until 1993.  He also emerged as a leading spokesman for improved urban design in Toronto.\n\nBaird founded his architectural and urban design practice, George Baird Architect and Associates, in 1972.  In 1982 the office became Baird/Sampson Architects, and since 1998 has been Baird Sampson Neuert Architects Inc.  Projects include [[Cloud Gardens|Cloud Gardens Park]] in Toronto, Thomas L. Wells Public School in Toronto (the first LEED certified public school in Canada), the Old Post Office Plaza in St. Louis, and the Mission 2050 Research Centre at the University of Guelph in Ontario.  Baird Sampson Neuert received the RAIC Architectural Firm Award in 2007.\n\nIn 1993 Baird joined the faculty of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, where he taught design studio and architectural theory and served as director of master's degree programs.  In  2004, he returned to the University of Toronto to become dean of the John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design, a position he held until 2009.\n\n== Architectural theory ==\n\n=== Public Space in Contemporary Architecture and Urbanism ===\n[[File:Public_+_Private_Space.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|The relationship between public space and the growth of privatized space in architectural industry discussions.]]\nRecognized for his academic and professional contributions to the discipline of architecture, George Baird\u2019s theoretical works and critical studies reveal a multi-faceted collection of publications and discourses on the topic of urban [[public space]]. In relationship to architectural design, urban design, and design history and theory, his trajectory of research specifically focuses on the status and relevance of public space in modern cities and how political and cultural agents utilize, identify, and represent such [[urban area]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Baird|first=George|title=Public Space, Cultural/Political Theory; Street Photography|publisher=SUN Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9789461051745|location=Amsterdam|pages=}}</ref>\n\n\nBaird\u2019s publications titled, ''The Space of Appearance'', ''Writings on Architecture and the City'', and ''Public Space: Cultural/Political Theory; Street Photography,'' each present a parallel discourse that discusses the two core questions: \u201cCan space be described as public or not?\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> and \u201cWhat is architecture\u2019s place in the world?\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|last=Baird|first=George|title=The Space of Appearance|publisher=MIT Press|year=1995|isbn=0262023784|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref>.

His criticisms argue that public space has eroded from the heart of contemporary industry discussions and has therefore evolved architectural expressions that are much more politically engaged.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sju.ca/thoughts-agency-utopia-and-property-contemporary-architectural-and-urban-theory|title=The Laurence A.

His book captures a social and cultural collection of 20<sup>th</sup> century photographic works by [[Berenice Abbott]], [[Walker Evans]], [[Bill Brandt]], [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], and others. In order to support his discussion on the topic of human consciousness and architecture, Baird\u2019s curation of photographers and photographs have been specifically selected to show the active engagement of people in physical settings who are unaware that they are being photographed. His reasoning behind such particular visuals presented in his project is because \u201cthese striking images, none the less, bear powerful witness to the scope of the contemporary photographic image and to its capacity of both to portray and to shape the contemporary political forms of publicness, generally, and of public space, specifically\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> Baird goes on to deeply analyse the various conditions of conscious states including focused observation, mutual awareness, intentional performability, and the assembly of the parade.<ref name=\":0\" /> Baird\u2019s reflections regarding the interrelationships of bodies in space, shown through street and news photography, helps to facilitate his three architectural conditions of publicness which he refers to as \u201cvisibility, propinquity, and continuity\u201d.{{cn|date=March 2020}} In relationship to architecture and urban design, each of these conditions work within the physical and psychological networks of bodily proximity and become present to those who exist within shared public space. Baird insists that the way we work on, interpret, and project the city relies heavily on the phenomenological aspects of architecture.<ref name=\":4\" /> He emphasizes that experiential journeys of bodies through physical spaces are crucial in understanding the cityscape; however, postmodern city centres have grown too large and complex to fully understand its entirety in this way. Similarly, to his syntheses presented through street photography, the city must therefore be understood through the approximations, representations, and other intermediate means of publicness.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Writings ==\n\n* Baird, George. 1970.

His influential work and passion for architectural academia earned him the 2012 AIA/ACSA Topaz Medallion for Excellence in Architectural Education.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Education==\nBaird was born in Toronto, and received his [[Bachelor of Architecture]] (B.Arch.) degree from the University of Toronto School of Architecture in 1962. He carried out postgraduate research at University College, London.  While he was at University College, Baird co-edited the book ''Meaning in Architecture'' with [[Charles Jencks]].\n\n==Career==\nBaird returned to Canada by 1967 and joined the faculty of the School of Architecture at the University of Toronto, remaining until 1993.  He also emerged as a leading spokesman for improved urban design in Toronto.\n\nBaird founded his architectural and urban design practice, George Baird Architect and Associates, in 1972.  In 1982 the office became Baird/Sampson Architects, and since 1998 has been Baird Sampson Neuert Architects Inc.  Projects include [[Cloud Gardens|Cloud Gardens Park]] in Toronto, Thomas L. Wells Public School in Toronto (the first LEED certified public school in Canada), the Old Post Office Plaza in St. Louis, and the Mission 2050 Research Centre at the University of Guelph in Ontario.  Baird Sampson Neuert received the RAIC Architectural Firm Award in 2007.\n\nIn 1993 Baird joined the faculty of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, where he taught design studio and architectural theory and served as director of master's degree programs.  In  2004, he returned to the University of Toronto to become dean of the John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design, a position he held until 2009.\n\n== Architectural theory: ==\n\n=== Public Space in Contemporary Architecture and Urbanism ===\n[[File:Public_+_Private_Space.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|The relationship between public space and the growth of privatized space in architectural industry discussions.]]\nRecognized for his academic and professional contributions to the discipline of architecture, George Baird\u2019s theoretical works and critical studies reveal a multi-faceted collection of publications and discourses on the topic of urban [[public space]]. In relationship to architectural design, urban design, and design history and theory, his trajectory of research specifically focuses on the status and relevance of public space in modern cities and how political and cultural agents utilize, identify, and represent such [[Urban area|urban areas]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Baird|first=George|title=Public Space, Cultural/Political Theory; Street Photography|publisher=SUN Publishers|year=2011|isbn=9789461051745|location=Amsterdam|pages=}}</ref>\n\n\nBaird\u2019s publications titled, ''The Space of Appearance'', ''Writings on Architecture and the City'', and ''Public Space: Cultural/Political Theory; Street Photography,'' each present a parallel discourse that discusses the two core questions: \u201cCan space be described as public or not?\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> and \u201cWhat is architecture\u2019s place in the world?\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|last=Baird|first=George|title=The Space of Appearance|publisher=MIT Press|year=1995|isbn=0262023784|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref>. In a 2005 lecture at the [[Berlage Institute]] in Rotterdam, Baird claims that the true concept of the \u201c[[public]]\u201d has shifted and the [[postmodern architecture]] movement is a consequential factor for its disappearance.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/240470574|title=The Continuing Relevance of Public Space in Contemporary Architecture and Urbanism|last=Baird|first=George|date=2005|website=|location=Rotterdam|format=Lecture|publication-place=Berlage Institute|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Influenced by political theories that stem from more recent generations of philosophers, Baird builds his main argument for publicness from the foundational thinking of [[Hannah Arendt]]\u2019s ''Theory of Action'', and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]' perspectives on the ''Public Sphere.'' His criticisms argue that public space has eroded from the heart of contemporary industry discussions and has therefore evolved architectural expressions that are much more politically engaged.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sju.ca/thoughts-agency-utopia-and-property-contemporary-architectural-and-urban-theory|title=The Laurence A.

His book captures a social and cultural collection of 20<sup>th</sup> century photographic works by [[Berenice Abbott]], [[Walker Evans]], [[Bill Brandt]], [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], and others. In order to support his discussion on the topic of human consciousness and architecture, Baird\u2019s curation of photographers and photographs have been specifically selected to show the active engagement of people in physical settings who are unaware that they are being photographed. His reasoning behind such particular visuals presented in his project is because \u201cthese striking images, none the less, bear powerful witness to the scope of the contemporary photographic image and to its capacity of both to portray and to shape the contemporary political forms of publicness, generally, and of public space, specifically\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> Baird goes on to deeply analyse the various conditions of conscious states including focused observation, mutual awareness, intentional performability, and the assembly of the parade.<ref name=\":0\" /> Baird\u2019s reflections regarding the interrelationships of bodies in space, shown through street and news photography, helps to facilitate his three architectural conditions of publicness which he refers to as \u201cvisibility, propinquity, and continuity\u201d.{{cn|date=March 2020}} In relationship to architecture and urban design, each of these conditions work within the physical and psychological networks of bodily proximity and become present to those who exist within shared public space. Baird insists that the way we work on, interpret, and project the city relies heavily on the phenomenological aspects of architecture.<ref name=\":4\" /> He emphasizes that experiential journeys of bodies through physical spaces are crucial in understanding the cityscape; however, postmodern city centres have grown too large and complex to fully understand its entirety in this way. Similarly, to his syntheses presented through street photography, the city must therefore be understood through the approximations, representations, and other intermediate means of publicness.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Writings ==\n\n* Baird, George. 1970.
