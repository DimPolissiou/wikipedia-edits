After a quick jump of four years, Gaurav is divorced and is relentlessly blaming his elder sister ([[Tisca Chopra]]) for everything that has gone wrong in his life. To help Gaurav, his friend suggests going to Mauritius for a vacation. For a break, he lies to his sisters saying that he is going to a business trip, whereas he went to Mauritius with his friends.

They were signed to the label in 1983.<ref>Skipper Wise [http://skipperwise.com/project/windows/ Windows]</ref> Windows, the self-titled album was released in 1983 on the ITI Records label. It received positive reviews that allowed the group to play locally and create a small following. This local buzz attracted Jim Martone of the new-formed Jazz label Intima/Enigma. Windows was signed in 1984 to Intima/Capitol Records and their second album \u201cIs It Safe\u201d was released soon after.\n\n[[Image:Skipper & Ed Blue Sept..jpg|thumb|Skipper Wise & Ed Cohen photographed for the album Blue September]]\nIn the summer of 1987, Windows released third album \u201cMr. Bongo\u201d and it charted Number Three on the new R&R radio format charts now called N.A.C (New Adult Contemporary).\n\nIn 1989, signed to a new recording contract at A&M/Cypress records, Windows released \u201cThe French Laundry,\u201d the first album to feature Skipper and, guest vocalist Al Stewart, on vocals on the title track.<ref>{{cite news |author=Dirk Sutro |title=Brazilian Music Is Back, and It's as Rio as It Gets|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1989-04-27 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-27/entertainment/ca-1833_1_brazilian-music-ivan-lins-dirk-sutro/3|accessdate=2011-05-11}}</ref> The album immediately went to Number One on the radio charts and stayed there for six weeks.\n\nIn 1990, a new Windows album \u201cBlue September\u201d was released on Cypress/Gold Mountain records.

Windows' popularity peaked in 1989 with the number one radio album ''The French Laundry''.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Skipper Peter Ed 2.jpg|thumb|Skipper Wise, Peter White & Ed Cohen]]\n[[Image:1 Windows Live 1991 copy.jpg|thumb|Windows Live in 1990]]\nWindows, an instrumental contemporary jazz group that included Skipper (Bassist), Ed Cohen (keyboard), Dudley Brooks (guitar), Tim Timmermans (drums) and Michael Acosta (saxophone). After sending out demo cassettes to record companies and getting back 24 letters saying \"Not interested\", they received one from [[Michael Dion]] of [[ITI Records]] expressing interest, saying \"I like what I hear, can we meet\". They were signed to the label in 1983.<ref>Skipper Wise [http://skipperwise.com/project/windows/ Windows]</ref> Windows, the self-titled album was released in 1983 on the ITI Records label. It received positive reviews that allowed the group to play locally and create a small following. This local buzz attracted Jim Martone of the new-formed Jazz label Intima/Enigma. Windows was signed in 1984 to Intima/Capitol Records and their second album \u201cIs It Safe\u201d was released soon after.\n\n[[Image:Skipper & Ed Blue Sept..jpg|thumb|Skipper Wise & Ed Cohen photographed for the album Blue September]]\nIn the summer of 1987, Windows released third album \u201cMr. Bongo\u201d and it charted Number Three on the new R&R radio format charts now called N.A.C (New Adult Contemporary).\n\nIn 1989, signed to a new recording contract at A&M/Cypress records, Windows released \u201cThe French Laundry,\u201d the first album to feature Skipper and, guest vocalist Al Stewart, on vocals on the title track.<ref>{{cite news |author=Dirk Sutro |title=Brazilian Music Is Back, and It's as Rio as It Gets|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1989-04-27 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-27/entertainment/ca-1833_1_brazilian-music-ivan-lins-dirk-sutro/3|accessdate=2011-05-11}}</ref> The album immediately went to Number One on the radio charts and stayed there for six weeks.\n\nIn 1990, a new Windows album \u201cBlue September\u201d was released on Cypress/Gold Mountain records.

Most modern knives have either fixed or folding blades; blade patterns and styles vary by maker and country of origin.\n\nKnives can serve various purposes. You can shove it up ur ass. Hunters use a [[hunting knife]], soldiers use the [[combat knife]], scouts, campers, and [[hiking|hikers]] carry a [[pocket knife]]; there are [[kitchen knives]] for preparing foods (the chef's knife, the paring knife, bread knife, cleaver), table knives ([[butter knives]] and [[steak knives]]), weapons ([[dagger]]s or [[switchblade]]s), knives for throwing or juggling, and knives for religious ceremony or display (the [[kirpan]]).<ref name=JK>{{cite book | last = Kertzman| first = Joe| title = Art of the Knife| publisher = Krause Publications| year =2007 | location =Iola, WI | pages =3\u20136| isbn =978-0-89689-470-9  }}</ref>\n\n==Parts==\n{{Main|Knife making}}\n[[File:Knife parts.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Different parts of a knife indicated with numerals|Characteristic parts of a knife]]\nA modern knife consists of:\n# the ''blade''\n# the ''handle''\n# the ''point'' \u2013 the end of the knife used for piercing\n# the ''edge'' \u2013 the cutting surface of the knife extending from the point to the heel\n# the ''[[grind]]'' \u2013 the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] shape of the blade\n# the ''spine'' \u2013 the thickest section of the blade; on a single-edged knife, the side opposite the edge; on a two-edged knife, more toward the middle\n# the ''[[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]]'' \u2013 a groove added to make the blade lighter\n# the ''[[ricasso]]'' \u2013 the flat section of the blade located at the junction of the blade and the knife's bolster or guard\n# the ''[[Guard (weapon)|guard]]'' \u2013 the barrier between the blade and the handle which prevents the hand from slipping forward onto the blade and protects the hand from the external forces that are usually applied to the blade during use\n# the ''hilt'' or ''butt'' \u2013 the end of the handle utilized for blunt force\n# the ''[[lanyard]]'' \u2013 a strap used to secure the knife to the wrist\n\nThe blade edge can be plain or [[serrated blade|serrated]], or a combination of both. Single-edged knives may have a ''reverse edge'' or ''false edge'' occupying a section of the spine.  These edges are usually serrated and are used to further enhance function.\n\nThe handle, used to grip and manipulate the blade safely, may include a ''[[Tang (tools)|tang]]'', a portion of the blade that extends into the handle. Knives are made with partial tangs (extending part way into the handle, known as \"stick tangs\") or full tangs (extending the full length of the handle, often visible on top and bottom). The handle may include a bolster, a piece of heavy material (usually metal) situated at the front or rear of the handle. The bolster, as its name suggests, is used to mechanically strengthen the knife.\n\n[[File:Fixed Blade Full Tang Survival Knife.png|right|thumb|A [[Gerber Legendary Blades|Gerber]]-made full-[[Tang (tools)|tang]] survival knife.  The metal from the blade extends into the handle.]]\n\n===Blade===\n{{Main|Blade}}\n[[Image:Chinese knife factory.jpg|thumb|alt=Seated female workers making knives on machinery with large spinning drums|Knife blade mass production]]\nKnife blades can be manufactured from a variety of materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. [[Carbon steel]], an alloy of [[iron]] and [[carbon]], can be very sharp. It holds its edge well, and remains easy to sharpen, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron, [[chromium]], possibly [[nickel]], and [[molybdenum]], with only a small amount of carbon. It is not able to take quite as sharp an edge as carbon steel, but is highly resistant to corrosion. [[Stainless Steel#Types of stainless steel|High carbon stainless steel]] is stainless steel with a higher amount of carbon, intended to incorporate the better attributes of carbon steel and stainless steel. High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge. [[Laminate]]d blades use multiple metals to create a layered sandwich, combining the attributes of both. For example, a harder, more brittle steel may be sandwiched between an outer layer of softer, tougher, stainless steel to reduce vulnerability to corrosion. In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable. [[Damascus steel]] is a form of [[pattern welding]] with similarities to laminate construction. Layers of different steel types are welded together, but then the stock is manipulated to create patterns in the steel.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Maryon | first = Herbert | author-link = Herbert Maryon | date = 1948 | title = A Sword of the Nydam Type from Ely Fields Farm, near Ely | journal = Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society | series = | volume = XLI | issue = | pages = 73\u201376 | doi = 10.5284/1034398 | url = http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/cambridge_antiq }}</ref>\n\n[[Titanium]] is a metal that has a better strength-to-weight ratio, is more wear resistant, and more flexible than steel. Although less hard and unable to take as sharp an edge, carbides in the titanium alloy allow them to be heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. [[Ceramic]] blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface. They are immune to common corrosion, and can only be sharpened on silicon carbide sandpaper and some grinding wheels. [[Plastic]] blades are not especially sharp and typically [[Serrated blade|serrated]]. They are often disposable.\n[[File:Microtome-knife-profile.svg|thumb|120px|left|Knife blades have different profiles]]\n\nSteel blades are commonly shaped by [[forging]] or stock removal. Forged blades are made by heating a single piece of steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be [[Heat treatment|heat treated]]. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then [[quenching]] the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]] to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and stock removal processes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.restodonte.com.br/artigos/tipos-de-facas-e-suas-utilidades|title=Restodont\u00ea {{!}} Tipos de facas e suas utilidades|website=Restodont\u00ea|access-date=2019-07-04}}</ref> Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock removal product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.\n\nKnives are sharpened in various ways. Flat ground blades have a profile that tapers from the thick spine to the sharp edge in a straight or [[wikt:convex|convex]] line. Seen in cross section, the blade would form a long, thin triangle, or where the taper does not extend to the back of the blade, a long thin rectangle with one peaked side. Hollow ground blades have [[wikt:concave|concave]], beveled edges. The resulting blade has a thinner edge, so it may have better cutting ability for shallow cuts, but it is lighter and less durable than flat ground blades and will tend to bind in deep cuts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Serrated blade knives have a wavy, scalloped or saw-like blade. Serrated blades are more well suited for tasks that require aggressive 'sawing' motions, whereas plain edge blades are better suited for tasks that require push-through cuts (e.g., shaving, chopping, slicing).\n\nMany knives have holes in the blade for various uses, such as fingering if you're bored.<ref name=\"OutdoorProductGuide\">{{cite book|title=Why Do Knives Have Holes in the Blade?|url=http://outdoorproductguide.com/why-do-knives-have-holes-in-the-blade/|year=2018}}</ref> Holes are commonly drilled in blades to reduce friction while cutting, increase single-handed usability of pocket knives, and, for butchers' knives, allow hanging out of the way when not in use.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Fixed blade features====\n[[File:CKc Pen Knife.jpg|thumb|alt=Fixed-blade knife with wooden handle on a table, next to a molded plastic sheath|cKc pen knife]]\nA fixed blade knife, sometimes called a [[sheath knife]], does not fold or slide, and is typically stronger due to the tang, the extension of the blade into the handle, and lack of moving parts.\n\n====Folding blade features====\n[[File:Swiss army knife open 20050612 (cropped).jpg|thumb|alt=Folding pocket knife with multiple exposed tools|A [[Swiss Army knife]]]]\n{{Main|Pocket knife}}\nA folding knife connects the blade to the handle through a pivot, allowing the blade to fold into the handle. To prevent injury to the knife user through the blade accidentally closing on the user's hand, folding knives typically have a locking mechanism. Different locking mechanisms are favored by various individuals for reasons such as perceived strength (lock safety), legality, and ease of use.\nPopular locking mechanisms include:\n* ''Slip joint'' \u2013 Found most commonly on traditional pocket knives, the opened blade does not lock, but is held in place by a spring device that allows the blade to fold if a certain amount of pressure is applied.<ref name=\"Kertzman2013sj\">{{cite book|last=Kertzman|first=Joe|title=Knives 2014: The World's Greatest Knife Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wS7UAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|year=2013|publisher=F+W Media|location=Iola, WI|isbn=978-1-4402-3700-3|page=7}}</ref>\n* ''Lockback'' \u2013 Also known as the ''spine lock'', the lockback includes a pivoted latch affixed to a spring, and can be disengaged only by pressing the latch down to release the blade.\n* ''[[Walker Linerlock|Linerlock]]'' \u2013 Invented by [[Michael Walker (knifemaker)|Michael Walker]], a Linerlock is a folding knife with a side-spring lock that can be opened and closed with one hand without repositioning the knife in the hand. The lock is self-adjusting for wear.<ref name=winter>{{cite book|last=Warner|first= Ken|title=Knives 91|date=1991|page =31}}</ref>\n* ''Compression Lock'' \u2013 A variant of the Liner Lock, it uses a small piece of metal at the tip of the lock to lock into a small corresponding impression in the blade.  This creates a lock that doesn't disengage when the blade is torqued, instead becoming more tightly locked.  It is released by pressing the tab of metal to the side, to allow the blade to be placed into its groove set into the handle.<ref name=winter/>\n* ''Frame Lock'' \u2013 Also known as the ''integral lock'' or ''monolock'', this locking mechanism was invented by custom knifemaker [[Chris Reeve]] for the [[Sebenza]] as an update to the liner lock. The frame lock works in a manner similar to the liner lock but uses a partial cutout of the actual knife handle, rather than a separate liner inside the handle to hold the blade in place.<ref name=\"NKM93\">Dick, Steven, The National Knife Magazine, \u201cThe Chris Reeve Sebenza Folding Hunter\u201d, September 1993, pp. 16\u201318.</ref><ref name=\"KI2000\">Lang, Bud, Knives Illustrated, \u201cChris Reeve\u2019s Classic 2000\u201d, April 2000, pp. 22\u201324.</ref>\n* ''Collar lock'' \u2013 found on [[Opinel knife|Opinel knives]].<ref name=\"Media1996\">{{cite book|last=Media|first=New Track|title=American Woodworker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MfcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA43|date=1996|publisher=New Track Media|page=43|issn=1074-9152}}</ref>\n* ''Button Lock'' \u2013 Found mainly on automatic knives, this type of lock uses a small push-button to open and release the knife.[[Image:BM-AxisLock.jpg|thumb|alt=Close-up of pivot joint of a folding knife, showing locking barrel inserted through holes in the handle|The Benchmade Axis Lock mechanism]]\n* ''Axis Lock'' \u2013 A locking mechanism exclusively licensed to the [[Benchmade|Benchmade Knife Company]].

To close, manually lift (pick) the spring tab (lock) off the blade post with your fingers, or in \"Italian Style Stilettos\" swivel the bolster (hand guard) clockwise to lift the spring tab off the blade post.\n\nAnother prominent feature on many folding knives is the opening mechanism. Traditional pocket knives and [[Swiss Army Knife|Swiss Army knives]] commonly employ the nail nick, while modern folding knives more often use a stud, hole, disk, or ''flipper'' located on the blade, all which have the benefit of allowing the user to open the knife with one hand.\n\nThe \"wave\" feature is another prominent design, which uses a part of the blade that protrudes outward to catch on one's pocket as it is drawn, thus opening the blade; this was patented by [[Ernest Emerson]] and is not only used on many of the Emerson knives, but also on knives produced by several other manufacturers, notably [[Spyderco]] and [[Cold Steel]].<ref name =\"cutler\">{{cite journal|last=Shackleford|first= Steve |year=1997|title=Cutler of Fortune|journal=Blade Magazine|issue=10|volume=22|page=50}}</ref>\n\n''Automatic'' or ''[[switchblade]]'' knives open using the stored energy from a spring that is released when the user presses a button or lever or other actuator built into the handle of the knife.

These differ from automatic or switchblade knives in that the blade is not released by means of a button or catch on the handle; rather, the blade itself is the actuator. Most assisted openers use flippers as their opening mechanism. Assisted opening knives can be as fast or faster than automatic knives to deploy.<ref>{{cite book|title=Blade's Guide to Knives & Their Values|first=Steve |last=Shackleford|edition=7|page =232|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4402-0387-9}}</ref>\n\n=====Common locking mechanisms=====\n[[File:Folding knife locking mechanisms.svg|framed|right]]\nIn the '''lock back''', as in many folding knives, a stop pin acting on the top (or behind) the blade prevents it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a torsion bar. To release the knife the rocker bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around the rocker pin, lifting the hook and freeing the blade.\n\nWhen negative pressure (pushing down on the spine) is applied to the blade all the stress is transferred from the hook on the blade's tang to the hook on rocker bar and thence to the small rocker pin. Excessive stress can shear one or both of these hooks rendering the knife effectively useless. Knife company Cold Steel uses a variant of the lock back called the '''Tri-Ad Lock''' which introduces a pin in front of the rocker bar to relieve stress on the rocker pin, has an elongated hole around the rocker pin to allow the mechanism to wear over time without losing strength and angles the hooks so that the faces no longer meet vertically.\n\nThe bolt in the '''bolt lock''' is a rectangle of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward. When the knife is open a spring biases the bolt to the forward position where it rests above the tang of the blade preventing the blade from closing. Small knobs extend through the handle of the knife on both sides allowing the user to slide the bolt backwards freeing the knife to close. The '''Axis Lock''' used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the bolt lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than a rectangle to trap the blade.<ref name=\"Ahern2010\"/> The '''Arc Lock''' by knife maker SOG is similar to the Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.<ref name=\"ShidelerSigler2008\"/>\n\nIn the '''liner lock''', an \"L\"-shaped split in the liner allows part of the liner to move sideways from its resting position against the handle to the centre of the knife where it rests against the flat end of the tang. To disengage, this leaf spring is pushed so it again rests flush against the handle allowing the knife to rotate.<ref name=winter/> A '''frame lock''' is functionally identical but instead of using a thin liner inside the handle material uses a thicker piece of metal as the handle and the same split in it allows a section of the frame to press against the tang.<ref name=winter/>\n\n====Sliding blade features====\n{{Main|Sliding knife}}\n[[File:OTF knife GM08.jpg|thumb|right|An OTF knife, showing the sliding blade being extended from the handle]]\nA sliding knife is a knife that can be opened by sliding the knife blade out the front of the handle. One method of opening is where the blade exits out the front of the handle point-first and then is locked into place (an example of this is the [[gravity knife]]). Another form is an [[OTF knife|OTF]] (out-the-front) switchblade, which only requires the push of a button or spring to cause the blade to slide out of the handle and lock into place. To retract the blade back into the handle, a release lever or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed.  A very common form of sliding knife is the sliding [[utility knife]] (commonly known as a stanley knife or boxcutter).\n\n===Handle===\n{{Main|Handle (grip)}}\nThe handles of knives can be made from a number of different materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Handles are produced in a wide variety of shapes and styles. Handles are often textured to enhance grip.\n* [[Wood]] handles provide good grip and are warm in the hand, but are more difficult to care for. They do not resist water well, and will crack or warp with prolonged exposure to water. Modern stabilized and laminated woods have largely overcome these problems. Many beautiful and exotic hardwoods are employed in the manufacture of custom and some production knives. In some countries it is now forbidden for commercial butchers' knives to have wood handles, for sanitary reasons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n* [[Plastic]] handles are more easily cared for than wooden handles, but can be slippery and become brittle over time.<ref name=\"JK\" />\n* [[Injection mold]]ed handles made from higher grade plastics are composed of [[polyphthalamide]], and when marketed under trademarked names such as ''[[Zytel]]'' or ''[[Grivory]]'', are reinforced with ''[[Kevlar]]'' or [[fiberglass]]. These are often used by major knife manufacturers.\n* [[Rubber]] handles such as [[Kraton (polymer)|Kraton]] or Resiprene-C are generally preferred over plastic due to their durable and cushioning nature.\n* [[Micarta]] is a popular handle material on ''user'' knives due to its toughness and stability. Micarta is nearly impervious to water, is ''grippy'' when wet, and is an excellent insulator. Micarta has come to refer to any fibrous material cast in resin. There are many varieties of micarta available. One very popular version is a fiberglass impregnated resin called G-10.\n* [[Leather]] handles are seen on some hunting and military knives, notably the [[KA-BAR]]. Leather handles are typically produced by stacking leather washers, or less commonly, as a sleeve surrounding another handle material. Russian manufacturers often use [[birchbark]] in the same manner.\n* Skeleton handles refers to the practice of using the tang itself as the handle, usually with sections of material removed to reduce weight. Skeleton handled knives are often wrapped with [[parachute cord]] or other wrapping materials to enhance grip.\n* [[Stainless steel]] and [[aluminum]] handles are durable and sanitary, but can be slippery. To counter this, premium knife makers make handles with ridges, bumps, or indentations to provide extra grip. Another problem with knives that have metal handles is that, since metal is an excellent heat-conductor, these knives can be very uncomfortable, and even painful or dangerous, when handled without gloves or other protective handwear in (very) cold climates.\n[[File:Knife handle made of buffalo horn.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A traditional knife handle made from buffalo horn ([[Tasikmalaya]], Indonesia)]]\nMore exotic materials usually only seen on art or ceremonial knives include: Stone, bone, mammoth tooth, mammoth ivory, oosik (walrus penis bone), walrus tusk, antler (often called stag in a knife context), sheep horn, buffalo horn, teeth, and mop (mother of pearl or \"pearl\"). Many materials have been employed in knife handles.\n\nHandles may be adapted to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities. For example, knife handles may be made thicker or with more cushioning for people with [[arthritis]] in their hands. A non-slip handle accommodates people with [[palmar hyperhidrosis]].\n[[Image:Birchbark handle.jpg|thumb|250px|Birchbark knife handle]]\n\n==Types==\n{{details|topic=the various types of knives|Blade#Patterns of knife blades}}\n\n===Weapons===\n[[File:Tuarknife.jpg|thumb|right|A large traditional [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] knife.]]\nAs a weapon, the knife is universally adopted as an essential tool.

Most modern knives have either fixed or folding blades; blade patterns and styles vary by maker and country of origin.\n\nKnives can serve various purposes. Hunters use a [[hunting knife]], soldiers use the [[combat knife]], scouts, campers, and [[hiking|hikers]] carry a [[pocket knife]]; there are [[kitchen knives]] for preparing foods (the chef's knife, the paring knife, bread knife, cleaver), table knives ([[butter knives]] and [[steak knives]]), weapons ([[dagger]]s or [[switchblade]]s), knives for throwing or juggling, and knives for religious ceremony or display (the [[kirpan]]).<ref name=JK>{{cite book | last = Kertzman| first = Joe| title = Art of the Knife| publisher = Krause Publications| year =2007 | location =Iola, WI | pages =3\u20136| isbn =978-0-89689-470-9  }}</ref>\n\n==Parts==\n{{Main|Knife making}}\n[[File:Knife parts.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Different parts of a knife indicated with numerals|Characteristic parts of a knife]]\nA modern knife consists of:\n# the ''blade''\n# the ''handle''\n# the ''point'' \u2013 the end of the knife used for piercing\n# the ''edge'' \u2013 the cutting surface of the knife extending from the point to the heel\n# the ''[[grind]]'' \u2013 the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] shape of the blade\n# the ''spine'' \u2013 the thickest section of the blade; on a single-edged knife, the side opposite the edge; on a two-edged knife, more toward the middle\n# the ''[[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]]'' \u2013 a groove added to make the blade lighter\n# the ''[[ricasso]]'' \u2013 the flat section of the blade located at the junction of the blade and the knife's bolster or guard\n# the ''[[Guard (weapon)|guard]]'' \u2013 the barrier between the blade and the handle which prevents the hand from slipping forward onto the blade and protects the hand from the external forces that are usually applied to the blade during use\n# the ''hilt'' or ''butt'' \u2013 the end of the handle utilized for blunt force\n# the ''[[lanyard]]'' \u2013 a strap used to secure the knife to the wrist\n\nThe blade edge can be plain or [[serrated blade|serrated]], or a combination of both. Single-edged knives may have a ''reverse edge'' or ''false edge'' occupying a section of the spine.  These edges are usually serrated and are used to further enhance function.\n\nThe handle, used to grip and manipulate the blade safely, may include a ''[[Tang (tools)|tang]]'', a portion of the blade that extends into the handle. Knives are made with partial tangs (extending part way into the handle, known as \"stick tangs\") or full tangs (extending the full length of the handle, often visible on top and bottom). The handle may include a bolster, a piece of heavy material (usually metal) situated at the front or rear of the handle. The bolster, as its name suggests, is used to mechanically strengthen the knife.\n\n[[File:Fixed Blade Full Tang Survival Knife.png|right|thumb|A [[Gerber Legendary Blades|Gerber]]-made full-[[Tang (tools)|tang]] survival knife.  The metal from the blade extends into the handle.]]\n\n===Blade===\n{{Main|Blade}}\n[[Image:Chinese knife factory.jpg|thumb|alt=Seated female workers making knives on machinery with large spinning drums|Knife blade mass production]]\nKnife blades can be manufactured from a variety of materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. [[Carbon steel]], an alloy of [[iron]] and [[carbon]], can be very sharp. It holds its edge well, and remains easy to sharpen, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron, [[chromium]], possibly [[nickel]], and [[molybdenum]], with only a small amount of carbon. It is not able to take quite as sharp an edge as carbon steel, but is highly resistant to corrosion. [[Stainless Steel#Types of stainless steel|High carbon stainless steel]] is stainless steel with a higher amount of carbon, intended to incorporate the better attributes of carbon steel and stainless steel. High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge. [[Laminate]]d blades use multiple metals to create a layered sandwich, combining the attributes of both. For example, a harder, more brittle steel may be sandwiched between an outer layer of softer, tougher, stainless steel to reduce vulnerability to corrosion. In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable. [[Damascus steel]] is a form of [[pattern welding]] with similarities to laminate construction. Layers of different steel types are welded together, but then the stock is manipulated to create patterns in the steel.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Maryon | first = Herbert | author-link = Herbert Maryon | date = 1948 | title = A Sword of the Nydam Type from Ely Fields Farm, near Ely | journal = Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society | series = | volume = XLI | issue = | pages = 73\u201376 | doi = 10.5284/1034398 | url = http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/cambridge_antiq }}</ref>\n\n[[Titanium]] is a metal that has a better strength-to-weight ratio, is more wear resistant, and more flexible than steel. Although less hard and unable to take as sharp an edge, carbides in the titanium alloy allow them to be heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. [[Ceramic]] blades are hard, brittle, and lightweight: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are as fragile as glass and will break if dropped on a hard surface. They are immune to common corrosion, and can only be sharpened on silicon carbide sandpaper and some grinding wheels. [[Plastic]] blades are not especially sharp and typically [[Serrated blade|serrated]]. They are often disposable.\n[[File:Microtome-knife-profile.svg|thumb|120px|left|Knife blades have different profiles]]\n\nSteel blades are commonly shaped by [[forging]] or stock removal. Forged blades are made by heating a single piece of steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be [[Heat treatment|heat treated]]. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then [[quenching]] the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]] to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and stock removal processes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.restodonte.com.br/artigos/tipos-de-facas-e-suas-utilidades|title=Restodont\u00ea {{!}} Tipos de facas e suas utilidades|website=Restodont\u00ea|access-date=2019-07-04}}</ref> Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock removal product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.\n\nKnives are sharpened in various ways. Flat ground blades have a profile that tapers from the thick spine to the sharp edge in a straight or [[wikt:convex|convex]] line. Seen in cross section, the blade would form a long, thin triangle, or where the taper does not extend to the back of the blade, a long thin rectangle with one peaked side. Hollow ground blades have [[wikt:concave|concave]], beveled edges. The resulting blade has a thinner edge, so it may have better cutting ability for shallow cuts, but it is lighter and less durable than flat ground blades and will tend to bind in deep cuts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Serrated blade knives have a wavy, scalloped or saw-like blade. Serrated blades are more well suited for tasks that require aggressive 'sawing' motions, whereas plain edge blades are better suited for tasks that require push-through cuts (e.g., shaving, chopping, slicing).\n\nMany knives have holes in the blade for various uses.<ref name=\"OutdoorProductGuide\">{{cite book|title=Why Do Knives Have Holes in the Blade?|url=http://outdoorproductguide.com/why-do-knives-have-holes-in-the-blade/|year=2018}}</ref> Holes are commonly drilled in blades to reduce friction while cutting, increase single-handed usability of pocket knives, and, for butchers' knives, allow hanging out of the way when not in use.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Fixed blade features====\n[[File:CKc Pen Knife.jpg|thumb|alt=Fixed-blade knife with wooden handle on a table, next to a molded plastic sheath|cKc pen knife]]\nA fixed blade knife, sometimes called a [[sheath knife]], does not fold or slide, and is typically stronger due to the tang, the extension of the blade into the handle, and lack of moving parts.\n\n====Folding blade features====\n[[File:Swiss army knife open 20050612 (cropped).jpg|thumb|alt=Folding pocket knife with multiple exposed tools|A [[Swiss Army knife]]]]\n{{Main|Pocket knife}}\nA folding knife connects the blade to the handle through a pivot, allowing the blade to fold into the handle. To prevent injury to the knife user through the blade accidentally closing on the user's hand, folding knives typically have a locking mechanism. Different locking mechanisms are favored by various individuals for reasons such as perceived strength (lock safety), legality, and ease of use.\nPopular locking mechanisms include:\n* ''Slip joint'' \u2013 Found most commonly on traditional pocket knives, the opened blade does not lock, but is held in place by a spring device that allows the blade to fold if a certain amount of pressure is applied.<ref name=\"Kertzman2013sj\">{{cite book|last=Kertzman|first=Joe|title=Knives 2014: The World's Greatest Knife Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wS7UAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|year=2013|publisher=F+W Media|location=Iola, WI|isbn=978-1-4402-3700-3|page=7}}</ref>\n* ''Lockback'' \u2013 Also known as the ''spine lock'', the lockback includes a pivoted latch affixed to a spring, and can be disengaged only by pressing the latch down to release the blade.\n* ''[[Walker Linerlock|Linerlock]]'' \u2013 Invented by [[Michael Walker (knifemaker)|Michael Walker]], a Linerlock is a folding knife with a side-spring lock that can be opened and closed with one hand without repositioning the knife in the hand. The lock is self-adjusting for wear.<ref name=winter>{{cite book|last=Warner|first= Ken|title=Knives 91|date=1991|page =31}}</ref>\n* ''Compression Lock'' \u2013 A variant of the Liner Lock, it uses a small piece of metal at the tip of the lock to lock into a small corresponding impression in the blade.  This creates a lock that doesn't disengage when the blade is torqued, instead becoming more tightly locked.

Traditional pocket knives and [[Swiss Army Knife|Swiss Army knives]] commonly employ the nail nick, while modern folding knives more often use a stud, hole, disk, or ''flipper'' located on the blade, all which have the benefit of allowing the user to open the knife with one hand.\n\nThe \"wave\" feature is another prominent design, which uses a part of the blade that protrudes outward to catch on one's pocket as it is drawn, thus opening the blade; this was patented by [[Ernest Emerson]] and is not only used on many of the Emerson knives, but also on knives produced by several other manufacturers, notably [[Spyderco]] and [[Cold Steel]].<ref name =\"cutler\">{{cite journal|last=Shackleford|first= Steve |year=1997|title=Cutler of Fortune|journal=Blade Magazine|issue=10|volume=22|page=50}}</ref>\n\n''Automatic'' or ''[[switchblade]]'' knives open using the stored energy from a spring that is released when the user presses a button or lever or other actuator built into the handle of the knife.

These differ from automatic or switchblade knives in that the blade is not released by means of a button or catch on the handle; rather, the blade itself is the actuator. Most assisted openers use flippers as their opening mechanism. Assisted opening knives can be as fast or faster than automatic knives to deploy.<ref>{{cite book|title=Blade's Guide to Knives & Their Values|first=Steve |last=Shackleford|edition=7|page =232|publisher=Krause Publications|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4402-0387-9}}</ref>\n\n=====Common locking mechanisms=====\n[[File:Folding knife locking mechanisms.svg|framed|right]]\nIn the '''lock back''', as in many folding knives, a stop pin acting on the top (or behind) the blade prevents it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a torsion bar. To release the knife the rocker bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around the rocker pin, lifting the hook and freeing the blade.\n\nWhen negative pressure (pushing down on the spine) is applied to the blade all the stress is transferred from the hook on the blade's tang to the hook on rocker bar and thence to the small rocker pin. Excessive stress can shear one or both of these hooks rendering the knife effectively useless. Knife company Cold Steel uses a variant of the lock back called the '''Tri-Ad Lock''' which introduces a pin in front of the rocker bar to relieve stress on the rocker pin, has an elongated hole around the rocker pin to allow the mechanism to wear over time without losing strength and angles the hooks so that the faces no longer meet vertically.\n\nThe bolt in the '''bolt lock''' is a rectangle of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward. When the knife is open a spring biases the bolt to the forward position where it rests above the tang of the blade preventing the blade from closing. Small knobs extend through the handle of the knife on both sides allowing the user to slide the bolt backwards freeing the knife to close. The '''Axis Lock''' used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the bolt lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than a rectangle to trap the blade.<ref name=\"Ahern2010\"/> The '''Arc Lock''' by knife maker SOG is similar to the Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.<ref name=\"ShidelerSigler2008\"/>\n\nIn the '''liner lock''', an \"L\"-shaped split in the liner allows part of the liner to move sideways from its resting position against the handle to the centre of the knife where it rests against the flat end of the tang. To disengage, this leaf spring is pushed so it again rests flush against the handle allowing the knife to rotate.<ref name=winter/> A '''frame lock''' is functionally identical but instead of using a thin liner inside the handle material uses a thicker piece of metal as the handle and the same split in it allows a section of the frame to press against the tang.<ref name=winter/>\n\n====Sliding blade features====\n{{Main|Sliding knife}}\n[[File:OTF knife GM08.jpg|thumb|right|An OTF knife, showing the sliding blade being extended from the handle]]\nA sliding knife is a knife that can be opened by sliding the knife blade out the front of the handle. One method of opening is where the blade exits out the front of the handle point-first and then is locked into place (an example of this is the [[gravity knife]]). Another form is an [[OTF knife|OTF]] (out-the-front) switchblade, which only requires the push of a button or spring to cause the blade to slide out of the handle and lock into place. To retract the blade back into the handle, a release lever or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed.  A very common form of sliding knife is the sliding [[utility knife]] (commonly known as a stanley knife or boxcutter).\n\n===Handle===\n{{Main|Handle (grip)}}\nThe handles of knives can be made from a number of different materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Handles are produced in a wide variety of shapes and styles. Handles are often textured to enhance grip.\n* [[Wood]] handles provide good grip and are warm in the hand, but are more difficult to care for. They do not resist water well, and will crack or warp with prolonged exposure to water. Modern stabilized and laminated woods have largely overcome these problems. Many beautiful and exotic hardwoods are employed in the manufacture of custom and some production knives. In some countries it is now forbidden for commercial butchers' knives to have wood handles, for sanitary reasons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n* [[Plastic]] handles are more easily cared for than wooden handles, but can be slippery and become brittle over time.<ref name=\"JK\" />\n* [[Injection mold]]ed handles made from higher grade plastics are composed of [[polyphthalamide]], and when marketed under trademarked names such as ''[[Zytel]]'' or ''[[Grivory]]'', are reinforced with ''[[Kevlar]]'' or [[fiberglass]]. These are often used by major knife manufacturers.\n* [[Rubber]] handles such as [[Kraton (polymer)|Kraton]] or Resiprene-C are generally preferred over plastic due to their durable and cushioning nature.\n* [[Micarta]] is a popular handle material on ''user'' knives due to its toughness and stability. Micarta is nearly impervious to water, is ''grippy'' when wet, and is an excellent insulator. Micarta has come to refer to any fibrous material cast in resin. There are many varieties of micarta available. One very popular version is a fiberglass impregnated resin called G-10.\n* [[Leather]] handles are seen on some hunting and military knives, notably the [[KA-BAR]]. Leather handles are typically produced by stacking leather washers, or less commonly, as a sleeve surrounding another handle material. Russian manufacturers often use [[birchbark]] in the same manner.\n* Skeleton handles refers to the practice of using the tang itself as the handle, usually with sections of material removed to reduce weight. Skeleton handled knives are often wrapped with [[parachute cord]] or other wrapping materials to enhance grip.\n* [[Stainless steel]] and [[aluminum]] handles are durable and sanitary, but can be slippery. To counter this, premium knife makers make handles with ridges, bumps, or indentations to provide extra grip. Another problem with knives that have metal handles is that, since metal is an excellent heat-conductor, these knives can be very uncomfortable, and even painful or dangerous, when handled without gloves or other protective handwear in (very) cold climates.\n[[File:Knife handle made of buffalo horn.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A traditional knife handle made from buffalo horn ([[Tasikmalaya]], Indonesia)]]\nMore exotic materials usually only seen on art or ceremonial knives include: Stone, bone, mammoth tooth, mammoth ivory, oosik (walrus penis bone), walrus tusk, antler (often called stag in a knife context), sheep horn, buffalo horn, teeth, and mop (mother of pearl or \"pearl\"). Many materials have been employed in knife handles.\n\nHandles may be adapted to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities. For example, knife handles may be made thicker or with more cushioning for people with [[arthritis]] in their hands. A non-slip handle accommodates people with [[palmar hyperhidrosis]].\n[[Image:Birchbark handle.jpg|thumb|250px|Birchbark knife handle]]\n\n==Types==\n{{details|topic=the various types of knives|Blade#Patterns of knife blades}}\n\n===Weapons===\n[[File:Tuarknife.jpg|thumb|right|A large traditional [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] knife.]]\nAs a weapon, the knife is universally adopted as an essential tool.

This title is less commonly used than the title [[First Lady of the United States|first lady of the United States]].\n\nThe term \"[[Second Lady]]\", coined in contrast to \"[[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]]\" (who is almost always the wife of the [[president of the United States|president]]), may have been first used by [[Jennie Tuttle Hobart]] (whose husband, [[Garret Hobart]] was vice president from 1897 to 1899) to refer to herself.\n\nThe title later fell out of favor, but was revived in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Edward|title=Vice Presidents: A Biographical Dictionary|date=2010|publisher=InfoBase |isbn=1438130716|page=237}}</ref><ref name=safire>{{cite book|last1=Safire |first1=William|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195343344 |page=249 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&pg=PA249&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> During the 1990s the title was again abandoned, in favor of \"wife of the vice president\", but was later resurrected during the [[presidency of Barack Obama]].<ref name=safire/> Its use was continued by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|administration of Donald Trump]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs. Karen Pence|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/karen-pence|website=[[whitehouse.gov]]|accessdate=21 January 2017|date=24 December 2014}}</ref> although Trump said, about six months into his presidency, that he had never heard the term.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/trump-reveals-that-hes-never-heard-the-term-second-lady.html |accessdate=19 November 2017|language=en|date=July 2017|title=Trump Reveals That He's Never Heard the Term 'Second Lady'|magazine=New York magazine |first=Margaret|last=Hartmann}}</ref>\n\nFourteen second ladies have gone on to become First Lady of the United States during their husband's terms as president. The first to do this was [[Abigail Adams]], who was married to [[John Adams]], who was the first vice president from 1789 to 1797 and then second president from 1797 to 1801. The last to do this was [[Barbara Bush]], who was married to [[George H. W. Bush]], who was the 43rd vice president from 1981 to 1989 and then 41st president from 1989 to 1993.\n\nThe current second lady is [[Karen Pence]], since January 20, 2017. She is married to [[Mike Pence]], the 48th and current vice president of the United States.\n\nThere are four living former second ladies: [[Marilyn Quayle]], wife of [[Dan Quayle]]; [[Tipper Gore]], now separated wife of [[Al Gore]]; [[Lynne Cheney]], wife of [[Dick Cheney]]; and [[Jill Biden]], wife of [[Joe Biden]].\n\n==History==\nThe second lady's visibility in the public sphere has been a somewhat recent development. Although the role of the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady]] as [[White House]] hostess dates from the beginning of the republic (and was typically filled by another member of the president's family if the president was unmarried or a widower), with a few exceptions, it was generally not until the late 20th century and early 21st century that vice-presidential wives took on public roles that attracted significant media attention.\n\nIn one notable exception, [[Floride Calhoun]], wife of Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]], was a central figure in the [[Petticoat Affair]], a social-political scandal which involved the social ostracism of Secretary of War [[John H. Eaton]] and his wife [[Margaret O'Neill Eaton]] further damaging already-strained relations between Vice President Calhoun and President [[Andrew Jackson]]. \n\n[[Image:Nixons in Ghana 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Second Lady Pat Nixon, with Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], led a delegation to [[Ghana]] in 1957. One historian wrote that Pat Nixon \"helped to define this nebulous role for an entire generation of women who would succeed her.\"]]\n\n[[Pat Nixon]], wife of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], was the first second lady to add a great deal of substance to the role of the vice president's wife. When Nixon assumed the position in 1953, the role's only official function was to preside over the once-annual Senate Ladies Luncheon.<ref name=\"pat nixon\">{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/393855-remembering-pat-nixon-a-fearless-first-and-second-lady |title=Remembering Pat Nixon: A fearless first and second lady |last=Brower |first=Kate Andersen |date=June 24, 2018 |website=The Hill |access-date=August 6, 2018 }}</ref> Instead, Nixon launched her own initiatives, sensing great opportunities that her role provided. She established a schedule separate from that of her husband, which often consisted of solo activities. As second lady, Nixon traveled more than 125,000 miles around the world to six continents, including a two-month, 42,000-mile journey through Asia in 1953.<ref name=\"pat nixon\"/> As she undertook missions of goodwill across the world, she insisted on visiting schools, orphanages, hospitals and village markets rather than attend tea or coffee functions. In this sense, Nixon essentially created the modern role of the second lady; historian [[Kate Andersen Brower]] wrote, \"she helped to define this nebulous role for an entire generation of women who would succeed her.\"<ref name=\"pat nixon\"/>\n\nIn 1978, [[Muriel Humphrey Brown|Muriel Humphrey]], wife of Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]], became the only former second lady to hold public office; after her husband, who had returned to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] after his term as vice president, died in office, she was appointed by [[Governor of Minnesota|Minnesota governor]] [[Rudy Perpich]] to continue her husband's term. [[Tipper Gore]], wife of Vice President [[Al Gore]], was active in several campaigns to remove material she found objectionable from popular American entertainment like [[motion picture|movies]], [[television|television shows]] and [[music]], starting when her husband was a [[United States senator|senator]]. She challenged performers over their use of profane lyrics and often debated with her critics, such as [[Dead Kennedys]] singer [[Jello Biafra]]. [[Lynne Cheney]], wife of Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], championed [[education]] reform, citing specific failures of the American [[public education]] system during her tenure as second lady. She is a particularly outspoken supporter of American [[history]] education, having written five [[Bestseller|bestselling]] books on this topic for children and their families.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/mrscheney/ |title=Mrs. Lynne Cheney |accessdate=2008-10-13 |work=whitehouse.gov |publisher=The White House}}</ref> [[Jill Biden]], wife of Vice President [[Joe Biden]], works as an English professor at [[Northern Virginia Community College]], and is thought to be the first second lady to hold a paying job while her husband was vice president.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abcarian |first=Robin Abcarian |title=Hi, I'm Jill.

The first to do this was [[Abigail Adams]], who was married to [[John Adams]], who was the first vice president from 1789 to 1797 and then second president from 1797 to 1801. The last to do this was [[Barbara Bush]], who was married to [[George H. W. Bush]], who was the 43rd vice president from 1981 to 1989 and then 41st president from 1989 to 1993.\n\nThe current second lady is [[Karen Pence]], since January 20, 2017. She is married to [[Mike Pence]], the 48th and current vice president of the United States.\n\nThere are four living former second ladies: [[Marilyn Quayle]], wife of [[Dan Quayle]]; [[Tipper Gore]], now separated wife of [[Al Gore]]; [[Lynne Cheney]], wife of [[Dick Cheney]]; and [[Jill Biden]], wife of [[Joe Biden]].\n\n==History==\nThe second lady's visibility in the public sphere has been a somewhat recent development. Although the role of the [[First Lady of the United States|first lady]] as [[White House]] hostess dates from the beginning of the republic (and was typically filled by another member of the president's family if the president was unmarried or a widower), with a few exceptions, it was generally not until the late 20th century and early 21st century that vice-presidential wives took on public roles that attracted significant media attention.\n\nIn one notable exception, [[Floride Calhoun]], wife of Vice President [[John C. Calhoun]], was a central figure in the [[Petticoat Affair]], a social-political scandal which involved the social ostracism of Secretary of War [[John H. Eaton]] and his wife [[Margaret O'Neill Eaton]] further damaging already-strained relations between Vice President Calhoun and President [[Andrew Jackson]]. \n\n[[Image:Nixons in Ghana 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Second Lady Pat Nixon, with Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], led a delegation to [[Ghana]] in 1957. One historian wrote that Pat Nixon \"helped to define this nebulous role for an entire generation of women who would succeed her.\"]]\n\n[[Pat Nixon]], wife of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], was the first second lady to add a great deal of substance to the role of the vice president's wife. When Nixon assumed the position in 1953, the role's only official function was to preside over the once-annual Senate Ladies Luncheon.<ref name=\"pat nixon\">{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/393855-remembering-pat-nixon-a-fearless-first-and-second-lady |title=Remembering Pat Nixon: A fearless first and second lady |last=Brower |first=Kate Andersen |date=June 24, 2018 |website=The Hill |access-date=August 6, 2018 }}</ref> Instead, Nixon launched her own initiatives, sensing great opportunities that her role provided. She established a schedule separate from that of her husband, which often consisted of solo activities. As second lady, Nixon traveled more than 125,000 miles around the world to six continents, including a two-month, 42,000-mile journey through Asia in 1953.<ref name=\"pat nixon\"/> As she undertook missions of goodwill across the world, she insisted on visiting schools, orphanages, hospitals and village markets rather than attend tea or coffee functions. In this sense, Nixon essentially created the modern role of the second lady; historian [[Kate Andersen Brower]] wrote, \"she helped to define this nebulous role for an entire generation of women who would succeed her.\"<ref name=\"pat nixon\"/>\n\nIn 1978, [[Muriel Humphrey Brown|Muriel Humphrey]], wife of Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]], became the only former second lady to hold public office; after her husband, who had returned to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] after his term as vice president, died in office, she was appointed by [[Governor of Minnesota|Minnesota governor]] [[Rudy Perpich]] to continue her husband's term. [[Tipper Gore]], wife of Vice President [[Al Gore]], was active in several campaigns to remove material she found objectionable from popular American entertainment like [[motion picture|movies]], [[television|television shows]] and [[music]], starting when her husband was a [[United States senator|senator]]. She challenged performers over their use of profane lyrics and often debated with her critics, such as [[Dead Kennedys]] singer [[Jello Biafra]]. [[Lynne Cheney]], wife of Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], championed [[education]] reform, citing specific failures of the American [[public education]] system during her tenure as second lady. She is a particularly outspoken supporter of American [[history]] education, having written five [[Bestseller|bestselling]] books on this topic for children and their families.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/mrscheney/ |title=Mrs. Lynne Cheney |accessdate=2008-10-13 |work=whitehouse.gov |publisher=The White House}}</ref> [[Jill Biden]], wife of Vice President [[Joe Biden]], works as an English professor at [[Northern Virginia Community College]], and is thought to be the first second lady to hold a paying job while her husband was vice president.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abcarian |first=Robin Abcarian |title=Hi, I'm Jill.

Beginning in 1013, [[Norway]] (presumably also intended to include all her colonies, like [[Orkney]], as later under [[Denmark-Norway]]), came into [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], in the rule of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]].\n\nIn 1497, when [[John Cabot]] landed on the same island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], just on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and nowhere near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], he raised the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Pope|Papal]] banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King [[Henry VII of England]], while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, \"Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world\" pp. 179\u2013180</ref> A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and \"he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England\".<ref name=\"The John Day Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|title= The John Day Letter|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2018-05-14}}</ref>\nIn 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded the first Catholic colony in [[Quebec City]].\n\n[[Missionary]] work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9 as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of [[Mi'kma'ki]]. Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9's ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Flech\u00e9 erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.63</ref> In 1611, the [[Society of Jesus]] started its missionary work in [[Acadia]].

Although the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation Agreement of 1867]] guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the [[Manitoba]] [[Manitoba Schools Question|Schools Question]]  in the 1890s and [[Ontario]] in the 1910s.<ref>Margaret Prang, \"Clerics, Politicians, and the Bilingual Schools Issue in Ontario, 1910\u20131917.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 41.4 (1960): 281-307.</ref> In Ontario, [[Regulation 17]] was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. [[Pope Benedict XV]] asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario.<ref>Bock, Michel.

The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Irish Catholicism was \"[[ultramontanism|ultramontane]]\", which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of [[Regulation 17]] this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

The Protestants narrowly elected [[Hugh Hoyles]] as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This 'denominational compromise' was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.<ref>Frederick Jones, \"HOYLES, Sir HUGH WILLIAM,\" in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 11, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003\u2013, accessed May 25, 2015. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hoyles_hugh_william_11E.html.</ref> Newfoundland's denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s.

(whose mother had converted and brought Catholicism to what became the Diocese of [[Gar\u00f0ar, Greenland]]), his sister and at least two brothers, according to the [[Vinland Sagas]]. Beginning in 1013, [[Norway]] (presumably also intended to include all her colonies, like [[Orkney]], as later under [[Denmark-Norway]]), came into [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], in the rule of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]].\n\nIn 1497, when [[John Cabot]] landed on the same island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], just on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and nowhere near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], he raised the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Pope|Papal]] banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King [[Henry VII of England]], while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, \"Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world\" pp. 179\u2013180</ref> A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and \"he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England\".<ref name=\"The John Day Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|title= The John Day Letter|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2018-05-14}}</ref>\nIn 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded the first Catholic colony in [[Quebec City]].\n\n[[Missionary]] work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9 as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of [[Mi'kma'ki]]. Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9's ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Flech\u00e9 erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.63</ref> In 1611, the [[Society of Jesus]] started its missionary work in [[Acadia]]. Unlike their predecessor, the Jesuits began their work on Mi'kma'ki by learning the local language and living alongside the [[Mi'kmaq]] in order to instruct and convert them to Catholicism.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.74</ref>\n\nIn 1620, [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]] purchased a tract of land in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] from Sir [[William Vaughan (writer)|William Vaughan]] and established a colony, calling it Avalon, after the legendary spot where [[Christianity]] was introduced to Britain.<ref name=\"Browne, William Hand\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9kwOAAAAIAAJ |title=George Calvert and Cecilius Calvert: Barons Baltimore of Baltimore|publisher=New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company|accessdate=2013-01-23|year=1890}}</ref> In 1627 Calvert brought two Catholic priests to Avalon. This was the first continuous Catholic ministry in [[British North America]]. Despite the severe religious conflicts of the period, Calvert secured the right of Catholics to practice their religion unimpeded in Newfoundland, and embraced the novel principle of religious [[toleration|tolerance]], which he wrote into the Charter of Avalon and the later [[Province of Maryland#Founding charter|Charter of Maryland]]. The [[Province of Avalon|Colony of Avalon]] was thus the first [[North America]]n jurisdiction to practice religious tolerance.<ref name=\"Sir George Calvert\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/avalon.html|title=Sir George Calvert and the Colony of Avalon|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===British Rule in Canada===\nIn the way of the Canada Conquest in 1759, New France became a British colony. Nevertheless, the [[Catholic Church]] continued to grow in [[Canada]] due to the flexibility imposed on the British regime in Canada by the [[Head of state|sovereigns]] of the [[United Kingdom]] who always spoke in favor of the protection of [[Catholicism]] and [[French-speaking]] people in Canada.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/catholicism |title=Catholicism |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6KBIoZf4A</ref> This historical perspective still influences Canadian society today.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921|title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

Although the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation Agreement of 1867]] guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the [[Manitoba]] [[Manitoba Schools Question|Schools Question]]  in the 1890s and [[Ontario]] in the 1910s.<ref>Margaret Prang, \"Clerics, Politicians, and the Bilingual Schools Issue in Ontario, 1910\u20131917.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 41.4 (1960): 281-307.</ref> In Ontario, [[Regulation 17]] was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. [[Pope Benedict XV]] asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario.<ref>Bock, Michel.

The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Irish Catholicism was \"[[ultramontanism|ultramontane]]\", which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of [[Regulation 17]] this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

Tensions were [[Manitoba Schools Question|especially high in Manitoba]] at the end of the 19th century.  In [[Alberta]] in the 1920s, a new Irish bishop undermined French language Catholic schooling, and removed the Francophile order of teaching sisters.<ref>Henry Wostenberg, \"Language Controversy in the Red Deer Catholic Parish, 1924-1932\" ''Alberta History'' (2013) 61#4 [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-349221834/language-controversy-in-the-red-deer-catholic-parish online]</ref>\n\n=== Newfoundland ===\nIn the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] (which was an independent dominion before joining Canada in 1949), politics was polarized around religious lines, with the Protestants confronting the Irish Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|author=John P.

The Protestants narrowly elected [[Hugh Hoyles]] as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This 'denominational compromise' was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.<ref>Frederick Jones, \"HOYLES, Sir HUGH WILLIAM,\" in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 11, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003\u2013, accessed May 25, 2015. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hoyles_hugh_william_11E.html.</ref> Newfoundland's denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s. In the fall of 1998, Newfoundland officially adopted a non-denominational school system, following two referenda and judgements by the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and its Court of Appeal that constitutionally recognized the end of provincially-funded Catholic schools.<ref>The Collapse of Denominational Education\" in ''Heritage Newfoundland & Labrador'' by Jenny Higgins, 2011. \u2013, accessed May 29, 2018. https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/collapse-denominational-education.php</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\nIt appears that across Canada the [[Catholic Church]] is declining, resulting in [[Deconsecration|closures]] of more and more churches in all [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] of country. Identification with [[Catholicism]] (as well as to other sects of [[Christianity]]) in Canada is also declining.
