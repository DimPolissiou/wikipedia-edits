It is known today mainly as a centre for tourism, as the home of [[Kendal mint cake]], and as a producer of pipe tobacco and [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]]. Its local grey [[limestone]] buildings have earned it the nickname \"Auld Grey Town\".\n\n==Name==\n''Kendal'' takes its name from the River Kent (the etymology of whose name is uncertain but thought to be [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]) and the [[Old Norse]] word ''dalr'' (\"valley\"). Kendal is listed in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of [[Yorkshire]] with the name Cherchebi (from Old Norse ''kirkju-b\u00fd'', \"church-village\"). For many centuries it was called Kirkby Kendal: \"village with a church in the valley of the River Kent\".<ref>A. D. Mills, ''Dictionary of English Place Names'', Oxford: OUP, 1998.</ref><ref>''The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society'', ed. by Victor Watts, Cambridge: CUP, 2004), under ''River KENT'' and ''KENDAL''.</ref>\n\n==History==\nA chartered [[market town]], the centre of Kendal has formed round a high street with fortified alleyways, known locally as yards, off to either side, which allowed local people to  shelter from the Anglo-Scottish raiders known as [[Border Reivers]]. The main industry in those times was the manufacture of [[wool]]len goods, whose importance is reflected in the town's [[Heraldry|coat of arms]] and in its Latin motto ''Pannus mihi panis'' (Cloth is my bread.) \"Kendal Green\" was a hard-wearing, wool-based fabric specific to the local manufacturing process. It was supposedly sported by the Kendalian archers instrumental in the English victory over the French at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Kendal Green was also worn by slaves in the Americas and appears in songs and literature from that time. Shakespeare notes it as the colour of clothing worn by foresters (''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'').\n\n[[Kendal Castle]] has a long history as a stronghold, built on the site of several successive castles. The earliest was a Norman [[motte and bailey]] (now located on the west side of the town), when the settlement went under the name of Kirkbie Strickland.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The most recent is from the late 12th century, as the castle of the [[Barony of Kendal]], the part of Westmorland ruled from here. The castle is best known as the home of the Parr family, as heirs of these barons. They inherited it through marriage in the reign of [[Edward III of England]]. Rumours still circulate that King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s sixth wife [[Catherine Parr]] was born at Kendal Castle, but the evidence available leaves this unlikely: by her time the castle was beyond repair and her father was already based in Blackfriars, London, at the court of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>Linda Porter.

He brought with him 50 tons of second-hand equipment, all carried on horseback. Pipe tobacco and other tobacco products were added later to the firm's production. Ownership of the firm passed to a son-in-law, Samuel Gawith, whose eponymic firm [[Samuel Gawith & Co.]] remains in business. After Gawith's death in 1865, the firm passed to his two eldest sons, being administered initially by trustees, including Henry Hoggarth, and John Thomas Illingworth.\n\nIllingworth left the firm in 1867 to start his own firm, which remained in business until the 1980s. The youngest son of Samuel Gawith subsequently teamed with Henry Hoggarth to form Gawith Hoggarth TT, Ltd. Both firms continue in business in Kendal, producing snuffs and tobacco products used around the world. Samuel Gawith and Company holds the distinction of employing the oldest piece of industrial equipment still in use in the world: a device manufactured in the 1750s.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Governance==\n===Civic history===\nThe [[municipal borough]] of Kendal was created in 1835; until 1894 it was also an [[sanitary district|urban sanitary district]]. The borough boundaries were altered in 1935 under a [[Local Government Act 1929|County Review Order]] to include a patch of [[South Westmorland Rural District]]. The [[civil parishes]] of Kirkland and Nether Graveship became in 1908 part of Kendal Civil Parish, whose boundaries thereafter were the same as the borough's. From 1888 to 1974, Kendal was the centre of the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of [[Westmorland]], although [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]] was the traditional [[county town]].\n\nThe borough was abolished in 1974 under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], becoming part of the [[South Lakeland]] district of [[Cumbria]].

It is known today mainly as a centre for tourism, as the home of [[Kendal mint cake]], and as a producer of pipe tobacco and [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]]. Its local grey [[limestone]] buildings have earned it the nickname \"Auld Grey Town\".\n\n==Name==\n''Kendal'' takes its name from the River Kent (the etymology of whose name is uncertain but thought to be [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]) and the [[Old Norse]] word ''dalr'' (\"valley\"). Kendal is listed in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of [[Yorkshire]] with the name Cherchebi (from Old Norse ''kirkju-b\u00fd'', \"church-village\"). For many centuries it was called Kirkby Kendal: \"village with a church in the valley of the River Kent\".<ref>A. D. Mills, ''Dictionary of English Place Names'', Oxford: OUP, 1998.</ref><ref>''The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society'', ed. by Victor Watts, Cambridge: CUP, 2004), under ''River KENT'' and ''KENDAL''.</ref>\n\n==History==\nA chartered [[market town]], the centre of Kendal has formed round a high street with fortified alleyways, known locally as yards, off to either side, which allowed local people to  shelter from the Anglo-Scottish raiders known as [[Border Reivers]]. The main industry in those times was the manufacture of [[wool]]len goods, whose importance is reflected in the town's [[Heraldry|coat of arms]] and in its Latin motto ''Pannus mihi panis'' (Cloth is my bread.) \"Kendal Green\" was a hard-wearing, wool-based fabric specific to the local manufacturing process. It was supposedly sported by the Kendalian archers instrumental in the English victory over the French at the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. Kendal Green was also worn by slaves in the Americas and appears in songs and literature from that time. Shakespeare notes it as the colour of clothing worn by foresters (''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'').\n\n[[Kendal Castle]] has a long history as a stronghold, built on the site of several successive castles. The earliest was a Norman [[motte and bailey]] (now located on the west side of the town), when the settlement went under the name of Kirkbie Strickland.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The most recent is from the late 12th century, as the castle of the [[Barony of Kendal]], the part of Westmorland ruled from here. The castle is best known as the home of the Parr family, as heirs of these barons. They inherited it through marriage in the reign of [[Edward III of England]]. Rumours still circulate that King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s sixth wife [[Catherine Parr]] was born at Kendal Castle, but the evidence available leaves this unlikely: by her time the castle was beyond repair and her father was already based in Blackfriars, London, at the court of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>Linda Porter.

He brought with him 50 tons of second-hand equipment, all carried on horseback. Pipe tobacco and other tobacco products were added later to the firm's production. Ownership of the firm passed to a son-in-law, Samuel Gawith, whose eponymic firm [[Samuel Gawith & Co.]] remains in business. After Gawith's death in 1865, the firm passed to his two eldest sons, being administered initially by trustees, including Henry Hoggarth, and John Thomas Illingworth.\n\nIllingworth left the firm in 1867 to start his own firm, which remained in business until the 1980s. The youngest son of Samuel Gawith subsequently teamed with Henry Hoggarth to form Gawith Hoggarth TT, Ltd. Both firms continue in business in Kendal, producing snuffs and tobacco products used around the world.

The [[civil parishes]] of Kirkland and Nether Graveship became in 1908 part of Kendal Civil Parish, whose boundaries thereafter were the same as the borough's. From 1888 to 1974, Kendal was the centre of the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of [[Westmorland]], although [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]] was the traditional [[county town]].\n\nThe borough was abolished in 1974 under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], becoming part of the [[South Lakeland]] district of [[Cumbria]].

A three-mile, \u00a31.9m A591 bypass opened on 29 August 1971.\n\nThe [[Lancaster Canal]] was built as far as Kendal in 1819, but the northern section was rendered unnavigable by the construction of the M6. Part of this section was drained and filled in to prevent leakage, and the course of the canal through Kendal has now been built over. The canal towpath, however, remains as a footpath through Kendal. A campaign is underway to restore the canal as far as Kendal.\n\nKendal has a daily coach service to London.

The introduction of foundation trusts represented a change in the [[history of the National Health Service]] and the way in which hospital services are managed and provided. At the time of introduction they were described \"as a sort of halfway house between the public and private sectors\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/nov/13/health.theissuesexplained | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Patrick | last1=Butler | first2=Simon | last2=Parker | title=Q&A: foundation trusts | date=14 November 2002}}</ref> This form of NHS trust is an important part of the [[United Kingdom]] government's programme to create a \"patient-led\" NHS with an [[Quasi-market|internal market]]. The stated purpose is to devolve decision-making from a centralised NHS to local communities in an effort to be more responsive to their needs and wishes.  But after [[Gordon Brown]] prevented plans by [[Alan Milburn]] to make them financially autonomous<ref name=\"Who Runs Britain\"/> they have been much more in the public sector and less autonomous than was originally expected.\n\n==Mutuality==\n\nEach Foundation Trust has a Council of Governors. This is made up of elected Governors and appointed Governors<!-- Needs reference (as with much of this section) -->. Elected Governors are chosen by a secret, postal ballot, of the membership. The elections are usually held in separate constituencies. Typically there is a staff constituency, a patient constituency, and a \"public member\" constituency consisting of members who are neither patients nor staff but live in a defined geographical area. In addition there are appointed Governors, appointed by bodies with whom the trust works in partnership. So, for example, appointments may be made by local Councils, local medical Schools, and local Voluntary organisations. Governors are intended to act as a link between the community and the Board of Directors.<ref name=\"Members Area - NHS\">[http://www.bfwhospitals.nhs.uk/members/ Members Area \u2013 NHS]</ref> The size of the Council of Governors and its exact composition is determined by the constitution of the particular Trust. Each Trust adopts its own constitution subject to certain restrictions in legislation. (For example, a majority of the Council of Governors must be elected Governors and Governors must be unpaid volunteers. They are intended to act as a link between the community and the Board of Directors.<ref name=\"Members Area - NHS\"/> Some trusts are more committed to co-operative principles and have even written the [[Rochdale Principles]] into their constitution and aspire to work closely and in partnership with other mutual as well as local organisations.<ref>South London & Maudsley NHS Trust.

They are authorised and regulated by [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]], the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts. They include acute trusts, mental health, community and ambulance trusts. A full list of NHS foundation trusts can be found on Monitor's website.<ref name=\"monitor-register\">Monitor: Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts [http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/register.php Public Register of NHS Foundation Trusts]. Accessed 19 May 2008</ref>\nWith the authorisation of North East Ambulance Service in November 2011, the North East became the first region with all trusts having gained foundation trust status.\n\nThe trade body for foundation trusts is [http://www.nhsproviders.org NHS Providers], formerly known as the Foundation Trust Network, which has 95% of all acute, ambulance, community and mental health foundation trusts and trusts in its membership. The chief executive of NHS Providers is Chris Hopson.\n\n== Equivalent Foundation Trusts (eFT) ==\nFormerly referred to as ''Foundation Trust equivalent'' (FTe), this designation applies only to trusts providing high secure psychiatric services. There are three: [[Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust]], [[West London Mental Health NHS Trust]] and [[Mersey Care NHS Trust]]. Nottinghamshire Healthcare gained Foundation Trust standard on 2 November 2010. The other two trusts are in the assessment process.\n\nThese trusts abide by the same Department of Health definition for a Foundation Trust but the Secretary of State (SoS) for Health maintains a direct line of communication and accountability with them because the SoS has the responsibility to provide healthcare to patients who have been detained under the [[Mental Health Act]], and have been judged to pose a grave and immediate danger to the public.\n\nUnlike full Foundation Trusts, Governors have no statutory role. The Board of Directors have no statutory duty towards the governors. The governors cannot, without the Board of Directors' permission, have any control over the direction of the FT. The governors cannot appoint or remove trust auditors. The chair and directors are not appointed by their board of governors. Equivalent Foundation Trust organisations are still regulated by Monitor, and can retain surplus cash and can sell property and retain the cash from the sale.\n\n==Comparison with other NHS trusts==\n<!-- Have Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland introduced equivalents of Foundation Trusts -->\n<!-- How do they differ from Nuffield, BUPA and other private and not-for-profit hospitals?  Similarities? -->\n<!-- How do they differ from other English NHS hospitals? Similarities? -->\n\nFoundation trusts had a cap on the proportion of their income that can come from non-NHS treatments.  It did not only apply to income derived from individual patients, it covered income from all non-NHS sources. This could include joint ventures to develop medical technologies, employers paying for counselling services or income from treating UK military personnel overseas.\n\nThe Health and Social Care Act 2012 abolished the private patient income cap but FTs have to do the majority of their work for the NHS. This restriction was kept to reassure those concerned about future developments that FTs would continue to have NHS work as their central concern. Previously each FT had its own cap, set at the level of its private activity when the first FTs were established in 2003/4. About three-quarters of all FTs had a cap of 1.5% or less. Until 2010 all mental health trusts were completely barred from undertaking non NHS work, but after lobbying from the Foundation Trust Network it was raised to 1.5%. These caps disappeared on 1 October 2012.  Collective earnings from private patients increased 14%, from \u00a3346.1 million in 2012\u201313 to \u00a3395.9 million for 2014\u201315. Private earning is concentrated on specialist hospitals in London who see many patients from other countries.  Most Trusts have negligible private income.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHS private pay income up 14% in two years|url=http://www.healthinvestor.co.uk/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=4259|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=Health Investor|date=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nFoundation Trusts also have different reporting requirements. They produce their accounts under the Foundation Trust Financial Report Manual, which is collated and authorised by Monitor, in liaison with HM Treasury. They also have to produce annual Quality Accounts.\n\n==Achieving Foundation Trust status==\n\nIn order to achieve Foundation Trust status, NHS Trusts have to pass a variety of tests, which have changed over time.  In 2003 only trusts with three stars from the [[Commission for Health Improvement]] were eligible for foundation status. In that year Aintree Hospitals, Essex Rivers Healthcare, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals and Walsall Hospitals were all downgraded to two stars and so did not make the first wave of Foundation Trusts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Foundation hopefuls lose out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3068203.stm|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=16 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reservations==\n\nThe public's perception of Foundation Trust status implying a high standard of clinical care was changed by the [[Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust]] scandal ([[Stafford Hospital scandal|Stafford Hospital Scandal]]) and the Francis enquiry published in 2013. At the outset some critics claimed that Foundation Trusts go against the spirit of the principles laid out by [[Aneurin Bevan]] (who founded the NHS). Others feared that it would lead to a two-tier system. Others doubted whether the Foundation Trust members would succeed in having any effective influence over hospital management. A study undertaken in 2005 by the [[King's Fund]] of [[Homerton University Hospital|Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust]] found some governors disappointed and disillusioned.\n\nAnother report found that it was too easy to invite members to sit on sub-committees, where they quickly became bogged down in the minutiae of operational planning, whilst the main decisions were taken at meetings that they only heard about after they took place.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last =Brettingham  | first = Madeleine| title =Local control over foundation trusts is \"rhetoric\"  | journal =British Medical Journal  | year =2005  | url =http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7505/1408-d  | doi =10.1136/bmj.330.7505.1408-d  | pmc = 558406 | volume =330  | pages =1408 | issue=7505}}</ref> This study was funded by the [[Nuffield Foundation]].\n\nIn June 2014 Bill Moyes, former Monitor executive chair, urged the NHS to reconsider \"whether the model of foundation trusts is sensible\", arguing \"If one-third of the hospital system is permanently not demonstrating good viability and good governance, is that telling you something about actually how the system should run as opposed to how we thought it should run?\u201d<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Moyes questions whether FT model remains 'sensible'|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/foundation-trusts/bill-moyes-questions-whether-ft-model-remains-sensible/5071945.article#.U8PwnvldUk4|accessdate=14 July 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nSome have argued that the success associated with foundation trusts has been due to {{clarify span|other factors|date=January 2017}}.<ref>Goddard, Maria; Verzulli, Rossella; Jacobs, Rowena (July 2011) [http://www.york.ac.uk/media/che/documents/papers/researchpapers/RP64_Foundation_Trusts.pdf Do Hospitals Respond to Greater Autonomy?

A foundation trust finance facility, managed by an advisory committee to the Department of Health, dealing with loans to foundation trusts was established to cover capital developments, but during 2014 applications were made by trusts which had trouble paying utility bills or replacing medical equipment.  Guidance issued in October 2014 said that conditions could be set which could include: reductions in the use of temporary staff, \"use of collaborative procurement routes\" or \"the adoption of a shared services solution\".<ref>{{cite news|title=DH sets new bailout conditions for foundation trusts|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/dh-sets-new-bailout-conditions-for-foundation-trusts/5075976.article#.VGpsPfmsUk4|accessdate=17 November 2014|date=21 October 2014}}</ref> By the end of 2013\u201314 Foundation Trusts collectively had built up cash reserves of \u00a34.3 billion and it was suggested in the NHS [[Five Year Forward View]], that the government would \"support\" foundation trusts to spend this money \"to help local service transformation\".

The introduction of foundation trusts represented a change in the [[history of the National Health Service]] and the way in which hospital services are managed and provided. At the time of introduction they were described \"as a sort of halfway house between the public and private sectors\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/nov/13/health.theissuesexplained | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Patrick | last1=Butler | first2=Simon | last2=Parker | title=Q&A: foundation trusts | date=14 November 2002}}</ref> This form of NHS trust is an important part of the [[United Kingdom]] government's programme to create a \"patient-led\" NHS with an [[Quasi-market|internal market]]. The stated purpose is to devolve decision-making from a centralised NHS to local communities in an effort to be more responsive to their needs and wishes.  But after [[Gordon Brown]] prevented plans by [[Alan Milburn]] to make them financially autonomous<ref name=\"Who Runs Britain\"/> they have been much more in the public sector and less autonomous than was originally expected.\n\n==Mutuality==\n\nEach Foundation Trust has a Council of Governors. This is made up of elected Governors and appointed Governors<!-- Needs reference (as with much of this section) -->. Elected Governors are chosen by a secret, postal ballot, of the membership. The elections are usually held in separate constituencies. Typically there is a staff constituency, a patient constituency, and a \"public member\" constituency consisting of members who are neither patients nor staff but live in a defined geographical area. In addition there are appointed Governors, appointed by bodies with whom the trust works in partnership. So, for example, appointments may be made by local Councils, local medical Schools, and local Voluntary organisations. Governors are intended to act as a link between the community and the Board of Directors.<ref name=\"Members Area - NHS\">[http://www.bfwhospitals.nhs.uk/members/ Members Area \u2013 NHS]</ref> The size of the Council of Governors and its exact composition is determined by the constitution of the particular Trust. Each Trust adopts its own constitution subject to certain restrictions in legislation. (For example, a majority of the Council of Governors must be elected Governors and Governors must be unpaid volunteers. They are intended to act as a link between the community and the Board of Directors.<ref name=\"Members Area - NHS\"/> Some trusts are more committed to co-operative principles and have even written the [[Rochdale Principles]] into their constitution and aspire to work closely and in partnership with other mutual as well as local organisations.<ref>South London & Maudsley NHS Trust.

They are authorised and regulated by [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]], the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts. They include acute trusts, mental health, community and ambulance trusts. A full list of NHS foundation trusts can be found on Monitor's website.<ref name=\"monitor-register\">Monitor: Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts [http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/register.php Public Register of NHS Foundation Trusts]. Accessed 19 May 2008</ref>\nWith the authorisation of North East Ambulance Service in November 2011, the North East became the first region with all trusts having gained foundation trust status.\n\nThe trade body for foundation trusts is [http://www.nhsproviders.org NHS Providers], formerly known as the Foundation Trust Network, which has 95% of all acute, ambulance, community and mental health foundation trusts and trusts in its membership. The chief executive of NHS Providers is Chris Hopson.\n\n== Equivalent Foundation Trusts (eFT) ==\nFormerly referred to as ''Foundation Trust equivalent'' (FTe), this designation applies only to trusts providing high secure psychiatric services. There are three: [[Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust]], [[West London Mental Health NHS Trust]] and [[Mersey Care NHS Trust]]. Nottinghamshire Healthcare gained Foundation Trust standard on 2 November 2010. The other two trusts are in the assessment process.\n\nThese trusts abide by the same Department of Health definition for a Foundation Trust but the Secretary of State (SoS) for Health maintains a direct line of communication and accountability with them because the SoS has the responsibility to provide healthcare to patients who have been detained under the [[Mental Health Act]], and have been judged to pose a grave and immediate danger to the public.\n\nUnlike full Foundation Trusts, Governors have no statutory role. The Board of Directors have no statutory duty towards the governors. The governors cannot, without the Board of Directors' permission, have any control over the direction of the FT. The governors cannot appoint or remove trust auditors. The chair and directors are not appointed by their board of governors. Equivalent Foundation Trust organisations are still regulated by Monitor, and can retain surplus cash and can sell property and retain the cash from the sale.\n\n==Comparison with other NHS trusts==\n<!-- Have Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland introduced equivalents of Foundation Trusts -->\n<!-- How do they differ from Nuffield, BUPA and other private and not-for-profit hospitals?  Similarities? -->\n<!-- How do they differ from other English NHS hospitals? Similarities? -->\n\nFoundation trusts had a cap on the proportion of their income that can come from non-NHS treatments.  It did not only apply to income derived from individual patients, it covered income from all non-NHS sources. This could include joint ventures to develop medical technologies, employers paying for counselling services or income from treating UK military personnel overseas.\n\nThe Health and Social Care Act 2012 abolished the private patient income cap but FTs have to do the majority of their work for the NHS. This restriction was kept to reassure those concerned about future developments that FTs would continue to have NHS work as their central concern. Previously each FT had its own cap, set at the level of its private activity when the first FTs were established in 2003/4. About three-quarters of all FTs had a cap of 1.5% or less. Until 2010 all mental health trusts were completely barred from undertaking non NHS work, but after lobbying from the Foundation Trust Network it was raised to 1.5%. These caps disappeared on 1 October 2012.  Collective earnings from private patients increased 14%, from \u00a3346.1 million in 2012\u201313 to \u00a3395.9 million for 2014\u201315. Private earning is concentrated on specialist hospitals in London who see many patients from other countries.  Most Trusts have negligible private income.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHS private pay income up 14% in two years|url=http://www.healthinvestor.co.uk/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=4259|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=Health Investor|date=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nFoundation Trusts also have different reporting requirements. They produce their accounts under the Foundation Trust Financial Report Manual, which is collated and authorised by Monitor, in liaison with HM Treasury. They also have to produce annual Quality Accounts.\n\n==Achieving Foundation Trust status==\n\nIn order to achieve Foundation Trust status, NHS Trusts have to pass a variety of tests, which have changed over time.  In 2003 only trusts with three stars from the [[Commission for Health Improvement]] were eligible for foundation status. In that year Aintree Hospitals, Essex Rivers Healthcare, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals and Walsall Hospitals were all downgraded to two stars and so did not make the first wave of Foundation Trusts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Foundation hopefuls lose out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3068203.stm|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=16 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reservations==\n\nThe public's perception of Foundation Trust status implying a high standard of clinical care was changed by the [[Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust]] scandal ([[Stafford Hospital scandal|Stafford Hospital Scandal]]) and the Francis enquiry published in 2013. At the outset some critics claimed that Foundation Trusts go against the spirit of the principles laid out by [[Aneurin Bevan]] (who founded the NHS). Others feared that it would lead to a two-tier system. Others doubted whether the Foundation Trust members would succeed in having any effective influence over hospital management. A study undertaken in 2005 by the [[King's Fund]] of [[Homerton University Hospital|Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust]] found some governors disappointed and disillusioned.\n\nAnother report found that it was too easy to invite members to sit on sub-committees, where they quickly became bogged down in the minutiae of operational planning, whilst the main decisions were taken at meetings that they only heard about after they took place.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last =Brettingham  | first = Madeleine| title =Local control over foundation trusts is \"rhetoric\"  | journal =British Medical Journal  | year =2005  | url =http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7505/1408-d  | doi =10.1136/bmj.330.7505.1408-d  | pmc = 558406 | volume =330  | pages =1408 | issue=7505}}</ref> This study was funded by the [[Nuffield Foundation]].\n\nIn June 2014 Bill Moyes, former Monitor executive chair, urged the NHS to reconsider \"whether the model of foundation trusts is sensible\", arguing \"If one-third of the hospital system is permanently not demonstrating good viability and good governance, is that telling you something about actually how the system should run as opposed to how we thought it should run?\u201d<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Moyes questions whether FT model remains 'sensible'|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/foundation-trusts/bill-moyes-questions-whether-ft-model-remains-sensible/5071945.article#.U8PwnvldUk4|accessdate=14 July 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nSome have argued that the success associated with foundation trusts has been due to {{clarify span|other factors|date=January 2017}}.<ref>Goddard, Maria; Verzulli, Rossella; Jacobs, Rowena (July 2011) [http://www.york.ac.uk/media/che/documents/papers/researchpapers/RP64_Foundation_Trusts.pdf Do Hospitals Respond to Greater Autonomy?

Accessed 21 July 2011</ref>\n\n==Finance==\nThe early foundation trusts were generally financially buoyant, but during 2013 and 2014 more faced financial difficulties.  A foundation trust finance facility, managed by an advisory committee to the Department of Health, dealing with loans to foundation trusts was established to cover capital developments, but during 2014 applications were made by trusts which had trouble paying utility bills or replacing medical equipment.  Guidance issued in October 2014 said that conditions could be set which could include: reductions in the use of temporary staff, \"use of collaborative procurement routes\" or \"the adoption of a shared services solution\".<ref>{{cite news|title=DH sets new bailout conditions for foundation trusts|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/dh-sets-new-bailout-conditions-for-foundation-trusts/5075976.article#.VGpsPfmsUk4|accessdate=17 November 2014|date=21 October 2014}}</ref> By the end of 2013\u201314 Foundation Trusts collectively had built up cash reserves of \u00a34.3 billion and it was suggested in the NHS [[Five Year Forward View]], that the government would \"support\" foundation trusts to spend this money \"to help local service transformation\".  In response the chief executive of the Foundation Trust Network Chris Hopson said: \"The responsibility for these surpluses lies with the FTs; any attempt by the statutory bodies to make a grab for them will be furiously resisted\".<ref>{{cite news|title=FTs will resist forced expenditure on primary care|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/fts-will-resist-forced-expenditure-on-primary-care/5076652.article#.VGxhM_msUk4|accessdate=19 November 2014|date=13 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Erosion==\nBy 2016 the distinction between Foundation Trusts and other NHS trusts was widely regarded as eroded. The two separate regulators were combined into a new body [[NHS Improvement]]. The notion that every trust should become a Foundation Trust was abandoned and the widespread financial crisis undermined the supposed autonomy when almost all had to rely on money borrowed from the Department of Health to which strings were attached.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Collins|first1=Ben|title=The foundation trust model: death by a thousand cuts|url=http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2016/02/foundation-trust-model|accessdate=28 June 2016|publisher=Kings Fund|date=15 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the National Health Service]]\n* [[List of NHS Trusts]]\n* [[National Health Service]]\n* [[:Category:NHS Foundation Trusts]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book\n  | last = Pollock\n  | first =Allyson\n  |author2=Colin Leys\n   | title =NHS plc : the privatisation of our health care\n  | publisher =Verso Books\n  | date =21 September 2005\n  | pages = 75\u2013295\n  | isbn = 978-1-84467-539-5 }}\n\n* Patricia Day and Rudolf Klein Governance of Foundation Trusts The Nuffield Trust 2005\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.foundationtrustnetwork.org Foundation Trust Network]\n*[http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk Monitor]\n* [http://www.dh.gov.uk/PolicyAndGuidance/OrganisationPolicy/SecondaryCare/NHSFoundationTrust/fs/en Department of Health information on NHS Foundation Trusts]\n* [http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/register.php Public register of NHS Foundation Trusts]\n* Unison (January 2007 Revised edition).
