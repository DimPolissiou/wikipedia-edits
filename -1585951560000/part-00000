The abdomen swells as her eggs develop,  until the translucent tip of the ootheca begins to protrude from the end of her abdomen, and by that time the eggs inside are fully sized, about 1/4 inch long with 16 segments.  The ootheca, at first translucent, soon turns white and then within a few hours it turns pink, progressively darkening until, some 48 hours later, it attains the dark red-brown of the shell of a chestnut.  The ootheca has a keel-like ridge along the line where the young emerge, and curls slightly towards that edge as it completes its maturation.  A small percentage of the nymphs may hatch while the ootheca is still attached to the female, but the majority emerge some 24 hours after it has detached from the female's body.  The newly hatched 3-mm-long black nymphs then progress through six or seven [[instar]]s before becoming sexually mature, but [[ecdysis]] is such a hazardous process that nearly half the nymphs die of natural causes before reaching adulthood.  Molted skins and dead nymphs are soon eaten by living nymphs present at the time of molting.<ref name=\"Ebeling\" />\n\n== Pest control ==\nThe German cockroach is very successful at establishing an [[ecological niche]] in buildings, and is resilient in the face of many [[pest-control]] measures. Reasons include:\n* lack of natural [[predator]]s in a human habitat\n* prolific reproduction\n* short reproductive cycle\n* the ability to hide in very small refuges\n* sexual maturity attained within several weeks, and\n* adaptation and resistance to some [[chemical pesticides]]\nGerman cockroaches are [[thigmotactic]], meaning they prefer confined spaces, and they are small compared to other pest species, so they can hide within small cracks and crevices that are easy to overlook, thereby evading humans and their eradication efforts. Conversely, the seasoned pest controller is alert for cracks and crevices where it is likely to be profitable to place baits or spray surfaces.\n\nTo be effective, control measures must be comprehensive, sustained, and systematic; survival of just a few eggs is quite enough to regenerate a nearly exterminated pest population within a few generations, and recolonisation from surrounding populations often is very rapid, too.<ref name=\"CaliforniaWisconsin1994\" />\n\nAnother problem in controlling German cockroaches is the nature of their population behaviour. Though they are not social and practise no organised maternal care, females carry oothecae of 18-50 eggs (average about 32) during incubation until just before hatching, instead of dropping them as most other species of cockroaches do. This protects the eggs from certain classes of predation. Then, after hatching, nymphs largely survive by consuming excretions and moults from adults, thereby establishing their own internal microbial populations and avoiding contact with most insecticidal surface treatments and baits.  One effective control is insect growth regulators (hydroprene, methoprene, etc.), which act by preventing molting, thus prevent maturation of the various instars.  Caulking baseboards and around pipes may prevent the travel of adults from one apartment to another within a building.\n\n[[File:Blatella germanica cdc.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Female German cockroach with [[ootheca]]]]\nAs an [[Adaptation|adaptive]] consequence of pest control by poisoned sugar baits, a strain of German cockroaches has emerged that reacts to glucose as distastefully bitter. They refuse to eat sweetened baits, which presents an obstacle to their control, given that baits are an economical and effective means of control. It also is a dramatic illustration of adaptive selection; in the absence of poisoned sweet baits, attraction to sugars strongly promotes growth, energy, and reproduction; cockroaches that are not attracted to sugars take longer to grow and reproduce, whereas in the presence of poisoned sugared baits, sugar avoidance promotes reproduction.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wada-Katsumata | first1 = A. | last2 = Silverman | first2 = J. | last3 = Schal | first3 = C. | doi = 10.1126/science.1234854 | title = Changes in Taste Neurons Support the Emergence of an Adaptive Behavior in Cockroaches | journal = Science | volume = 340 | issue = 6135 | pages = 972\u20135 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23704571| pmc = | bibcode = 2013Sci...340..972W }} ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22611143 summary at BBC News])</ref>\n\n== Comparison of three common cockroaches ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Roach''' || German cockroach || [[Oriental cockroach]] || [[American cockroach]]\n|-on|'''Size''' || {{convert|13|\u2013|16|mm|in|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || {{convert|18|\u2013|29|mm|in|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Robinson2005\">{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=William H.|title=Urban Insects and Arachnids: A Handbook of Urban Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aluUgDVYJ8wC&pg=PA51|date=14 April 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81253-5|pages=45\u201346, 51\u201354}}</ref> || {{convert|29|\u2013|53|mm|in|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" />\n|-\n|'''Preferred temperature''' || {{convert|15|\u2013|35|C|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Bassett2012\">{{cite book|last=Bassett|first=W.H. |title=Clay's Handbook of Environmental Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ck2qO5Gyj40C&pg=PT317|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-81033-7|page=317}}</ref> || {{convert|20|\u2013|30|C|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || {{convert|20|\u2013|29|C|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Bassett2012\" />\n|-\n|'''Nymphal development'''{{efn|Dependent on several factors, including temperature (significantly), sex, and nutrition.}} || 54\u2013215 days<br />(at {{convert|24|\u2013|35|C|abbr=on}})<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || 164\u2013542 days<br />(at {{convert|22|\u2013|30|C|abbr=on}})<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || 150\u2013360 days<br />(at {{convert|25|\u2013|30|C|abbr=on}})<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" />\n|-\n|'''Lifespan''' || Around 200 days<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || 35\u2013190 days<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || 90\u2013706 days<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" />\n|-\n|'''Able to fly?''' || Uncommon{{efn|German cockroaches can glide, especially males, but powered flight is uncommon.}}<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || No<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || Yes<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" />\n|}\n\n== Genome ==\nThe genome of the German cockroach was published in February 2018 in ''[[Nature Ecology and Evolution]]''.<ref name=\"Harrison2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Mark C.|last2=Jongepier|first2=Evelien|last3=Robertson|first3=Hugh M.|last4=Arning|first4=Nicolas|last5=Bitard-Feildel|first5=Tristan|last6=Chao|first6=Hsu|last7=Childers|first7=Christopher P.|last8=Dinh|first8=Huyen|last9=Doddapaneni|first9=Harshavardhan|last10=Dugan|first10=Shannon|last11=Gowin|first11=Johannes|last12=Greiner|first12=Carolin|last13=Han|first13=Yi|last14=Hu|first14=Haofu|last15=Hughes|first15=Daniel S.

Molted skins and dead nymphs are soon eaten by living nymphs present at the time of molting.<ref name=\"Ebeling\" />\n\n== Pest control ==\nThe German cockroach is very successful at establishing an [[ecological niche]] in buildings, and is resilient in the face of many [[pest-control]] measures. Reasons include:\n* lack of natural [[predator]]s in a human habitat\n* prolific reproduction\n* short reproductive cycle\n* the ability to hide in very small refuges\n* sexual maturity attained within several weeks, and\n* adaptation and resistance to some [[chemical pesticides]]\nGerman cockroaches are [[thigmotactic]], meaning they prefer confined spaces, and they are small compared to other pest species, so they can hide within small cracks and crevices that are easy to overlook, thereby evading humans and their eradication efforts. Conversely, the seasoned pest controller is alert for cracks and crevices where it is likely to be profitable to place baits or spray surfaces.\n\nTo be effective, control measures must be comprehensive, sustained, and systematic; survival of just a few eggs is quite enough to regenerate a nearly exterminated pest population within a few generations, and recolonisation from surrounding populations often is very rapid, too.<ref name=\"CaliforniaWisconsin1994\" />\n\nAnother problem in controlling German cockroaches is the nature of their population behaviour. Though they are not social and practise no organised maternal care, females carry oothecae of 18-50 eggs (average about 32) during incubation until just before hatching, instead of dropping them as most other species of cockroaches do. This protects the eggs from certain classes of predation. Then, after hatching, nymphs largely survive by consuming excretions and moults from adults, thereby establishing their own internal microbial populations and avoiding contact with most insecticidal surface treatments and baits.  One effective control is insect growth regulators (hydroprene, methoprene, etc.), which act by preventing molting, thus prevent maturation of the various instars.  Caulking baseboards and around pipes may prevent the travel of adults from one apartment to another within a building.\n\n[[File:Blatella germanica cdc.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Female German cockroach with [[ootheca]]]]\nAs an [[Adaptation|adaptive]] consequence of pest control by poisoned sugar baits, a strain of German cockroaches has emerged that reacts to glucose as distastefully bitter. They refuse to eat sweetened baits, which presents an obstacle to their control, given that baits are an economical and effective means of control. It also is a dramatic illustration of adaptive selection; in the absence of poisoned sweet baits, attraction to sugars strongly promotes growth, energy, and reproduction; cockroaches that are not attracted to sugars take longer to grow and reproduce, whereas in the presence of poisoned sugared baits, sugar avoidance promotes reproduction.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wada-Katsumata | first1 = A. | last2 = Silverman | first2 = J. | last3 = Schal | first3 = C. | doi = 10.1126/science.1234854 | title = Changes in Taste Neurons Support the Emergence of an Adaptive Behavior in Cockroaches | journal = Science | volume = 340 | issue = 6135 | pages = 972\u20135 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23704571| pmc = | bibcode = 2013Sci...340..972W }} ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22611143 summary at BBC News])</ref>\n\n== Comparison of three common cockroaches ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Roach''' || German cockroach || [[Oriental cockroach]] || [[American cockroach]]\n|-on|'''Size''' || {{convert|13|\u2013|16|mm|in|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || {{convert|18|\u2013|29|mm|in|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Robinson2005\">{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=William H.|title=Urban Insects and Arachnids: A Handbook of Urban Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aluUgDVYJ8wC&pg=PA51|date=14 April 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81253-5|pages=45\u201346, 51\u201354}}</ref> || {{convert|29|\u2013|53|mm|in|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" />\n|-\n|'''Preferred temperature''' || {{convert|15|\u2013|35|C|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Bassett2012\">{{cite book|last=Bassett|first=W.H. |title=Clay's Handbook of Environmental Health|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ck2qO5Gyj40C&pg=PT317|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-81033-7|page=317}}</ref> || {{convert|20|\u2013|30|C|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || {{convert|20|\u2013|29|C|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Bassett2012\" />\n|-\n|'''Nymphal development'''{{efn|Dependent on several factors, including temperature (significantly), sex, and nutrition.}} || 54\u2013215 days<br />(at {{convert|24|\u2013|35|C|abbr=on}})<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || 164\u2013542 days<br />(at {{convert|22|\u2013|30|C|abbr=on}})<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || 150\u2013360 days<br />(at {{convert|25|\u2013|30|C|abbr=on}})<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" />\n|-\n|'''Lifespan''' || Around 200 days<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || 35\u2013190 days<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || 90\u2013706 days<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" />\n|-\n|'''Able to fly?''' || Uncommon{{efn|German cockroaches can glide, especially males, but powered flight is uncommon.}}<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || No<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" /> || Yes<ref name=\"Robinson2005\" />\n|}\n\n== Genome ==\nThe genome of the German cockroach was published in February 2018 in ''[[Nature Ecology and Evolution]]''.<ref name=\"Harrison2018\">{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Mark C.|last2=Jongepier|first2=Evelien|last3=Robertson|first3=Hugh M.|last4=Arning|first4=Nicolas|last5=Bitard-Feildel|first5=Tristan|last6=Chao|first6=Hsu|last7=Childers|first7=Christopher P.|last8=Dinh|first8=Huyen|last9=Doddapaneni|first9=Harshavardhan|last10=Dugan|first10=Shannon|last11=Gowin|first11=Johannes|last12=Greiner|first12=Carolin|last13=Han|first13=Yi|last14=Hu|first14=Haofu|last15=Hughes|first15=Daniel S.
