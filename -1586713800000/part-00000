Early apoptotic cells express \u201ceat-me\u201d signals, of cell-surface proteins such as phosphatidylserine, that prompt immune cells to engulf them. Apoptotic cells also express \u201cfind-me\u201d signals, to attract macrophages and dendritic cells. When apoptotic material is not removed correctly by phagocytes, they are captured instead by antigen-presenting cells, which leads to development of antinuclear antibodies.<ref name=Lancet2014/>\n\n[[Monocytes]] isolated from [[whole blood]] of people with SLE show reduced expression of [[CD44]] surface molecules involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells. Most of the monocytes and tingible body macrophages (TBMs), which are found in the [[germinal centre]]s of [[lymph nodes]], even show a definitely different morphology; they are smaller or scarce and die earlier. Serum components like [[Complement system|complement]] factors, [[C-reactive protein|CRP]], and some [[glycoproteins]] are, furthermore, decisively important for an efficiently operating phagocytosis. With SLE, these components are often missing, diminished, or inefficient.\n\nRecent research has found an association between certain people with lupus (especially those with [[lupus nephritis]]) and an impairment in degrading [[neutrophil extracellular traps]] (NETs). These were due to [[Deoxyribonuclease I|DNAse1]] inhibiting factors, or NET protecting factors in people's serum, rather than abnormalities in the DNAse1 itself.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hakkim A, F\u00fcrnrohr BG, Amann K, etal |title=Impairment of neutrophil extracellular trap degradation is associated with lupus nephritis |journal=Proc.

It leads to a progression of the apoptosis process and finally to secondary [[necrosis]] of the cells if this ability is disturbed. Necrotic cells release nuclear fragments as potential [[autoantigens]], as well as internal danger signals, inducing maturation of [[dendritic cells]] (DCs), since they have lost their membranes' integrity. Increased appearance of apoptotic cells also stimulates inefficient clearance. That leads to maturation of DCs and also to the presentation of intracellular antigens of late apoptotic or secondary necrotic cells, via MHC molecules.\n[[Autoimmunity]] possibly results by the extended exposure to nuclear and intracellular autoantigens derived from late apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells. B and [[T cell]] tolerance for apoptotic cells is abrogated, and the [[lymphocytes]] get activated by these autoantigens; [[inflammation]] and the production of autoantibodies by [[plasma cells]] is initiated. A clearance deficiency in the skin for apoptotic cells has also been observed in people with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gaipl US, Munoz LE, Grossmayer G, et al |title=Clearance deficiency and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) |journal=J.

However, about 50 % of people with SLE show rather normal germinal centre.]]\nIn healthy conditions, apoptotic lymphocytes are removed in [[germinal center]]s (GC) by specialized phagocytes, the tingible body macrophages (TBM), which is why no free apoptotic and potential autoantigenic material can be seen. In some people with SLE, buildup of apoptotic [[debris]] can be observed in GC because of an ineffective clearance of apoptotic cells. In close proximity to TBM, [[follicular dendritic cells]] (FDC) are localised in GC, which attach antigen material to their surface and, in contrast to [[bone marrow]]-derived DC, neither take it up nor present it via [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] molecules.\n\nAutoreactive [[B cells]] can accidentally emerge during [[somatic hypermutation]] and migrate into the germinal center light zone. Autoreactive B cells, maturated coincidentally, normally do not receive survival signals by antigen planted on follicular dendritic cells and perish by apoptosis. In the case of clearance deficiency, apoptotic nuclear debris accumulates in the light zone of GC and gets attached to FDC. This serves as a germinal centre survival signal for autoreactive B-cells. After migration into the mantle zone, autoreactive B cells require further survival signals from autoreactive helper T cells, which promote the maturation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells and B memory cells. In the presence of autoreactive T cells, a chronic [[autoimmune disease]] may be the consequence.\n\n===Anti-nRNP autoimmunity===\n[[Anti-nRNP]] [[autoantibodies]] to [[nRNP A]] and [[nRNP C]] initially targeted restricted, [[proline]]-rich [[sequence motif|motifs]].

Mild or remittent disease may, sometimes, be safely left untreated. If required, [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s and [[malaria|antimalarials]] may be used. Medications such as [[prednisone]], [[mycophenolic acid]] and [[tacrolimus]] have been used in the past.\n\n====Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs====\n[[Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]]s (DMARDs) are used preventively to reduce the incidence of flares, the progress of the disease, and the need for steroid use; when flares occur, they are treated with [[corticosteroids]]. DMARDs commonly in use are antimalarials such as [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[immunosuppressants]] (e.g. [[methotrexate]] and [[azathioprine]]). Hydroxychloroquine is an FDA-approved antimalarial used for constitutional, cutaneous, and articular manifestations.

Depending on the dosage, people who require steroids may develop [[Cushing's syndrome]], symptoms of which may include [[obesity]], puffy round face, [[diabetes mellitus]], increased appetite, difficulty sleeping and [[osteoporosis]]. These may subside if and when the large initial dosage is reduced, but long-term use of even low doses can cause elevated [[blood pressure]] and [[cataracts]].\n\nNumerous new immunosuppressive drugs are being actively tested for SLE. Rather than suppressing the immune system nonspecifically, as corticosteroids do, they target the responses of individual [types of] immune cells.

Potent NSAIDs such as [[indomethacin]] and [[diclofenac]] are relatively contraindicated for people with SLE because they increase the risk of kidney failure and heart failure.<ref name=Vasudevan/>\n\nPain is typically treated with [[opioids]], varying in potency based on the severity of symptoms. When opioids are used for prolonged periods, drug tolerance, chemical dependency, and addiction may occur. Opiate addiction is not typically a concern since the condition is not likely to ever completely disappear. Thus, lifelong treatment with opioids is fairly common for chronic pain symptoms, accompanied by periodic titration that is typical of any long-term opioid regimen.\n\n====Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs)====\n[[Intravenous immunoglobulin]]s may be used to control SLE with organ involvement, or [[vasculitis]].

Early mortality, within 5 years, is due to organ failure or overwhelming infections, both of which can be altered by early diagnosis and treatment. The mortality risk is fivefold when compared to the normal population in the late stages, which can be attributed to cardiovascular disease from accelerated atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death for people with SLE.<ref name=Vasudevan/> To reduce the potential for cardiovascular issues, high blood pressure and high cholesterol should be prevented or treated aggressively.

In females, the rate is highest between 45 and 64 years of age. The lowest overall rate exists in Iceland and Japan. The highest rates exist in the US and France. However, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude why SLE is less common in some countries compared to others; it could be the environmental variability in these countries. For example, different countries receive different levels of sunlight, and exposure to UV rays affects dermatological symptoms of SLE. Certain studies hypothesize that a genetic connection exists between race and lupus which affects disease prevalence. If this is true, the racial composition of countries affects disease, and will cause the incidence in a country to change as the racial makeup changes.

The mask is called a \"loup,\" French for \"wolf.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n=== Classical period ===\nThe classical period began when the disease was first recognized in the Middle Ages.

Cazenave termed the illness lupus and added the word erythematosus to distinguish this disease from other illnesses that affected the skin except they were infectious.<ref name=Phillips>{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Robert H.|title=Coping with Lupus: A Practical Guide to Alleviating the Challenges of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus|date=2012|publisher=The Penguin Group|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-58333-445-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781583334454/page/11 11\u201312]|edition=4th|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781583334454/page/11}}</ref> Cazenave observed the disease in several people and made very detailed notes to assist others in its diagnosis.

They documented the physical effects of lupus as well as some insights into the possibility that the disease caused internal trauma. Von Hebra observed that lupus symptoms could last many years and that the disease could go \"dormant\" after years of aggressive activity and then re-appear with symptoms following the same general pattern. These observations led Hebra to term lupus a chronic disease in 1872.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hebra|first1=Ferdinand|editor1-last=Fagge|editor1-first=C.

Kaposi also observed those patients who developed the \"butterfly rash\" (or malar rash) often were afflicted with another disease such as tuberculosis, anemia, or chlorisis which often caused death.<ref name=Talbott /> Kaposi was one of the first people to recognize what is now termed systemic lupus erythematosus in his documentation of the remitting and relapsing nature of the disease and the relationship of skin and systemic manifestations during disease activity.<ref name=Rostein>{{cite journal|last1=Rostein|first1=J.|editor1-last=Kargar|editor1-first=S.|title=Immunosuppresion Systemic Lupus Erythematosus|journal=Rheumatology: An Annual Review|date=1974|volume=5|issue=5 volumes 1967\u20131974|pages=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\nThe 19th century's research into lupus continued with the work of [[Sir William Osler]] who, in 1895, published the first of his three papers about the internal complications of [[erythema exudativum multiforme]]. Not all the patient cases in his paper had SLE but Osler's work expanded the knowledge of systemic diseases and documented extensive and critical visceral complications for several diseases including lupus.<ref name=Talbott /> Noting that many people with lupus had a disease that not only affected the skin but many other organs in the body as well, Osler added the word \"systemic\" to the term lupus erythematosus to distinguish this type of disease from discoid lupus erythematosus.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=Ronald I.|title=Lupus Erythematosus: A Handbook for Physicians, Patients, and their Families|date=1986|publisher=Lupus Foundation of America Inc.|edition=2nd|page=3}}</ref> Osler's second paper noted that reoccurrence is a special feature of the disease and that attacks can be sustained for months or even years. Further study of the disease led to a third paper, published in 1903, documenting afflictions such as arthritis, pneumonia, the inability to form coherent ideas, delirium, and central nervous system damage as all affecting patients diagnosed with SLE.<ref name=Talbott />\n\n=== Modern period ===\nThe modern period, beginning in 1920, saw major developments in research into the cause and treatment of discoid and systemic lupus. Research conducted in the 1920s and 1930s led to the first detailed pathologic descriptions of lupus and demonstrated how the disease affected the kidney, heart, and lung tissue.<ref name=Wallace>{{cite book|last1=Wallace|first1=Daniel J.|title=The Lupus Book|url=https://archive.org/details/lupusbook00wall|url-access=registration|date=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/lupusbook00wall/page/8 8]}}</ref> A major breakthrough was made in 1948 with the discovery of the LE cell (the lupus erythematosus cell\u2014a misnomer, as it occurs with other diseases as well). Discovered by a team of researchers at the [[Mayo Clinic]], they discovered that the white blood cells contained the nucleus of another cell that was pushing against the white's cell proper nucleus.<ref name=Carr>{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=Robert I.|title=Lupus Erythematosus: A Handbook for Physicians, Patients and Their Families|date=1986|publisher=Lupus Foundation of America Inc.|edition=2nd|page=15}}</ref> Noting that the invading nucleus was coated with antibody that allowed it to be ingested by a phagocytic or scavenger cell, they named the antibody that causes one cell to ingest another the LE factor and the two nuclei cell result in the LE cell.<ref name=Lahita>{{cite book|authorlink1=Robert G.

This discovery led to one of the first definitive tests for lupus since LE cells are found in approximately 60% of all people diagnosed with lupus.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Robert H.|title=Coping with Lupus: A Practical Guide to Alleviating the Challenges of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus|date=2012|publisher=The Penguin Group|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-58333-445-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781583334454/page/24 24]|edition=4th|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781583334454/page/24}}</ref> The LE cell test is rarely performed as a definitive lupus test today as LE cells do not always occur in people with SLE and can occur in individuals with other autoimmune diseases. Their presence can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis but no longer indicates a definitive SLE diagnosis.\n\nThe discovery of the LE cell led to further research and this resulted in more definitive tests for lupus. Building on the knowledge that those with SLE had auto-antibodies that would attach themselves to the nuclei of normal cells, causing the immune system to send white blood cells to fight off these \"invaders\", a test was developed to look for the anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) rather than the LE cell specifically. This ANA test was easier to perform and led not only to a definitive diagnosis of lupus but also many other related diseases. This discovery led to the understanding of what is now known as autoimmune diseases.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas, Jr.|first1=Donald E.|title=The Lupus Encyclopedia: A Comprehensive Guide for Patients and Families|date=2014|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, USA|isbn=978-1-4214-0984-9|page=26}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure that the person has lupus and not another autoimmune disease, the [[American College of Rheumatology|American College of Rheumatology (ACR)]] established a list of clinical and immunologic criteria that, in any combination, point to SLE. The criteria include symptoms that the person can identify (e.g. pain) and things that a physician can detect in a physical examination and through laboratory test results. The list was originally compiled in 1971, initially revised in 1982, and further revised and improved in 2009.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas, Jr.|first1=Donald E.|title=The Lupus Encyclopedia: A Comprehensive Guide for Patients and Families|date=2014|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, USA|isbn=978-1-4214-0984-9|pages=17\u201321}}</ref>\n\nMedical historians have theorized that people with [[porphyria]] (a disease that shares many symptoms with SLE) generated folklore stories of vampires and werewolves, due to the photosensitivity, scarring, hair growth, and porphyrin brownish-red stained teeth in severe recessive forms of porphyria (or combinations of the disorder, known as dual, homozygous, or compound heterozygous porphyrias).<ref name=\"historyof\">{{cite journal |author=Hochberg MC |title=The history of lupus erythematosus |journal=Md Med J |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=871\u20133 |date=October 1991 |pmid=1943516 }}</ref>\n\nUseful medication for the disease was first found in 1894, when [[quinine]] was first reported as an effective therapy. Four years later, the use of [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]]s in conjunction with quinine was noted to be of still greater benefit.

Early apoptotic cells express \u201ceat-me\u201d signals, of cell-surface proteins such as phosphatidylserine, that prompt immune cells to engulf them. Apoptotic cells also express \u201cfind-me\u201d signals, to attract macrophages and dendritic cells. When apoptotic material is not removed correctly by phagocytes, they are captured instead by antigen-presenting cells, which leads to development of antinuclear antibodies.<ref name=Lancet2014/>\n\n[[Monocytes]] isolated from [[whole blood]] of people with SLE show reduced expression of [[CD44]] surface molecules involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells. Most of the monocytes and tingible body macrophages (TBMs), which are found in the [[germinal centre]]s of [[lymph nodes]], even show a definitely different morphology; they are smaller or scarce and die earlier. Serum components like [[Complement system|complement]] factors, [[C-reactive protein|CRP]], and some [[glycoproteins]] are, furthermore, decisively important for an efficiently operating phagocytosis. With SLE, these components are often missing, diminished, or inefficient.\n\nRecent research has found an association between certain people with lupus (especially those with [[lupus nephritis]]) and an impairment in degrading [[neutrophil extracellular traps]] (NETs).

It leads to a progression of the apoptosis process and finally to secondary [[necrosis]] of the cells if this ability is disturbed. Necrotic cells release nuclear fragments as potential [[autoantigens]], as well as internal danger signals, inducing maturation of [[dendritic cells]] (DCs), since they have lost their membranes' integrity. Increased appearance of apoptotic cells also stimulates inefficient clearance. That leads to maturation of DCs and also to the presentation of intracellular antigens of late apoptotic or secondary necrotic cells, via MHC molecules.\n[[Autoimmunity]] possibly results by the extended exposure to nuclear and intracellular autoantigens derived from late apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells. B and [[T cell]] tolerance for apoptotic cells is abrogated, and the [[lymphocytes]] get activated by these autoantigens; [[inflammation]] and the production of autoantibodies by [[plasma cells]] is initiated. A clearance deficiency in the skin for apoptotic cells has also been observed in people with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gaipl US, Munoz LE, Grossmayer G, et al |title=Clearance deficiency and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) |journal=J.

In some people with SLE, buildup of apoptotic [[debris]] can be observed in GC because of an ineffective clearance of apoptotic cells. In close proximity to TBM, [[follicular dendritic cells]] (FDC) are localised in GC, which attach antigen material to their surface and, in contrast to [[bone marrow]]-derived DC, neither take it up nor present it via [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] molecules.\n\nAutoreactive [[B cells]] can accidentally emerge during [[somatic hypermutation]] and migrate into the germinal center light zone. Autoreactive B cells, maturated coincidentally, normally do not receive survival signals by antigen planted on follicular dendritic cells and perish by apoptosis. In the case of clearance deficiency, apoptotic nuclear debris accumulates in the light zone of GC and gets attached to FDC. This serves as a germinal centre survival signal for autoreactive B-cells. After migration into the mantle zone, autoreactive B cells require further survival signals from autoreactive helper T cells, which promote the maturation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells and B memory cells. In the presence of autoreactive T cells, a chronic [[autoimmune disease]] may be the consequence.\n\n===Anti-nRNP autoimmunity===\n[[Anti-nRNP]] [[autoantibodies]] to [[nRNP A]] and [[nRNP C]] initially targeted restricted, [[proline]]-rich [[sequence motif|motifs]].

DMARDs commonly in use are antimalarials such as [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[immunosuppressants]] (e.g. [[methotrexate]] and [[azathioprine]]).

Depending on the dosage, people who require steroids may develop [[Cushing's syndrome]], symptoms of which may include [[obesity]], puffy round face, [[diabetes mellitus]], increased appetite, difficulty sleeping and [[osteoporosis]]. These may subside if and when the large initial dosage is reduced, but long-term use of even low doses can cause elevated [[blood pressure]] and [[cataracts]].\n\nNumerous new immunosuppressive drugs are being actively tested for SLE. Rather than suppressing the immune system nonspecifically, as corticosteroids do, they target the responses of individual [types of] immune cells.

Potent NSAIDs such as [[indomethacin]] and [[diclofenac]] are relatively contraindicated for people with SLE because they increase the risk of kidney failure and heart failure.<ref name=Vasudevan/>\n\nPain is typically treated with [[opioids]], varying in potency based on the severity of symptoms. When opioids are used for prolonged periods, drug tolerance, chemical dependency, and addiction may occur. Opiate addiction is not typically a concern since the condition is not likely to ever completely disappear. Thus, lifelong treatment with opioids is fairly common for chronic pain symptoms, accompanied by periodic titration that is typical of any long-term opioid regimen.\n\n====Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs)====\n[[Intravenous immunoglobulin]]s may be used to control SLE with organ involvement, or [[vasculitis]].

Early mortality, within 5 years, is due to organ failure or overwhelming infections, both of which can be altered by early diagnosis and treatment. The mortality risk is fivefold when compared to the normal population in the late stages, which can be attributed to cardiovascular disease from accelerated atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death for people with SLE.<ref name=Vasudevan/> To reduce the potential for cardiovascular issues, high blood pressure and high cholesterol should be prevented or treated aggressively.

In females, the rate is highest between 45 and 64 years of age. The lowest overall rate exists in Iceland and Japan. The highest rates exist in the US and France. However, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude why SLE is less common in some countries compared to others; it could be the environmental variability in these countries. For example, different countries receive different levels of sunlight, and exposure to UV rays affects dermatological symptoms of SLE. Certain studies hypothesize that a genetic connection exists between race and lupus which affects disease prevalence. If this is true, the racial composition of countries affects disease, and will cause the incidence in a country to change as the racial makeup changes.

More likely is that it is derived from the similarity in distribution to [[lupus vulgaris]] or chronic facial tuberculosis where the lesions are ragged and punched out and are said to resemble the bite of a wolf.\n# Another account claims that the term \"lupus\" did not come from Latin directly but from the term for a French style of mask that women reportedly wore to conceal the rash on their faces. The mask is called a \"loup,\" French for \"wolf.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n=== Classical period ===\nThe classical period began when the disease was first recognized in the Middle Ages.

Von Hebra observed that lupus symptoms could last many years and that the disease could go \"dormant\" after years of aggressive activity and then re-appear with symptoms following the same general pattern.

Not all the patient cases in his paper had SLE but Osler's work expanded the knowledge of systemic diseases and documented extensive and critical visceral complications for several diseases including lupus.<ref name=Talbott /> Noting that many people with lupus had a disease that not only affected the skin but many other organs in the body as well, Osler added the word \"systemic\" to the term lupus erythematosus to distinguish this type of disease from discoid lupus erythematosus.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=Ronald I.|title=Lupus Erythematosus: A Handbook for Physicians, Patients, and their Families|date=1986|publisher=Lupus Foundation of America Inc.|edition=2nd|page=3}}</ref> Osler's second paper noted that reoccurrence is a special feature of the disease and that attacks can be sustained for months or even years.

Their presence can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis but no longer indicates a definitive SLE diagnosis.\n\nThe discovery of the LE cell led to further research and this resulted in more definitive tests for lupus. Building on the knowledge that those with SLE had auto-antibodies that would attach themselves to the nuclei of normal cells, causing the immune system to send white blood cells to fight off these \"invaders\", a test was developed to look for the anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) rather than the LE cell specifically. This ANA test was easier to perform and led not only to a definitive diagnosis of lupus but also many other related diseases.

Historically Crossens was entirely in Lancashire, but [[Southport]], along with most of Crossens, was transferred to [[Merseyside]] in April 1974 when local government boundaries were reorganised nationally. Whilst most of the village is now within [[Merseyside]], part of northern Crossens known as Fiddlers Ferry, is in [[West Lancashire]].  Formerly, Crossens was a detached settlement lying on the western edge of [[Martin Mere]], but after the drainage of the Mere and the expansion of Southport, it had become absorbed into the town's conurbation.\n\nFormerly Crossenes or Crosnes meaning a \u201cness\u201d or headland with a cross. The cross was possibly a guide for shipping or people crossing the Ribble Estuary from Freckleton (near Lytham). A hospice or lodging house was sited in Crossens where travellers could rest after making the crossing.

After the [[Second World War]], the family moved to Switzerland, where his father chauffeured for a millionaire and the [[Western European Union]]. In 1946 Peggy brought Ian back to England and they stayed with her sister, Mary, a doctor in [[Cranham]], a small village in Essex. Although he saw his father on visits, they never lived together again.<ref>Balls, Richard (2000), pp. 16\u201324</ref>\n\nAt the age of seven, Dury contracted [[polio]], most likely, he believed, from a swimming pool at [[Southend-on-Sea]] during the [[History of poliomyelitis#Epidemics|1949 polio epidemic]].

Home improvement expert Harold Hill of Harold Hill, Of do-it-yourself dexterity and double-glazing skill, Came home to find another gentleman's kippers in the grill, So he sanded off his winkle with his Black & Decker drill.\" The song \"[[Billericay Dickie]]\" rhymes \"I had a love affair with Nina, In the back of my [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]]\" with \"A seasoned-up hyena Could not have been more obscener\".\n\nThe Blockheads' sound drew from its members' diverse musical influences, which included [[jazz]], rock and roll, [[funk]], and [[reggae]], and Dury's love of [[music hall]]. The band was formed after Dury began writing songs with pianist and guitarist [[Chas Jankel|Chaz Jankel]] (the brother of noted music video, TV, commercial and film director [[Annabel Jankel]]). Jankel took Dury's lyrics, fashioned a number of songs, and they began recording with members of [[Radio Caroline]]'s Loving Awareness Band{{snd}} drummer [[Charley Charles]] (born Hugh Glenn Mortimer Charles, [[Guyana]] 1945), bassist [[Norman Watt-Roy]], keyboard player [[Mick Gallagher]], guitarist [[John Turnbull (musician)|John Turnbull]] and former Kilburns saxophonist [[Davey Payne]]. An album was completed, but major record labels passed on the band. Next door to Dury's manager's office was the newly formed [[Stiff Records]], a perfect home for Dury's maverick style.\n\nThe single \"[[Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll]]\", released 26 August 1977, marked Dury's Stiff debut. Although it was banned by the [[BBC]] it was named Single of the Week by ''[[NME]]'' on its release.<ref name=\"pennyblack\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/Article/4896/Blockheads-Interview |first=John |last=Clarkson |title=Mickey Gallagher interview, October 2008 |publisher=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk |date=28 October 2008|accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref> The single issue was soon followed, at the end of September, by the album ''[[New Boots and Panties!!]]'' which, although it did not include the single, achieved platinum status.\n\n[[File:duryegg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Live at The Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, London, 1978]]\nIn October 1977 Dury and his band started performing as Ian Dury & the Blockheads, when the band signed on for the Stiff \"Live Stiffs Tour\" alongside [[Elvis Costello]] & [[the Attractions]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Wreckless Eric]], and [[Larry Wallis]]. The tour was a success, and Stiff launched a concerted Ian Dury marketing campaign, resulting in the Top Ten hit \"[[What a Waste]]\", and the hit single \"[[Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK at the beginning of 1979, selling just short of a million copies. Again, \"Hit Me\" was not included on the original release of the subsequent album ''[[Do It Yourself (Ian Dury & the Blockheads album)|Do It Yourself]]''. With their hit singles, the band built up a dedicated following in the UK and other countries and their next single \"[[Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3]]\" made number three in the UK.\nThe band's second album ''Do It Yourself'' was released in June 1979 in a [[Barney Bubbles]]-designed sleeve of which there were over a dozen variations, all based on samples from the [[Crown Wallpaper|Crown]] [[wallpaper]] catalogue.

Partly due to personality clashes with Dury,<ref name=\"pennyblack\"/> Jankel left the group again in 1980, after the recording of the ''Do It Yourself'' LP, and he returned to the US to concentrate on his solo career.\nThe group worked solidly over the eighteen months between the release of \"Rhythm Stick\" and their next single, \"Reasons to Be Cheerful\", which returned them to the charts, making the UK Top 10. Jankel was replaced by former [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] guitarist [[Wilko Johnson]], who also contributed to the next album ''[[Laughter (Ian Dury & The Blockheads album)|Laughter]]'' (1980) and its two hit singles, although Gallagher recalls that the recording of the ''Laughter'' album was difficult and that Dury was drinking heavily in this period.<ref name=\"pennyblack\"/>\n\nIn 1980\u201381 Dury and Jankel teamed up again with [[Sly and Robbie]] and the [[Compass Point All Stars]] to record ''[[Lord Upminster]]'' (1981).

Choosing to work with a group of young musicians which he named the Music Students, he recorded the album ''Four Thousand Weeks' Holiday''. This album marked a departure from his usual style and was not as well received by fans for its American jazz influence.\n\nThe Blockheads briefly reformed in June 1987 to play a short tour of Japan, and then disbanded again. In September 1990, following the death from cancer of drummer Charley Charles, they reunited for two benefit concerts in aid of Charles' family, held at [[The Forum, London|The Forum]], [[Camden Town]], with [[Steven Monti]] on drums. In December 1990, augmented by Merlin Rhys-Jones on guitar and Will Parnell on percussion, they recorded the live album ''Warts & Audience'' at the [[Brixton Academy]].<ref name=\"Blockheads official website\"/>\n\nThe Blockheads (minus Jankel, who returned to California) toured Spain in January 1991, then disbanded again until August 1992 when, following Jankel's return to England, they were invited to reform for the [[Madstock!]] Festival in [[Finsbury Park]];<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/ian-dury-and-the-blockheads/1992/finsbury-park-london-england-13ddf5d9.html |title=Ian Dury & The Blockheads Setlist |publisher=Setlist.fm |date= |accessdate=18 June 2018}}</ref> this was followed by sporadic gigs in Europe, Ireland, the UK and Japan in late 1994 and 1995.<ref name=\"Blockheads official website\"/> In the early 1990s, Dury appeared with English band [[Curve (band)|Curve]] on the benefit compilation album ''[[Peace Together]]''. Dury and Curve singer [[Toni Halliday]] shared vocals on a cover of the Blockheads' track \"What a Waste\".\n\nIn March 1996 Dury was diagnosed with cancer and, after recovering from an operation, he set about writing another album. In late 1996 he reunited with the Blockheads to record the album ''[[Mr. Love Pants]]'' (1997). Ian Dury & the Blockheads resumed touring, with Dylan Howe replacing Steven Monti on drums. Davey Payne left the group permanently in August and was replaced by [[Gilad Atzmon]]; this line-up gigged throughout 1999, culminating in their last performance with Ian Dury on 6 February 2000 at the [[London Palladium]]. Dury died six weeks later on 27 March 2000.<ref name=\"Blockheads official website\"/>\n\nThe Blockheads have continued after Dury's death, contributing to the tribute album ''Brand New Boots And Panties'', then ''Where's The Party''. The Blockheads currently comprise Jankel, Watt-Roy, Gallagher, Turnbull, John Roberts on drums, Gilad Atzmon and Dave Lewis on saxes. Derek The Draw (who was Dury's friend and minder) is now writing songs with Jankel as well as singing. [[Lee Harris (guitarist)|Lee Harris]] is their '[[aide de camp]]'.\n\n====Roger Daltrey====\nIn 1984, Dury was featured in the music video for the minor hit single \"[[Walking in My Sleep]]\" by [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[The Who]].\n\n===Spasticus Autisticus===\nDury's 1981 song \"[[Spasticus Autisticus]]\"{{snd}} written to show his disdain for that year's [[International Year of Disabled Persons]], which he saw as patronising and counter-productive{{snd}} was banned by the [[BBC]]. Dury was a disabled person himself, having been left crippled by childhood polio. The lyrics were uncompromising:\n<poem>\n          So place your hard-earned peanuts in my tin\n          And thank the Creator you're not in the state I'm in\n          So long have I been languished on the shelf\n          I must give all proceedings to myself</poem>\nThe song's refrain, \"I'm spasticus, autisticus\", was inspired by the response of the rebellious Roman [[gladiator]]s in the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', who, when instructed to identify their leader, all answered, \"I am [[Spartacus]]\", to protect him. According to Professor George McKay, in a 2009 article in ''Popular Music'' called 'Crippled with nerves' (an early Dury song title):\n\n{{quote|Ian Dury, that 'flaw of the jungle', produced a remarkable and sustained body of work that explored issues of disability, in both personal and social contexts, institutionalisation, and to a lesser extent the pop cultural tradition of disability. He also, with the single \"Spasticus Autisticus\" (1981), produced one of the outstanding protest songs about the place of disabled people in what he called 'normal land'.<ref>{{cite journal |first=George |last=McKay |date=2009 |url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2372/1/displayFulltext.pdf |title='Crippled with nerves': popular music and polio, with particular reference to Ian Dury |journal=Popular Music |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=341\u2013365 |doi=10.1017/S0261143009990109|accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nDury described the song as \"a war cry\" on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. The song was banned from being broadcast by the [[BBC]] before 6 p.m. when it first came out; it was later used at the opening of the [[London 2012 Paralympics]].\n\n===Acting and other activities===\n[[File:Ian Dury2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dury in concert]]\nDury's confident and unusual demeanour caught the eyes of producers and directors of drama. His first important and extensive role was in [[Farrukh Dhondy]]'s mini-series for the BBC ''[[King of the Ghetto]]'' (1986), a drama set in London's multi-racial [[Brick Lane]] area with a cast led by a young [[Tim Roth]].\n\nDury had small parts in several films, probably the best known of which was [[Peter Greenaway]]'s\n''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]'' (1989), as well as a [[cameo role|cameo appearance]] in [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Pirates (1986 film)|Pirates]]'' (1986).

In 1987 he appeared as the narrator (Scullery) in ''[[Road (play)|Road]]'', also at the Royal Court. Among the cast was actress and singer [[Jane Horrocks]], who cohabited with Dury until late in 1988, although the relationship was kept discreet.<ref>Balls, Richard (2000), pp. 264\u20136</ref>\n\nDury wrote and performed the theme song \"Profoundly in Love with Pandora\" for the television series ''[[The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13\u00be]]'' (1985), based on the book of the same name by [[Sue Townsend]], as well as its follow-up, ''[[The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole]]'' (1987).

He was the lead singer of [[The Blockheads|Ian Dury and the Blockheads]] and before that of [[Kilburn and the High Roads]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nDury was born, and spent his early years, at his parents' home at 43 Weald Rise, [[Harrow Weald]], Middlesex (though he often pretended that he had been born in [[Upminster]], Essex, which all but one of his obituaries in the UK national press stated as fact).<ref>{{cite book | first= Richard | last= Balls | year= 2000 | title= Sex & Drugs & Rock'N'Roll: The Life of Ian Dury | edition= 1st | publisher=Omnibus Press | location= London | pages= 14\u201316 | isbn= 0-7119-8644-4 }}</ref> His father, William George Dury (born 23 September 1905, [[Southborough, Kent|Southborough]], Kent; died 25 February 1968), was a local bus driver and a former boxer, while his mother Margaret (known as \"Peggy\", born Margaret Cuthbertson Walker, 17 April 1910, [[Rochdale]], Lancashire; died January 1995)<ref>{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Balls |url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/73862 |title=Dury, Ian Robins (1942\u20132000), popular singer, songwriter, and actor |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref> was a [[health visitor]], the daughter of a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] doctor and the granddaughter of an [[Irish people|Irish]] landowner.\n\nWilliam Dury trained with [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] to be a [[chauffeur]], and was then absent for long periods, so Peggy Dury took Ian to stay with her parents in Cornwall. After the [[Second World War]], the family moved to Switzerland, where his father chauffeured for a millionaire and the [[Western European Union]]. In 1946 Peggy brought Ian back to England and they stayed with her sister, Mary, a doctor in [[Cranham]], a small village in Essex. Although he saw his father on visits, they never lived together again.<ref>Balls, Richard (2000), pp. 16\u201324</ref>\n\nAt the age of seven, Dury contracted [[polio]], most likely, he believed, from a swimming pool at [[Southend-on-Sea]] during the [[History of poliomyelitis#Epidemics|1949 polio epidemic]]. After six weeks in a full plaster cast in the [[Royal Cornwall Infirmary]], [[Truro]], he was moved to [[Black Notley]] Hospital, [[Braintree, Essex]], where he spent a year and a half before going to [[Chailey Heritage School|Chailey Heritage Craft School]], East Sussex, in 1951. His illness resulted in the paralysis and withering of his left leg, shoulder and arm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/hit-me-with-your-rhythm-shtick-how-did-ian-dury-become-one-of-the-most-fascinating-rock-stars-of-the-1850025.html|title=Hit me with your rhythm shtick: How did Ian Dury become one of the|date=3 January 2010|website=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nChailey was a school and hospital for disabled children, and believed in toughening them up, contributing to the observant and determined person Dury became.<ref>Balls, Richard (2000) pp. 30\u201335</ref> Chailey taught trades such as [[cobbling]] and printing, but Dury's mother wanted him to be more academic, so his aunt Moll arranged for him to enter the [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe]], where he recounted being punished for misdemeanours by being made to learn long tracts of poetry until a housemaster found him sobbing and put a stop to it:\n{{quote|I had to go into a box room where the suitcases were stored and learn 80 lines of ''[[To Autumn|Ode to Autumn]]'' by yer man [[John Keats|Keats]].

Home improvement expert Harold Hill of Harold Hill, Of do-it-yourself dexterity and double-glazing skill, Came home to find another gentleman's kippers in the grill, So he sanded off his winkle with his Black & Decker drill.\" The song \"[[Billericay Dickie]]\" rhymes \"I had a love affair with Nina, In the back of my [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]]\" with \"A seasoned-up hyena Could not have been more obscener\".\n\nThe Blockheads' sound drew from its members' diverse musical influences, which included [[jazz]], rock and roll, [[funk]], and [[reggae]], and Dury's love of [[music hall]]. The band was formed after Dury began writing songs with pianist and guitarist [[Chas Jankel|Chaz Jankel]] (the brother of noted music video, TV, commercial and film director [[Annabel Jankel]]). Jankel took Dury's lyrics, fashioned a number of songs, and they began recording with members of [[Radio Caroline]]'s Loving Awareness Band{{snd}} drummer [[Charley Charles]] (born Hugh Glenn Mortimer Charles, [[Guyana]] 1945), bassist [[Norman Watt-Roy]], keyboard player [[Mick Gallagher]], guitarist [[John Turnbull (musician)|John Turnbull]] and former Kilburns saxophonist [[Davey Payne]]. An album was completed, but major record labels passed on the band. Next door to Dury's manager's office was the newly formed [[Stiff Records]], a perfect home for Dury's maverick style.\n\nThe single \"[[Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll]]\", released 26 August 1977, marked Dury's Stiff debut. Although it was banned by the [[BBC]] it was named Single of the Week by ''[[NME]]'' on its release.<ref name=\"pennyblack\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/Article/4896/Blockheads-Interview |first=John |last=Clarkson |title=Mickey Gallagher interview, October 2008 |publisher=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk |date=28 October 2008|accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref> The single issue was soon followed, at the end of September, by the album ''[[New Boots and Panties!!]]'' which, although it did not include the single, achieved platinum status.\n\n[[File:duryegg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Live at The Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, London, 1978]]\nIn October 1977 Dury and his band started performing as Ian Dury & the Blockheads, when the band signed on for the Stiff \"Live Stiffs Tour\" alongside [[Elvis Costello]] & [[the Attractions]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Wreckless Eric]], and [[Larry Wallis]]. The tour was a success, and Stiff launched a concerted Ian Dury marketing campaign, resulting in the Top Ten hit \"[[What a Waste]]\", and the hit single \"[[Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK at the beginning of 1979, selling just short of a million copies. Again, \"Hit Me\" was not included on the original release of the subsequent album ''[[Do It Yourself (Ian Dury & the Blockheads album)|Do It Yourself]]''. With their hit singles, the band built up a dedicated following in the UK and other countries and their next single \"[[Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3]]\" made number three in the UK.\nThe band's second album ''Do It Yourself'' was released in June 1979 in a [[Barney Bubbles]]-designed sleeve of which there were over a dozen variations, all based on samples from the [[Crown Wallpaper|Crown]] [[wallpaper]] catalogue. Bubbles also designed the Blockhead logo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aural-innovations.com/robertcalvert/hawkwind/barney.htm |first=Roy |last=Carr |newspaper=New Musical Express |title=Barney Bubbles obituary |accessdate=12 June 2018 |date=26 November 1983}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n| type        = music\n| filename    = Ian Dury And The Blockheads - Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick excerpt.ogg\n| title       = \"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\"\n| description = 24-second sample\n| pos         = right\n}}\nJankel left the band temporarily and relocated to the US after the release of \"What a Waste\" (his organ part on that single was overdubbed later) but he subsequently returned to the UK and began touring sporadically with the Blockheads, eventually returning to the group full-time for the recording of \"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\"; according to Mickey Gallagher, the band recorded 28 takes of the song but eventually settled on the second take for the single release. Partly due to personality clashes with Dury,<ref name=\"pennyblack\"/> Jankel left the group again in 1980, after the recording of the ''Do It Yourself'' LP, and he returned to the US to concentrate on his solo career.\nThe group worked solidly over the eighteen months between the release of \"Rhythm Stick\" and their next single, \"Reasons to Be Cheerful\", which returned them to the charts, making the UK Top 10. Jankel was replaced by former [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] guitarist [[Wilko Johnson]], who also contributed to the next album ''[[Laughter (Ian Dury & The Blockheads album)|Laughter]]'' (1980) and its two hit singles, although Gallagher recalls that the recording of the ''Laughter'' album was difficult and that Dury was drinking heavily in this period.<ref name=\"pennyblack\"/>\n\nIn 1980\u201381 Dury and Jankel teamed up again with [[Sly and Robbie]] and the [[Compass Point All Stars]] to record ''[[Lord Upminster]]'' (1981). The Blockheads toured the UK and Europe throughout 1981, sometimes augmented by jazz trumpeter [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], ending the year with their only tour of Australia.<ref name=\"Blockheads official website\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theblockheads.com/biog.php |title=Blockheads official website |publisher=Theblockheads.com |access-date=30 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509084204/http://www.theblockheads.com/biog.php |archive-date=9 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nThe Blockheads disbanded in early 1982 after Dury secured a new recording deal with [[Polydor Records]] through A&R man Frank Neilson. Choosing to work with a group of young musicians which he named the Music Students, he recorded the album ''Four Thousand Weeks' Holiday''. This album marked a departure from his usual style and was not as well received by fans for its American jazz influence.\n\nThe Blockheads briefly reformed in June 1987 to play a short tour of Japan, and then disbanded again. In September 1990, following the death from cancer of drummer Charley Charles, they reunited for two benefit concerts in aid of Charles' family, held at [[The Forum, London|The Forum]], [[Camden Town]], with [[Steven Monti]] on drums. In December 1990, augmented by Merlin Rhys-Jones on guitar and Will Parnell on percussion, they recorded the live album ''Warts & Audience'' at the [[Brixton Academy]].<ref name=\"Blockheads official website\"/>\n\nThe Blockheads (minus Jankel, who returned to California) toured Spain in January 1991, then disbanded again until August 1992 when, following Jankel's return to England, they were invited to reform for the [[Madstock!]] Festival in [[Finsbury Park]];<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/ian-dury-and-the-blockheads/1992/finsbury-park-london-england-13ddf5d9.html |title=Ian Dury & The Blockheads Setlist |publisher=Setlist.fm |date= |accessdate=18 June 2018}}</ref> this was followed by sporadic gigs in Europe, Ireland, the UK and Japan in late 1994 and 1995.<ref name=\"Blockheads official website\"/> In the early 1990s, Dury appeared with English band [[Curve (band)|Curve]] on the benefit compilation album ''[[Peace Together]]''. Dury and Curve singer [[Toni Halliday]] shared vocals on a cover of the Blockheads' track \"What a Waste\".\n\nIn March 1996 Dury was diagnosed with cancer and, after recovering from an operation, he set about writing another album. In late 1996 he reunited with the Blockheads to record the album ''[[Mr. Love Pants]]'' (1997). Ian Dury & the Blockheads resumed touring, with Dylan Howe replacing Steven Monti on drums. Davey Payne left the group permanently in August and was replaced by [[Gilad Atzmon]]; this line-up gigged throughout 1999, culminating in their last performance with Ian Dury on 6 February 2000 at the [[London Palladium]]. Dury died six weeks later on 27 March 2000.<ref name=\"Blockheads official website\"/>\n\nThe Blockheads have continued after Dury's death, contributing to the tribute album ''Brand New Boots And Panties'', then ''Where's The Party''. The Blockheads currently comprise Jankel, Watt-Roy, Gallagher, Turnbull, John Roberts on drums, Gilad Atzmon and Dave Lewis on saxes. Derek The Draw (who was Dury's friend and minder) is now writing songs with Jankel as well as singing. [[Lee Harris (guitarist)|Lee Harris]] is their '[[aide de camp]]'.\n\n====Roger Daltrey====\nIn 1984, Dury was featured in the music video for the minor hit single \"[[Walking in My Sleep]]\" by [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[The Who]].\n\n===Spasticus Autisticus===\nDury's 1981 song \"[[Spasticus Autisticus]]\"{{snd}} written to show his disdain for that year's [[International Year of Disabled Persons]], which he saw as patronising and counter-productive{{snd}} was banned by the [[BBC]]. Dury was a disabled person himself, having been left crippled by childhood polio. The lyrics were uncompromising:\n<poem>\n          So place your hard-earned peanuts in my tin\n          And thank the Creator you're not in the state I'm in\n          So long have I been languished on the shelf\n          I must give all proceedings to myself</poem>\nThe song's refrain, \"I'm spasticus, autisticus\", was inspired by the response of the rebellious Roman [[gladiator]]s in the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', who, when instructed to identify their leader, all answered, \"I am [[Spartacus]]\", to protect him. According to Professor George McKay, in a 2009 article in ''Popular Music'' called 'Crippled with nerves' (an early Dury song title):\n\n{{quote|Ian Dury, that 'flaw of the jungle', produced a remarkable and sustained body of work that explored issues of disability, in both personal and social contexts, institutionalisation, and to a lesser extent the pop cultural tradition of disability. He also, with the single \"Spasticus Autisticus\" (1981), produced one of the outstanding protest songs about the place of disabled people in what he called 'normal land'.<ref>{{cite journal |first=George |last=McKay |date=2009 |url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2372/1/displayFulltext.pdf |title='Crippled with nerves': popular music and polio, with particular reference to Ian Dury |journal=Popular Music |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=341\u2013365 |doi=10.1017/S0261143009990109|accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nDury described the song as \"a war cry\" on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. The song was banned from being broadcast by the [[BBC]] before 6 p.m. when it first came out; it was later used at the opening of the [[London 2012 Paralympics]].\n\n===Acting and other activities===\n[[File:Ian Dury2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Dury in concert]]\nDury's confident and unusual demeanour caught the eyes of producers and directors of drama. His first important and extensive role was in [[Farrukh Dhondy]]'s mini-series for the BBC ''[[King of the Ghetto]]'' (1986), a drama set in London's multi-racial [[Brick Lane]] area with a cast led by a young [[Tim Roth]].\n\nDury had small parts in several films, probably the best known of which was [[Peter Greenaway]]'s\n''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]'' (1989), as well as a [[cameo role|cameo appearance]] in [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Pirates (1986 film)|Pirates]]'' (1986). He also appeared in the [[Eduardo Guedes]] film '' Rocinante'' (1986), [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s ''[[The Rainbow Thief]]'' (1990), and the [[Sylvester Stallone]] science fiction film ''[[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]'' (1995). His other film appearances included roles in ''Number One'' (1985) starring [[Bob Geldof]], the [[Bob Hoskins]] film ''[[The Raggedy Rawney]]'' (1988), and ''[[Split Second (1992 film)|Split Second]]'' (1992) starring [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Kim Cattrall]]. He also appeared alongside fellow lyricists [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Tom Waits]], respectively, in the movies ''[[Hearts of Fire]]'' (1987) and ''Bearskin: An Urban Fairytale'' (1990), also by Eduardo Guedes.<ref>{{cite web|first=Paul |last=Willemen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/oct/17/guardianobituaries.filmnews1 |title=Obituary: Eduardo Guedes |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 October 2000  |accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref> His later films included the comedy ''[[Different for Girls (film)|Different for Girls]]'' (1996), and ''[[The Crow: City of Angels]]'' (1996), directed by [[Tim Pope]], who had directed a few of Dury's music videos.\n\nDury also wrote a musical, ''Apples'', staged in London's [[Royal Court Theatre]]. In 1987 he appeared as the narrator (Scullery) in ''[[Road (play)|Road]]'', also at the Royal Court. Among the cast was actress and singer [[Jane Horrocks]], who cohabited with Dury until late in 1988, although the relationship was kept discreet.<ref>Balls, Richard (2000), pp. 264\u20136</ref>\n\nDury wrote and performed the theme song \"Profoundly in Love with Pandora\" for the television series ''[[The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13\u00be]]'' (1985), based on the book of the same name by [[Sue Townsend]], as well as its follow-up, ''[[The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole (TV series)|The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole]]'' (1987). Dury turned down an offer from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] to write the libretto for ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' (from which [[Richard Stilgoe]] reportedly earned millions).

Griphook agrees in exchange for the [[Sword of Gryffindor]]. Wandmaker [[Ollivander]] tells Harry that two wands taken from [[Malfoy Manor]] belonged to Bellatrix and [[Draco Malfoy]], though Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry.\n\nIn the vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux is [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of [[Lord Voldemort]] killing goblins including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at [[Hogwarts]] somehow connected to [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]. The trio [[apparate]] into [[Hogsmeade]], where [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] reluctantly instructs the [[Portrait (Harry Potter)|portrait]] of his deceased younger sister [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] to fetch [[Neville Longbottom]], who leads the trio through a secret passageway into Hogwarts.\n\n[[Severus Snape]] hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of punishment for aiding Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees after [[Minerva McGonagall]] challenges him to a duel. Voldemort then arrives with the Death Eaters, demanding Harry is given over to him; McGonagall gathers the Hogwarts community for battle. At [[Luna Lovegood]]'s insistence, Harry speaks to [[Helena Ravenclaw]]'s ghost, who reveals that Voldemort performed \"dark magic\" on her mother's diadem, located in the [[Room of Requirement]]. In the [[Chamber of Secrets]], Hermione destroys the Horcrux cup with a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|Basilisk]] fang. In the Room of Requirement, Draco, [[Blaise Zabini]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts a Fiendfyre curse; unable to control it, he is burned to death while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang, and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement to be destroyed. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] is the final Horcrux. After entering the boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; he then orders Nagini to kill Snape. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the [[Pensieve]]. Meanwhile, [[Fred Weasley]], [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] are killed in the chaos at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry learns from Snape's memories that while Snape despised Harry's late father [[James Potter (character)|James]], who bullied him, he loved his late mother [[Lily Potter|Lily]]. Following her death, Snape worked with [[Albus Dumbledore]] to protect Harry from Voldemort due to his love for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and wished for Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword was conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him; he must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within himself. Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Voldemort casts the [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] upon Harry, who finds himself in [[limbo]]. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's curse. Harry returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort.\n\nVoldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the sword from the [[Sorting Hat]], Harry reveals he is still alive; the Malfoys and many [[Death Eaters]] abandon Voldemort upon knowing they've already lost if Harry still lives, much to Voldemort and Bellatrix's fury. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, [[Molly Weasley]] kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, making Voldemort mortal. Harry and Voldemort's fight ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand recognised him as its true master after he disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore. Harry destroys the Elder Wand rather than claim it.\n\nNineteen years later, Harry and [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron and Hermione, and Draco proudly watch their children leave for Hogwarts at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], one of Harry's best friends.\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]], Harry's other best friend, and the brain of the trio.\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], a [[Death Eater]] and [[Sirius Black]]'s cousin and murderer.\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]], Harry's half-giant friend and a former member of the staff of [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as [[Filius Flitwick]], the Charms master and Head of the [[Ravenclaw]] house at Hogwarts; and [[Griphook]], a [[Goblins (Harry Potter)|goblin]] and former employee at [[Gringotts]] Bank.\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Lord Voldemort]], a twisted, evil, power-hungry, powerful wizard, and the founder and supreme leader of the [[Death Eater]]s.\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Albus Dumbledore]], the late headmaster of [[Hogwarts]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Mr. Ollivander]], a wandmaker abducted by the Death Eaters.\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Lucius Malfoy]], Draco Malfoy's father and a disgraced [[Death Eater]].\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Sirius Black]], Harry's late godfather.\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Severus Snape]], former Head of the [[Slytherin]] House and Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher and the new headmaster of [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Minerva McGonagall]], the Transfiguration teacher and the Head of the [[Gryffindor]] house at [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Remus Lupin]], a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] and a former Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Julie Walters]] as [[Molly Weasley]], the Weasley matriarch\n<!---Credited as the main cast in film credits--->\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Casting===\nThe roles of several minor characters were recast or replaced for this film.

After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter [[Steve Kloves]], he agreed with the division.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJVDzNtosrc |title=David Heyman 'Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them' script is wonderful |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=25 November 2014 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sets===\nIn an interview with ''Architectural Digest'', production designer [[Stuart Craig]] remarked on creating sets for ''Part&nbsp;2''. Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, \"our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That was part of the fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble.\" About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, \"We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. [[John Richardson (special effects designer)|John Richardson]], the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |title=Inside Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Production designer Stuart Craig gives AD an exclusive look at the sets of the upcoming film |first=Elizabeth |last=Stamp |work=Architectural Digest |accessdate=23 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120201728/http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |archivedate=20 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nCraig spoke about the Battle of Hogwarts to ''Art Insights Magazine'', saying that \"the great challenge is the destruction of Hogwarts.

A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really&nbsp;\u2013 maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely.\" When asked about the King's Cross scene near the end of the film, Craig said, \"We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white&nbsp;\u2013 so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |title=Stuart Craig Interview Transcript |work=Art Insights Magazine |accessdate=23 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913153753/http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |archive-date=13 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects supervisor Tim Burke said that \"It was such a major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, and we had to do it in different stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative.\" He went on to say that \"It's taken two years&nbsp;\u2013 getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down.

I think people are going to be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really impressed with it, actually.\" Producer [[David Heyman]] spoke to ''SFX'' magazine about the [[2D to 3D conversion|3D conversion]], saying that \"The way David Yates is approaching 3D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view.

Griphook agrees in exchange for the [[Sword of Gryffindor]]. Wandmaker [[Ollivander]] tells Harry that two wands taken from [[Malfoy Manor]] belonged to Bellatrix and [[Draco Malfoy]], though Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry.\n\nIn the vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux is [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of [[Lord Voldemort]] killing goblins including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at [[Hogwarts]] somehow connected to [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]. The trio [[apparate]] into [[Hogsmeade]], where [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] reluctantly instructs the [[Portrait (Harry Potter)|portrait]] of his deceased younger sister [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] to fetch [[Neville Longbottom]], who leads the trio through a secret passageway into Hogwarts.\n\n[[Severus Snape]] hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of punishment for aiding Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees after [[Minerva McGonagall]] challenges him to a duel. Voldemort then arrives with the Death Eaters, demanding Harry is given over to him; McGonagall gathers the Hogwarts community for battle. At [[Luna Lovegood]]'s insistence, Harry speaks to [[Helena Ravenclaw]]'s ghost, who reveals that Voldemort performed \"dark magic\" on her mother's diadem, located in the [[Room of Requirement]]. In the [[Chamber of Secrets]], Hermione destroys the Horcrux cup with a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|Basilisk]] fang. In the Room of Requirement, Draco, [[Blaise Zabini]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts a Fiendfyre curse; unable to control it, he is burned to death while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang, and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement to be destroyed. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] is the final Horcrux. After entering the boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; he then orders Nagini to kill Snape. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the [[Pensieve]]. Meanwhile, [[Fred Weasley]], [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] are killed in the chaos at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry learns from Snape's memories that while Snape despised Harry's late father [[James Potter (character)|James]], who bullied him, he loved his late mother [[Lily Potter|Lily]]. Following her death, Snape worked with [[Albus Dumbledore]] to protect Harry from Voldemort due to his love for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and wished for Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword was conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him; he must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within himself. Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Voldemort casts the [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] upon Harry, who finds himself in [[limbo]]. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's curse. Harry returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort.\n\nVoldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the sword from the [[Sorting Hat]], Harry reveals he is still alive; the Malfoys and many [[Death Eaters]] abandon Voldemort. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, [[Molly Weasley]] kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, making Voldemort mortal. Harry and Voldemort's fight ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand recognised him as its true master after he disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore. Harry destroys the Elder Wand rather than claim it.\n\nNineteen years later, Harry and [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron and Hermione, and Draco proudly watch their children leave for Hogwarts at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], one of Harry's best friends.\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]], Harry's other best friend, and the brain of the trio.\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], a [[Death Eater]] and [[Sirius Black]]'s cousin and murderer.\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]], Harry's half-giant friend and a former member of the staff of [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as [[Filius Flitwick]], the Charms master and Head of the [[Ravenclaw]] house at Hogwarts; and [[Griphook]], a [[Goblins (Harry Potter)|goblin]] and former employee at [[Gringotts]] Bank.\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Lord Voldemort]], a twisted, evil, power-hungry, powerful wizard, and the founder and supreme leader of the [[Death Eater]]s.\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Albus Dumbledore]], the late headmaster of [[Hogwarts]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Mr. Ollivander]], a wandmaker abducted by the Death Eaters.\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Lucius Malfoy]], Draco Malfoy's father and a disgraced [[Death Eater]].\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Sirius Black]], Harry's late godfather.\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Severus Snape]], former Head of the [[Slytherin]] House and Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher and the new headmaster of [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Minerva McGonagall]], the Transfiguration teacher and the Head of the [[Gryffindor]] house at [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Remus Lupin]], a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] and a former Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Julie Walters]] as [[Molly Weasley]], the Weasley matriarch\n<!---Credited as the main cast in film credits--->\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Casting===\nThe roles of several minor characters were recast or replaced for this film.

Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, \"No, David. How are we going to do it?\". After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter [[Steve Kloves]], he agreed with the division.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJVDzNtosrc |title=David Heyman 'Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them' script is wonderful |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=25 November 2014 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sets===\nIn an interview with ''Architectural Digest'', production designer [[Stuart Craig]] remarked on creating sets for ''Part&nbsp;2''. Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, \"our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That was part of the fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble.\" About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, \"We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. [[John Richardson (special effects designer)|John Richardson]], the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |title=Inside Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Production designer Stuart Craig gives AD an exclusive look at the sets of the upcoming film |first=Elizabeth |last=Stamp |work=Architectural Digest |accessdate=23 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120201728/http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |archivedate=20 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nCraig spoke about the Battle of Hogwarts to ''Art Insights Magazine'', saying that \"the great challenge is the destruction of Hogwarts.

A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really&nbsp;\u2013 maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely.\" When asked about the King's Cross scene near the end of the film, Craig said, \"We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white&nbsp;\u2013 so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |title=Stuart Craig Interview Transcript |work=Art Insights Magazine |accessdate=23 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913153753/http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |archive-date=13 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects supervisor Tim Burke said that \"It was such a major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, and we had to do it in different stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative.\" He went on to say that \"It's taken two years&nbsp;\u2013 getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down.

I think people are going to be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really impressed with it, actually.\" Producer [[David Heyman]] spoke to ''SFX'' magazine about the [[2D to 3D conversion|3D conversion]], saying that \"The way David Yates is approaching 3D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view.
