In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.\n\nA [[pseudonym]] is a name used in addition to the original or true name.  This does not require legal sanction. Pseudonyms are generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but may also be used for personal, social or ideological reasons.\n\n==Reasons for changing one's name==\n* Marriage or civil partnership. \n* [[Divorce]] or [[Family estrangement|estrangement]] of parents.\n* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment]]\n* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])\n* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)\n* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)\n* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g., old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)\n* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) \n* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)\n* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])\n* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).\n* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g., changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).\n* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).\n* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],<ref name=\"BBCBrown1\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm \"Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change\"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), \"Sport: Fun and Games\" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007</ref> and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)\n* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])\n* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g., old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])\n* To make their name more attractive or \"catchy\" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])\n* To change legal name to one used in everyday life (e.g., where middle name has been used throughout life)\n* To [[anglicise]] a name or choose a different name if one's name is too difficult to pronounce or spell for most people\n* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])\n\n==United States==\nIn the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and [[common law]] name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.\n\nUsually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324\u20139}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.</ref>  Although the states ([[Law of Louisiana|except Louisiana]]) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change.\n\nWhere a court process is used, it is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.  Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to deny a change of name: usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.<ref>Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&ndash;3.</ref>  In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}</ref> The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}</ref>\n\nIn nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].\n\nSome examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:\n* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).  This is usually done without court proceedings.\n* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.\n* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.\n\nUnder the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.<ref>\"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]\", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).</ref> During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.\n\nTo maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.\n\n===Informal methods of legal name change===\n\n====Assumed name====\nThe \"open and notorious\" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].\n\n====Usage method====\nA common law name (i.e. one assumed without formality and for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.</ref> In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,<ref>''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.</ref> unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.<ref>''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).</ref>\n\nIn [[California]] the \"usage method\" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.<ref>For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).</ref> Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.\n\nSpecifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1279.5 and Family Code \u00a7 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1279.5 (a) reads, \"Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name.\" Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code \u00a7 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)\n\n====Preferred name====\nMany universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a \"preferred name\" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and [[student ID]] cards.  It provides a \"transitional\"\nname change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.<ref name=\"UC Davis\">{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Leicester\">{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? \u2014 University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Official registration===\nA legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee.

The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.\n\nMany states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.<ref>see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.\n\nIn theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that \"documentary evidence\" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are \"matters of fact\", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.\n\nDocumentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a [[College of Arms|Royal Licence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name \u2013 D\u2022P\u2022O|work=Deed Poll Office}}</ref> A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the \"[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]\", even the \"triple-barrelled\" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy \"[[squirearchy]]\" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.\n\nWell known examples are:\n*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.\n*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715\u20131786) (c.1714\u20131786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644\u20131670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. \u2013 D\u2022P\u2022O|work=Deed Poll Office}}</ref> Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].\n\n===Scotland===\nPeople whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.\n\n==Other common law countries==\n\n=== Australia ===\nIndividuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled \"Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries \u2013 australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}</ref>  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)<ref>http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx</ref> and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name \u2013 Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}</ref>\n\nInstitutions such as banks,<ref>http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf</ref> the Passports Office<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}</ref> and transport authorities<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}</ref> require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.\n\nIf a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or \"Change of Name Certificate\".

As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.\n\nHowever, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll.

Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].<ref>[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123</ref>\n\n==Civil law==\nIn general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Belgium===\nChanges in law Aug 2018 changes first name and fee will fall under the authority of local town hall <ref>https://justitie.belgium.be/nl/nieuws/persberichten_70</ref> In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arr\u00eat\u00e9 royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:\n* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society\n* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress.

However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: \n* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  \n* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  \n* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  \n* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  \n* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.\n\n===India===\nIn India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.<ref>http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf</ref>\n\n===Norway===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\nAlthough it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.\n\n===Philippines===\n2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order.

Permanent Residents residing in Quebec, if falling under an [[Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]] exception, may make a statutory declaration to IRCC and obtain a change of name through them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/identity-management/exceptions.html|title=Exceptions to change of name requirements|last=Immigration|first=Refugees and Citizenship Canada|date=2017-11-16|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> Otherwise, as with all Temporary Residents residing in Quebec, they must obtain a change of name from the country that issued their passport/travel document.\n\nQuebec also has other strict regulations regarding name changes. For example, Micheline Montreuil, a trans woman who is non-operative, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the Directeur de l'Etat Civil refused to permit the change on the grounds that someone legally assigned male at birth could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeals ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}</ref> Another issue specific to Quebec is married names.

Some have used that loophole to legally change their names by temporarily moving another Canadian province or territory, which follow more permissive common-law rules.\n\n===South Africa===\nSouth Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.\n\nA person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a \"good and sufficient reason\" for the change.\n\nA married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)\n\nSouth Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.\n\nThe surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.<ref>[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997).

When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.\n\n===Taiwan===\n{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}\nIn [[Taiwan]], the ''Name Act'' bans changing one's legal name for some criminal reasons per [https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawSearchContent.aspx?pcode=D0030011&norge=6 Article 15] since 2015 (Article 12 since 2001).

Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.\n* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].\n\n===Hinduism===\nThere is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].\n\n===Islam===\n* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].\n*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. \n* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].\n:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means \"son of Abdullah\", or ''bint Abdullah'' means \"daughter of Abdullah\". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.\n:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.\nThe last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.\n\n===Judaism===\n* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.

In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.\n\nA [[pseudonym]] is a name used in addition to the original or true name.  This does not require legal sanction. Pseudonyms are generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but may also be used for personal, social or ideological reasons.\n\n==Reasons for changing one's name==\n* Marriage or civil partnership. \n* [[Divorce]] or [[Family estrangement|estrangement]] of parents.\n* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment]]\n* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])\n* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)\n* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)\n* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g., old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)\n* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) \n* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)\n* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])\n* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).\n* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g., changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).\n* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).\n* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],<ref name=\"BBCBrown1\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm \"Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change\"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), \"Sport: Fun and Games\" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007</ref> and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)\n* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])\n* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g., old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])\n* To make their name more attractive or \"catchy\" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])\n* To change legal name to one used in everyday life (e.g., where middle name has been used throughout life)\n* To [[anglicise]] a name or choose a different name if one's name is too difficult to pronounce or spell for most people\n* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])\n\n==United States==\nIn the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and [[common law]] name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.\n\nUsually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324\u20139}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.</ref>  Although the states ([[Law of Louisiana|except Louisiana]]) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change.\n\nWhere a court process is used, it is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.  Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to deny a change of name: usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.<ref>Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&ndash;3.</ref>  In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}</ref> The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}</ref>\n\nIn nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].\n\nSome examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:\n* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).  This is usually done without court proceedings.\n* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.\n* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.\n\nUnder the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.<ref>\"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]\", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).</ref> During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.\n\nTo maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.\n\n===Informal methods of legal name change===\n\n====Assumed name====\nThe \"open and notorious\" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].\n\n====Usage method====\nA common law name (i.e. one assumed without formality and for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.</ref> In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,<ref>''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.</ref> unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.<ref>''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).</ref>\n\nIn [[California]] the \"usage method\" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.<ref>For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).</ref> Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.\n\nSpecifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1279.5 and Family Code \u00a7 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1279.5 (a) reads, \"Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name.\" Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code \u00a7 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)\n\n====Preferred name====\nMany universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a \"preferred name\" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and [[student ID]] cards.  It provides a \"transitional\"\nname change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.<ref name=\"UC Davis\">{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Leicester\">{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? \u2014 University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Official registration===\nA legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov|access-date=2015-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|archive-date=2016-01-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports & International Travel|work=state.gov}}</ref> (for [[United States passport|passports]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM040301.html |title=8 FAM 403.1-4 Material Discrepancies (Major name changes) |last= |first= |date=August 7, 2018 |website=Foreign Affairs Manual |publisher=United States Department of State |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> the [[Federal Communications Commission]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22}}</ref> the [[Selective Service System]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29}}</ref> and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.\n\nMost states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time, and some state motor vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes, by first registering a new name with the Social Security office:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Several United States !!

The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.\n\nMany states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.<ref>see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.\n\nIn theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that \"documentary evidence\" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are \"matters of fact\", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.\n\nDocumentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.<ref name=\"auto\">[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a [[College of Arms|Royal Licence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name \u2013 D\u2022P\u2022O|work=Deed Poll Office}}</ref> A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the \"[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]\", even the \"triple-barrelled\" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy \"[[squirearchy]]\" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.\n\nWell known examples are:\n*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.\n*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715\u20131786) (c.1714\u20131786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644\u20131670).

As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.\n\nHowever, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll.

Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Belgium===\nChanges in law Aug 2018 changes first name and fee will fall under the authority of local town hall <ref>https://justitie.belgium.be/nl/nieuws/persberichten_70</ref> In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arr\u00eat\u00e9 royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:\n* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society\n* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren (\"born naked\"), and Clooten (\"sods of earth\" in Middle Dutch, but \"testicles\" in modern Dutch)\n* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity<ref>[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nAccording to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: \n* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  \n* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  \n* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  \n* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  \n* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.\n\n===India===\nIn India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.<ref>http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf</ref>\n\n===Norway===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\nAlthough it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.\n\n===Philippines===\n2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order.

For example, Micheline Montreuil, a trans woman who is non-operative, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the Directeur de l'Etat Civil refused to permit the change on the grounds that someone legally assigned male at birth could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeals ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}</ref> Another issue specific to Quebec is married names.

Some have used that loophole to legally change their names by temporarily moving another Canadian province or territory, which follow more permissive common-law rules.\n\n===South Africa===\nSouth Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.\n\nA person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a \"good and sufficient reason\" for the change.\n\nA married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)\n\nSouth Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.\n\nThe surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.<ref>[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997).

Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].\n\n===Islam===\n* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].\n*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. \n* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].\n:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means \"son of Abdullah\", or ''bint Abdullah'' means \"daughter of Abdullah\". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.\n:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.\nThe last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.\n\n===Judaism===\n* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name \u2013 Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion & Spirituality}}</ref> Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym \"ben/bat Avraham Avinu\" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.\n\n===Sikhism===\n* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].\n* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.\n\n===Wicca===\n* Some [[Wiccans]] have a [[craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Family name]], including patrilineal surnames\n*[[Given name]]\n*[[Hornsleth Village Project]]\n*[[In re McUlta]]\n*[[Legal aspects of transsexualism]] for information about name change for transgender and transsexual people\n**[[Diane Marie Rodriguez Zambrano]], an activist who sued to enable legal name change in Ecuador for purposes of [[gender identity]]\n*[[Legal name]]\n*[[Married and maiden names]]\n*[[Matriname]]\n*[[Nickname]]\n*[[Pseudonym]]\n**[[Pen name]]\n**[[Stage name]]\n*[[Regnal name]]\n*[[Religious conversion]]\n*[[Witness protection]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Personal names}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Name Change}}\n[[Category:Public law]]\n[[Category:Gender transitioning]]\n[[Category:Transgender law]]\n[[Category:Human names]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4062:84:bda7::1a29:60a5", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(My problem)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_change"}
