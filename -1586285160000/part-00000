In addition, it scanned 184 subjects from this pool at 7 Tesla, with higher spatial resolution. The data are being analyzed to show the anatomical and functional connections between parts of the brain for each individual, and will be related to behavioral test data. Comparing the [[connectome]]s and genetic data of genetically [[identical twins]] with fraternal twins will reveal the relative contributions of genes and environment in shaping brain circuitry and pinpoint relevant [[genetic variation]]. The maps will also shed light on how brain networks are organized.\n\nUsing a combination of [[Minimally-invasive procedures#Non-invasive procedure|non-invasive]] [[imaging technologies]], including [[resting state fMRI|resting-state fMRI]] and task-based [[functional MRI]], [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] and [[EEG]], and [[diffusion MRI]], the WU-Minn will be mapping [[connectome]]s at the macro scale \u2014 [[Brain mapping|mapping large brain systems]] that can be divided into anatomically and functionally distinct areas, rather than mapping individual [[neuron]]s.\n\nDozens of investigators and researchers from nine institutions have contributed to this project.

The studies fall into three categories: Healthy Adult Connectomes, Lifespan Connectome Data, and Connectomes Related to Human Disease. Under each of these categories are research groups working on specific questions.\n\n=== Healthy Adult Connectomes ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult|title=HCP Young Adult - Connectome - Publications|last=UpAndRunning|website=www.humanconnectome.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}</ref> The Human Connectome Project Young Adult study made data on the brain connections of 1100 healthy young adults available to the scientific community.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.humanconnectome.org/about/publications-using-hcp-data.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507181029/http://www.humanconnectome.org/about/publications-using-hcp-data.php |archive-date=2017-05-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Scientists have used data from the study to support theories about which areas of the brain communicate with one another.<ref name=pmid28231395>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/ejn.13544 |pmid=28231395 |title=Functional connectivity in amygdalar-sensory/(pre)motor networks at rest: New evidence from the Human Connectome Project |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=45 |issue=9 |pages=1224\u20131229 |year=2017 |last1=Toschi |first1=Nicola |last2=Duggento |first2=Andrea |last3=Passamonti |first3=Luca }}</ref> For example, one study used data from the project to show that the [[amygdala]], a part of the brain essential for emotional processing, is connected to the parts of the brain that receive information from the senses and plan movement.<ref name=pmid27744495>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11682-016-9642-2 |pmid=27744495 |title=White matter integrity in brain networks relevant to anxiety and depression: Evidence from the human connectome project dataset |journal=Brain Imaging and Behavior |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=1604\u20131615 |year=2016 |last1=De Witte |first1=Nele A.

The purpose of these groups is to determine ordinary brain connectivity during infancy, childhood, adolescence, and aging. Scientists will use the data from these research groups in the same manner in which they have used data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult study.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanconnectome.org/lifespan-studies|title=Connectome - HCP Lifespan Studies|last=UpAndRunning|website=www.humanconnectome.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Connectomes Related to Human Disease ===\nFourteen research groups investigate how connections in the brain change during the course of a particular disease. Four of the groups focus on [[Alzheimer's disease]] or [[dementia]]. Alzheimer's disease and dementia are diseases that begin during aging. Memory loss and cognitive impairment mark the progression of these diseases. While scientists consider Alzheimer's disease to be a disease with a specific cause, dementia actually describes symptoms which could be attributed to a number of causes. Two other research groups investigate how diseases that disrupt vision change connectivity in the brain. Another four of the research groups focus on [[anxiety disorders]] and [[major depressive disorder]], psychological disorders that result in abnormal emotional regulation. Two more of the research groups focus on the effects of [[psychosis]], a symptom of some psychological disorders in which an individual perceives reality differently than others do. One of the teams researches [[epilepsy]], a disease characterized by seizures. Finally, one research team is documenting the brain connections of the [[Amish]] people, a religious and ethnic group that has high rates of some [[psychological disorders]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanconnectome.org/disease-studies|title=Connectome - Human Connectome Studies Related To Disease|last=UpAndRunning|website=www.humanconnectome.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref>\n\nAlthough theories have been put forth about the way brain connections change in the diseases under investigation, many of these theories have been supported by data from healthy populations.<ref name=pmid27744495/> For example, an analysis of the brains of healthy individuals supported the theory that individuals with anxiety disorders and depression have less connectivity between their emotional centers and the areas that govern attention. By collecting data specifically from individuals with these diseases, researchers hope to have a more certain idea of how brain connections in these individuals change over time.\n\n== Status ==\nAs

Comparing the [[connectome]]s and genetic data of genetically [[identical twins]] with fraternal twins will reveal the relative contributions of genes and environment in shaping brain circuitry and pinpoint relevant [[genetic variation]]. The maps will also shed light on how brain networks are organized.\n\nUsing a combination of [[Minimally-invasive procedures#Non-invasive procedure|non-invasive]] [[imaging technologies]], including [[resting state fMRI|resting-state fMRI]] and task-based [[functional MRI]], [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] and [[EEG]], and [[diffusion MRI]], the WU-Minn will be mapping [[connectome]]s at the macro scale \u2014 [[Brain mapping|mapping large brain systems]] that can be divided into anatomically and functionally distinct areas, rather than mapping individual [[neuron]]s.\n\nDozens of investigators and researchers from nine institutions have contributed to this project.

The purpose of these groups is to determine ordinary brain connectivity during infancy, childhood, adolescence, and aging. Scientists will use the data from these research groups in the same manner in which they have used data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult study.\n\n=== Connectomes Related to Human Disease ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanconnectome.org/disease-studies|title=Connectome - Human Connectome Studies Related To Disease|last=UpAndRunning|website=www.humanconnectome.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref> Fourteen research groups investigate how connections in the brain change during the course of a particular disease. Four of the groups focus on [[Alzheimer's disease]] or [[dementia]]. Alzheimer's disease and dementia are diseases that begin during aging. Memory loss and cognitive impairment mark the progression of these diseases. While scientists consider Alzheimer's disease to be a disease with a specific cause, dementia actually describes symptoms which could be attributed to a number of causes. Two other research groups investigate how diseases that disrupt vision change connectivity in the brain. Another four of the research groups focus on [[anxiety disorders]] and [[major depressive disorder]], psychological disorders that result in abnormal emotional regulation. Two more of the research groups focus on the effects of [[psychosis]], a symptom of some psychological disorders in which an individual perceives reality differently than others do. One of the teams researches [[epilepsy]], a disease characterized by seizures. Finally, one research team is documenting the brain connections of the [[Amish]] people, a religious and ethnic group that has high rates of some [[psychological disorders]].\n\nAlthough theories have been put forth about the way brain connections change in the diseases under investigation, many of these theories have been supported by data from healthy populations.<ref name=pmid27744495/> For example, an analysis of the brains of healthy individuals supported the theory that individuals with anxiety disorders and depression have less connectivity between their emotional centers and the areas that govern attention. By collecting data specifically from individuals with these diseases, researchers hope to have a more certain idea of how brain connections in these individuals change over time.\n\n== Status ==\nAs

Mayan scholars stated that no [[Maya codices|classic Mayan accounts]] forecast impending doom, and the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Mayan history and culture.<ref name=\"Milbrath\" /><ref name=\"Stuart\">David Stuart, ''The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012'', Harmony Books, 2011</ref><ref name=\"webster\" /> Astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience<ref name=\"Brown 2009\">{{cite web|title=SI do not \u2665 pseudo-science|first=Mike|last=Brown|url=http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/02/i-do-not-pseudo-science.html|year=2008|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers\" /> which is easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.<ref name=\"NASA2\" />\n\n== Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ==\n{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}\n\nDecember 2012 marked the conclusion of a ''[[b\u02bcak\u02bctun]]''\u2014a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in [[Mesoamerica|Central America]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],<ref name=\"delara2006\" /> it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&nbsp;AD.<ref name=\"Population structure of the classic period Maya\" /> The [[Maya script|writing system]] of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered,<ref name=\"joyce\" /> meaning that a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n|European conquest]].\n\nUnlike the 260-day ''[[tzolk\u02bcin]]'' still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k\u02bcatun'', and 20 k\u02bcatuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b\u02bcak\u02bctun''. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b\u02bcak\u02bctuns, 3 k\u02bcatuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}<ref name=\"The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0\" />\n\n=== Apocalypse ===\n[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]\n\nThere is a strong tradition of \"world ages\" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K\u02bciche\u02bc people|K\u02bciche\u02bc Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429\u2013430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b\u02bcak\u02bctuns, or roughly 5,125 years.{{sfn|Freidel|Schele|Parker|1993|p=63}}{{ref label|A|Note a|a}} The Long Count's \"zero date\"{{ref label|B|Note b|b}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114&nbsp;BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=46}}<ref name=yucalandia/> This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer [[Maud Worcester Makemson]] wrote that \"the completion of a Great Period of 13 b\u02bcak\u02bctuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya.\"<ref name=\"makemson1957\" /> In 1966, [[Michael D. Coe]] wrote in ''The Maya'' that \"there is a suggestion&nbsp;... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b\u02bcak\u02bctun]. Thus&nbsp;... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion.\"{{sfn|Coe|1966|p=149}}{{ref label|E|Note e|e}}\n\n=== Objections ===\nCoe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s.<ref name=\"carrasco1990\" /> In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun would perhaps be a cause for celebration,<ref name=\"Milbrath\" /> it did not mark the end of the calendar.<ref name=\"milbrath1999\" /> \"There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012,\" said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. \"The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention.\"<ref name=\"van\" /> In 1990, Mayanist scholars [[Linda Schele]] and David Freidel argued that the Maya \"did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested\".{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81\u201382, 430\u2013431}} Susan Milbrath, [[curator]] of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that, \"We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end\" in 2012.<ref name=\"Milbrath\" /> Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, \"For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle,\" and, \"The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in.\"<ref name=\"Milbrath\" /> \"There will be another cycle,\" said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the [[Tulane University]] Middle American Research Institute. \"We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this.\"<ref name=\"The Sky Is Not Falling\" /> Commenting on the new calendar found at [[Xult\u00fan]], one archaeologist said \"The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue&nbsp;\u2013 that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset.\"<ref name=\"NG120510\" />\n\nSeveral prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Ind\u00edgenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle \"supposes changes in human consciousness\". Mart\u00edn Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuradur\u00eda de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.<ref name=\"prensalibre\" />\n\n=== Prior associations ===\nThe European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profec\u00edas]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the \"Maia\" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hoopes 2011</ref> Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of \"most distant\" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]]. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the [[Spanish Conquest]] as the result of popular [[astrology|astrological]] predictions in Europe of a second [[Great Flood]] for the year 1524.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the early 1900s, German scholar [[Ernst F\u00f6rstemann]] interpreted the last page of the [[Dresden Codex]] as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.<ref>F\u00f6rstemann 1906: 264</ref> His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],<ref>Morley 1915: 32</ref> who directly paraphrased F\u00f6rstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, \"Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm\" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n== Maya references to b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 ==\nIt is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun.<ref name=\"Houston1996\" /> Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.<ref name=\"Houston1996\" /> Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.\n\n=== Tortuguero ===\nThe [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ahau. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:\n{{verse translation|lang=myn|\ntzuhtzjo\ua789m uy-u\ua789xlaju\ua789n pik\nchan ajaw u\ua789x uni\ua789w\nuhto\ua789m il[?]\nye\u02bcni/ye\ua789n bolon yokte'\nta chak joyaj\n|\nIt will be completed the 13th ''b\u02bcak\u02bctun''.\nIt is 4 ''Ajaw'' 3 ''K\u02bcank\u02bcin''\nand it will happen a 'seeing\u02bc[?].\nIt is the display of ''B\u02bcolon-Yokte'''\nin a great \"investiture\".{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|p=8}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun with the appearance of B\u02bcolon Yokte\u02bc K\u02bcuh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open.

According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements \"nine\", \u02bcOK-te\u02bc (the meaning of which is unknown), and \"god\". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.<ref name=\"eberl2005\" /> He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.<ref name=\"hieroglyphic\" />\n\nBased on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte\u02bc K\u02bcuh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36\u201337}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte\u02bc K\u02bcuh with b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as \"erection of stelae, scattering of incense\" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.<ref name=\"What Will Not Happen in 2012\" />\n\n=== La Corona ===\nIn April\u2013May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k\u02bcatuns with the future completion of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun.

Most of these are in the form of \"distance dates\"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K\u02bcinich Janaab\u02bc Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93\u201395}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.<ref name=\"van\" />{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93\u201395}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}\n\nAnother example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b\u02bcak\u02bctun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent \"the starting point of a huge odometer of time\", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=81\u201382, 430\u2013431}}{{ref label|C|Note c|c}} Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 20<sup>21</sup>\u00d713\u00d7360 days,<ref name=wagner/> or roughly 2.687\u00d710<sup>28</sup> years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the [[age of the universe]] as determined by cosmologists.

He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.<ref name=\"scare\" /> Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17\u201327}}\n\nIn 2001, Robert Bast wrote the first online articles regarding the possibility of a doomsday in 2012.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010515214545/http://www.survive2012.com Survive2012.com homepage]</ref> In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].<ref name=\"Pinchbeck 2006\" /><ref name=\"The End of the World As They Know It\" /> Pinchbeck claims to discern a \"growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&nbsp;... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic\".<ref name=\"anasatas\" />\n\n=== Galactic alignment ===\nThere is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=83}} However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by [[esoteric]], [[fringe science|fringe]], and [[New Age]] literature that placed great significance on [[astrology]], especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of [[axial precession]].<ref name=\"Hoopes2009\" /><ref name=\"Hoopes2012\" /> Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a \"galactic alignment\".\n\n==== Precession ====\nIn the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations, and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called \"[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]\", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.<ref name=\"prec\" /> Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.<ref name=\"prec\" /> In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115\u2013127}}\n\nSimilarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].<ref name=\"Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center\" /> Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.<ref name=\"What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?\" /> In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].<ref name=\"starry\" /> In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.<ref name=\"Questions and comments\" />\n\n==== Mysticism ====\n[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or \"Black Road\"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]\n\nMystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975).\n\nAdherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or \"Black Road\".<ref name=\"Xibalba or Xibalbe\" /> John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.<ref name=\"Jenkins2012\" /> Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.<ref name=\"Jenkins2012\" /> Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.<ref name=\"The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness\" /> New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.<ref name=\"pinchbeck2006\" /> Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].<ref name=\"jenkins1998\" /> Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a \"world tree\", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}\n\n==== Criticism ====\nAstronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.<ref name=\"scare\" /> Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.<ref name=\"jenk\" /><ref name=\"The True Alignment Zone\" /><ref name=\"meeus1997\" />\n\nThere is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,<ref name=\"grofe2011\" /> Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,<ref name=\"jenkins2009\" /> have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.<ref name=\"van\" /> There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.<ref name=\"van\" /><ref name=\"Aimers, J.

To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc\u2014as it does every 20\u201325&nbsp;million years\u2014it comes under the influence of the far stronger \"disc tides\", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.<ref name=\"Perturbing the Oort Cloud\" /> However, this \"alignment\" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.<ref name=\"Galactic Plane\" /> Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.<ref name=\"The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane\" />\n\nA third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.<ref name=\"Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers\" /> Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.<ref name=\"Planetary Alignment\" /> [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above \u2248300&nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined.

Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b\u02bcak\u02bctuns, 3 k\u02bcatuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=246}}<ref name=\"The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0\" />\n\n=== Apocalypse ===\n[[File:Popol vuh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The oldest surviving manuscript of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', dated to 1701|alt=an ancient manuscript page.]]\n\nThere is a strong tradition of \"world ages\" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation.{{sfn|Severin|1981|p=75}} According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a compilation of the [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] of the [[K\u02bciche\u02bc people|K\u02bciche\u02bc Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|pp=429\u2013430}} The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed.

Ricardo Cajas, president of the ''Colectivo de Organizaciones Ind\u00edgenas de Guatemala'', said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle \"supposes changes in human consciousness\". Mart\u00edn Sacalxot, of the office of the ''[[Procuradur\u00eda de los Derechos Humanos (Guatemala)|Procurador de los Derechos Humanos]]'' (Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman, PDH), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.<ref name=\"prensalibre\" />\n\n=== Prior associations ===\nThe European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], who was compiling a work called ''[[Book of Prophecies|Libro de las profec\u00edas]]'' during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the \"Maia\" on [[Guanaja]], an island off the north coast of [[Honduras]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hoopes 2011</ref> Influenced by the writings of Bishop [[Pierre d'Ailly]], Columbus believed that his discovery of \"most distant\" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the [[Apocalypse]].

He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.<ref>F\u00f6rstemann 1906: 264</ref> His ideas were repeated by archaeologist [[Sylvanus Morley]],<ref>Morley 1915: 32</ref> who directly paraphrased F\u00f6rstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, \"Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World&nbsp;... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all-engulfing cataclysm\" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, ''The Ancient Maya'', the first edition of which was published in 1946.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n== Maya references to b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 ==\nIt is not certain what significance the classic [[Maya civilization|Maya]] gave to the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun.<ref name=\"Houston1996\" /> Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.<ref name=\"Houston1996\" /> Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.\n\n=== Tortuguero ===\nThe [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ahau. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 in any detail.

He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]\n\nVery little is known about the god B\u02bcolon Yokte\u02bc. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements \"nine\", \u02bcOK-te\u02bc (the meaning of which is unknown), and \"god\". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.<ref name=\"eberl2005\" /> He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.<ref name=\"hieroglyphic\" />\n\nBased on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte\u02bc K\u02bcuh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=11, 36\u201337}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} They note that the association of Bolon Yokte\u02bc K\u02bcuh with b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as \"erection of stelae, scattering of incense\" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century.{{sfn|Gronemeyer|MacLeod|2010|pp=24, 35}} Mayanist scholar [[Stephen D. Houston|Stephen Houston]] contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.<ref name=\"What Will Not Happen in 2012\" />\n\n=== La Corona ===\nIn April\u2013May 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the [[La Corona]] site in [[Guatemala]]. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in [[Calakmul]] in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k\u02bcatuns with the future completion of the 13th b\u02bcak\u02bctun.

Most of these are in the form of \"distance dates\"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year [[Calendar Round]] from the coronation of the ruler [[K\u02bcinich Janaab\u02bc Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615&nbsp;AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, {{nowrap|603&nbsp;AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93\u201395}} arriving at a date of 21 October 4772&nbsp;AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.<ref name=\"van\" />{{sfn|Schele|1992|pp=93\u201395}}{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990|p=430}}\n\nAnother example is Stela 1 at [[Coba]] which marks the date of creation as {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or nineteen units above the b\u02bcak\u02bctun.

The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but \"to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism\".<ref name=\"skepsis\" /> Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a \"disconnected\" society: \"Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time\u2014entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge.\"{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=161}}\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1975, the ending of b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global \"transformation of consciousness\".

He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon.<ref name=\"scare\" /> Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|pp=17\u201327}}\n\nIn 2001, Robert Bast wrote the first online articles regarding the possibility of a doomsday in 2012.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010515214545/http://www.survive2012.com Survive2012.com homepage]</ref> In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]] and [[mediumship]].<ref name=\"Pinchbeck 2006\" /><ref name=\"The End of the World As They Know It\" /> Pinchbeck claims to discern a \"growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date&nbsp;...

From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s that line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]]al constellations, and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called \"[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]\", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.<ref name=\"prec\" /> Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac.<ref name=\"prec\" /> In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[March equinox]], one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signaled the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).{{sfn|Spencer|2000|pp=115\u2013127}}\n\nSimilarly, the Sun's December [[solstice]] position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].<ref name=\"Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center\" /> Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it.<ref name=\"What's going to happen on 21 December 2012?\" /> In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].<ref name=\"starry\" /> In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.<ref name=\"Questions and comments\" />\n\n==== Mysticism ====\n[[File:Milkyway Swan Panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|The Milky Way near [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] showing the lane of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Dark Rift]], which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or \"Black Road\"|alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees]]\n\nMystical speculations about the [[precession]] of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in ''[[Hamlet's Mill]]'' (1969) by [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by [[Terence McKenna|Terence]] and [[Dennis McKenna]] in ''The Invisible Landscape'' (1975).\n\nAdherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by [[Munro Edmonson]],{{sfn|Edmonson|1988|p=119}} alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the ''[[Xibalba|Xibalba be]]'' or \"Black Road\".<ref name=\"Xibalba or Xibalbe\" /> John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.<ref name=\"Jenkins2012\" /> Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice.<ref name=\"Jenkins2012\" /> Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.<ref name=\"The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness\" /> New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.<ref name=\"pinchbeck2006\" /> Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].<ref name=\"jenkins1998\" /> Jenkins also associated the ''Xibalba be'' with a \"world tree\", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.{{sfn|Aveni|2009|p=62}}\n\n==== Criticism ====\nAstronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to.<ref name=\"scare\" /> Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.<ref name=\"jenk\" /><ref name=\"The True Alignment Zone\" /><ref name=\"meeus1997\" />\n\nThere is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod,{{sfn|MacLeod|2011}} Michael Grofe,<ref name=\"grofe2011\" /> Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,<ref name=\"jenkins2009\" /> have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.<ref name=\"van\" /> There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.<ref name=\"van\" /><ref name=\"Aimers, J.

To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its [[Galactic year|250-million-year orbit]] of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc\u2014as it does every 20\u201325&nbsp;million years\u2014it comes under the influence of the far stronger \"disc tides\", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.<ref name=\"Perturbing the Oort Cloud\" /> However, this \"alignment\" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.<ref name=\"Galactic Plane\" /> Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it.<ref name=\"The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane\" />\n\nA third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date.<ref name=\"Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers\" /> Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.<ref name=\"Planetary Alignment\" /> [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects above \u2248300&nbsp;km in radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined.

In February 2012, American automotive company [[General Motors]] aired an advertisement during the annual [[Super Bowl]] [[American football|football game]] in which a group of friends drove [[Chevrolet Silverado]]s through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, [[Jell-O]] ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world.

The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k\u02bcatuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.{{sfn|Rice|2007|pp=44, 59}}<ref name=\"The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya\" />\n* {{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.<ref name=\"joyce\" />\n* {{note label|C|c|c}} Rather than \"0.0.0.0.0\", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as \"13.0.0.0.0\"<ref name=wagner/>\n* {{note label|D|d|d}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the \"GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation\" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114&nbsp;BC and the end date of b\u02bcak\u02bctun 13 at 21 December 2012.<ref name=\"Who's Who in the Maya World\" /> This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the \"Lounsbury/GMT+2\" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December.

Types can emerge annually, biennially and perennially, rendering consistent management practices difficult. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control as the weeds regenerate in a manner that oftentimes outpaces eradication efforts. Broadleaf weeds do not differ greatly in terms of visuals, with large main leaves connected via central veins from a branch. Despite this broad similarity, they also differ in various aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive [[taproot]] while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and [[rhizomes]]. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The use of such chemicals is often the best option when thinking of clearing the entire yard or lawn of all manner of weeds.  In most cases, the chemical content prevents the weeds from re-surfacing for several months.   The perennial types of broadleaf weeds are often controlled with chemical herbicides although they still find their way back after some months  especially when the cleared lawn or yard is  left unused for months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broadleaf Weed Problems in Lawns |website=LawnTalk |publisher=University of Illinois Extension |url=https://extension.illinois.edu/lawntalk/weeds/broadleaf_weed_problems_in_lawns.cfm |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shading out===\nBroadleaf weeds can be controlled by shading them out.  This involves covering the entire affected area with flat materials such as boards, nylon, plastic spread,  and the like.  When broadleaf weeds are covered that way, they lack access to sunlight and rain that speed up their growth. By so doing, they wither away.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weed]]\n* [[List of common weeds of Queensland]]\n* [[Weed control]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n\n[[Category:Garden pests]]\n[[Category:Plants and humans]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pests]]\n", "text_old": "{{Copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n'''Broadleaf weeds''' are unwanted pugnacious and tough plants that grow mostly around free areas in a lawn, garden or yard.<ref name=\"MISS\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Perennial Broadleaf Weeds in Lawns| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =missouribotanicalgarden.org| date = | url =http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/weeds/broadleaf-weeds.aspx | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> They are often very easy to spot because they are different from normal grasses.<ref name=\"UPS\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Identify the weeds in your lawn and get rid of them| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =upscalelivingmag.com| date = | url =https://www.upscalelivingmag.com/identify-weeds-lawn-get-rid-good/ | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> They  multiply with ease and can be very hard to control.<ref name=\"TUR\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =5 Tips To Enhance Broadleaf Weed Control| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =turfmagazine.com| date = | url =https://www.turfmagazine.com/lawn-care/5-tips-to-enhance-broadleaf-weed-control/ | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Basic characteristics==\nBroadleaf weeds generally do not spring up in one specific pattern. Types can emerge annually, biennially and perennially, rendering consistent management practices difficult. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control as the weeds regenerate in a manner that oftentimes outpaces eradication efforts. Broadleaf weeds do not differ greatly in terms of visuals, with large main leaves connected via central veins from a branch. Despite this broad similarity, they also differ in various aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive [[taproot]] while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and [[rhizomes]].
