With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.<ref>Kemp (2011), 96\u201399.</ref> Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of [[Hedera|ivy]] and of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}</ref>{{Not in refs|date=November 2019}}<!--Heart symbol not mentioned, over their heads could be circles as well.-->\n\nThe first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held \"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into \"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\">Vinken (2001).</ref> [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\"/>\n\nThe \"scalloped\" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''[[c:File:Documenti_d'amore_(1640)_(14747564815).jpg#file|Documenti d'amore]] ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459\u201370, fol 192v. [[Royal Library of Belgium]]). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.<ref>Vinken (2001): \"The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since.\"</ref> The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.<ref>A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nVarious hypotheses attempted to connect the \"heart shape\" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.<ref name=\"mcdonell\">[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.</ref> Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.

With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.<ref>Kemp (2011), 96\u201399.</ref> Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of [[Hedera|ivy]] and of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}</ref>{{Not in refs|date=November 2019}}<!--Heart symbol not mentioned, over their heads could be circles as well.-->\n\nThe first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held \"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into \"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\">Vinken (2001).</ref> [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\"/>\n\nThe \"scalloped\" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''[[c:File:Documenti_d'amore_(1640)_(14747564815).jpg#file|Documenti d'amore]] ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459\u201370, fol 192v. [[Royal Library of Belgium]]). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.<ref>Vinken (2001): \"The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since.\"</ref> The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.<ref>A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nVarious hypotheses attempted to connect the \"heart shape\" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.<ref name=\"mcdonell\">[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.</ref> Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.

However, while the charges are clearly heart-shaped, they did not in origin depict hearts, or symbolize any idea related to love. Instead they are assumed to have depicted the leaves of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. Early heraldic heart-shaped charges depicting the leaves of water-lilies are found in various other designs related to territories close to rivers or a coastline (''e.g.'' [[Flags of Frisia]]).\n\nInverted heart symbols have been used in heraldry as stylized [[testicle]]s (''coglioni'' in Italian) as in the [[canting arms]] of the [[Colleoni]] family of Milan.<ref name=\"Woodward\">Woodward, John and George Burnett (1969).

Coloured red on the [[Tube map]], the line serves 49 stations over {{convert|46|mi}}.<ref name=\"Line Facts\" /> It is one of only two lines on the Underground network to cross the [[Greater London]] boundary, the other being the [[Metropolitan line]]. One of London's [[London Underground infrastructure#Sub surface network and deep-level tube lines|deep-level railways]], Central line trains are smaller than those on British main lines.\n\nThe line was opened as the [[Central London Railway]] in 1900, crossing central London on an east\u2013west axis, as the third deep-level Tube line to be built after electric trains made them possible. It was later extended to the western suburb of Ealing. After the Second World War, the line was expanded considerably into the recently constructed suburbs, taking over steam-hauled outer-suburban routes to the borders of London and beyond to the east. This realised plans that had been delayed by the war, when construction stopped and the unused tunnels were used as air-raid shelters and factories. However, suburban growth proved to be less than expected, and of the planned expansions one (to {{rws|Denham}}, Buckinghamshire) was cut short due to its location in the Metropolitan Green Belt and another (to {{rws|Ongar}}) ultimately closed in 1994 due to low patronage; the section between Epping and Ongar later became part of the [[Epping Ongar Railway]]. The Central line has mostly been operated by [[automatic train operation]] since a major refurbishment in the 1990s, although all trains still carry drivers. Many of its stations are of historic interest, from turn-of-the-century Central London Railway buildings in west London to post-war modernist designs on the West Ruislip and Hainault branches, as well as Victorian-era [[Eastern Counties Railway]] and [[Great Eastern Railway]] buildings east of {{stn|Stratford}}, from when the line to Epping was a rural branch line.\n\nIn terms of total passengers, the Central line is the second busiest on the Underground.

Both the [[City and South London Railway]] and the [[Waterloo and City Railway]] were lit by gas lamps, primarily because the power stations for these lines were designed with no spare capacity to power electric lighting. With the white glazed tiling, all underground Central London Railway platforms were very brightly lit. The use of electric lighting was further made possible because the Central London was also the first tube railway to use [[Alternating current|AC]] electrical distribution{{efn|Power was generated at 5000 volts at {{frac|33|1|3}} Hertz from six 850 kW generators at Wood Lane.}} and the [[Electrical substation|substation]] [[transformer]]s were easily able to provide convenient voltages to run the lighting. Earlier tube lines generated [[DC power]] at the voltage required to run the trains (500 volts).\n\nThe line between Shepherd's Bush and Bank was formally opened on 30 June 1900, public services beginning on 30 July.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=56\u201357}} With a uniform fare of 2[[\u00a3sd|d]] the railway became known as the \"Twopenny Tube\".{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=56\u201357}} It was initially operated by [[electric locomotive]]s hauling carriages, but the locomotive's considerable unsprung weight{{efn|The CLR locomotives had been designed such that the motor armatures were built directly on the axles. This was intended to reduce noise from gearboxes which would otherwise be necessary.}} caused much vibration in the buildings above the line, and the railway rebuilt the locomotives to incorporate geared drives. This allowed higher-speed and lighter motors to be used, which reduced the overall weight of the locomotive as well as the unsprung weight. The railway also tried an alternative approach: it converted four coaches to accommodate motors and control gear. Two of these experimental motor coaches were used in a 6-coach train, the control gear being operated by the system used on the Waterloo and City Railway.{{efn|Although the Board of Trade forbade this system being used on any future passenger railway, it was used in this case because the trains were experimental and were forbidden to carry fare-paying passengers.}} The modified locomotives were a considerable improvement, but the motor coaches of an even lower weight were much better still. The CLR ordered 64 new motor cars{{efn|The CLR adopted the American term of 'car' rather than 'coach' with the introduction of the Electrical Multiple Unit.}} designed to use [[Frank J. Sprague|Sprague]]'s recently developed [[Multiple-unit train control|traction control]] system. The CLR was exclusively using the resulting [[electric multiple units]] by 1903.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=22}}\n\nIn July 1907, the fare was increased to 3d for journeys of more than seven or eight stations. The line was extended westwards with a loop serving a single platform at [[Wood Lane (Central line) tube station|Wood Lane]] for the 1908 [[Franco-British Exhibition (1908)|Franco-British Exhibition]]. A reduced fare of 1d, for a journey of three or fewer stations, was introduced in 1909, and season tickets became available from 1911. The extension to Liverpool Street opened the following year, providing access to the [[Great Eastern Railway|Great Eastern]] station and the adjacent [[Broad Street railway station (London)|Broad Street]] station by escalators. The Central London Railway was absorbed into the [[Underground Group]] on 1 January 1913.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nIn 1911, the [[Great Western Railway]] won permission for a line from [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing Broadway]] to a station near to the CLR's [[Shepherd's Bush tube station|Shepherd's Bush]] station, with a connection to the [[West London Railway]], and agreement to connect the line to the Central London Railway and for the CLR to run trains to Ealing Broadway. Construction of the extension from the CLR to Ealing Broadway started in 1912{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=119}} but opening was delayed by [[World War I]]. The CLR purchased new rolling stock for the extension, which arrived in 1915 and was stored before being lent to the [[Bakerloo line]]. The rolling stock returned when the extension opened in 1920.{{sfn|Bruce|1988|pp=31\u201333}}\n\nIn 1912, plans were published for a railway from [[Shepherd's Bush tube station|Shepherd's Bush]] to [[Turnham Green tube station|Turnham Green]] and [[Gunnersbury station|Gunnersbury]],<ref name=gazette_1>{{London Gazette|issue=28666|date=26 November 1912|pages=9018\u20139021}}</ref> allowing the Central London Railway to run trains on [[London and South Western Railway]] (L&SWR) tracks to [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]].

[[London Underground]] line that runs through central London, from {{lus|Epping}}, Essex, in the north-east to {{lus|Ealing Broadway}} and {{lus|West Ruislip}} in the west. Coloured red on the [[Tube map]], the line serves 49 stations over {{convert|46|mi}}.<ref name=\"Line Facts\" /> It is one of only two lines on the Underground network to cross the [[Greater London]] boundary, the other being the [[Metropolitan line]]. One of London's [[London Underground infrastructure#Sub surface network and deep-level tube lines|deep-level railways]], Central line trains are smaller than those on British main lines.\n\nThe line was opened as the [[Central London Railway]] in 1900, crossing central London on an east\u2013west axis, as the third deep-level Tube line to be built after electric trains made them possible. It was later extended to the western suburb of Ealing. After the Second World War, the line was expanded considerably into the recently constructed suburbs, taking over steam-hauled outer-suburban routes to the borders of London and beyond to the east. This realised plans that had been delayed by the war, when construction stopped and the unused tunnels were used as air-raid shelters and factories. However, suburban growth proved to be less than expected, and of the planned expansions one (to {{rws|Denham}}, Buckinghamshire) was cut short due to its location in the Metropolitan Green Belt and another (to {{rws|Ongar}}) ultimately closed in 1994 due to low patronage; the section between Epping and Ongar later became part of the [[Epping Ongar Railway]]. The Central line has mostly been operated by [[automatic train operation]] since a major refurbishment in the 1990s, although all trains still carry drivers. Many of its stations are of historic interest, from turn-of-the-century Central London Railway buildings in west London to post-war modernist designs on the West Ruislip and Hainault branches, as well as Victorian-era [[Eastern Counties Railway]] and [[Great Eastern Railway]] buildings east of {{stn|Stratford}}, from when the line to Epping was a rural branch line.\n\nIn terms of total passengers, the Central line is the second busiest on the Underground.

Both the [[City and South London Railway]] and the [[Waterloo and City Railway]] were lit by gas lamps, primarily because the power stations for these lines were designed with no spare capacity to power electric lighting. With the white glazed tiling, all underground Central London Railway platforms were very brightly lit. The use of electric lighting was further made possible because the Central London was also the first tube railway to use [[Alternating current|AC]] electrical distribution{{efn|Power was generated at 5000 volts at {{frac|33|1|3}} Hertz from six 850 kW generators at Wood Lane.}} and the [[Electrical substation|substation]] [[transformer]]s were easily able to provide convenient voltages to run the lighting. Earlier tube lines generated [[DC power]] at the voltage required to run the trains (500 volts).\n\nThe line between Shepherd's Bush and Bank was formally opened on 30 June 1900, public services beginning on 30 July.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=56\u201357}} With a uniform fare of 2[[\u00a3sd|d]] the railway became known as the \"Twopenny Tube\".{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=56\u201357}} It was initially operated by [[electric locomotive]]s hauling carriages, but the locomotive's considerable unsprung weight{{efn|The CLR locomotives had been designed such that the motor armatures were built directly on the axles. This was intended to reduce noise from gearboxes which would otherwise be necessary.}} caused much vibration in the buildings above the line, and the railway rebuilt the locomotives to incorporate geared drives. This allowed higher-speed and lighter motors to be used, which reduced the overall weight of the locomotive as well as the unsprung weight. The railway also tried an alternative approach: it converted four coaches to accommodate motors and control gear. Two of these experimental motor coaches were used in a 6-coach train, the control gear being operated by the system used on the Waterloo and City Railway.{{efn|Although the Board of Trade forbade this system being used on any future passenger railway, it was used in this case because the trains were experimental and were forbidden to carry fare-paying passengers.}} The modified locomotives were a considerable improvement, but the motor coaches of an even lower weight were much better still. The CLR ordered 64 new motor cars{{efn|The CLR adopted the American term of 'car' rather than 'coach' with the introduction of the Electrical Multiple Unit.}} designed to use [[Frank J. Sprague|Sprague]]'s recently developed [[Multiple-unit train control|traction control]] system. The CLR was exclusively using the resulting [[electric multiple units]] by 1903.{{sfn|Green|1987|p=22}}\n\nIn July 1907, the fare was increased to 3d for journeys of more than seven or eight stations. The line was extended westwards with a loop serving a single platform at [[Wood Lane (Central line) tube station|Wood Lane]] for the 1908 [[Franco-British Exhibition (1908)|Franco-British Exhibition]]. A reduced fare of 1d, for a journey of three or fewer stations, was introduced in 1909, and season tickets became available from 1911. The extension to Liverpool Street opened the following year, providing access to the [[Great Eastern Railway|Great Eastern]] station and the adjacent [[Broad Street railway station (London)|Broad Street]] station by escalators. The Central London Railway was absorbed into the [[Underground Group]] on 1 January 1913.{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nIn 1911, the [[Great Western Railway]] won permission for a line from [[Ealing Broadway station|Ealing Broadway]] to a station near to the CLR's [[Shepherd's Bush tube station|Shepherd's Bush]] station, with a connection to the [[West London Railway]], and agreement to connect the line to the Central London Railway and for the CLR to run trains to Ealing Broadway. Construction of the extension from the CLR to Ealing Broadway started in 1912{{sfn|Croome|Jackson|1993|p=119}} but opening was delayed by [[World War I]]. The CLR purchased new rolling stock for the extension, which arrived in 1915 and was stored before being lent to the [[Bakerloo line]].

Producer [[Kevin Feige]] first publicly mentioned ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' as a potential film in 2010 and Marvel Studios announced it was in active development at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in July 2012. Gunn was hired to write and direct the film that September. In February 2013, Pratt was hired to play Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the supporting cast members were subsequently confirmed.

Twenty-six years later on the abandoned planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious orb but is attacked by [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], a subordinate to the fanatical [[Kree]] militant, [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]. Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] after the orb.\n\nWhen Quill attempts to sell the orb on [[Xandar]], capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and the tree-like humanoid [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]. [[Nova Corps]] officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. A powerful inmate there, [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax]], attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Thanos and Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the orb to the Collector [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer Tivan]], Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the ''Milano''.\n\nRonan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to [[Knowhere]], a remote lawless outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing the Power [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stone]], an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive. Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb.\n\nQuill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the ''Dark Aster'', Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.\n\nThe Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the ''Dark Aster'' at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the ''Dark Aster'' with the ''Milano''. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax kills Korath and Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the ''Dark Aster''. The damaged ''Dark Aster'' crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize Ronan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt ''Milano'' along with a potted sapling [[Cutting (plant)|cut]] from Groot, which grows into a baby version of him.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|Identified offscreen as [[Cosmo the Spacedog]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom2\" /><ref name=\"Green\" />}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Guardians cast.jpg|150|526|The cast of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Just the simple things that we have in common. Simple things like the tattoos, the tragedy\u2014because, you know, I had a bit of tragedy in my life as well. So it's really easy for me to pull from that.\" Bautista also said that there was \"a lot of comic relief to Drax\", but the character was not aware of it. Bautista stated that he did not do much preparation for the role, because \"Luckily, for me, I'm a lifelong athlete and I adapted real quick.\"<ref name=\"2014Bautista\" /> Bautista's makeup took approximately four hours to apply, though it could be removed in just 90 minutes.<ref name=\"ColliderMay2014\" /> Drax has various scarring patterns on his body, which replace the simple tattoos from the comics, each having a specific story.

He's caught up in Rocket's life, really.\" Gunn added that the design and movement of Groot took \"the better part of a year\" to create.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer3\" /> Gunn added, \"The ways in which Vin Diesel says, 'I am Groot,' I am astounded. All of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very good at all ... Vin came in and in one day, laid down all these 'I am Groot' tracks, and he's a perfectionist.

It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how much the character changed and how much he influenced the character.\"<ref name=\"GunnIGNFeb2014\" /> Regarding the limited words used by Groot, Diesel said in many ways this was, \"... the most challenging thing to ask an actor to do.\"<ref name=\"TheMovieNetwork\"/> Diesel found an emotional note in his performance, invoking the death of his friend and ''[[The Fast and the Furious|Fast and Furious]]'' co-star [[Paul Walker]], saying, \"This was in December [2013], and the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice.\"<ref name=\"DieselGrootDeath\" /> Groot's form and size-changing abilities are seen, with Gunn stating that he has the ability to grow in the film.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg2\" />\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket<!-- CREDITED ONLY AS \"Rocket\" PER OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS! -->]]: <br />A genetically-engineered [[raccoon]]-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Cooper\" /> Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was \"not a cartoon character\", saying, \"It's not [[Bugs Bunny]] in the middle of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine.\"<ref name=\"GunnRocket\" /> Gunn also based the character on himself.<ref name=\"RocketGrootInfluence\" /> Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, \"I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of [[Joe Pesci]] in ''[[Goodfellas]]'' guy.\"<ref name=\"Cooper2\" /> Cooper voiced Rocket, while [[Sean Gunn]] (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /> James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators,<ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /> though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Sean noted they \"kind of stumbled\" into the process of him performing on set since they \"weren't sure how we were going to create that character\". The same process would continue to be used for all subsequent appearances of Rocket.<ref name=\"SeanGunnSept2018\" /> Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance \"the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny.

He has a very sick and twisted view of what morality is; strength is virtue and weakness is sin and that is what he lives by, and I think he is very scary because of his beliefs, which are real to him.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\" /> Pace, who originally auditioned for Peter Quill,<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> described Ronan as a \"psycho\" and a \"monster\".<ref name=\"PaceOctober2013\" />\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]]: <br />A blue-skinned bandit who is the leader of the Ravagers and a paternal figure to Quill.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> Yondu helps Quill to steal the orb before Quill betrays him, leaving Yondu and the Ravagers to chase the Guardians. On the character, Rooker said, he has \"some interesting issues\u2014not a good guy, not a bad guy. There's hope and there's a heart inside Yondu.\" Gunn created the film's version of the character specifically with Rooker in mind, while borrowing the character's mohawk and use of a whistle-controlled arrow from the comics. Rooker fully committed to the role once he knew his role on the TV series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' would be ending.<ref name=\"RookerUSAToday\" /> Rooker's makeup took approximately four hours to apply.<ref name=\"RookerMakeup\" />\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]: <br />An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings and is a loyal lieutenant in the employ of Ronan and Thanos.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\" /> About the character, Gillan said, \"She is the female villain of the film ... She is very sadistic and evil, but I like to think for a very valid reason.\"<ref name=\"2013NovGillan\" /> She also added, \"I think she's a really interesting character. What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of [[sibling rivalry]]. That's the most interesting aspect to me, because jealousy can consume you and turn you bitter, and ugly. And she's a total sadist, so that's fun too.\"<ref name=\"GillanCBR\" /> Gillan researched the ancient [[Sparta]]ns, shaved off her hair, and trained for two months for the role.<ref name=\"GillanCBR\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /> The character's makeup took approximately four-and-a-half hours to be applied.<ref name=\"GillanCBR\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: <br />A Kree<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" /> ally of Ronan who is a feared intergalactic hunter.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /> As to why he took the role Hounsou said, \"I have a four-year old son who loves superheroes from [[Spider-Man]] to [[Iron Man]] to [[Batman]]. He's got all the costumes. One day he looks at me and says 'Dad, I want to be light-skinned so I could be Spider-Man. Spider-Man has light skin.' That was sort of a shock.

I think they've been revamped recently in a fun way in the [comic] book.\"<ref name=\"2010SDCCFeige\" /> Feige reiterated that sentiment in a September 2011 issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', saying, \"There's an opportunity to do a big space epic, which ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' sort of hints at, in the cosmic side\" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Feige added, should the film be made, it would feature an ensemble of characters, similar to ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"2011SeptEW\" />\n\nFeige announced that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014.

He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon ...

He felt that \"having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to ''Guardians of the Galaxy'',\" yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without \"[belittling] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan.\" To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill \"The Other\", Thanos' vizier, saying, \"I thought that was interesting, because we've had the Other, who's obviously very powerful even in comparison to [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him.

I can't wait for people to see it, because it's astonishingly beautiful.\"<ref name=\"GunnEffects\" /> After the release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', Feige stated that the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]] would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the Phase Three slate of films within the MCU.<ref name=\"InfinityStones\" /> In a separate interview for ''The Dark World'' in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film,<ref name=\"SlashFilmNov2013\" /> referred to as the \"Power Stone\" by the Collector.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /><ref name=\"IBPowerStone\" /> The [[mid-credits scene]] in ''The Dark World'' revealed Lovibond's role as the Collector's slave, later named Carina.<ref name=\"2014AprilLovibond\" /> In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.<ref name=\"DieselMarvelOfficial\" />\n\nA few weeks of additional filming, involving the film's main cast and crew, occurred in March 2014 at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming\" /><ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming2\" /><ref name=\"SaldanaAddnlFilming\" /> In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the \"head of the snake\" in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture.<ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\" /> In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an \"enormous\" amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date.<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" /> Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, \"We really, really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy. We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races.\" The film introduces the alien race [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]], who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the [[Badoon]], as the Badoon film rights belonged to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" />\n\nBy the end of May, [[Josh Brolin]] was revealed as the voice of Thanos,<ref name=\"ThanosCast\" /><ref name=\"BrolinThanos\" /> with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /> Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /> In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are \"the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into ''Avengers'' films in the future.\"<ref name=\"FeigeTotalFilm\" /> On casting Brolin, Feige said,\n\n<blockquote>We reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it's very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of ''Avengers''. Then we shot him and recorded for it.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /></blockquote>\n\nOn July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film.<ref name=\"GotGComplete\" /> In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve [[Howard the Duck]] when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production,<ref name=\"GunnHowardDuck\" /> a decision made by \"some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate. Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Baby Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want \"people walking out and missing this thing\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. Sarofsky developed a custom [[typeface]] based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and grey imagery. One of the typography solutions offered before the final product wound up being repurposed as the locator cards seen throughout the film.<ref name=\"Sarofsky\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n|align     = right\n|direction = vertical\n|footer            = The [[Gardens by the Bay]] (top) in [[Singapore]] helped inspire the look of the planet Xandar (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n|width     = 200\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n|image1    = Gardens by the Bay South viewed from Sands Sky Park, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore.jpg\n|width1    =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n|image2    = Xandar.jpg\n|width2    = \n}}\n\nThe film featured 2,750 visual effects shots,<ref name=\"VFXShots\" /> which make up approximately 90% of the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> The visual effects were created by: [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), who worked on creating Groot, as well as Morag, Xandar, the ''Dark Aster'' and the final battle on Xandar;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Framestore]], who worked on creating Rocket, extending the Kyln prison set and constructing Knowhere;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"FramestoreRocket\" /> [[Luma Pictures]], who worked on Thanos;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Method Studios]], who worked on creating the Orb opening and revealing its powers, as well as the holographic displays at the Nova Corps command center;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Lola VFX; Cantina Creative; [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], who worked on Howard the Duck and creating the ''Dark Aster'' shots with MPC;<ref name=\"Corlett\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> CoSA VFX; Secret Lab; Rise Visual Effects Studios; and Technicolor VFX.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"MethodVFX\" /> Pre- and post-visualizations were done by Proof and The Third Floor, with Proof also contributing to the creation of Rocket and Groot.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nProducer Nik Korda noted how helpful it was to have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it provided references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, \"When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections\u2014trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place\u2014trying to make them strange and look more human.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nOne of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since \"raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs\", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use \"guide hairs\" to control the movements of thick sections of fur.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nIn order to give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks\". The character's large jaw, and the deep groves that run down his face, had \"to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)}}\nIn August 2013, Gunn revealed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as \"[[Hooked on a Feeling]]\", on a mixtape in Quill's [[Walkman]], which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer6\" /> In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the '60s and '70s were \"cultural reference points\", saying, \"It's striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill] is a real person from planet Earth who's just like you and me. Except that he's in this big outer space adventure.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" />\n\nWhen choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he \"started the process by reading the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts for all of the top hits of the '70s\", downloading \"a few hundred\" songs that were \"semi-familiar\u2014ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head\" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he \"would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house\u2014sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" /> Most of the songs were played on set to help \"the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot\", with [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in mind; however, once Gunn discovered \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a \"better fit.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" />\n\nThree albums were released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 29, 2014: The film's score, ''Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score)'', which features the music composed by Bates for the film;<ref name=\"Score\" /> ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]'', which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" /> By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape had reached the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixChart\" /> Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to [[Record Store Day]] participants.

The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and ''Guardians'' depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat.\" He also felt that Close, Reilly and del Toro were underused in the film.<ref name=\"APReview\" /> [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said, \"In place of wit, ''Guardians'' offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening\u2013and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it.\"<ref name=\"SFChronicleReview\" /> Kyle Smith of the ''[[New

In ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]] forms an uneasy alliance with a group of extraterrestrial criminals who are on the run after stealing a powerful artifact.\n\nPerlman began working on the screenplay in 2009. Producer [[Kevin Feige]] first publicly mentioned ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' as a potential film in 2010 and Marvel Studios announced it was in active development at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in July 2012. Gunn was hired to write and direct the film that September. In February 2013, Pratt was hired to play Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the supporting cast members were subsequently confirmed. [[Principal photography]] began in July 2013 at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England, with filming continuing in London before wrapping up in October 2013. Post-production was completed on July 7, 2014.\n\n''Guardians of the Galaxy'' premiered at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Hollywood on July 21, 2014, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 1, 2014, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU.

A third film, ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'', is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be kept between 400 to 700 words! -->\nIn 1988, following his mother's death, a young [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]] is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, a group of alien thieves and smugglers led by [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]]. Twenty-six years later on the abandoned planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious orb but is attacked by [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], a subordinate to the fanatical [[Kree]] militant, [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]. Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] after the orb.\n\nWhen Quill attempts to sell the orb on [[Xandar]], capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and the tree-like humanoid [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]. [[Nova Corps]] officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. A powerful inmate there, [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax]], attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Thanos and Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the orb to the Collector [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer Tivan]], Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the ''Milano''.\n\nRonan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to [[Knowhere]], a remote lawless outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing the Power [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stone]], an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive. Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb.\n\nQuill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the ''Dark Aster'', Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.\n\nThe Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the ''Dark Aster'' at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the ''Dark Aster'' with the ''Milano''. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax kills Korath and Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the ''Dark Aster''. The damaged ''Dark Aster'' crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize Ronan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt ''Milano'' along with a potted sapling [[Cutting (plant)|cut]] from Groot, which grows into a baby version of him.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|Identified offscreen as [[Cosmo the Spacedog]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom2\" /><ref name=\"Green\" />}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Guardians cast.jpg|150|526|The cast of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Pratt had lost weight to portray fit characters in films such as ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', and had given up ambitions to play the lead role in action films after humbling auditions for ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. Casting director Sarah Finn suggested Pratt to Gunn, who dismissed the idea despite struggling to cast that role. Despite this, Finn arranged for a meeting between the two, at which point Gunn was immediately convinced that Pratt was perfect for the role. Pratt also won over Feige, despite having gained weight again for ''[[Delivery Man (film)|Delivery Man]]''.<ref name=\"EWJuly2014\" /> Prior to filming, Pratt underwent a strict diet and training regimen to lose {{convert|60|lb}} in six months.<ref name=\"PrattWeight\" /> Pratt signed a multi-film contract with Marvel,<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /> and was granted a temporary leave from his work on ''Parks and Recreation'' in order to accommodate his participation in the film.<ref name=\"ParksandRec\" /> [[Wyatt Oleff]] portrays a young Quill.<ref name=\"TimeReview\" />\n* [[Zoe Saldana]] as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]]: <br />An orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes.

I've been blue before [in ''Avatar''].\"<ref name=\"2013MayMTV\" /> Saldana described Gamora as \"... a warrior, she's an assassin and she's very lethal but what saves her is the same thing that can doom her.

Just the simple things that we have in common. Simple things like the tattoos, the tragedy\u2014because, you know, I had a bit of tragedy in my life as well. So it's really easy for me to pull from that.\" Bautista also said that there was \"a lot of comic relief to Drax\", but the character was not aware of it. Bautista stated that he did not do much preparation for the role, because \"Luckily, for me, I'm a lifelong athlete and I adapted real quick.\"<ref name=\"2014Bautista\" /> Bautista's makeup took approximately four hours to apply, though it could be removed in just 90 minutes.<ref name=\"ColliderMay2014\" /> Drax has various scarring patterns on his body, which replace the simple tattoos from the comics, each having a specific story. Additionally, his skin tone was changed from the bright green in the comics to a muddier grey, to avoid visual similarities to the [[Hulk]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" />\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]: <br />A tree-like humanoid<ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /> who is the accomplice of Rocket.

He's an innocent. He's a hundred percent deadly and a hundred percent sweet. He's caught up in Rocket's life, really.\" Gunn added that the design and movement of Groot took \"the better part of a year\" to create.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer3\" /> Gunn added, \"The ways in which Vin Diesel says, 'I am Groot,' I am astounded. All of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very good at all ... Vin came in and in one day, laid down all these 'I am Groot' tracks, and he's a perfectionist.

It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how much the character changed and how much he influenced the character.\"<ref name=\"GunnIGNFeb2014\" /> Regarding the limited words used by Groot, Diesel said in many ways this was, \"... the most challenging thing to ask an actor to do.\"<ref name=\"TheMovieNetwork\"/> Diesel found an emotional note in his performance, invoking the death of his friend and ''[[The Fast and the Furious|Fast and Furious]]'' co-star [[Paul Walker]], saying, \"This was in December [2013], and the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice.\"<ref name=\"DieselGrootDeath\" /> Groot's form and size-changing abilities are seen, with Gunn stating that he has the ability to grow in the film.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg2\" />\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket<!-- CREDITED ONLY AS \"Rocket\" PER OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS! -->]]: <br />A genetically-engineered [[raccoon]]-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Cooper\" /> Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was \"not a cartoon character\", saying, \"It's not [[Bugs Bunny]] in the middle of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine.\"<ref name=\"GunnRocket\" /> Gunn also based the character on himself.<ref name=\"RocketGrootInfluence\" /> Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, \"I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of [[Joe Pesci]] in ''[[Goodfellas]]'' guy.\"<ref name=\"Cooper2\" /> Cooper voiced Rocket, while [[Sean Gunn]] (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /> James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators,<ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /> though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Sean noted they \"kind of stumbled\" into the process of him performing on set since they \"weren't sure how we were going to create that character\". The same process would continue to be used for all subsequent appearances of Rocket.<ref name=\"SeanGunnSept2018\" /> Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance \"the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny.

He has a very sick and twisted view of what morality is; strength is virtue and weakness is sin and that is what he lives by, and I think he is very scary because of his beliefs, which are real to him.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\" /> Pace, who originally auditioned for Peter Quill,<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> described Ronan as a \"psycho\" and a \"monster\".<ref name=\"PaceOctober2013\" />\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]]: <br />A blue-skinned bandit who is the leader of the Ravagers and a paternal figure to Quill.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> Yondu helps Quill to steal the orb before Quill betrays him, leaving Yondu and the Ravagers to chase the Guardians. On the character, Rooker said, he has \"some interesting issues\u2014not a good guy, not a bad guy. There's hope and there's a heart inside Yondu.\" Gunn created the film's version of the character specifically with Rooker in mind, while borrowing the character's mohawk and use of a whistle-controlled arrow from the comics.

She is very sadistic and evil, but I like to think for a very valid reason.\"<ref name=\"2013NovGillan\" /> She also added, \"I think she's a really interesting character. What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of [[sibling rivalry]].

They like first writers an awful lot.\"<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\" /> In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script,<ref name=\"2012AugMcCoy\" /> however, it is unclear what contribution he had to the final script, since he did not receive production credit.<ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" />\n\nGunn revealed that character introductions were the \"hardest scenes to crack\", with Thanos' introduction being the most difficult. He felt that \"having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to ''Guardians of the Galaxy'',\" yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without \"[belittling] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan.\" To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill \"The Other\", Thanos' vizier, saying, \"I thought that was interesting, because we've had the Other, who's obviously very powerful even in comparison to [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn't work so much.\"<ref name=\"GunnVultureThanos\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn September 2012, Gunn confirmed that he had signed on to direct the film and rewrite the script.<ref name=\"2012SepGunn\" /> By the end of November, [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Jack Huston]], [[Jim Sturgess]], and [[Eddie Redmayne]] signed deals to test for the role of [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], as did [[Lee Pace]],<ref name=\"2012NovTestDeals\" /> which he confirmed a week later in early December.<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> Other actors who were considered for the role included ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''{{'}}s [[Zachary Levi]],<ref name=\"2012Dec21Quill\" /> [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]],<ref name=\"2013JanJGL\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]],<ref name=\"2013JanRosenbaum\" /> and [[John Gallagher Jr.]]<ref name=\"GallagherStarLord\" /> [[Chris Pratt]] was cast in the role in February 2013, as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel.<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /><ref name=\"2013FebPratt\" />\n\n[[File:James Gunn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gunn promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn January 2013, filming was scheduled to take place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in London, United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /> and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in [[3D film|3D]].<ref name=\"2013Jan3D\" /> Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created through a combination of CGI and motion capture, going on to say that \"You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon\u2014they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do [[rotoscoping|rotomation]], probably, for some of the behavior ... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on where he wants to take the characters.\"<ref name=\"2013FebAlonso\" /> In March 2013, Feige discussed ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"It's much more of a [[Sequel#Stand-alone sequels|standalone]] film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been on the other side of that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time.\" Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space.<ref name=\"2013MarchSFX\" /> In mid-March, [[Dave Bautista]] was signed to play [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> Other actors who had been considered for the role included [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and [[Jason Momoa]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> By the following week, sculptor [[Brian Muir (sculptor)|Brian Muir]], who sculpted [[Darth Vader]]'s mask for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, was revealed to be working on the film.<ref name=\"2013MarchMuir\" />\n\nIn early April 2013, [[Zoe Saldana]] entered into negotiations to star as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] in the film, and it was confirmed she had been cast later that month.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilSaldana\" /> Also in April, [[Michael Rooker]] joined the film's cast as [[Yondu]],<ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> and it was announced that [[Ophelia Lovibond]] had been cast in a supporting role.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /> By this point in time, [[Lee Pace]] was in final negotiations to play the villain of the film.<ref name=\"2013AprilPace\" /> In May, Marvel offered [[John C.

White said, \"James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like me, to see the real deal there on set.\" White was careful not to use \"modern\" creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different-colored aliens.<ref name=\"WhiteMakeup\" /> For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create \"a colorful science-fiction world\", and include elements of 1950s and '60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, as an example of the latter.<ref name=\"GunnDesign\" /> Science fiction artist [[Chris Foss]] inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.<ref name=\"ChrisFoss\" /> The ''[[Mass Effect]]'' video game series, [[Flash Gordon]], ''[[Farscape]]'', and ''[[Star Wars]]'' were primary inspirations for Gunn on the film.<ref name=\"GunnInspirations\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began around July 6, 2013 in [[London]], United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /> under the working title of ''Full Tilt''.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg1\" /> Filming took place at Shepperton Studios and [[Longcross Studios]].<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /><ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Later in July, Gunn and the film's cast flew from London to attend San Diego Comic-Con International, where it was revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser, Gillan would be [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], del Toro as [[Collector (comics)|The Collector]], and that [[Djimon Hounsou]] had been cast as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]].<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Close was later revealed to play [[Nova Corps#Known members|Nova Prime Irani Rael]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Also at San Diego Comic-Con, Feige stated that Thanos would be a part of the film as the \"mastermind\".<ref name=\"2013JulyFeige\" /> On August 11, 2013, filming began at London's [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]],<ref name=\"Entertainmentwise\" /> which was selected as a double for [[Xandar]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" /> In August 2013, Marvel announced that [[Bradley Cooper]] would voice Rocket.<ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /> On September 3, 2013, Gunn said that filming was \"a little over half[way]\" complete.<ref name=\"2013SeptMTV\" /> Also in September, [[Vin Diesel]] stated that he was voicing Groot.<ref name=\"DieselConfirm\" /> However, Marvel did not confirm Diesel's involvement in the film at the time.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /><ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /><ref name=\"HuffingtonPostOct2013\" /> On October 12, 2013, Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed.<ref name=\"FilmingEnding\" />\n\n[[Director of photography]] [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] used [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] cameras for the film, saying, \"I'm traditionally a photochemical fan, but going with the digital format was the right way for this movie ... the Alexa [provided] the right look for this particular film.\" During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they \"had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [he] felt added something.\" Davis used spherical [[Panavision]] Primos for the rest of the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene.<ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.<ref name=\"DavisInterview2\" />\n\nGunn revealed that his brother, Sean Gunn, took on multiple roles during the filming process, such as standing in for Rocket, which he noted was beneficial for the other actors, including Saldana, Pratt, and Bautista, who responded positively to Sean and his on-set performances.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Special effects makeup designer David White made two life-size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot as aids for visual effects, with White saying, \"it gives [the filmmakers] a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket can actually reach certain things or use certain devices.\"<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> These busts were also used to see how the on-set lighting would affect the characters, to assist with the visual effects lighting process.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney revealed that the film came in \"slightly over the agreed budget\" at $232.3 million, with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4 million from the British government.<ref name=\"ActualBudget\" /> It was previously estimated to have had a $170 million budget.<ref name=\"Tracking\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn November 2013, Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during post-production, saying, \"Our sets are enormous. We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel. Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical and CGI effects ... I can't wait for people to see it, because it's astonishingly beautiful.\"<ref name=\"GunnEffects\" /> After the release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', Feige stated that the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]] would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the Phase Three slate of films within the MCU.<ref name=\"InfinityStones\" /> In a separate interview for ''The Dark World'' in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film,<ref name=\"SlashFilmNov2013\" /> referred to as the \"Power Stone\" by the Collector.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /><ref name=\"IBPowerStone\" /> The [[mid-credits scene]] in ''The Dark World'' revealed Lovibond's role as the Collector's slave, later named Carina.<ref name=\"2014AprilLovibond\" /> In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.<ref name=\"DieselMarvelOfficial\" />\n\nA few weeks of additional filming, involving the film's main cast and crew, occurred in March 2014 at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming\" /><ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming2\" /><ref name=\"SaldanaAddnlFilming\" /> In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the \"head of the snake\" in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture.<ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\" /> In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an \"enormous\" amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date.<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" /> Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, \"We really, really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy. We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races.\" The film introduces the alien race [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]], who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the [[Badoon]], as the Badoon film rights belonged to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" />\n\nBy the end of May, [[Josh Brolin]] was revealed as the voice of Thanos,<ref name=\"ThanosCast\" /><ref name=\"BrolinThanos\" /> with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /> Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /> In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are \"the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into ''Avengers'' films in the future.\"<ref name=\"FeigeTotalFilm\" /> On casting Brolin, Feige said,\n\n<blockquote>We reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it's very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of ''Avengers''. Then we shot him and recorded for it.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /></blockquote>\n\nOn July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film.<ref name=\"GotGComplete\" /> In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve [[Howard the Duck]] when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production,<ref name=\"GunnHowardDuck\" /> a decision made by \"some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate. Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Baby Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want \"people walking out and missing this thing\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. Sarofsky developed a custom [[typeface]] based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and grey imagery. One of the typography solutions offered before the final product wound up being repurposed as the locator cards seen throughout the film.<ref name=\"Sarofsky\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n|align     = right\n|direction = vertical\n|footer            = The [[Gardens by the Bay]] (top) in [[Singapore]] helped inspire the look of the planet Xandar (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n|width     = 200\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n|image1    = Gardens by the Bay South viewed from Sands Sky Park, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore.jpg\n|width1    =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n|image2    = Xandar.jpg\n|width2    = \n}}\n\nThe film featured 2,750 visual effects shots,<ref name=\"VFXShots\" /> which make up approximately 90% of the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> The visual effects were created by: [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), who worked on creating Groot, as well as Morag, Xandar, the ''Dark Aster'' and the final battle on Xandar;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Framestore]], who worked on creating Rocket, extending the Kyln prison set and constructing Knowhere;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"FramestoreRocket\" /> [[Luma Pictures]], who worked on Thanos;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Method Studios]], who worked on creating the Orb opening and revealing its powers, as well as the holographic displays at the Nova Corps command center;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Lola VFX; Cantina Creative; [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], who worked on Howard the Duck and creating the ''Dark Aster'' shots with MPC;<ref name=\"Corlett\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> CoSA VFX; Secret Lab; Rise Visual Effects Studios; and Technicolor VFX.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"MethodVFX\" /> Pre- and post-visualizations were done by Proof and The Third Floor, with Proof also contributing to the creation of Rocket and Groot.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nProducer Nik Korda noted how helpful it was to have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it provided references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, \"When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections\u2014trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place\u2014trying to make them strange and look more human.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nOne of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since \"raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs\", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use \"guide hairs\" to control the movements of thick sections of fur.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nIn order to give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks\". The character's large jaw, and the deep groves that run down his face, had \"to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)}}\nIn August 2013, Gunn revealed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as \"[[Hooked on a Feeling]]\", on a mixtape in Quill's [[Walkman]], which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer6\" /> In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the '60s and '70s were \"cultural reference points\", saying, \"It's striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill] is a real person from planet Earth who's just like you and me. Except that he's in this big outer space adventure.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" />\n\nWhen choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he \"started the process by reading the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts for all of the top hits of the '70s\", downloading \"a few hundred\" songs that were \"semi-familiar\u2014ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head\" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he \"would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house\u2014sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" /> Most of the songs were played on set to help \"the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot\", with [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in mind; however, once Gunn discovered \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a \"better fit.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" />\n\nThree albums were released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 29, 2014: The film's score, ''Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score)'', which features the music composed by Bates for the film;<ref name=\"Score\" /> ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]'', which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" /> By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape had reached the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixChart\" /> Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to [[Record Store Day]] participants.

''The Hollywood Reporter'' noted that the quick release of the scene from Marvel two weeks after the film's theatrical release, along with the rush announcement from Funko, indicated the popularity of both the character and the scene.<ref name=\"THRBabyGroot\" /> The scene also produced the word \"grooting\", coined by Michael Rooker, in which a person dances similar to Groot, with the word entering the social media [[lexicon]].<ref name=\"Grooting\" /> Also in August, Marvel held a special screening of the film at [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]], where Pratt dressed as Star-Lord to entertain the patients.<ref name=\"ChildrensHospitalScreening\" />\n\n===Merchandise===\nIn June 2012, Marvel filed eleven [[trademark]] applications for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', covering a variety of [[consumer product]]s, from [[video game]]s to [[cosmetics]].<ref name=\"2012TMApps\" /> [[Disney Consumer Products]] partnered with Mad Engine, C-Life, [[New Era Cap Company|New Era]], [[Hasbro]], Disguise, Rubies, [[Sideshow Collectibles]], [[Lego]], KIDdesigns, [[iHome]], [[Funko]], Freeze, Fast Forward, and Innovative Designs to produce merchandise for the film, with releases starting in June 2014.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /><ref name=\"2013AugVariety\" /><ref name=\"LegoSets\" /><ref name=\"LegoSets2\" /> Mad Engine and C-Life were partnered as the core apparel outfitters, producing a line of T-shirts and fleece jackets, while New Era produced headwear and hats.<ref name=\"2013AugVariety\" /> Hasbro produced toys for the film; Disguise and Rubies produced the costumes; and [[Sideshow Collectibles]] was given charge of the collectibles.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /><ref name=\"2013AugVariety\" /> Lego announced three toy sets based on scenes from the film,<ref name=\"LegoSets\" /> while iHome created character speakers, Funko made vinyl [[bobblehead]]s, Freeze crafted 1980s-inspired apparel, and backpacks and stationery were made by Fast Forward and Innovative Designs.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /> Despite first films in a potential new franchise usually being off-limits to licensees, Marvel used ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''{{'}}s success as evidence of unknown characters becoming hits with audiences to attract partnerships. Licensees embraced Rocket as the film's potential breakout character, with Drax and Gamora being used for older demographics; Star-Lord's obsession with 1980s nostalgia, including his \"Awesome Mix Vo. 1\" cassette, has also served as a basis for tie-in products.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /> In August 2014, Funko announced a toy based on \"Dancing Groot\",<ref name=\"THRBabyGroot\" /> while in October 2014, Marvel and KID designs announced a replica of dancing Groot, for release in December 2014.<ref name=\"KIDDancingGroot\" />\n\nIn December 2014, Disney made a second marketing push, to coincide with the film's home media release with additional merchandise.

With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.<ref>Kemp (2011), 96\u201399.</ref> Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of [[Hedera|ivy]] and of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}</ref>{{Not in refs|date=November 2019}}<!--Heart symbol not mentioned, over their heads could be circles as well.-->\n\nThe first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held \"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into \"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\">Vinken (2001).</ref> [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\"/>\n\nThe \"scalloped\" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''[[c:File:Documenti_d'amore_(1640)_(14747564815).jpg#file|Documenti d'amore]] ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459\u201370, fol 192v. [[Royal Library of Belgium]]). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.<ref>Vinken (2001): \"The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since.\"</ref> The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.<ref>A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nVarious hypotheses attempted to connect the \"heart shape\" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.<ref name=\"mcdonell\">[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.</ref> Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.

''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (1987, 1988) had a \"life bar\" composed of [[hexagon]]s, but in 1990s remakes of these games, the hexagons were replaced by heart shapes. Since the 1990s, the heart symbol has also been used as an ideogram indicating health outside of the video gaming context, e.g. its use by restaurants to indicate heart-healthy nutrient content claim (e.g. \"low in [[cholesterol]]\"). A copyrighted \"heart-check\" symbol to indicate heart-healthy food was introduced by the [[American Heart Association]] in 1995.<ref>\"the heart-check mark that began to appear on a wide array of food packaging in 1995.

With possible early examples or direct predecessors in the 13th to 14th century, the familiar symbol of the heart represented love developed in the 15th century, and became popular in Europe during the 16th.<ref>Kemp (2011), 96\u201399.</ref> Before the 14th century, the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor. The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources, but in such instances does not depict a heart, but typically foliage: in examples from antiquity [[Common fig|fig]] leaves, and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of [[Hedera|ivy]] and of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript, Al-Maqamat written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Al Hariri of Basra]]. The manuscript includes an [https://medieval.tumblr.com/image/108488126380 illustration] of a farewell greeting between two men while astride their camels, with the heart shape seen prominently over their heads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topic.com/the-pleasure-principles|title=The Pleasure Principles|publisher=}}</ref>{{Not in refs|date=November 2019}}<!--Heart symbol not mentioned, over their heads could be circles as well.-->\n\nThe first known depiction of a heart as a symbol of romantic love dates to the 1250s. It occurs in a miniature decorating a capital 'S' in a manuscript of the French ''[[Roman de la poire]]'' (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or ''douz regart'') offers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held \"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into \"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\">Vinken (2001).</ref> [[Giotto]] in his 1305 painting in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] ([[Padua]]) shows an [[Charity (virtue)|allegory of charity]] (caritas) handing her heart to [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]. This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by [[Taddeo Gaddi]] in Santa Croce, by [[Andrea Pisano]] on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by [[Andrea da Firenze]] in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century.<ref name=\"Vinken 2001\"/>\n\nThe \"scalloped\" shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, arises in the early 14th century, at first only lightly dented, as in the miniatures in Francesco Barberino's ''[[c:File:Documenti_d'amore_(1640)_(14747564815).jpg#file|Documenti d'amore]] ''(before 1320). A slightly later example with a more pronounced dent is found in a manuscript from the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Brussels (MS 4459\u201370, fol 192v. [[Royal Library of Belgium]]). The convention of showing a dent at the base of the heart thus spread at about the same time as the convention of showing the heart with its point downward.<ref>Vinken (2001): \"The change from the spherical to the scalloped form of the heart base happened more or less in train with the differing way in which the heart was held, and has dominated visual representations of the heart ever since.\"</ref> The modern indented red heart has been used on [[playing card]]s since the late 15th century.<ref>A Brief History of Playing Cardes, by Charles Knutson, Renaissance Magazine 2001 {{cite web |url=http://www.renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220111738/http://renaissancemagazine.com/backissues/game.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nVarious hypotheses attempted to connect the \"heart shape\" as it evolved in the [[Late Middle Ages]] with instances of the geometric shape in antiquity.<ref name=\"mcdonell\">[http://www.slate.com/id/2159800/?GT1=9129 The Shape of My Heart: Where did the ubiquitous Valentine's symbol come from?] by Keelin McDonell, [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]], Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2007.</ref> Such theories are modern, proposed from the 1960s onward, and they remain speculative, as no continuity between the supposed ancient predecessors and the late medieval tradition can be shown.

It was a stamp that validated lifestyles. People could \u2665 their grandchildren or line dancing or Buddha.\" Stephen Amidon, Thomas Amidon, ''The Sublime Engine: A Biography of the Human Heart'' (2011), p. 193.</ref>\n\nHeart symbols were used to symbolize [[Health (gaming)|\"health\" or \"lives\"]] in [[video game]]s; influentially so in ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986) and ''[[Minecraft]]'' (2009). ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' (1987, 1988) had a \"life bar\" composed of [[hexagon]]s, but in 1990s remakes of these games, the hexagons were replaced by heart shapes. Since the 1990s, the heart symbol has also been used as an ideogram indicating health outside of the video gaming context, e.g. its use by restaurants to indicate heart-healthy nutrient content claim (e.g. \"low in [[cholesterol]]\"). A copyrighted \"heart-check\" symbol to indicate heart-healthy food was introduced by the [[American Heart Association]] in 1995.<ref>\"the heart-check mark that began to appear on a wide array of food packaging in 1995. The symbol consists of a heart branded with a bold, efficient check mark.

However, while the charges are clearly heart-shaped, they did not in origin depict hearts, or symbolize any idea related to love. Instead they are assumed to have depicted the leaves of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]]. Early heraldic heart-shaped charges depicting the leaves of water-lilies are found in various other designs related to territories close to rivers or a coastline (''e.g.'' [[Flags of Frisia]]).\n\nInverted heart symbols have been used in heraldry as stylized [[testicle]]s (''coglioni'' in Italian) as in the [[canting arms]] of the [[Colleoni]] family of Milan.<ref name=\"Woodward\">Woodward, John and George Burnett (1969).
