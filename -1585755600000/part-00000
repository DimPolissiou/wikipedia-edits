PTFE is [[hydrophobic]]: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated [[London dispersion force]]s due to the high [[electronegativity]] of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of [[friction]] of any solid.\n\nPTFE is used as a [[non-stick coating]] for pans and other cookware. It is nonreactive, partly because of the strength of [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond]]s, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a [[lubricant]], PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. It is also frequently employed as coating on [[catheter]]s; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Happy Pan Poster.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Advertisement of the Happy Pan, a Teflon-coated pan from the 1960s]]\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=  | audio1 = [https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/teflon \"From stove tops to outer space...

Plunkett]] while he was working in New Jersey for [[DuPont]]. As Plunkett attempted to make a new [[chlorofluorocarbon]] refrigerant, the [[tetrafluoroethylene]] gas in its pressure bottle stopped flowing before the bottle's weight had dropped to the point signaling \"empty.\" Since Plunkett was measuring the amount of gas used by weighing the bottle, he became curious as to the source of the weight, and finally resorted to sawing the bottle apart. He found the bottle's interior coated with a waxy white material that was oddly slippery. Analysis showed that it was polymerized perfluoroethylene, with the iron from the inside of the container having acted as a catalyst at high pressure.<ref name=\"Institute\">{{cite web |title=Roy J.

PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with [[bismaleimide]] resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.\n\nBecause of its extreme non-reactivity and high temperature rating, PTFE is often used as the liner in [[hose]] assemblies, [[expansion joint#Pipe expansion joints|expansion joint]]s, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.\n\n[[Gore-Tex]] is a brand of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores.

It is notable for its extremely low coefficient of friction, its hydrophobia (which serves to inhibit rust), and for the dry film it forms after application, which allows it to resist collecting particles that might otherwise form an abrasive paste.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://interflonusa.com/what-is-micpol/#assembly|title=What is MicPol?|work=Lubrication|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPTFE (Teflon) is best known for its use in coating non-stick [[frying pan]]s and other cookware, as it is [[hydrophobic]] and possesses fairly high heat resistance.\n\n[[File:PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing, rolls of 15 and 25 mm widths.jpg|thumb|right|PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing]]\n\nThe sole plates of some clothes irons are coated with PTFE (Teflon).<ref>[http://pratique.leparisien.fr/fiches-pratiques/electromenager/repassage/fers-a-repasser-semelle-teflon-1600004600043011#xtref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.fr%252F Fers \u00e0 repasser semelle teflon - Fiche pratique - Le Parisien].

However, there has been relatively little conversation about the presence of these chemicals in our everyday lives and the public\u2019s sheer exposure to PFAS through primary contact from commercial products used in our everyday lives. Several peer reviewed studies have shown that the mean and median concentration of PFOA in household dust in the US was found to be between approximately 10,000 and 50,000 parts per trillion (ppt)3.

PTFE is [[hydrophobic]]: neither water nor water-containing substances wet PTFE, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated [[London dispersion force]]s due to the high [[electronegativity]] of fluorine. PTFE has one of the lowest coefficients of [[friction]] of any solid.\n\nPTFE is used as a [[non-stick coating]] for pans and other cookware. It is nonreactive, partly because of the strength of [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond]]s, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a [[lubricant]], PTFE reduces friction, wear, and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. It is also frequently employed as coating on [[catheter]]s; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Happy Pan Poster.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Advertisement of the Happy Pan, a Teflon-coated pan from the 1960s]]\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=  | audio1 = [https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/podcast/teflon \"From stove tops to outer space...

Combined with its high melting temperature, this makes it the material of choice as a high-performance substitute for the weaker and lower-melting-point [[polyethylene]] commonly used in low-cost applications.\n\nIn industrial applications, owing to its low friction, PTFE is used for [[plain bearing]]s, [[gear]]s, [[slide plate]]s, seals, gaskets, bushings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espemfg.com/teflon-machining-fabrication.html|title=Teflon Machining & Fabrication {{!}} ESPE|website=www.espemfg.com|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>, and more applications with sliding action of parts, where it outperforms [[polyoxymethylene|acetal]] and [[nylon]].<ref>Mishra & Yagci, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CoFE-itPBPgC&pg=PA573 p 573]</ref>\n \nIts extremely high bulk [[resistivity]] makes it an ideal material for fabricating long-life [[electret]]s, the [[electrostatic]] analogues of [[magnet|permanent magnets]].\n\nPTFE film is also widely used in the production of carbon fiber composites as well as fiberglass composites, notably in the aerospace industry. PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when debulking (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with [[bismaleimide]] resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.\n\nBecause of its extreme non-reactivity and high temperature rating, PTFE is often used as the liner in [[hose]] assemblies, [[expansion joint#Pipe expansion joints|expansion joint]]s, and in industrial pipe lines, particularly in applications using acids, alkalis, or other chemicals. Its frictionless qualities allow improved flow of highly viscous liquids, and for uses in applications such as brake hoses.\n\n[[Gore-Tex]] is a brand of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a material incorporating a fluoropolymer membrane with micropores. The roof of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in [[Minneapolis]], US,  was one of the largest applications of PTFE coatings. {{convert|20|acre|m2}} of the material was used in the creation of the white double-layered PTFE-coated fiberglass dome.\n\nPTFE is often found in musical instrument lubrication product; most commonly, valve oil.\n\nPTFE is used in some aerosol lubricant sprays, including in micronized and polarized form. It is notable for its extremely low coefficient of friction, its hydrophobia (which serves to inhibit rust), and for the dry film it forms after application, which allows it to resist collecting particles that might otherwise form an abrasive paste.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://interflonusa.com/what-is-micpol/#assembly|title=What is MicPol?|work=Lubrication|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPTFE (Teflon) is best known for its use in coating non-stick [[frying pan]]s and other cookware, as it is [[hydrophobic]] and possesses fairly high heat resistance.\n\n[[File:PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing, rolls of 15 and 25 mm widths.jpg|thumb|right|PTFE tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive backing]]\n\nThe sole plates of some clothes irons are coated with PTFE (Teflon).<ref>[http://pratique.leparisien.fr/fiches-pratiques/electromenager/repassage/fers-a-repasser-semelle-teflon-1600004600043011#xtref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.fr%252F Fers \u00e0 repasser semelle teflon - Fiche pratique - Le Parisien].

Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant over a wide range of wavelengths, from UV down to near [[infrared]]. In this region, the ratio of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a [[diffuser (optics)|diffuser]] (PTFE sheet) radiates like [[Lambert's cosine law]].

Both the strength and direction of a magnetic field vary with location.  As such, it is described mathematically as a [[vector field]]. That is true.\n\nIn [[electromagnetics]], the term \"magnetic field\" is used for two distinct but closely related fields denoted by the symbols {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}}.

In a [[vacuum]], {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} are the same aside from units; but in a magnetized material, {{math|'''B'''}}/<math>\\mu_0</math> and {{math|'''H'''}} differ by the [[magnetization]] {{math|'''M'''}} of the material at that point in the material.\n\nMagnetic fields are produced by moving [[electric charge]]s and the intrinsic [[magnetic moment]]s of [[elementary particle]]s associated with a fundamental [[quantum mechanics|quantum property]], their [[Spin (physics)|spin]].<ref name=\"Jiles\">{{cite book\n | last = Jiles\n | first = David C.\n | title = Introduction to Magnetism and Magnetic Materials\n | publisher = CRC\n | edition = 2\n | date = 1998\n | pages = 3\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=axyWXjsdorMC&pg=PA3\n | isbn = 978-0412798603\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Feynman\">{{cite book\n | last1 = Feynman\n | first1 = Richard Phillips\n | last2 = Leighton\n | first2 =  Robert B.\n | last3 = Sands\n | first3 =  Matthew\n | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics\n | publisher = California Institute of Technology\n | volume = 2\n | date = 1964\n | pages = 1.7\u20131.8\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uaQfAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22magnetic+field\n | isbn = 978-0465079988\n }}</ref> Magnetic fields and [[electric field]]s are interrelated and are both components of the [[electromagnetic force]], one of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature.\n\nMagnetic fields are widely used throughout modern technology, particularly in [[electrical engineering]] and [[electromechanics]]. Rotating magnetic fields are used in both [[electric motor]]s and [[electric generator|generators]]. The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is studied in the discipline of [[magnetic circuit]]s. Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the [[Hall effect]]. The Earth produces [[Earth's magnetic field|its own magnetic field]], which shields the Earth's ozone layer from the [[solar wind]] and is important in [[navigation]] using a [[compass]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of electromagnetic theory}}\n[[Image:Descartes magnetic field.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the first drawings of a magnetic field, by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], 1644, showing the Earth attracting lodestones.  It illustrated his theory that magnetism was caused by the circulation of tiny helical particles, \"threaded parts\", through threaded pores in magnets.]]\nAlthough magnets and magnetism were studied much earlier, the research of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar [[Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt]] mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles.<ref group=\"nb\">His ''Epistola Petri Peregrini de Maricourt ad Sygerum de Foucaucourt Militem de Magnete'', which is often shortened to ''Epistola de magnete'', is dated 1269 C.E.</ref> Noting that the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points \"poles\" in analogy to Earth's poles. He also clearly articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.\n\nAlmost three centuries later, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] of [[Colchester]] replicated Petrus Peregrinus's work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=34}}</ref> Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, ''[[De Magnete]]'', helped to establish magnetism as a science.\n\nIn 1750, [[John Michell]] stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in accordance with an [[inverse square law]].<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=56}}</ref> [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that the north and south poles cannot be separated.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=59}}</ref> Building on this force between poles, [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] (1781\u20131840) created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=64}}</ref> In this model, a magnetic {{math|'''H'''}}-field is produced by \"magnetic poles\" and magnetism is due to small pairs of north/south magnetic poles.\n\n[[File:\u00d8rsted - ger, 1854 - 682714 F.tif|thumb|[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]], ''Der Geist in der Natur'', 1854]]\nThree discoveries in 1820 challenged this foundation of magnetism, though.

In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=88}}</ref> and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model.<ref group=\"nb\">\n\nFrom the outside, the field of a dipole of magnetic charge has exactly the same form as a current loop when both are sufficiently small. Therefore, the two models differ only for magnetism inside magnetic material.</ref> This has the additional benefit of explaining why magnetic charge can not be isolated. Further, Amp\u00e8re derived both [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]] describing the force between two currents and [[Amp\u00e8re's law]], which, like the Biot\u2013Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Amp\u00e8re introduced the term [[electrodynamics]] to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.\n\nIn 1831, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field. He described this phenomenon in what is known as [[Faraday's law of induction]]. Later, [[Franz Ernst Neumann]] proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Amp\u00e8re's force law.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=222}}</ref> In the process, he introduced the [[magnetic vector potential]], which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.\n\nIn 1850, [[Lord Kelvin]], then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}. The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Amp\u00e8re's model and induction.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=244}}</ref> Further, he derived how {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} relate to each other.\n\nThe reason the letters {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} are used for the two magnetic fields has been a source of some debate among science historians. Most agree that Kelvin avoided {{math|'''M'''}} to prevent confusion with the SI fundamental unit of length, the [[Metre]], abbreviated \"m\". Others believe the choices were purely random.<ref>Kelvin (1900). \"Kabinett physikalischer Rarit\u00e4ten.\" Page 200</ref><ref>[http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/did/Physik/Schulservice/Physikerkalender/06_26_Lord-Kelvin-of-Largs.pdf Lord Kelvin of Largs]. physik.uni-augsburg.de. 26 June 1824</ref>\n\nBetween 1861 and 1865, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed and published [[Maxwell's equations]], which explained and united all of [[classical theory|classical]] electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled ''[[:Commons:File:On Physical Lines of Force.pdf|On Physical Lines of Force]]'' in 1861. These equations were valid although incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]'' and demonstrated the fact that light is an [[electromagnetic wave]]. [[Heinrich Hertz]] experimentally confirmed this fact in 1887.\n\nThe twentieth century extended electrodynamics to include relativity and quantum mechanics. [[Albert Einstein]], in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. (See [[moving magnet and conductor problem]] for details about the [[thought experiment]] that eventually helped Albert Einstein to develop [[special relativity]].) Finally, the emergent field of [[quantum mechanics]] was merged with electrodynamics to form [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).\n\n==Definitions, units, and measurement== <!-- note that [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] links here -->\n\n[[File:VFPt magnets BHM.svg|thumb|Comparison of {{math|'''B'''}}, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''M'''}} inside and outside a cylindrical bar magnet.]]\n\n=== The B-field ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n!Alternative names for '''B'''<ref name=Electromagnetics>E.

Important classes of magnetometers include using [[Search coil|induction magnetometers]] (or search-coil magnetometers) which measure only varying magnetic fields, [[Magnetometer#Rotating coil magnetometer|rotating coil magnetometers]], [[Hall effect]] magnetometers, [[proton magnetometer|NMR magnetometers]], [[SQUID|SQUID magnetometers]], and [[Magnetometer#Fluxgate magnetometer|fluxgate magnetometers]]. The magnetic fields of distant [[astronomical object]]s are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce [[synchrotron radiation]] that is detectable in [[radio waves]].\n\n==Magnetic field lines{{anchor|Magnetic field line}}==\n{{Main|Field line}}\n\n[[Image:Magnet0873.png|thumb|right|The direction of magnetic [[field line]]s represented by [[iron filings]] sprinkled on paper placed above a bar magnet.]]\n[[Image:Magnetic field near pole.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|right|[[Compass]] needles point in the direction of the local magnetic field, towards a magnet's south pole and away from its north pole.]]\nMapping the magnetic field of an object is simple in principle. First, measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of locations (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an arrow (called a [[vector (geometry)|vector]]) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.\n\nAn alternative method to map the magnetic field is to \"connect\" the arrows to form magnetic ''field lines''. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength. Magnetic field lines are like [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] in [[Fluid dynamics|fluid flow]], in that they represent something continuous, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines.\n\nAn advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the \"number\" of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly \"translated\" to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the [[surface integral]] of the magnetic field.<ref>Purcell, p237</ref>\n\nVarious phenomena \"display\" magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field form lines that correspond to \"field lines\".<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex07\">The use of iron filings to display a field presents something of an exception to this picture; the filings alter the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the \"lines\" of iron, because of the large [[magnetic permeability|permeability]] of iron relative to air.</ref> Magnetic field \"lines\" are also visually displayed in [[Aurora (astronomy)|polar auroras]], in which [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.\n\nField lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In [[ferromagnetic]] substances like [[iron]] and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a [[Maxwell stress tensor|tension]], (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. \"Unlike\" poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; \"like\" poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other. The rigorous form of this concept is the [[electromagnetic stress\u2013energy tensor]].\n\n==Magnetic field and permanent magnets==\n{{Main|Magnet}}\n\n''Permanent magnets'' are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials, such as iron and [[nickel]], that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.\n\n===Magnetic field of permanent magnets===\n{{Main|Magnetic moment|Magnetic moment#Models|l2=Two definitions of moment}}\n\nThe magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex05\">Here, \"small\" means that the observer is sufficiently far away that it can be treated as being infinitesimally small. \"Larger\" magnets need to include more complicated terms in the expression and depend on the entire geometry of the magnet not just {{math|'''m'''}}.</ref> straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's ''strength'' (called its [[magnetic dipole moment]] {{math|'''m'''}}). The [[Dipole#Field of a static magnetic dipole|equations]] are non-trivial and also depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, {{math|'''m'''}} points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its {{math|'''m'''}} by 180 degrees.\n\nThe magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modeling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called [[dipole]]s each having their own {{math|'''m'''}}. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles; any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.\n\nThere are two competing models for the nature of these dipoles. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}. Outside a material, though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials.\n\n===Magnetic pole model and the H-field===\n[[Image:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|200px|upright|The magnetic pole model: two opposing poles, North (+) and South (\u2212), separated by a distance d produce a {{math|'''H'''}}-field (lines).]]\nIt is sometimes useful to model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the [[Coulomb force]] between electric charges. In this model, a magnetic {{math|'''H'''}}-field is produced by fictitious ''magnetic charges'' that are spread over the surface of each pole. These ''magnetic charges'' are in fact related to the magnetization field {{math|'''M'''}}.\n\nThe {{math|'''H'''}}-field, therefore, is analogous to the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}}, which starts at a positive [[electric charge]] and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all {{math|'''H'''}}-field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole all {{math|'''H'''}}-field lines point toward the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out). Too, a north pole feels a force in the direction of the {{math|'''H'''}}-field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the {{math|'''H'''}}-field.\n\nIn the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole {{math|'''m'''}} is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength {{math|''q''{{sub|m}}}} separated by a small distance vector {{math|'''d'''}}, such that {{math|1='''m''' = ''q''{{sub|m}}&thinsp;'''d'''}}. The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field {{math|'''H'''}} both inside and outside magnetic materials, in particular the fact that  {{math|'''H'''}} is opposite to the magnetization field {{math|'''M'''}} inside a permanent magnet.\n\nSince it is based on the fictitious idea of a ''magnetic charge density'', the pole model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north/south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents.\n\n===Amperian loop model and the B-field===\n{{see also|Gauss's law for magnetism}}\n\n[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|The Amperian loop model: A current loop (ring) that goes into the page at the x and comes out at the dot produces a {{math|'''B'''}}-field (lines). The north pole is to the right and the south to the left.]]\n\nAfter \u00d8rsted discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field and Ampere discovered that electric currents attracted and repelled each other similar to magnets, it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due to electric current loops. In this model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is {{math|1=''m'' = ''IA''}} where {{math|''A''}} is the area of the loop.\n\nThese magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field. One important property of the {{math|'''B'''}}-field produced this way is that magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field lines neither start nor end (mathematically, {{math|'''B'''}} is a [[solenoidal vector field]]); a field line either extends to infinity or wraps around to form a closed curve.<ref group=\"nb\">Magnetic field lines may also wrap around and around without closing but also without ending.</ref> To date, no exception to this rule has been found. (See [[#Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)|magnetic monopole]] below.) Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet {{math|'''B'''}}-field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex08\">To see that this must be true imagine placing a compass inside a magnet. There, the north pole of the compass points toward the north pole of the magnet since magnets stacked on each other point in the same direction.</ref> If a {{math|'''B'''}}-field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point. Magnetic poles, therefore, always come in N and S pairs.\n\nMore formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the \"number\"<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex09\">As discussed above, magnetic field lines are primarily a conceptual tool used to represent the mathematics behind magnetic fields. The total \"number\" of field lines is dependent on how the field lines are drawn. In practice, integral equations such as the one that follows in the main text are used instead.</ref> of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\n\n:{{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>{\\scriptstyle S}</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\mathbf{B} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} = 0,</math>\n}}\n\nwhere the integral is a [[surface integral]] over the [[closed surface]] {{math|''S''}} (a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape). Since {{math|d'''A'''}} points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for {{math|'''B'''}}-field pointing out and negative for {{math|'''B'''}}-field pointing in.\n\nThere is also a corresponding differential form of this equation covered in [[#Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]] below.\n\n===Force between magnets===\n{{Main|Force between magnets}}\n\nThe [[magnetic moment#Forces between two magnetic dipoles|force between two small magnets]] is quite complicated and depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and the distance and direction of the magnets relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex04\">Either {{math|'''B'''}} or {{math|'''H'''}} may be used for the magnetic field outside the magnet.</ref> of the other.\n\nTo understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the ''magnetic pole model'' given above. In this model, the ''{{math|'''H'''}}-field'' of one magnet pushes and pulls on ''both'' poles of a second magnet. If this {{math|'''H'''}}-field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is ''nonuniform'' (such as the {{math|'''H'''}} near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.\n\nThis is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.\n\nThe details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled into regions of higher magnetic field.\nMathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} due to a magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}} is:<ref name=Trigg>\n\nSee Eq. 11.42 in {{cite book |title=AIP physics desk reference |author1=E.

The [[dot product]] {{math|1='''m''' \u00b7 '''B''' = ''mB''cos(''\u03b8'')}}, where {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''B''}} represent the [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] of the {{math|'''m'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} vectors and {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the angle between them. If {{math|'''m'''}} is in the same direction as {{math|'''B'''}} then the dot product is positive and the gradient points \"uphill\" pulling the magnet into regions of higher {{math|'''B'''}}-field (more strictly larger {{math|'''m''' \u00b7 '''B'''}}). This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own {{math|'''m'''}} then [[Integral|summing up the forces on each of these very small regions]].\n\n===Magnetic torque on permanent magnets===\n{{Main|Magnetic torque}}\nIf two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a ''magnetic torque'' on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque {{math|'''\u03c4'''}} tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field.\n\nMagnetic torque is used to drive [[electric motor]]s. In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of [[electromagnet]]s. By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft. See [[#Rotating magnetic fields|Rotating magnetic fields]] below.\n\n[[Image:Dipole in uniform H field.svg|thumb|left|'''torque on a dipole''': An {{math|'''H'''}} field (to right) causes equal but opposite forces on a N pole ({{math|+''q''}}) and a S pole ({{math|\u2212''q''}}) creating a torque.]]As is the case for the force between magnets, the magnetic pole model leads more readily to the correct equation. Here, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same {{math|'''H'''}} also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force) between them. With the definition of {{math|'''m'''}} as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to {{math|1=''\u03c4'' = ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>''mH''sin''\u03b8''}}, where {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}} is a constant called the [[vacuum permeability]], measuring {{val|4|end= \u03c0|e=-7}} [[Volt|V]]\u00b7[[Second|s]]/([[Ampere|A]]\u00b7[[meter|m]]) and {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the angle between {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''m'''}}.\n\nThe Amperian loop model also predicts the same magnetic torque. Here, it is the {{math|'''B'''}} field interacting with the Amperian current loop through a Lorentz force described below. Again, the results are the same although the models are completely different.\n\n[[Image:cross parallelogram.png|thumb|'''Cross product''': {{math|1=<nowiki>|</nowiki>'''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''<nowiki>|</nowiki> = ''a b'' sin\u03b8}}.]]\nMathematically, the torque {{math|'''\u03c4'''}} on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} of the magnet:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}=\\mathbf{m}\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0\\mathbf{m}\\times\\mathbf{H}, \\,</math>\n\nwhere \u00d7 represents the vector [[cross product]]. This equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if {{math|'''m'''}} is in the same direction as the magnetic field. (The cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction.) Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.\n\n==Magnetic field and electric currents==\nCurrents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B-fields.\n\n===Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents===\n{{Main|Electromagnet|Biot\u2013Savart law|Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|l3=Amp\u00e8re's law}}\n[[Image:Manoderecha.svg|thumb|right|[[Right hand grip rule]]: a current flowing in the direction of the white arrow produces a magnetic field shown by the red arrows.]]\n\nAll moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving [[point particle|point]] charges, such as [[electron]]s, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|p=438}}</ref>\n\nMagnetic field lines form in [[concentric]] circles around a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the \"[[right-hand grip rule]]\" (see figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is inversely proportional to the distance.)\n[[Image:Solenoid-1 (vertical).png|50 px|thumb|left|[[Solenoid]]]]\n\nBending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or \"[[solenoid]]\" enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron [[Magnetic core|core]] may act as an ''electromagnet'', generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil.\n\nThe magnetic field generated by a steady current {{math|I}} (a constant flow of electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at any point){{refn|group=\"nb\" |name=\"ex12\"|In practice, the Biot\u2013Savart law and other laws of magnetostatics are often used even when a current change in time, as long as it does not change too quickly.

This force is known as the ''Lorentz force'', and is given by\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{E} + q \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B},</math>\nwhere\n{{math|'''F'''}} is the [[force]], {{math|''q''}} is the [[electric charge]] of the particle, {{math|'''v'''}} is the instantaneous [[velocity]] of the particle, and {{math|'''B'''}} is the magnetic field (in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]]).\n\nThe Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no [[mechanical work|work]] on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary [[magnetic dipole]], or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect<ref name=Deissler>\n{{cite journal\n |author=Deissler, R.J.\n |year=2008\n |title=Dipole in a magnetic field, work, and quantum spin\n |url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/deissler/PhysRevE_77_036609.pdf\n |journal=[[Physical Review E]]\n |volume=77 |issue=3, pt 2\n |page=036609\n |pmid=18517545\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.77.036609\n|bibcode = 2008PhRvE..77c6609D }}</ref> because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.\n\n====Force on current-carrying wire====\n{{Main|Laplace force}}\n\nThe force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a current carrying wire is a collection of moving charges. A current-carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the ''Laplace force''.\nConsider a conductor of length {{math|''\u2113''}}, cross section {{math|''A''}}, and charge {{math|''q''}} due to electric current {{math|''i''}}.

Because of the action of the strong Lorentz force the elliptical orbit is deformed into double 8-shape orbit which symmetry axis additionally rotates slowly around the positively charged nucleus.]]\n\n====Direction of force====\n{{See also|Right-hand rule}}\n\nThe direction of force on a charge or a current can be determined by a [[mnemonic]] known as the ''right-hand rule'' (see the figure). Using the right hand, pointing the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same current.) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field ''can'' distinguish between these, see [[#Hall effect|Hall effect]] below.\n\nAn alternative mnemonic to the right hand rule is [[Fleming's left-hand rule for motors|Fleming's left-hand rule]].\n\n==Relation between H and B==\nThe formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own [[bound current]], which can be a challenge to calculate. (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material.) The {{math|'''H'''}}-field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of ''magnetization'' first.\n\n===Magnetization===\n{{Main|Magnetization}}\n\nThe ''magnetization'' vector field {{math|'''M'''}} represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net [[magnetic dipole moment]] per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A&sdot;m<sup>2</sup>, the SI unit of magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} is ampere per meter, identical to that of the {{math|'''H'''}}-field.\n\nThe magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside the magnet.)\n\nIn the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called ''[[bound current]]''. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field due to the magnet. (See [[#Magnetic dipoles|Magnetic dipoles]] below and [[Magnet#Two models for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents|magnetic poles vs. atomic currents]] for more information.) Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law:<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|pp=266&ndash;268}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\oint \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = I_\\mathrm{b},</math>\n\nwhere the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and {{math|''I''<sub>b</sub>}} is the bound current enclosed by that closed loop.\n\nIn the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive \"magnetic pole strength\" (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\n\n:<math>\\oint_S \\mu_0 \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A} = -q_\\mathrm{M}</math>,\n\nwhere the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''q''<sub>M</sub>}} is the \"magnetic charge\" (in units of [[magnetic flux]]) enclosed by {{math|''S''}}. (A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.\n\n===H-field and magnetic materials===\n{{see also| demagnetizing field}}\nIn SI units, the H-field is related to the B-field by\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}\\  \\equiv \\ \\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\mathbf{M}.</math>\n\nIn terms of the H-field, Ampere's law is\n:<math>\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = \\oint \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\mathbf{M}\\right) \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = I_\\mathrm{tot} - I_\\mathrm{b} = I_\\mathrm{f},</math>\nwhere {{math|I<sub>f</sub>}} represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of {{math|'''H'''}} does not depend at all on the bound currents.<ref name=Slater>{{cite book |title=Electromagnetism |author1=John Clarke Slater |author2=Nathaniel Herman Frank |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GYsphnFwUuUC&pg=PA69 |page=69 |isbn=978-0-486-62263-7 |year=1969 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |edition=first published in 1947 }}</ref>\n\nFor the differential equivalent of this equation see [[#Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]].

They also are highly magnetic and can be perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field. Superconductors often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields (the so-named [[Type II superconductor#Mixed state|mixed state]]) under which they exhibit a complex hysteretic dependence of {{math|'''M'''}} on {{math|'''B'''}}.\n\nIn the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that:\n:<math>\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bc''}} is a material dependent parameter called the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]]. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank [[tensor]] so that {{math|'''H'''}} may not point in the same direction as {{math|'''B'''}}. These relations between {{math|'''B'''}}  and {{math|'''H'''}} are examples of [[constitutive equation]]s. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex {{math|'''B'''}}-to-{{math|'''H'''}} relation; see [[hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|magnetic hysteresis]].\n\n==Energy stored in magnetic fields==\n{{Main|Magnetic energy}}\n{{see also|Hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|l1=Magnetic hysteresis}}\n\nEnergy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials, this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that the energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.\n\nFor linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that {{math|1='''B''' = ''\u03bc'''''H'''}} where {{math|''\u03bc''}} is frequency-independent), the [[energy density]] is:\n\n:<math> u = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}}{2}= \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}}{2\\mu} = \\frac{\\mu\\mathbf{H}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}}{2}.</math>\n\nIf there are no magnetic materials around then {{math|''\u03bc''}} can be replaced by {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}}. The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used.\n\nIn general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume {{math|''\u03b4W''}} needed to cause a small change of magnetic field {{math|''\u03b4'''''B'''}} is:\n\n:<math>\\delta W = \\mathbf{H}\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{B}.</math>\n\nOnce the relationship between {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For [[Hysteresis|hysteretic materials]] such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.\n\n==Electromagnetism: the relationship between magnetic and electric fields==\n{{Main|Electromagnetism}}\n\n===Faraday's Law: Electric force due to a changing B-field===\n{{Main|Faraday's law of induction|Magnetic flux|l1=Faraday's law}}\n\nA changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an [[electric field]] (and therefore tends to drive a current in such a coil). This is known as ''Faraday's law'' and forms the basis of many [[electrical generator]]s and [[electric motor]]s.\n\nMathematically, Faraday's law is:\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi}{\\mathrm{d}t},</math>\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathcal{E}</math> is the [[electromotive force]] (or ''EMF'', the [[voltage]] generated around a closed loop) and {{math|\u03a6}} is the ''magnetic flux''\u2014the product of the area times the magnetic field [[Tangential and normal components|normal]] to that area.  (This definition of magnetic flux is why {{math|'''B'''}} is often referred to as ''magnetic flux density''.)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=John David|title=Classical electrodynamics|date=1975|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471431329|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/classicalelectro00jack_0}}</ref>{{rp|210}}\n\nThe negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that ''opposes'' the ''change'' in the magnetic field that induced it.

The first integral calculates the work done moving a charge a distance {{math|d'''\u2113'''}} based upon the Lorentz force law. In the case where the bounding surface is stationary, the [[Kelvin\u2013Stokes theorem]] can be used to show this equation is equivalent to the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation.\n\n</ref> into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions. This form is covered as one of Maxwell's equations below.\n\n===Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's Law: The magnetic field due to a changing electric field===\n{{Main|Amp\u00e8re's circuital law#Extending the original law: the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation|l1=Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's law}}\nSimilar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as ''Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's law'' and is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)\n\nThe full law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used.\n\nThe Maxwell term ''is'' critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's Law together with Faraday's law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form [[electromagnetic waves]], such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.\n\n===Maxwell's equations===\n{{Main|Maxwell's equations}}\n\nLike all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its ''sources''.  (For {{math|'''B'''}} the ''sources'' are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up ''Maxwell's Equations''. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of [[Classical electromagnetism|classical electrodynamics]] including both electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe first property is the [[divergence]] of a vector field {{math|'''A'''}}, {{math|'''\u2207''' \u00b7 '''A'''}}, which represents how {{math|'''A'''}} \"flows\" outward from a given point. As discussed above, a {{math|'''B'''}}-field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of {{math|'''B'''}} is zero. (Such vector fields are called [[solenoidal vector field]]s.) This property is called [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or [[magnetic monopole]]s. The electric field on the other hand begins and ends at electric charges so that its divergence is non-zero and proportional to the [[charge density]] (See [[Gauss's law]]).\n\nThe second mathematical property is called the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]], such that {{math|'''\u2207''' \u00d7 '''A'''}} represents how {{math|'''A'''}} curls or \"circulates\" around a given point. The result of the curl is called a \"circulation source\". The equations for the curl of {{math|'''B'''}} and of {{math|'''E'''}} are called the [[Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell equation]] and [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] respectively. They represent the differential forms of the integral equations given above.\n\nThe complete set of Maxwell's equations then are:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &=  0, \\\\\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} &=  \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} &=  \\mu_0\\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}} {\\partial t}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''J'''}} = complete microscopic [[current density]] and {{math|''\u03c1''}} is the charge density.\n\nAs discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric {{math|'''E'''}} field and an applied magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field by producing their own internal \"bound\" charge and current distributions that contribute to {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''D'''}} fields are used to re-factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the ''free current density'' {{math|'''J'''<sub>f</sub>}} and ''free charge density'' {{math|''\u03c1''<sub>f</sub>}}:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &=  0, \\\\\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} &=  \\rho_\\mathrm{f}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} &=  \\mathbf{J}_\\mathrm{f} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}} {\\partial t}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the \"bound\" charges and currents in the material are known). They also must be supplemented by the relationship between {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} as well as that between {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''D'''}}. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.\n\n===Electric and magnetic fields: different aspects of the same phenomenon===\n{{Main|Relativistic electromagnetism}}\n\nAccording to [[special relativity|the special theory of relativity]], the partition of the [[electromagnetic force]] into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the [[Frame of reference#Observational frames of reference|observational frame of reference]]: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.\n\nFormally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 [[tensor]], called the ''[[electromagnetic tensor]]''. Changing reference frames ''mixes'' these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity ''mixes'' space and time into [[spacetime]], and mass, momentum, and energy into [[four-momentum]].<ref>C. Doran and A.

In this representation, the ''[[magnetic vector potential]]'' {{math|'''A'''}}, and the [[electric potential|electric scalar potential]] {{math|''\u03c6''}}, are defined such that:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{B} &=  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}, \\\\\n  \\mathbf{E} &= -\\nabla \\varphi - \\frac{ \\partial \\mathbf{A} }{ \\partial t }.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe vector potential {{math|'''A'''}} may be interpreted as a ''generalized potential [[momentum]] per unit charge''<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=E.

The most accurate modern description of the electromagnetic interaction (and much else) is ''quantum electrodynamics'' (QED),<ref>\nFor a good qualitative introduction see:\n{{Cite book|author=Richard Feynman|authorlink=Richard Feynman|title=QED: the strange theory of light and matter|year=2006|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-12575-6|title-link=QED (book)}}\n</ref> which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the ''Standard Model of particle physics''.\n\nIn QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles (and their [[antiparticle]]s) is computed using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. These rather complex formulas produce a remarkable pictorial representation as [[Feynman diagram]]s in which [[virtual photon]]s are exchanged.\n\nPredictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of accuracy: currently about 10<sup>&minus;12</sup> (and limited by experimental errors); for details see [[precision tests of QED]]. This makes QED one of the most accurate physical theories constructed thus far.\n\nAll equations in this article are in the [[classical electromagnetism|classical approximation]], which is less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here.

''[[Scientific American]]''; Page 36.</ref> See [[orders of magnitude (magnetic field)]].\n\n===Rotating magnetic fields===\n{{Main|Rotating magnetic field|Alternator}}\n\nThe ''rotating magnetic field'' is a key principle in the operation of [[electric motor#AC motors|alternating-current motors]]. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was conceptualized by [[Nikola Tesla]], and later utilized in his and others' early AC ([[alternating current]]) electric motors.\n\nA rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents.\n\nThis inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world's [[electrical power]] supply systems.\n\n[[Synchronous motor]]s use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlled\u2014and [[induction motor]]s use short-circuited [[Rotor (electric)|rotors]] (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled [[stator]]. The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop [[eddy current]]s in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force.\n\nIn 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field. In 1885, [[Galileo Ferraris]] independently researched the concept. In 1888, Tesla gained {{US patent|381968}} for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the ''Royal Academy of Sciences'' in [[Turin]].\n\n===Hall effect===\n{{Main|Hall effect}}\n\nThe charge carriers of a current-carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the ''Hall effect''.\n\nThe ''Hall effect'' is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).\n\n===Magnetic circuits===\n{{Main|Magnetic circuit}}\nAn important use of {{math|'''H'''}} is in ''magnetic circuits'' where {{math|1='''B''' = ''\u03bc'''''H'''}} inside a linear material. Here, {{math|''\u03bc''}} is the [[magnetic permeability]] of the material. This result is similar in form to [[Ohm's law]] {{math|'''J''' {{=}} ''\u03c3'''''E'''}}, where {{math|'''J'''}} is the current density, {{math|''\u03c3''}} is the conductance and {{math|'''E'''}} is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law ({{math|1=''I'' = ''V''\u2044''R''}}) is:\n\n:<math>\\Phi = \\frac F R_\\mathrm{m},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi = \\int \\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A}</math> is the magnetic flux in the circuit, <math>F = \\int \\mathbf{H}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}</math> is the [[magnetomotive force]] applied to the circuit, and {{math|''R''<sub>m</sub>}} is the [[reluctance]] of the circuit. Here the reluctance {{math|''R''<sub>m</sub>}} is a quantity similar in nature to [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] for the flux.\n\nUsing this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of [[circuit theory]].\n\n===Magnetic field shape descriptions===\n[[Image:Magnetic quadrupole moment.svg|right|thumb|Schematic [[quadrupole magnet]] (\"''four-pole''\") magnetic field.

From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current {{math|''I''}} and an area {{math|''a''}}. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of:\n\n:<math>m=Ia, \\,</math>\n\nwhere the direction of {{math|'''m'''}} is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area {{math|''a''}} has been reduced to zero and its current {{math|''I''}} increased to infinity such that the product {{math|1=''m'' = ''Ia''}} is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the [[Einstein\u2013de Haas effect]] ''rotation by magnetization'' and its inverse, the [[Barnett effect]] or ''magnetization by rotation''.<ref name=Graham>See [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic dipoles|magnetic moment]] and {{cite book |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |author1=B.

This model produces an {{math|'''H'''}}-field not a {{math|'''B'''}}-field. Such a model is deficient, though, both in that there are no magnetic charges and in that it obscures the link between electricity and magnetism. Further, as discussed above it fails to explain the inherent connection between [[angular momentum]] and magnetism.\n\n===Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)===\n{{Main|Magnetic monopole}}\n\nA ''magnetic monopole'' is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that has, as its name suggests, only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a \"magnetic charge\" analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end.\n\nModern interest in this concept stems from [[high-energy physics|particle theories]], notably [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified Theories]] and [[superstring theory|superstring theories]], that predict either the existence, or the possibility, of magnetic monopoles. These theories and others have inspired extensive efforts to search for monopoles.

A charge that is moving parallel to a current of other charges experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity.<ref>Purcell, Edward. p278. Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd edition, Cambridge University Press, 2013. 839pp.</ref>  The effects of magnetic fields are commonly seen in [[permanent magnet]]s, which pull on [[ferromagnetic material|magnetic materials]] (such as [[iron]]) and attract or repel other magnets. Magnetic fields surround and are created by magnetized material and by moving [[electric charge]]s ([[electric current]]s) such as those used in [[electromagnet]]s.  They exert forces on nearby moving electrical charges and torques on nearby magnets. In addition, a magnetic field that varies with location exerts a force on magnetic materials. Both the strength and direction of a magnetic field vary with location.  As such, it is described mathematically as a [[vector field]].\n\nIn [[electromagnetics]], the term \"magnetic field\" is used for two distinct but closely related fields denoted by the symbols {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}}. In the [[International System of Units]], {{math|'''H'''}}, magnetic field strength, is measured in the SI base units of [[ampere]] per [[meter]].<ref>{{SIbrochure9th}}, p. 22</ref> {{math|'''B'''}}, magnetic flux density, is measured in [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] (in SI base units: kilogram per second<sup>2</sup> per ampere),<ref>{{SIbrochure9th}}, p. 21</ref> which is equivalent to [[newton (unit)|newton]] per meter per ampere. {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} differ in how they account for magnetization. In a [[vacuum]], {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} are the same aside from units; but in a magnetized material, {{math|'''B'''}}/<math>\\mu_0</math> and {{math|'''H'''}} differ by the [[magnetization]] {{math|'''M'''}} of the material at that point in the material.\n\nMagnetic fields are produced by moving [[electric charge]]s and the intrinsic [[magnetic moment]]s of [[elementary particle]]s associated with a fundamental [[quantum mechanics|quantum property]], their [[Spin (physics)|spin]].<ref name=\"Jiles\">{{cite book\n | last = Jiles\n | first = David C.\n | title = Introduction to Magnetism and Magnetic Materials\n | publisher = CRC\n | edition = 2\n | date = 1998\n | pages = 3\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=axyWXjsdorMC&pg=PA3\n | isbn = 978-0412798603\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Feynman\">{{cite book\n | last1 = Feynman\n | first1 = Richard Phillips\n | last2 = Leighton\n | first2 =  Robert B.\n | last3 = Sands\n | first3 =  Matthew\n | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics\n | publisher = California Institute of Technology\n | volume = 2\n | date = 1964\n | pages = 1.7\u20131.8\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uaQfAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22magnetic+field\n | isbn = 978-0465079988\n }}</ref> Magnetic fields and [[electric field]]s are interrelated and are both components of the [[electromagnetic force]], one of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature.\n\nMagnetic fields are widely used throughout modern technology, particularly in [[electrical engineering]] and [[electromechanics]]. Rotating magnetic fields are used in both [[electric motor]]s and [[electric generator|generators]]. The interaction of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is studied in the discipline of [[magnetic circuit]]s. Magnetic forces give information about the charge carriers in a material through the [[Hall effect]]. The Earth produces [[Earth's magnetic field|its own magnetic field]], which shields the Earth's ozone layer from the [[solar wind]] and is important in [[navigation]] using a [[compass]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of electromagnetic theory}}\n[[Image:Descartes magnetic field.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the first drawings of a magnetic field, by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], 1644, showing the Earth attracting lodestones.  It illustrated his theory that magnetism was caused by the circulation of tiny helical particles, \"threaded parts\", through threaded pores in magnets.]]\nAlthough magnets and magnetism were studied much earlier, the research of magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar [[Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt]] mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical magnet using iron needles.<ref group=\"nb\">His ''Epistola Petri Peregrini de Maricourt ad Sygerum de Foucaucourt Militem de Magnete'', which is often shortened to ''Epistola de magnete'', is dated 1269 C.E.</ref> Noting that the resulting field lines crossed at two points he named those points \"poles\" in analogy to Earth's poles. He also clearly articulated the principle that magnets always have both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.\n\nAlmost three centuries later, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] of [[Colchester]] replicated Petrus Peregrinus's work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is a magnet.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=34}}</ref> Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, ''[[De Magnete]]'', helped to establish magnetism as a science.\n\nIn 1750, [[John Michell]] stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in accordance with an [[inverse square law]].<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=56}}</ref> [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that the north and south poles cannot be separated.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=59}}</ref> Building on this force between poles, [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] (1781\u20131840) created the first successful model of the magnetic field, which he presented in 1824.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=64}}</ref> In this model, a magnetic {{math|'''H'''}}-field is produced by \"magnetic poles\" and magnetism is due to small pairs of north/south magnetic poles.\n\n[[File:\u00d8rsted - ger, 1854 - 682714 F.tif|thumb|[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]], ''Der Geist in der Natur'', 1854]]\nThree discoveries in 1820 challenged this foundation of magnetism, though.

In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents to magnets<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=88}}</ref> and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model.<ref group=\"nb\">\n\nFrom the outside, the field of a dipole of magnetic charge has exactly the same form as a current loop when both are sufficiently small. Therefore, the two models differ only for magnetism inside magnetic material.</ref> This has the additional benefit of explaining why magnetic charge can not be isolated. Further, Amp\u00e8re derived both [[Amp\u00e8re's force law]] describing the force between two currents and [[Amp\u00e8re's law]], which, like the Biot\u2013Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a steady current. Also in this work, Amp\u00e8re introduced the term [[electrodynamics]] to describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.\n\nIn 1831, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered electromagnetic induction when he found that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field. He described this phenomenon in what is known as [[Faraday's law of induction]]. Later, [[Franz Ernst Neumann]] proved that, for a moving conductor in a magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Amp\u00e8re's force law.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=222}}</ref> In the process, he introduced the [[magnetic vector potential]], which was later shown to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.\n\nIn 1850, [[Lord Kelvin]], then known as William Thomson, distinguished between two magnetic fields now denoted {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}. The former applied to Poisson's model and the latter to Amp\u00e8re's model and induction.<ref>{{harvnb|Whittaker|1951|p=244}}</ref> Further, he derived how {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} relate to each other.\n\nThe reason the letters {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} are used for the two magnetic fields has been a source of some debate among science historians. Most agree that Kelvin avoided {{math|'''M'''}} to prevent confusion with the SI fundamental unit of length, the [[Metre]], abbreviated \"m\". Others believe the choices were purely random.<ref>Kelvin (1900). \"Kabinett physikalischer Rarit\u00e4ten.\" Page 200</ref><ref>[http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/did/Physik/Schulservice/Physikerkalender/06_26_Lord-Kelvin-of-Largs.pdf Lord Kelvin of Largs]. physik.uni-augsburg.de. 26 June 1824</ref>\n\nBetween 1861 and 1865, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed and published [[Maxwell's equations]], which explained and united all of [[classical theory|classical]] electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published in a paper entitled ''[[:Commons:File:On Physical Lines of Force.pdf|On Physical Lines of Force]]'' in 1861. These equations were valid although incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in his later 1865 paper ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]'' and demonstrated the fact that light is an [[electromagnetic wave]]. [[Heinrich Hertz]] experimentally confirmed this fact in 1887.\n\nThe twentieth century extended electrodynamics to include relativity and quantum mechanics. [[Albert Einstein]], in his paper of 1905 that established relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. (See [[moving magnet and conductor problem]] for details about the [[thought experiment]] that eventually helped Albert Einstein to develop [[special relativity]].) Finally, the emergent field of [[quantum mechanics]] was merged with electrodynamics to form [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).\n\n==Definitions, units, and measurement== <!-- note that [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] links here -->\n\n[[File:VFPt magnets BHM.svg|thumb|Comparison of {{math|'''B'''}}, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''M'''}} inside and outside a cylindrical bar magnet.]]\n\n=== The B-field ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n!Alternative names for '''B'''<ref name=Electromagnetics>E.

Important classes of magnetometers include using [[Search coil|induction magnetometers]] (or search-coil magnetometers) which measure only varying magnetic fields, [[Magnetometer#Rotating coil magnetometer|rotating coil magnetometers]], [[Hall effect]] magnetometers, [[proton magnetometer|NMR magnetometers]], [[SQUID|SQUID magnetometers]], and [[Magnetometer#Fluxgate magnetometer|fluxgate magnetometers]]. The magnetic fields of distant [[astronomical object]]s are measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance, electrons spiraling around a field line produce [[synchrotron radiation]] that is detectable in [[radio waves]].\n\n==Magnetic field lines{{anchor|Magnetic field line}}==\n{{Main|Field line}}\n\n[[Image:Magnet0873.png|thumb|right|The direction of magnetic [[field line]]s represented by [[iron filings]] sprinkled on paper placed above a bar magnet.]]\n[[Image:Magnetic field near pole.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|right|[[Compass]] needles point in the direction of the local magnetic field, towards a magnet's south pole and away from its north pole.]]\nMapping the magnetic field of an object is simple in principle. First, measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number of locations (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an arrow (called a [[vector (geometry)|vector]]) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.\n\nAn alternative method to map the magnetic field is to \"connect\" the arrows to form magnetic ''field lines''. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength. Magnetic field lines are like [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] in [[Fluid dynamics|fluid flow]], in that they represent something continuous, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines.\n\nAn advantage of using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the \"number\" of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly \"translated\" to their mathematical form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the [[surface integral]] of the magnetic field.<ref>Purcell, p237</ref>\n\nVarious phenomena \"display\" magnetic field lines as though the field lines were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field form lines that correspond to \"field lines\".<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex07\">The use of iron filings to display a field presents something of an exception to this picture; the filings alter the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the \"lines\" of iron, because of the large [[magnetic permeability|permeability]] of iron relative to air.</ref> Magnetic field \"lines\" are also visually displayed in [[Aurora (astronomy)|polar auroras]], in which [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] particle dipole interactions create visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.\n\nField lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces. In [[ferromagnetic]] substances like [[iron]] and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a [[Maxwell stress tensor|tension]], (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring field lines. \"Unlike\" poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; \"like\" poles repel because their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other. The rigorous form of this concept is the [[electromagnetic stress\u2013energy tensor]].\n\n==Magnetic field and permanent magnets==\n{{Main|Magnet}}\n\n''Permanent magnets'' are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic fields. They are made of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials, such as iron and [[nickel]], that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.\n\n===Magnetic field of permanent magnets===\n{{Main|Magnetic moment|Magnetic moment#Models|l2=Two definitions of moment}}\n\nThe magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated, especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex05\">Here, \"small\" means that the observer is sufficiently far away that it can be treated as being infinitesimally small. \"Larger\" magnets need to include more complicated terms in the expression and depend on the entire geometry of the magnet not just {{math|'''m'''}}.</ref> straight magnet is proportional to the magnet's ''strength'' (called its [[magnetic dipole moment]] {{math|'''m'''}}). The [[Dipole#Field of a static magnetic dipole|equations]] are non-trivial and also depend on the distance from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, {{math|'''m'''}} points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its {{math|'''m'''}} by 180 degrees.\n\nThe magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modeling them as a collection of a large number of small magnets called [[dipole]]s each having their own {{math|'''m'''}}. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net magnetic field of these dipoles; any net force on the magnet is a result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.\n\nThere are two competing models for the nature of these dipoles. These two models produce two different magnetic fields, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}}. Outside a material, though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not generated by magnetic materials.\n\n===Magnetic pole model and the H-field===\n[[Image:VFPt dipole electric.svg|thumb|200px|upright|The magnetic pole model: two opposing poles, North (+) and South (\u2212), separated by a distance d produce a {{math|'''H'''}}-field (lines).]]\nIt is sometimes useful to model the force and torques between two magnets as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same manner as the [[Coulomb force]] between electric charges. In this model, a magnetic {{math|'''H'''}}-field is produced by fictitious ''magnetic charges'' that are spread over the surface of each pole. These ''magnetic charges'' are in fact related to the magnetization field {{math|'''M'''}}.\n\nThe {{math|'''H'''}}-field, therefore, is analogous to the [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}}, which starts at a positive [[electric charge]] and ends at a negative electric charge. Near the north pole, therefore, all {{math|'''H'''}}-field lines point away from the north pole (whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole all {{math|'''H'''}}-field lines point toward the south pole (whether inside the magnet or out). Too, a north pole feels a force in the direction of the {{math|'''H'''}}-field while the force on the south pole is opposite to the {{math|'''H'''}}-field.\n\nIn the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole {{math|'''m'''}} is formed by two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength {{math|''q''{{sub|m}}}} separated by a small distance vector {{math|'''d'''}}, such that {{math|1='''m''' = ''q''{{sub|m}}&thinsp;'''d'''}}. The magnetic pole model predicts correctly the field {{math|'''H'''}} both inside and outside magnetic materials, in particular the fact that  {{math|'''H'''}} is opposite to the magnetization field {{math|'''M'''}} inside a permanent magnet.\n\nSince it is based on the fictitious idea of a ''magnetic charge density'', the pole model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each other as electric charges can, but always come in north/south pairs. If a magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents.\n\n===Amperian loop model and the B-field===\n{{see also|Gauss's law for magnetism}}\n\n[[Image:VFPt dipole magnetic3.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|The Amperian loop model: A current loop (ring) that goes into the page at the x and comes out at the dot produces a {{math|'''B'''}}-field (lines). The north pole is to the right and the south to the left.]]\n\nAfter \u00d8rsted discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field and Ampere discovered that electric currents attracted and repelled each other similar to magnets, it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic fields are due to electric current loops. In this model developed by Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this loop is {{math|1=''m'' = ''IA''}} where {{math|''A''}} is the area of the loop.\n\nThese magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field. One important property of the {{math|'''B'''}}-field produced this way is that magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field lines neither start nor end (mathematically, {{math|'''B'''}} is a [[solenoidal vector field]]); a field line either extends to infinity or wraps around to form a closed curve.<ref group=\"nb\">Magnetic field lines may also wrap around and around without closing but also without ending.</ref> To date, no exception to this rule has been found. (See [[#Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)|magnetic monopole]] below.) Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter near its south pole, but inside the magnet {{math|'''B'''}}-field lines continue through the magnet from the south pole back to the north.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex08\">To see that this must be true imagine placing a compass inside a magnet. There, the north pole of the compass points toward the north pole of the magnet since magnets stacked on each other point in the same direction.</ref> If a {{math|'''B'''}}-field line enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed to have an end point. Magnetic poles, therefore, always come in N and S pairs.\n\nMore formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given region must also leave that region, subtracting the \"number\"<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex09\">As discussed above, magnetic field lines are primarily a conceptual tool used to represent the mathematics behind magnetic fields. The total \"number\" of field lines is dependent on how the field lines are drawn. In practice, integral equations such as the one that follows in the main text are used instead.</ref> of field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\n\n:{{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>{\\scriptstyle S}</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\mathbf{B} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} = 0,</math>\n}}\n\nwhere the integral is a [[surface integral]] over the [[closed surface]] {{math|''S''}} (a closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape). Since {{math|d'''A'''}} points outward, the dot product in the integral is positive for {{math|'''B'''}}-field pointing out and negative for {{math|'''B'''}}-field pointing in.\n\nThere is also a corresponding differential form of this equation covered in [[#Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]] below.\n\n===Force between magnets===\n{{Main|Force between magnets}}\n\nThe [[magnetic moment#Forces between two magnetic dipoles|force between two small magnets]] is quite complicated and depends on the strength and orientation of both magnets and the distance and direction of the magnets relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex04\">Either {{math|'''B'''}} or {{math|'''H'''}} may be used for the magnetic field outside the magnet.</ref> of the other.\n\nTo understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the ''magnetic pole model'' given above. In this model, the ''{{math|'''H'''}}-field'' of one magnet pushes and pulls on ''both'' poles of a second magnet. If this {{math|'''H'''}}-field is the same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the magnetic field of the first magnet is ''nonuniform'' (such as the {{math|'''H'''}} near one of its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a net torque.\n\nThis is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.\n\nThe details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled into regions of higher magnetic field.\nMathematically, the force on a small magnet having a magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} due to a magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}} is:<ref name=Trigg>\n\nSee Eq. 11.42 in {{cite book |title=AIP physics desk reference |author1=E.

The [[dot product]] {{math|1='''m''' \u00b7 '''B''' = ''mB''cos(''\u03b8'')}}, where {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''B''}} represent the [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] of the {{math|'''m'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} vectors and {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the angle between them. If {{math|'''m'''}} is in the same direction as {{math|'''B'''}} then the dot product is positive and the gradient points \"uphill\" pulling the magnet into regions of higher {{math|'''B'''}}-field (more strictly larger {{math|'''m''' \u00b7 '''B'''}}). This equation is strictly only valid for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by dividing them into smaller regions each having their own {{math|'''m'''}} then [[Integral|summing up the forces on each of these very small regions]].\n\n===Magnetic torque on permanent magnets===\n{{Main|Magnetic torque}}\nIf two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary magnet creates a ''magnetic torque'' on the magnet that is free to rotate. This magnetic torque {{math|'''\u03c4'''}} tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic field.\n\nMagnetic torque is used to drive [[electric motor]]s. In one simple motor design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a magnetic field from an array of [[electromagnet]]s. By continuously switching the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft. See [[#Rotating magnetic fields|Rotating magnetic fields]] below.\n\n[[Image:Dipole in uniform H field.svg|thumb|left|'''torque on a dipole''': An {{math|'''H'''}} field (to right) causes equal but opposite forces on a N pole ({{math|+''q''}}) and a S pole ({{math|\u2212''q''}}) creating a torque.]]As is the case for the force between magnets, the magnetic pole model leads more readily to the correct equation. Here, two equal and opposite magnetic charges experiencing the same {{math|'''H'''}} also experience equal and opposite forces. Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force) between them. With the definition of {{math|'''m'''}} as the pole strength times the distance between the poles, this leads to {{math|1=''\u03c4'' = ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>''mH''sin''\u03b8''}}, where {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}} is a constant called the [[vacuum permeability]], measuring {{val|4|end= \u03c0|e=-7}} [[Volt|V]]\u00b7[[Second|s]]/([[Ampere|A]]\u00b7[[meter|m]]) and {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the angle between {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''m'''}}.\n\nThe Amperian loop model also predicts the same magnetic torque. Here, it is the {{math|'''B'''}} field interacting with the Amperian current loop through a Lorentz force described below. Again, the results are the same although the models are completely different.\n\n[[Image:cross parallelogram.png|thumb|'''Cross product''': {{math|1=<nowiki>|</nowiki>'''a''' \u00d7 '''b'''<nowiki>|</nowiki> = ''a b'' sin\u03b8}}.]]\nMathematically, the torque {{math|'''\u03c4'''}} on a small magnet is proportional both to the applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} of the magnet:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}=\\mathbf{m}\\times\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0\\mathbf{m}\\times\\mathbf{H}, \\,</math>\n\nwhere \u00d7 represents the vector [[cross product]]. This equation includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no torque on a magnet if {{math|'''m'''}} is in the same direction as the magnetic field. (The cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction.) Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the direction of magnetic field.\n\n==Magnetic field and electric currents==\nCurrents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a force due to magnetic B-fields.\n\n===Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents===\n{{Main|Electromagnet|Biot\u2013Savart law|Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|l3=Amp\u00e8re's law}}\n[[Image:Manoderecha.svg|thumb|right|[[Right hand grip rule]]: a current flowing in the direction of the white arrow produces a magnetic field shown by the red arrows.]]\n\nAll moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving [[point particle|point]] charges, such as [[electron]]s, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|p=438}}</ref>\n\nMagnetic field lines form in [[concentric]] circles around a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such a magnetic field can be determined by using the \"[[right-hand grip rule]]\" (see figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is inversely proportional to the distance.)\n[[Image:Solenoid-1 (vertical).png|50 px|thumb|left|[[Solenoid]]]]\n\nBending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple closely spaced loops to form a coil or \"[[solenoid]]\" enhances this effect. A device so formed around an iron [[Magnetic core|core]] may act as an ''electromagnet'', generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet, with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through the coil.\n\nThe magnetic field generated by a steady current {{math|I}} (a constant flow of electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at any point){{refn|group=\"nb\" |name=\"ex12\"|In practice, the Biot\u2013Savart law and other laws of magnetostatics are often used even when a current change in time, as long as it does not change too quickly.

This force is known as the ''Lorentz force'', and is given by\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{E} + q \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B},</math>\nwhere\n{{math|'''F'''}} is the [[force]], {{math|''q''}} is the [[electric charge]] of the particle, {{math|'''v'''}} is the instantaneous [[velocity]] of the particle, and {{math|'''B'''}} is the magnetic field (in [[tesla (unit)|teslas]]).\n\nThe Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no [[mechanical work|work]] on an isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary [[magnetic dipole]], or to charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is incorrect<ref name=Deissler>\n{{cite journal\n |author=Deissler, R.J.\n |year=2008\n |title=Dipole in a magnetic field, work, and quantum spin\n |url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/deissler/PhysRevE_77_036609.pdf\n |journal=[[Physical Review E]]\n |volume=77 |issue=3, pt 2\n |page=036609\n |pmid=18517545\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.77.036609\n|bibcode = 2008PhRvE..77c6609D }}</ref> because the work in those cases is performed by the electric forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.\n\n====Force on current-carrying wire====\n{{Main|Laplace force}}\n\nThe force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge as expected since a current carrying wire is a collection of moving charges.

For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same current.) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric field ''can'' distinguish between these, see [[#Hall effect|Hall effect]] below.\n\nAn alternative mnemonic to the right hand rule is [[Fleming's left-hand rule for motors|Fleming's left-hand rule]].\n\n==Relation between H and B==\nThe formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic field, though, generates its own [[bound current]], which can be a challenge to calculate. (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current loops and the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make up the material.) The {{math|'''H'''}}-field as defined above helps factor out this bound current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of ''magnetization'' first.\n\n===Magnetization===\n{{Main|Magnetization}}\n\nThe ''magnetization'' vector field {{math|'''M'''}} represents how strongly a region of material is magnetized. It is defined as the net [[magnetic dipole moment]] per unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment {{math|'''m'''}} of the magnet divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A&sdot;m<sup>2</sup>, the SI unit of magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} is ampere per meter, identical to that of the {{math|'''H'''}}-field.\n\nThe magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} field of a region points in the direction of the average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines, therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside the magnet.)\n\nIn the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny Amperian loops to form a resultant current called ''[[bound current]]''. This bound current, then, is the source of the magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field due to the magnet. (See [[#Magnetic dipoles|Magnetic dipoles]] below and [[Magnet#Two models for magnets: magnetic poles and atomic currents|magnetic poles vs. atomic currents]] for more information.) Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law:<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1999|pp=266&ndash;268}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\oint \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = I_\\mathrm{b},</math>\n\nwhere the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and {{math|''I''<sub>b</sub>}} is the bound current enclosed by that closed loop.\n\nIn the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive \"magnetic pole strength\" (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent to:\n\n:<math>\\oint_S \\mu_0 \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A} = -q_\\mathrm{M}</math>,\n\nwhere the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''q''<sub>M</sub>}} is the \"magnetic charge\" (in units of [[magnetic flux]]) enclosed by {{math|''S''}}. (A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization field moves from south to north.\n\n===H-field and magnetic materials===\n{{see also| demagnetizing field}}\nIn SI units, the H-field is related to the B-field by\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}\\  \\equiv \\ \\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\mathbf{M}.</math>\n\nIn terms of the H-field, Ampere's law is\n:<math>\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = \\oint \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\mathbf{M}\\right) \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = I_\\mathrm{tot} - I_\\mathrm{b} = I_\\mathrm{f},</math>\nwhere {{math|I<sub>f</sub>}} represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the line integral of {{math|'''H'''}} does not depend at all on the bound currents.<ref name=Slater>{{cite book |title=Electromagnetism |author1=John Clarke Slater |author2=Nathaniel Herman Frank |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GYsphnFwUuUC&pg=PA69 |page=69 |isbn=978-0-486-62263-7 |year=1969 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |edition=first published in 1947 }}</ref>\n\nFor the differential equivalent of this equation see [[#Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equations]].

The {{math|'''H'''}} field lines loop only around \"free current\" and, unlike the magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.\n\n===Magnetism===\n{{Main|Magnetism}}\nMost materials respond to an applied {{math|'''B'''}}-field by producing their own magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} and therefore their own {{math|'''B'''}}-fields. Typically, the response is weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term ''magnetism'' describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic [[phase (matter)|phase]] of a material.

They also are highly magnetic and can be perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field. Superconductors often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields (the so-named [[Type II superconductor#Mixed state|mixed state]]) under which they exhibit a complex hysteretic dependence of {{math|'''M'''}} on {{math|'''B'''}}.\n\nIn the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} is often proportional to the applied magnetic field such that:\n:<math>\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H},</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03bc''}} is a material dependent parameter called the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]]. In some cases the permeability may be a second rank [[tensor]] so that {{math|'''H'''}} may not point in the same direction as {{math|'''B'''}}. These relations between {{math|'''B'''}}  and {{math|'''H'''}} are examples of [[constitutive equation]]s. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a more complex {{math|'''B'''}}-to-{{math|'''H'''}} relation; see [[hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|magnetic hysteresis]].\n\n==Energy stored in magnetic fields==\n{{Main|Magnetic energy}}\n{{see also|Hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|l1=Magnetic hysteresis}}\n\nEnergy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive materials, this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed so that the energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.\n\nFor linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that {{math|1='''B''' = ''\u03bc'''''H'''}} where {{math|''\u03bc''}} is frequency-independent), the [[energy density]] is:\n\n:<math> u = \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}}{2}= \\frac{\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}}{2\\mu} = \\frac{\\mu\\mathbf{H}\\cdot\\mathbf{H}}{2}.</math>\n\nIf there are no magnetic materials around then {{math|''\u03bc''}} can be replaced by {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}}. The above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more general expression given below must be used.\n\nIn general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume {{math|''\u03b4W''}} needed to cause a small change of magnetic field {{math|''\u03b4'''''B'''}} is:\n\n:<math>\\delta W = \\mathbf{H}\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{B}.</math>\n\nOnce the relationship between {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} is known this equation is used to determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For [[Hysteresis|hysteretic materials]] such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler energy density equation given above.\n\n==Electromagnetism: the relationship between magnetic and electric fields==\n{{Main|Electromagnetism}}\n\n===Faraday's Law: Electric force due to a changing B-field===\n{{Main|Faraday's law of induction|Magnetic flux|l1=Faraday's law}}\n\nA changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting coil, generates an [[electric field]] (and therefore tends to drive a current in such a coil). This is known as ''Faraday's law'' and forms the basis of many [[electrical generator]]s and [[electric motor]]s.\n\nMathematically, Faraday's law is:\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi}{\\mathrm{d}t},</math>\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathcal{E}</math> is the [[electromotive force]] (or ''EMF'', the [[voltage]] generated around a closed loop) and {{math|\u03a6}} is the ''magnetic flux''\u2014the product of the area times the magnetic field [[Tangential and normal components|normal]] to that area.  (This definition of magnetic flux is why {{math|'''B'''}} is often referred to as ''magnetic flux density''.)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=John David|title=Classical electrodynamics|date=1975|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=9780471431329|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/classicalelectro00jack_0}}</ref>{{rp|210}}\n\nThe negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that ''opposes'' the ''change'' in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known as [[Lenz's law]].\n\nThis integral formulation of Faraday's law can be converted<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex14\">\n\nA complete expression for Faraday's law of induction in terms of the electric {{math|'''E'''}} and magnetic fields can be written as:\n<math>\\textstyle\\mathcal{E} = - d\\Phi/dt </math>&ensp;\n<math>\\textstyle= \\oint_{\\partial \\Sigma (t)}\\left(  \\mathbf{E}( \\mathbf{r},\\ t) +\\mathbf{ v \\times B}(\\mathbf{r},\\ t)\\right) \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{\\ell}\\ </math>&ensp;\n<math>\\textstyle=-\\frac {d} {dt}  \\iint_{\\Sigma (t)} d \\boldsymbol {A} \\cdot \\mathbf {B}(\\mathbf{r},\\ t),</math>\n where {{math|'''\u2202\u03a3'''(''t'')}} is the moving closed path bounding the moving surface {{math|'''\u03a3'''(''t'')}}, and {{math|d'''A'''}} is an element of surface area of {{math|'''\u03a3'''(''t'')}}. The first integral calculates the work done moving a charge a distance {{math|d'''\u2113'''}} based upon the Lorentz force law. In the case where the bounding surface is stationary, the [[Kelvin\u2013Stokes theorem]] can be used to show this equation is equivalent to the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation.\n\n</ref> into a differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions. This form is covered as one of Maxwell's equations below.\n\n===Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's Law: The magnetic field due to a changing electric field===\n{{Main|Amp\u00e8re's circuital law#Extending the original law: the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation|l1=Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's law}}\nSimilar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is known as ''Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's law'' and is applied as an additive term to Ampere's law as given above. This additional term is proportional to the time rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of the electric field.)\n\nThe full law including the correction term is known as the Maxwell\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where the integral form is used.\n\nThe Maxwell term ''is'' critically important in the creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell's correction to Amp\u00e8re's Law together with Faraday's law of induction describes how mutually changing electric and magnetic fields interact to sustain each other and thus to form [[electromagnetic waves]], such as light: a changing electric field generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric field again. These, though, are usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.\n\n===Maxwell's equations===\n{{Main|Maxwell's equations}}\n\nLike all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical properties that relates it to its ''sources''.  (For {{math|'''B'''}} the ''sources'' are currents and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two corresponding properties of the electric field, make up ''Maxwell's Equations''. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a complete description of [[Classical electromagnetism|classical electrodynamics]] including both electricity and magnetism.\n\nThe first property is the [[divergence]] of a vector field {{math|'''A'''}}, {{math|'''\u2207''' \u00b7 '''A'''}}, which represents how {{math|'''A'''}} \"flows\" outward from a given point. As discussed above, a {{math|'''B'''}}-field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of {{math|'''B'''}} is zero. (Such vector fields are called [[solenoidal vector field]]s.) This property is called [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] and is equivalent to the statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or [[magnetic monopole]]s. The electric field on the other hand begins and ends at electric charges so that its divergence is non-zero and proportional to the [[charge density]] (See [[Gauss's law]]).\n\nThe second mathematical property is called the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]], such that {{math|'''\u2207''' \u00d7 '''A'''}} represents how {{math|'''A'''}} curls or \"circulates\" around a given point. The result of the curl is called a \"circulation source\". The equations for the curl of {{math|'''B'''}} and of {{math|'''E'''}} are called the [[Amp\u00e8re\u2013Maxwell equation]] and [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] respectively. They represent the differential forms of the integral equations given above.\n\nThe complete set of Maxwell's equations then are:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &=  0, \\\\\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} &=  \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} &=  \\mu_0\\mathbf{J} + \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}} {\\partial t}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''J'''}} = complete microscopic [[current density]] and {{math|''\u03c1''}} is the charge density.\n\nAs discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric {{math|'''E'''}} field and an applied magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field by producing their own internal \"bound\" charge and current distributions that contribute to {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''B'''}} but are difficult to calculate. To circumvent this problem, {{math|'''H'''}} and {{math|'''D'''}} fields are used to re-factor Maxwell's equations in terms of the ''free current density'' {{math|'''J'''<sub>f</sub>}} and ''free charge density'' {{math|''\u03c1''<sub>f</sub>}}:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &=  0, \\\\\n   \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} &=  \\rho_\\mathrm{f}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} &=  \\mathbf{J}_\\mathrm{f} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}} {\\partial t}, \\\\\n  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} &= -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese equations are not any more general than the original equations (if the \"bound\" charges and currents in the material are known). They also must be supplemented by the relationship between {{math|'''B'''}} and {{math|'''H'''}} as well as that between {{math|'''E'''}} and {{math|'''D'''}}. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to calculate the bound charges and currents.\n\n===Electric and magnetic fields: different aspects of the same phenomenon===\n{{Main|Relativistic electromagnetism}}\n\nAccording to [[special relativity|the special theory of relativity]], the partition of the [[electromagnetic force]] into separate electric and magnetic components is not fundamental, but varies with the [[Frame of reference#Observational frames of reference|observational frame of reference]]: An electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric and magnetic forces.\n\nFormally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into a rank-2 [[tensor]], called the ''[[electromagnetic tensor]]''. Changing reference frames ''mixes'' these components. This is analogous to the way that special relativity ''mixes'' space and time into [[spacetime]], and mass, momentum, and energy into [[four-momentum]].<ref>C. Doran and A. Lasenby (2003) ''Geometric Algebra for Physicists'', Cambridge University Press, p. 233. {{ISBN|0521715954}}.</ref>\n\n===Magnetic vector potential===\n{{Main|Magnetic potential}}\n\nIn advanced topics such as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] it is often easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the ''[[magnetic vector potential]]'' {{math|'''A'''}}, and the [[electric potential|electric scalar potential]] {{math|''\u03c6''}}, are defined such that:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{B} &=  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}, \\\\\n  \\mathbf{E} &= -\\nabla \\varphi - \\frac{ \\partial \\mathbf{A} }{ \\partial t }.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe vector potential {{math|'''A'''}} may be interpreted as a ''generalized potential [[momentum]] per unit charge''<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=E.

''[[Scientific American]]''; Page 36.</ref> See [[orders of magnitude (magnetic field)]].\n\n===Rotating magnetic fields===\n{{Main|Rotating magnetic field|Alternator}}\n\nThe ''rotating magnetic field'' is a key principle in the operation of [[electric motor#AC motors|alternating-current motors]]. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was conceptualized by [[Nikola Tesla]], and later utilized in his and others' early AC ([[alternating current]]) electric motors.\n\nA rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents.\n\nThis inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the conductor size and so, to overcome it, [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] systems are used where the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors, is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world's [[electrical power]] supply systems.\n\n[[Synchronous motor]]s use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the excitation of the machine be controlled\u2014and [[induction motor]]s use short-circuited [[Rotor (electric)|rotors]] (instead of a magnet) following the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled [[stator]]. The short-circuited turns of the rotor develop [[eddy current]]s in the rotating field of the stator, and these currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force.\n\nIn 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic field. In 1885, [[Galileo Ferraris]] independently researched the concept. In 1888, Tesla gained {{US patent|381968}} for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the ''Royal Academy of Sciences'' in [[Turin]].\n\n===Hall effect===\n{{Main|Hall effect}}\n\nThe charge carriers of a current-carrying conductor placed in a transverse magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to the applied magnetic field. This is known as the ''Hall effect''.\n\nThe ''Hall effect'' is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field. It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).\n\n===Magnetic circuits===\n{{Main|Magnetic circuit}}\nAn important use of {{math|'''H'''}} is in ''magnetic circuits'' where {{math|1='''B''' = ''\u03bc'''''H'''}} inside a linear material. Here, {{math|''\u03bc''}} is the [[magnetic permeability]] of the material. This result is similar in form to [[Ohm's law]] {{math|'''J''' {{=}} ''\u03c3'''''E'''}}, where {{math|'''J'''}} is the current density, {{math|''\u03c3''}} is the conductance and {{math|'''E'''}} is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law ({{math|1=''I'' = ''V''\u2044''R''}}) is:\n\n:<math>\\Phi = \\frac F R_\\mathrm{m},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi = \\int \\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{A}</math> is the magnetic flux in the circuit, <math>F = \\int \\mathbf{H}\\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\ell}</math> is the [[magnetomotive force]] applied to the circuit, and {{math|''R''<sub>m</sub>}} is the [[reluctance]] of the circuit. Here the reluctance {{math|''R''<sub>m</sub>}} is a quantity similar in nature to [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] for the flux.\n\nUsing this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available techniques of [[circuit theory]].\n\n===Magnetic field shape descriptions===\n[[Image:Magnetic quadrupole moment.svg|right|thumb|Schematic [[quadrupole magnet]] (\"''four-pole''\") magnetic field. There are four steel pole tips, two opposing magnetic north poles and two opposing magnetic south poles.]]\n\n*An ''azimuthal'' magnetic field is one that runs east\u2013west.\n*A ''meridional'' magnetic field is one that runs north\u2013south. In the [[solar dynamo]] model of the Sun, [[differential rotation]] of the solar plasma causes the meridional magnetic field to stretch into an azimuthal magnetic field, a process called the ''omega-effect''. The reverse process is called the ''alpha-effect''.<ref>[http://www.cora.nwra.com/~werne/eos/text/dynamo.html The Solar Dynamo]. Retrieved 15 September 2007.</ref>\n*A [[magnetic dipole|''dipole'' magnetic field]] is one seen around a bar magnet or around a [[electric charge|charged]] [[elementary particle]] with nonzero [[spin (physics)|spin]].\n*A [[quadrupole magnet|''quadrupole'' magnetic field]] is one seen, for example, between the poles of four bar magnets. The field strength grows linearly with the radial distance from its longitudinal axis.\n*A ''solenoidal'' magnetic field is similar to a dipole magnetic field, except that a solid bar magnet is replaced by a hollow electromagnetic coil magnet.\n*A ''toroidal'' magnetic field occurs in a doughnut-shaped coil, the electric current spiraling around the tube-like surface, and is found, for example, in a [[tokamak]].\n*A ''poloidal'' magnetic field is generated by a current flowing in a ring, and is found, for example, in a [[tokamak]].\n*A ''radial'' magnetic field is one in which field lines are directed from the center outwards, similar to the spokes in a bicycle wheel. An example can be found in a [[loudspeaker]] transducers (driver).<ref>I. S. Falconer and M. I. Large (edited by I. M.

From outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current {{math|''I''}} and an area {{math|''a''}}. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of:\n\n:<math>m=Ia, \\,</math>\n\nwhere the direction of {{math|'''m'''}} is perpendicular to the area of the loop and depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area {{math|''a''}} has been reduced to zero and its current {{math|''I''}} increased to infinity such that the product {{math|1=''m'' = ''Ia''}} is finite. This model clarifies the connection between angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the [[Einstein\u2013de Haas effect]] ''rotation by magnetization'' and its inverse, the [[Barnett effect]] or ''magnetization by rotation''.<ref name=Graham>See [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic dipoles|magnetic moment]] and {{cite book |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |author1=B.

Graham |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ixAe4qIGEmwC&pg=PA103 |page=103 |isbn=978-0-471-47741-9 |year=2008 |publisher=Wiley-IEEE |edition=2}}</ref> Rotating the loop faster (in the same direction) increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for example.\n\nIt is sometimes useful to model the magnetic dipole similar to the electric dipole with two equal but opposite magnetic charges (one south the other north) separated by distance {{math|''d''}}. This model produces an {{math|'''H'''}}-field not a {{math|'''B'''}}-field. Such a model is deficient, though, both in that there are no magnetic charges and in that it obscures the link between electricity and magnetism. Further, as discussed above it fails to explain the inherent connection between [[angular momentum]] and magnetism.\n\n===Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)===\n{{Main|Magnetic monopole}}\n\nA ''magnetic monopole'' is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that has, as its name suggests, only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a south pole). In other words, it would possess a \"magnetic charge\" analogous to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that magnetic field lines neither start nor end.\n\nModern interest in this concept stems from [[high-energy physics|particle theories]], notably [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified Theories]] and [[superstring theory|superstring theories]], that predict either the existence, or the possibility, of magnetic monopoles. These theories and others have inspired extensive efforts to search for monopoles. Despite these efforts, no magnetic monopole has been observed to date.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex10\">Two experiments produced candidate events that were initially interpreted as monopoles, but these are now considered inconclusive. For details and references, see [[magnetic monopole]].</ref>\n\nIn recent research, materials known as [[spin ice]]s can simulate monopoles, but do not contain actual monopoles.<ref name=\"monopole\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091015085916.htm |title='Magnetricity' Observed And Measured For First Time |website=[[Science Daily]] |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"MonopoleReview\">{{cite journal |author=M.J.P.

A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an [[algorithm]], a step-by-step approach to solving a task.\n\nThe flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given [[Problem solving|problem]]. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.<ref name=\"SSEV\">[http://pascal.computer.org/sev_display/index.action SEVOCAB: Software Systems Engineering Vocabulary]. Term: ''Flow chart''. Retrieved 31 July 2008.</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:For-loop-diagram.png|thumb|right|Flowchart of a [[C (programming language)|C-style]] ''[[for loop|for&nbsp;loop]]'']]\nFlowcharts are used in designing and documenting simple processes or programs. Like other types of diagrams, they help visualize what is going on and thereby help understand a process, and perhaps also find less-obvious features within the process, like flaws and [[Bottleneck (production)|bottleneck]]s. There are different types of flowcharts: each type has its own set of boxes and notations. The two most common types of boxes in a flowchart are:\n\n* a processing step, usually called ''activity'', and denoted as a rectangular box.\n* a decision, usually denoted as a diamond.\n \nA flowchart is described as \"cross-functional\" when the chart is divided into different vertical or horizontal parts, to describe the control of different organizational units. A symbol appearing in a particular part is within the control of that organizational unit.  A cross-functional flowchart allows the author to correctly locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision, and to show the responsibility of each organizational unit for different parts of a single process.\n\nFlowcharts depict certain aspects of processes and are usually complemented by other types of diagram. For instance, [[Kaoru Ishikawa]] defined the flowchart as one of the seven basic tools of quality control, next to the [[histogram]], [[Pareto chart]], [[check sheet]], [[control chart]], [[Ishikawa diagram|cause-and-effect diagram]], and the [[scatter diagram]].

A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an [[algorithm]], a step-by-step approach to solving a task.\n\nThe flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given [[Problem solving|problem]]. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.<ref name=\"SSEV\">[http://pascal.computer.org/sev_display/index.action SEVOCAB: Software Systems Engineering Vocabulary]. Term: ''Flow chart''. Retrieved 31 July 2008.</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:For-loop-diagram.png|thumb|right|Flowchart of a [[C (programming language)|C-style]] ''[[for loop|for&nbsp;loop]]'']]\nFlowcharts are used in designing and documenting simple processes or programs. Like other types of diagrams, they help visualize what is going on and thereby help understand a process, and perhaps also find less-obvious features within the process, like flaws and [[Bottleneck (production)|bottleneck]]s. There are different types of flowcharts: each type has its own set of boxes and notations. The two most common types of boxes in a flowchart are:\n\n* a processing step, usually called ''activity'', and denoted as a rectangular box.\n* a decision, usually denoted as a diamond.\n \nA flowchart is described as \"cross-functional\" when the chart is divided into different vertical or horizontal parts, to describe the control of different organizational units. A symbol appearing in a particular part is within the control of that organizational unit.  A cross-functional flowchart allows the author to correctly locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision, and to show the responsibility of each organizational unit for different parts of a single process.\n\nFlowcharts depict certain aspects of processes and are usually complemented by other types of diagram. For instance, [[Kaoru Ishikawa]] defined the flowchart as one of the seven basic tools of quality control, next to the [[histogram]], [[Pareto chart]], [[check sheet]], [[control chart]], [[Ishikawa diagram|cause-and-effect diagram]], and the [[scatter diagram]]. Similarly, in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], a standard concept-modeling notation used in software development, the [[activity diagram]], which is a type of flowchart, is just one of many different diagram types.\n\n[[Nassi-Shneiderman diagram]]s and [[DRAKON|Drakon-charts]] are an alternative notation for process flow.\n\nCommon alternative names include: flow chart, process flowchart, functional flowchart, process map, process chart, functional process chart, business process model, process model, process [[flow diagram]], [[workflow|work flow]] diagram, business flow diagram. The terms \"flowchart\" and \"flow chart\" are used interchangeably.\n\nThe underlying [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] structure of a flowchart is a flow graph, which abstracts away node types, their contents and other ancillary information.\n\n== History ==\nThe first structured method for documenting process flow, the \"[[flow process chart]]\", was introduced by [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth|Frank]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Gilbreth]] in the presentation \"Process Charts: First Steps in Finding the One Best Way to do Work\", to members of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)]] in 1921.<ref>Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1921) ''[https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/GilbrethLibrary/gilbrethproject/processcharts.pdf Process Charts]''.
