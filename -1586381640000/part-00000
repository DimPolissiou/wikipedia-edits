The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\n===Roots===\n[[File:Consolidated PB4Y-2 Naval Aviation Museum.jpg|left|thumb|PB4Y-2 BuNo 66261 (marked as BuNo 66304) in the collection of the [[National Naval Aviation Museum]] at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]].]]\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2 Privateers]]<ref name=\"Donald\">Donald</ref> from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden]], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flareups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. Despite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean which saw saw VQ-2 monitoring the Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the XXX aircrew fatalities and XXX aircraft in XXX mishaps.\n\n\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. \n\n\n\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Lucius D.

At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\"2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flareups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. Despite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean which saw saw VQ-2 monitoring the Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the XXX aircrew fatalities and XXX aircraft in XXX mishaps.\n\n\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. \n\n\n\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005. The relocation of VQ-2's six aircraft and 450 Sailors to the United States was in keeping with the Navy's ongoing transformation of forces in [[Europe]] and helped reduce costs and eliminate redundancies throughout its force structure worldwide.

Due to warfare and exposure to [[infectious diseases]] after [[Europe]]an contact, native tribes became depopulated.  In the eighteenth century, when the area was under [[Spain|Spanish]] rule, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples of [[Creek people|Creek]] and other tribes migrated into present-day Florida from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  [[Africans]] and [[African Americans]] who escaped from [[slavery]] and shipwrecks also migrated to the area, where they created [[Maroon (people)|maroon]] communities.  Some were given freedom by the Spanish in exchange for serving with their militias.  Gradually the [[Seminole]] nation formed out of these multi-ethnic people.  Some African-descended people set up communities near the Seminole and became known as [[Black Seminole]].  In the nineteenth century, most of the Seminole and many blacks were removed to [[Indian Territory]] after the [[Seminole Wars]], a result of pressure from increasing Anglo-American settlement.\n\nGlades County was created, in 1921, from Desoto County. It was named for the [[Florida Everglades]], though most of the county is prairie and pinelands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/321106|title=Florida Memory: History of Glades County|last=|first=|date=1939|website=Florida Memory|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIt is one of five counties surrounding Lake Okeechobee and the [[Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail]].\n\nGlades County sponsors one of Florida's oldest recurring festivals.  ''[[Chalo Nitka]]'' Festival is a celebration of local history and culture, similar to a county fair.  The festival also draws attention to the long and friendly relationship between the local [[Seminole]] groups and Glades County settlers.

Due to warfare and exposure to [[infectious diseases]] after [[Europe]]an contact, native tribes became depopulated.  In the eighteenth century, when the area was under [[Spain|Spanish]] rule, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples of [[Creek people|Creek]] and other tribes migrated into present-day Florida from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  [[Africans]] and [[African Americans]] who escaped from [[slavery]] and shipwrecks also migrated to the area, where they created [[Maroon (people)|maroon]] communities.  Some were given freedom by the Spanish in exchange for serving with their militias.  Gradually the [[Seminole]] nation formed out of these multi-ethnic people.  Some African-descended people set up communities near the Seminole and became known as [[Black Seminole]].  In the nineteenth century, most of the Seminole and many blacks were removed to [[Indian Territory]] after the [[Seminole Wars]], a result of pressure from increasing Anglo-American settlement.\n\nGlades County was created, in 1921, from Desoto County. It was named for the [[Florida Everglades]], though most of the county is prairie and pinelands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.floridamemory.com/items/show/321106|title=Florida Memory: History of Glades County|last=|first=|date=1939|website=Florida Memory|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIt is one of five counties surrounding Lake Okeechobee and the [[Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail]].\n\nGlades County sponsors one of Florida's oldest recurring festivals.  ''[[Chalo Nitka]]'' Festival is a celebration of local history and culture, similar to a county fair.  The festival also draws attention to the long and friendly relationship between the local [[Seminole]] groups and Glades County settlers.  [[Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation]] is located in the county.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|987|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|806|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|181|sqmi}} (18.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\n[[Fisheating Creek]] is a stream that flows into [[Lake Okeechobee]] in Florida.

It is the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] of locally based [[Sunbeam Television]]. WSVN's studios are located on 79th Street Causeway ([[Florida State Road 934|SR 934]]) in [[North Bay Village, Florida|North Bay Village]] (though with a Miami [[United States Postal Service|postal]] address), and its transmitter is located in north [[Miami\u2013Dade County, Florida|Miami\u2013Dade County]].\n\n==History==\n\n===WCKT===\nThe station first signed on the air on July 29, 1956 as '''WCKT'''. Originally operating as an [[NBC]] affiliate, it was founded by the Biscayne Television Corporation, a partnership between the [[Cox Enterprises|Cox]] and [[Knight Ridder|Knight]] publishing families (from which the original call letters were derived ['''C'''ox '''K'''night '''T'''elevision]), who respectively owned Miami's two major newspapers: the now-defunct ''[[The Miami News|Miami News]]'' and the still-operating ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]''. The same Cox/Knight partnership also owned WCKR radio (610 AM, now [[WIOD]], and 97.3 FM, now [[WFLC]]). Niles Trammell, a former NBC president, held a 15 percent ownership interest in WCKT.\n\nBefore WCKT signed on, NBC programming had been carried on [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]'s WFTL-TV (channel 23, later known as WGBS-TV after it had been acquired by [[Storer Broadcasting]]), which also held a secondary affiliation with the [[DuMont Television Network]]. However, WFTL struggled because television sets were not required to have UHF tuning capability (the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) would later [[All-Channel Receiver Act|require such tuners to be included]] in sets manufactured from 1964 onward). It didn't help matters that much of the area particularly Fort Lauderdale got a fairly strong signal from WJNO-TV (channel 5, now [[WPTV-TV|WPTV]]) in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. When the Cox/Knight partnership won a [[construction permit]] and [[broadcast license]] to operate a station on VHF channel 7, NBC quickly agreed to move its affiliation to WCKT, since WCKR radio had been the longtime Miami affiliate of the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]] (the forerunner to today's [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC)). Until WPST-TV (channel 10, now [[WPLG]]) signed on in August 1957, WCKT also shared ABC programming with [[WTVJ]] (channel 4), as part of an arrangement with the network to provide its programming throughout the [[media market|market]] as television sets were not required to have UHF tuning capability at the time, preventing many in the area from receiving the market's original ABC affiliate, WITV (channel 17). Channel 23 became an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] and eventually went dark, and later came back to the air in 1967 as WAJA-TV (it is now [[Univision]] flagship [[WLTV-DT]]).\n\nIn 1962, the Cox/Knight/Trammell partnership was stripped of its broadcast licenses due to violations of the FCC's licensing rules and ethics violations. In hearings that began in June 1960, it was found that some of the principals of Biscayne Television, as well as some of James Cox's personal friends, had made improper contact with FCC commissioner Richard Mack in order to influence the awarding of the construction permit and licenses. Biscayne had competed for the license with two other applicants, East Coast Television and South Florida TV. Mack had also been found guilty of taking payoffs and was forced to resign by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], as well as the rest of the FCC commissioners.\n\nBiscayne Television originally planned to appeal its license revocation, but was advised that the appeal would be turned down due to the gravity of the situation. Mack had also been found guilty of taking payoffs in the licensing process WPST, to the broadcasting subsidiary of [[National Airlines (NA)|National Airlines]]. WPST had its license revoked and Biscayne then opted to put WCKT up for sale. The owners of WPST were forced to sell the station only after they had to cease broadcasting.\n\n===Sunbeam Television ownership===\nShortly afterward, a new company called [[Sunbeam Television|Sunbeam Television Corporation]] bought the station for $3.4 million and assumed ownership of channel 7 on December 19, 1962. Upon the change in ownership, Sunbeam retained the WCKT call letters and claimed the Cox/Knight station's history as its own. Sunbeam was a partnership between [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]]-based real estate developer Sydney Ansin, and his son [[Edmund Ansin]]. The younger Ansin succeeded his father as president of Sunbeam Television in 1971. The station began using its own version of the [[circle 7 logo]] (which is moderately similar to the version originally created for ABC's owned-and-operated stations, but with the \"7\" not connected to the circle and being somewhat shaped differently) in the mid-1970s. On June 7, 1983, the station's callsign was changed to the current '''WSVN''', after those call letters were acquired from a [[PBS]] satellite [[Blue Ridge PBS|member station]] in [[Norton, Virginia]] (which subsequently became WSBN-TV; it has since [[Dark (broadcasting)|gone off the air]]).\n\nAs an NBC affiliate, WCKT/WSVN aired a local newscast in place of programs that NBC had aired at noon on weekdays. It also occasionally preempted network shows that aired during the 10:00 a.m. or 11:00 a.m. timeslot (but ran at least one of these hours) and preempted an occasional prime time program. While NBC was traditionally far less tolerant of program preemptions than the other major broadcast networks, it did not mind this at first provided that the network was able to get Miami area independent stations to air whatever programs that WSVN chose not to air. In addition, NBC programs that were not broadcast by WSVN were cleared by WPTV, whose signal provides city-grade coverage of Fort Lauderdale and was available on nearly every [[cable television|cable]] provider in the area. However, in the early 1980s, WPTV was removed from some Miami area cable systems to make room for new channels due to limited [[cable television headend|headend]] channel capacity. Largely due to those preemptions, WCKT/WSVN was one of NBC's weaker affiliates. Though NBC continued to arrange for independent stations to air network programs that were not shown on WSVN, the network grew increasingly annoyed at having to resort to such an arrangement in what had grown into a major market. NBC eventually decided that it needed to [[owned-and-operated station|acquire its own station]] in the growing [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]] market.\n\n====Network affiliation switch====\nNBC got its chance at owning a station in the late 1980s, when [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] put [[CBS]] affiliate WTVJ (then on channel 4, now on channel 6) on the market. NBC's then-corporate parent [[General Electric]] purchased that station in 1987, but WTVJ's affiliation contract with CBS was not set to expire until December 1988. CBS was willing to let WTVJ out of its contract one year early. However, Ed Ansin was not interested in letting NBC out of its affiliation agreement with WSVN, which also expired at the same time; Ansin even made an unsuccessful petition to the FCC to stop NBC's purchase of WTVJ.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-03-11/business/8701150881_1_station-owner-ed-ansin-channel |title=Channel 7 Fights Sale Of Rival Tv Station`s Owner Wants Channel 4 Deal Stopped  |website=Sun-Sentinel |date=March 11, 1987 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/87-OCR/BC-1987-03-16-Page-0041.pdf] {{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/87-OCR/BC-1987-03-16-Page-0042.pdf] {{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref> He wanted channel 7 to air NBC's strong fall 1988 lineup, which included the network's coverage of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[1988 World Series|World Series]] and the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].\n\nAs a result, NBC was forced to run WTVJ as a CBS affiliate for more than a year, with all of the NBC shows that were preempted by WSVN airing on WTVJ instead. This  situation did not sit well with either network. Ansin made an offer to take the CBS affiliation, but CBS turned the offer down.<ref>[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-06-19/business/8802050663_1_affiliates-convention-nbc-affiliation-affiliate-stations CBS Snubs WTVJ, Network Affiliation Flap Is Setting Precedents], ''Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel'', June 19, 1988.</ref> Instead, CBS bought Miami's longtime independent station and original [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate, WCIX channel 6, even though that station had an inadequate signal in [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] (WCIX's transmitter was located in [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]], farther southwest than those of other Miami area stations, to avoid signal interference with WCPX-TV (now [[WKMG-TV]]) in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and WPTV). In May 1988, Ed Ansin filed an antitrust lawsuit against General Electric/NBC and CBS, one week after he had claimed that CBS backed out of contract negotiations to affiliate with WSVN.<ref>[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-05-07/business/8801280416_1_two-networks-wsvn-nbc WSVN Owner Files Suit Against Networks, Firm], ''Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel'', May 7, 1988.</ref> With WCIX planning to switch to CBS at the start of 1989, Fox began negotiations with other area stations to carry its programming. It ultimately reached an agreement with Sunbeam Television to affiliate with channel 7.\n\n====Fox affiliation====\nOn [[New Year's Day|January 1]], 1989, South Florida's first network affiliation switch occurred, with NBC moving to WTVJ full-time and WSVN taking the Fox affiliation. Channel 7 had far fewer network shows to preempt as a result, as Fox only ran prime time programming on weekends at the time and would not air an entire week's worth of programming until 1993. As a result, WSVN was for essential intents and purposes programmed as a ''de facto'' independent station (even referring to itself as such in promotions regarding the switch, despite still being affiliated with a network). Until Fox began airing programming every weeknight, WSVN aired a movie in prime time at 8:00 p.m. on nights where network programming was not scheduled to air. WSVN's affiliation with Fox could be seen as a major coup for the fledgling network, as WSVN had been a longtime NBC affiliate and Fox was pleased to affiliate with a station that had been with a \"[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]]\" network for years. At the time, WSVN was one of the largest heritage \"Big Three\" stations to join Fox. The combination of WSVN not following a similar pattern to other Fox affiliates at the time (which focused more on syndicated programming and movies, than news), and WCIX becoming a \"Big Three\" affiliate had also led then-struggling independent WDZL (channel 39, now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WSFL-TV]]) to rise to a higher profile, as WDZL had picked up many shows that were formerly seen on WCIX (now [[WFOR-TV]] on channel 4). WSVN, meanwhile, picked up some of WCIX's movie packages, as well as a couple of cartoons that it aired on Saturday and Sunday mornings.\n\n[[Image:Svntape.JPG|205px|thumb|right|WSVN archive [[betacam]] newstape at the Florida Moving Image Archive.]]\nInstead of acquiring a large amount of off-network sitcoms and cartoons, WSVN opted to pour most of its resources into its news department and took on a news-intensive format\u2014expanding its newscasts to seven hours on weekdays\u2014a move that was pilloried at the time since its newscasts had consistently finished well behind WTVJ and WPLG in the ratings.<ref>[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-09-13/features/8802220537_1_ed-ansin-wsvn-station Emphasis On News A Bold Move For Ch. 7], ''Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel'', September 13, 1988.</ref> Because of this, the station had a higher local newscast output than the rest of Fox's stations did at the time of the switch; when WSVN became a Fox affiliate, only a small number of Fox stations ran local newscasts, which were largely limited to late prime time slots (as of 2014, about \u00be of Fox's stations have morning newscasts, but only about one-third of its owned-and-operated stations and affiliates carry newscasts in either the midday or late afternoon/early evening time periods). In addition to newscasts, WSVN began to air a lot of first-run [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[talk show]]s, [[court show]]s, and off-network [[drama (film and television)|drama]] series. As Fox lacked a national evening newscast (a situation which continues to this day), the station also ran a half-hour late afternoon simulcast of [[HLN (TV channel)|CNN Headline News]] during the early and mid-1990s.\n\nThe station ran some cartoons on weekend mornings as well, it originally aired [[Fox Kids]] when Fox launched the block on September 8, 1990, however, it would become the first Fox station in the country to stop carrying the block in 1993, Fox Kids subsequently moved to WDZL, before moving again to [[WAMI-DT|WAMI]] (channel 69) in 1998, [[WBFS-TV]] (channel 33) aired the successor [[4Kids TV]] block until it ended on December 27, 2008. By coincidence, when [[New World Pictures#New World Communications (1992\u20131997)|New World Communications]] switched most of its \"Big Three\"-affiliated stations to Fox between 1994 and 1996, the programming on those stations was very similar in format to WSVN, except that their news formats may have been aimed at an older audience than WSVN's, many stations owned by New World also passed on Fox Kids just as WSVN did. In the early 1990s, the station added a few off-network sitcoms to its schedule such as ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', and ''[[Empty Nest]]'' (the latter two being set in Miami).\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WSVNlogo.jpg|205px|thumb|left|WSVN's 2001-2009 news open.{{ffdc|1=WSVNlogo.jpg|log=2016 January 15}}]] -->\nAs a Fox affiliate, the station brands itself as \"WSVN 7\", rather than \"Fox 7\" under Fox's branding guidelines for its owned-and-operated stations and affiliates ([[Boston]] sister station [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] formerly used its affiliated network's name in its branding as \"7 NBC\" until it became an independent station in January 2017, although NBC is not as strict with station branding as Fox is), and is one of a handful of Fox affiliates that omit network references entirely from their branding. However, [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]] refers to the station as \"Fox 7\" when carrying WSVN's coverage of breaking news stories from South Florida; until its website was remodeled in late 2009, the Fox logo also occasionally appeared in a rolling marquee alongside the station's \"circle 7\" logo on the top left hand corner of the site. At the time of the 1989 switch, the network's owned-and-operated stations and certain affiliates were the only Fox stations to use full network references, while other stations\u2014like original Miami affiliate WCIX used limited to no references to Fox in their branding.

As time went on, though, most Fox stations began relying more on talk and court shows, as well as local newscasts. Channel 7 runs only a slightly heavier amount of local news programming than other Fox stations (which have gradually increased their news outputs over the last 15 years). WSVN continues not to feature any sitcoms as part of its syndication inventory, somewhat atypical for a news-intensive Fox station.\n\n===Sports programming===\nIn 1966, with the establishment of the [[Miami Dolphins]] of the [[American Football League]], the station, via [[NFL on NBC|NBC]], which held the league's broadcast rights, became the station of record for the new team. WVSN provided coverage of the Dolphins' victory in [[Super Bowl VII]] after their [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|perfect season in 1972]]. This alliance continued until the end of the [[1988 Miami Dolphins season|1988 season]], when most games moved over to WTVJ (today, most games are aired by WFOR). Since 1994, the station airs at least two Dolphins games a season via the [[Fox NFL|NFL on Fox]], usually when the team plays host to an [[National Football Conference|NFC]] team at [[Hard Rock Stadium]], however, starting in [[2014 Miami Dolphins season|2014]], with the institution of the NFL's new broadcast 'cross-flex' rules, more games can be seen on Channel 7 when they are moved from WFOR, and since 2018, via Fox's exclusive contract, [[Thursday Night Football]] games. In addition, any [[Miami Marlins]] games featured as part of Fox's MLB broadcast contract are aired on channel 7, this included their victory in the [[2003 World Series]], when the team was still the Florida Marlins. The station was also the local broadcaster of [[Super Bowl LIV]] which was held at Hard Rock Stadium, as Fox [[NFL on Fox|had the national television rights]] to the game; it also previously served as the home broadcaster of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] which was also on Fox.\n\n==News operation==\nWSVN presently broadcasts 63\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 10\u00bd hours each weekday, six hours on Saturdays and five hours on Sundays), in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output of any local television station in Miami. Unlike other news-intensive Fox stations, WSVN carries newscasts at 5:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m., and 6:30 p.m. on both Saturdays and Sundays (others either air early evening newscasts on weekends at different times on Saturdays and Sundays [i.e., Saturdays at 6:00 p.m. and Sundays at 5:00 p.m.], air them either at only 5:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. on both nights or do not carry newscasts in that particular weekend time period at all), however, WSVN's weekend 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. newscasts are subject to preemption and/or delay due to network sports telecasts running into the timeslot. In addition, the station produces the entertainment news/lifestyle program ''[[Deco Drive]]'' (which airs at 7:30 p.m. weeknights). The station is affiliated with [[CNN]] for news.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Keith|last2=Preuss|first2=Andreas|title=Millions of dollars found stashed in buckets at Miami home, police say|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/30/us/florida-cash-drugs-gun-found-in-home/|accessdate=June 30, 2016|work=CNN|date=June 30, 2016|quote=...told CNN affiliate WSVN.}}</ref>\n\nWhen the station gained the Fox affiliation on January 1, 1989, it retained a news schedule similar to the one it had as an NBC affiliate, in its early years with Fox, local news programming on the station ran on weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., Noon to 1:00 p.m., 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., weekends from 6:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. and nightly from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. The station became the second Fox affiliate to have a weekday morning newscast as a result and was the first one with weeknight 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. newscasts. On the date of the network switch, WSVN debuted a locally produced early evening [[newsmagazine|news magazine]] program, ''Inside Story'', the program eventually evolved into its present entertainment-based format as ''7:30'' (in reference to its timeslot) in 1994, and later changed its title to the current ''Deco Drive'' in 1996.\n\nUnder [[news director]] [[Joel Cheatwood]], WSVN became well known in South Florida, and throughout the nation, for its emphasis on crime stories and sensationalistic reporting\u2014summarized in the phrase, \"if it bleeds, it leads.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Jicha|first=Tom|title=News Show To Get WSVN's Familiar Tabloid Touch|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-03-29/features/9101160152_1_newscast-joel-cheatwood-wsvn|accessdate=July 9, 2012|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]|date=March 29, 1991}}</ref> Although this embrace of [[tabloid television]] was criticized, it rejuvenated a station that had languished in third place for most of its tenure with NBC. Within a few years, with anchor Rick Sanchez at the helm, WSVN became the market's highest-rated English-language station from sign-on to sign-off,<ref>http://www.flnewscenter.com/archives/696.html</ref> a rank it would hold for the better part of two decades until it was overtaken for the title by WFOR, though WSVN has been a solid runner-up and has tied for second with WPLG.\n\n[[Image:WSVN HD.JPG|225px|thumb|left|WSVN's Pre-2015 HD Newsplex studio.]]\nWSVN's success also influenced how newscasts on other Fox affiliates would look in later years; the station's decision to take on a news-intensive schedule would eventually serve as the template for the programming formats of the former \"Big Three\" stations that switched to Fox as a result of its 1994 affiliation agreement with New World Communications and certain transactions related to the deal, and was gradually adopted by many heritage Fox stations and certain news-producing stations that are not affiliated with the network, NBC, CBS or ABC. It was also the first station to take a cue from CNN, integrating its newsroom and studio into one large area, which the station has termed the \"newsplex\". It evolved out of their initial two sets around the time of the network switch in the late 1980s: one used for its morning and 5:00 p.m. newscasts, which was a small, enclosed area in the newsroom, and its main set, which was positioned in the station's control room. Other stations and networks, both in the U.S. and internationally, have taken cues from WSVN's set. The overall format was successful enough in Miami that in 1993, Ed Ansin assigned Cheatwood to overhaul Sunbeam's newly acquired Boston station WHDH, incorporating a considerably watered-down version of the WSVN format for its newscasts; as in Miami, the tabloid style helped WHDH rise from a perennial third place into a contender for first in the news ratings (against the more traditional [[WCVB-TV]]). WHDH uses many visual cues taken from WSVN including the use of flashy graphics, distinct music packages composed by Chris Crane (who has composed the various custom news themes used by WSVN since 1991) and a similarly designed \"newsplex\" set; WSVN's \"circle 7\" logo was also adopted by WHDH after Sunbeam assumed ownership. A similar format was adopted by [[KJRH-TV]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] between 1994 and 1997, that station has since reverted to airing traditional newscasts.\n\nThe station's 11:00 p.m. newscast evolved into an hour-long 10:00 p.m. program after it joined Fox, but was revived in 1995 as a 15-minute wrap-up of the proceedings in the [[O.J.

It is the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] of locally based [[Sunbeam Television]]. WSVN's studios are located on 79th Street Causeway ([[Florida State Road 934|SR 934]]) in [[North Bay Village, Florida|North Bay Village]] (though with a Miami [[United States Postal Service|postal]] address), and its transmitter is located in north [[Miami\u2013Dade County, Florida|Miami\u2013Dade County]].\n\n==History==\n\n===WCKT===\nThe station first signed on the air on July 29, 1956 as '''WCKT'''. Originally operating as an [[NBC]] affiliate, it was founded by the Biscayne Television Corporation, a partnership between the [[Cox Enterprises|Cox]] and [[Knight Ridder|Knight]] publishing families (from which the original call letters were derived ['''C'''ox '''K'''night '''T'''elevision]), who respectively owned Miami's two major newspapers: the now-defunct ''[[The Miami News|Miami News]]'' and the still-operating ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]''. The same Cox/Knight partnership also owned WCKR radio (610 AM, now [[WIOD]], and 97.3 FM, now [[WFLC]]). Niles Trammell, a former NBC president, held a 15 percent ownership interest in WCKT.\n\nBefore WCKT signed on, NBC programming had been carried on [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]'s WFTL-TV (channel 23, later known as WGBS-TV after it had been acquired by [[Storer Broadcasting]]), which also held a secondary affiliation with the [[DuMont Television Network]]. However, WFTL struggled because television sets were not required to have UHF tuning capability (the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) would later [[All-Channel Receiver Act|require such tuners to be included]] in sets manufactured from 1964 onward). It didn't help matters that much of the area particularly Fort Lauderdale got a fairly strong signal from WJNO-TV (channel 5, now [[WPTV-TV|WPTV]]) in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. When the Cox/Knight partnership won a [[construction permit]] and [[broadcast license]] to operate a station on VHF channel 7, NBC quickly agreed to move its affiliation to WCKT, since WCKR radio had been the longtime Miami affiliate of the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]] (the forerunner to today's [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC)). Until WPST-TV (channel 10, now [[WPLG]]) signed on in August 1957, WCKT also shared ABC programming with [[WTVJ]] (channel 4), as part of an arrangement with the network to provide its programming throughout the [[media market|market]] as television sets were not required to have UHF tuning capability at the time, preventing many in the area from receiving the market's original ABC affiliate, WITV (channel 17). Channel 23 became an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] and eventually went dark, and later came back to the air in 1967 as WAJA-TV (it is now [[Univision]] flagship [[WLTV-DT]]).\n\nIn 1962, the Cox/Knight/Trammell partnership was stripped of its broadcast licenses due to violations of the FCC's licensing rules and ethics violations. In hearings that began in June 1960, it was found that some of the principals of Biscayne Television, as well as some of James Cox's personal friends, had made improper contact with FCC commissioner Richard Mack in order to influence the awarding of the construction permit and licenses. Biscayne had competed for the license with two other applicants, East Coast Television and South Florida TV. Mack had also been found guilty of taking payoffs and was forced to resign by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], as well as the rest of the FCC commissioners.\n\nBiscayne Television originally planned to appeal its license revocation, but was advised that the appeal would be turned down due to the gravity of the situation. Mack had also been found guilty of taking payoffs in the licensing process WPST, to the broadcasting subsidiary of [[National Airlines (NA)|National Airlines]]. WPST had its license revoked and Biscayne then opted to put WCKT up for sale. The owners of WPST were forced to sell the station only after they had to cease broadcasting.\n\n===Sunbeam Television ownership===\nShortly afterward, a new company called [[Sunbeam Television|Sunbeam Television Corporation]] bought the station for $3.4 million and assumed ownership of channel 7 on December 19, 1962. Upon the change in ownership, Sunbeam retained the WCKT call letters and claimed the Cox/Knight station's history as its own. Sunbeam was a partnership between [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]]-based real estate developer Sydney Ansin, and his son [[Edmund Ansin]]. The younger Ansin succeeded his father as president of Sunbeam Television in 1971. The station began using its own version of the [[circle 7 logo]] (which is moderately similar to the version originally created for ABC's owned-and-operated stations, but with the \"7\" not connected to the circle and being somewhat shaped differently) in the mid-1970s. On June 7, 1983, the station's callsign was changed to the current '''WSVN''', after those call letters were acquired from a [[PBS]] satellite [[Blue Ridge PBS|member station]] in [[Norton, Virginia]] (which subsequently became WSBN-TV; it has since [[Dark (broadcasting)|gone off the air]]).\n\nAs an NBC affiliate, WCKT/WSVN aired a local newscast in place of programs that NBC had aired at noon on weekdays. It also occasionally preempted network shows that aired during the 10:00 a.m. or 11:00 a.m. timeslot (but ran at least one of these hours) and preempted an occasional prime time program. While NBC was traditionally far less tolerant of program preemptions than the other major broadcast networks, it did not mind this at first provided that the network was able to get Miami area independent stations to air whatever programs that WSVN chose not to air. In addition, NBC programs that were not broadcast by WSVN were cleared by WPTV, whose signal provides city-grade coverage of Fort Lauderdale and was available on nearly every [[cable television|cable]] provider in the area. However, in the early 1980s, WPTV was removed from some Miami area cable systems to make room for new channels due to limited [[cable television headend|headend]] channel capacity. Largely due to those preemptions, WCKT/WSVN was one of NBC's weaker affiliates. Though NBC continued to arrange for independent stations to air network programs that were not shown on WSVN, the network grew increasingly annoyed at having to resort to such an arrangement in what had grown into a major market. NBC eventually decided that it needed to [[owned-and-operated station|acquire its own station]] in the growing [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]] market.\n\n====Network affiliation switch====\nNBC got its chance at owning a station in the late 1980s, when [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] put [[CBS]] affiliate WTVJ (then on channel 4, now on channel 6) on the market. NBC's then-corporate parent [[General Electric]] purchased that station in 1987, but WTVJ's affiliation contract with CBS was not set to expire until December 1988. CBS was willing to let WTVJ out of its contract one year early. However, Ed Ansin was not interested in letting NBC out of its affiliation agreement with WSVN, which also expired at the same time; Ansin even made an unsuccessful petition to the FCC to stop NBC's purchase of WTVJ.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-03-11/business/8701150881_1_station-owner-ed-ansin-channel |title=Channel 7 Fights Sale Of Rival Tv Station`s Owner Wants Channel 4 Deal Stopped  |website=Sun-Sentinel |date=March 11, 1987 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/87-OCR/BC-1987-03-16-Page-0041.pdf] {{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/87-OCR/BC-1987-03-16-Page-0042.pdf] {{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref> He wanted channel 7 to air NBC's strong fall 1988 lineup, which included the network's coverage of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[1988 World Series|World Series]] and the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].\n\nAs a result, NBC was forced to run WTVJ as a CBS affiliate for more than a year, with all of the NBC shows that were preempted by WSVN airing on WTVJ instead. This  situation did not sit well with either network. Ansin made an offer to take the CBS affiliation, but CBS turned the offer down.<ref>[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-06-19/business/8802050663_1_affiliates-convention-nbc-affiliation-affiliate-stations CBS Snubs WTVJ, Network Affiliation Flap Is Setting Precedents], ''Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel'', June 19, 1988.</ref> Instead, CBS bought Miami's longtime independent station and original [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate, WCIX channel 6, even though that station had an inadequate signal in [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] (WCIX's transmitter was located in [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]], farther southwest than those of other Miami area stations, to avoid signal interference with WCPX-TV (now [[WKMG-TV]]) in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and WPTV). In May 1988, Ed Ansin filed an antitrust lawsuit against General Electric/NBC and CBS, one week after he had claimed that CBS backed out of contract negotiations to affiliate with WSVN.<ref>[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-05-07/business/8801280416_1_two-networks-wsvn-nbc WSVN Owner Files Suit Against Networks, Firm], ''Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel'', May 7, 1988.</ref> With WCIX planning to switch to CBS at the start of 1989, Fox began negotiations with other area stations to carry its programming. It ultimately reached an agreement with Sunbeam Television to affiliate with channel 7.\n\n====Fox affiliation====\nOn [[New Year's Day|January 1]], 1989, South Florida's first network affiliation switch occurred, with NBC moving to WTVJ full-time and WSVN taking the Fox affiliation. Channel 7 had far fewer network shows to preempt as a result, as Fox only ran prime time programming on weekends at the time and would not air an entire week's worth of programming until 1993. As a result, WSVN was for essential intents and purposes programmed as a ''de facto'' independent station (even referring to itself as such in promotions regarding the switch, despite still being affiliated with a network). Until Fox began airing programming every weeknight, WSVN aired a movie in prime time at 8:00 p.m. on nights where network programming was not scheduled to air. WSVN's affiliation with Fox could be seen as a major coup for the fledgling network, as WSVN had been a longtime NBC affiliate and Fox was pleased to affiliate with a station that had been with a \"[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]]\" network for years. At the time, WSVN was one of the largest heritage \"Big Three\" stations to join Fox. The combination of WSVN not following a similar pattern to other Fox affiliates at the time (which focused more on syndicated programming and movies, than news), and WCIX becoming a \"Big Three\" affiliate had also led then-struggling independent WDZL (channel 39, now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WSFL-TV]]) to rise to a higher profile, as WDZL had picked up many shows that were formerly seen on WCIX (now [[WFOR-TV]] on channel 4). WSVN, meanwhile, picked up some of WCIX's movie packages, as well as a couple of cartoons that it aired on Saturday and Sunday mornings.\n\n[[Image:Svntape.JPG|205px|thumb|right|WSVN archive [[betacam]] newstape at the Florida Moving Image Archive.]]\nInstead of acquiring a large amount of off-network sitcoms and cartoons, WSVN opted to pour most of its resources into its news department and took on a news-intensive format\u2014expanding its newscasts to seven hours on weekdays\u2014a move that was pilloried at the time since its newscasts had consistently finished well behind WTVJ and WPLG in the ratings.<ref>[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-09-13/features/8802220537_1_ed-ansin-wsvn-station Emphasis On News A Bold Move For Ch. 7], ''Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel'', September 13, 1988.</ref> Because of this, the station had a higher local newscast output than the rest of Fox's stations did at the time of the switch; when WSVN became a Fox affiliate, only a small number of Fox stations ran local newscasts, which were largely limited to late prime time slots (as of 2014, about \u00be of Fox's stations have morning newscasts, but only about one-third of its owned-and-operated stations and affiliates carry newscasts in either the midday or late afternoon/early evening time periods). In addition to newscasts, WSVN began to air a lot of first-run [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[talk show]]s, [[court show]]s, and off-network [[drama (film and television)|drama]] series. As Fox lacked a national evening newscast (a situation which continues to this day), the station also ran a half-hour late afternoon simulcast of [[HLN (TV channel)|CNN Headline News]] during the early and mid-1990s.\n\nThe station ran some cartoons on weekend mornings as well, it originally aired [[Fox Kids]] when Fox launched the block on September 8, 1990, however, it would become the first Fox station in the country to stop carrying the block in 1993, Fox Kids subsequently moved to WDZL, before moving again to [[WAMI-DT|WAMI]] (channel 69) in 1998, [[WBFS-TV]] (channel 33) aired the successor [[4Kids TV]] block until it ended on December 27, 2008. By coincidence, when [[New World Pictures#New World Communications (1992\u20131997)|New World Communications]] switched most of its \"Big Three\"-affiliated stations to Fox between 1994 and 1996, the programming on those stations was very similar in format to WSVN, except that their news formats may have been aimed at an older audience than WSVN's, many stations owned by New World also passed on Fox Kids just as WSVN did. In the early 1990s, the station added a few off-network sitcoms to its schedule such as ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', and ''[[Empty Nest]]'' (the latter two being set in Miami).\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WSVNlogo.jpg|205px|thumb|left|WSVN's 2001-2009 news open.{{ffdc|1=WSVNlogo.jpg|log=2016 January 15}}]] -->\nAs a Fox affiliate, the station brands itself as \"WSVN 7\", rather than \"Fox 7\" under Fox's branding guidelines for its owned-and-operated stations and affiliates ([[Boston]] sister station [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] formerly used its affiliated network's name in its branding as \"7 NBC\" until it became an independent station in January 2017, although NBC is not as strict with station branding as Fox is), and is one of a handful of Fox affiliates that omit network references entirely from their branding. However, [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]] refers to the station as \"Fox 7\" when carrying WSVN's coverage of breaking news stories from South Florida; until its website was remodeled in late 2009, the Fox logo also occasionally appeared in a rolling marquee alongside the station's \"circle 7\" logo on the top left hand corner of the site. At the time of the 1989 switch, the network's owned-and-operated stations and certain affiliates were the only Fox stations to use full network references, while other stations\u2014like original Miami affiliate WCIX used limited to no references to Fox in their branding. Miami\u2013Fort Lauderdale is one of two U.S. television markets in which the Fox affiliation had moved from one VHF station to another (the other being [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], if stations not operating as [[Broadcast relay station#Satellite stations|satellites]] are counted, as Fox charter affiliate [[KHNL]] and NBC affiliate [[KHON-TV]] swapped affiliations on January 1, 1996) and the only known instance of a longtime \"Big Three\" affiliate switching to Fox prior to its [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|1994 affiliation agreement]] with New World Communications and the affiliation transactions that resulted from the deal.\n\nWSVN ended programming on its analog signal, on [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]].

As time went on, though, most Fox stations began relying more on talk and court shows, as well as local newscasts. Channel 7 runs only a slightly heavier amount of local news programming than other Fox stations (which have gradually increased their news outputs over the last 15 years). WSVN continues not to feature any sitcoms as part of its syndication inventory, somewhat atypical for a news-intensive Fox station.\n\n===Sports programming===\nIn 1966, with the establishment of the [[Miami Dolphins]] of the [[American Football League]], the station, via [[NFL on NBC|NBC]], which held the league's broadcast rights, became the station of record for the new team. This alliance continued until the end of the [[1988 Miami Dolphins season|1988 season]], when most games moved over to WTVJ (today, most games are aired by WFOR). Since 1994, the station airs at least two Dolphins games a season via the [[Fox NFL|NFL on Fox]], usually when the team plays host to an [[National Football Conference|NFC]] team at [[Hard Rock Stadium]], however, starting in [[2014 Miami Dolphins season|2014]], with the institution of the NFL's new broadcast 'cross-flex' rules, more games can be seen on Channel 7 when they are moved from WFOR, and since 2018, via Fox's exclusive contract, [[Thursday Night Football]] games. In addition, any [[Miami Marlins]] games featured as part of Fox's MLB broadcast contract are aired on channel 7, this included their victory in the [[2003 World Series]], when the team was still the Florida Marlins. The station was also the local broadcaster of [[Super Bowl LIV]] which was held at Hard Rock Stadium, as Fox [[NFL on Fox|had the national television rights]] to the game; it also previously served as the home broadcaster of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] which was also on Fox.\n\n==News operation==\nWSVN presently broadcasts 63\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 10\u00bd hours each weekday, six hours on Saturdays and five hours on Sundays), in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output of any local television station in Miami. Unlike other news-intensive Fox stations, WSVN carries newscasts at 5:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m., and 6:30 p.m. on both Saturdays and Sundays (others either air early evening newscasts on weekends at different times on Saturdays and Sundays [i.e., Saturdays at 6:00 p.m. and Sundays at 5:00 p.m.], air them either at only 5:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. on both nights or do not carry newscasts in that particular weekend time period at all), however, WSVN's weekend 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. newscasts are subject to preemption and/or delay due to network sports telecasts running into the timeslot. In addition, the station produces the entertainment news/lifestyle program ''[[Deco Drive]]'' (which airs at 7:30 p.m. weeknights). The station is affiliated with [[CNN]] for news.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Keith|last2=Preuss|first2=Andreas|title=Millions of dollars found stashed in buckets at Miami home, police say|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/30/us/florida-cash-drugs-gun-found-in-home/|accessdate=June 30, 2016|work=CNN|date=June 30, 2016|quote=...told CNN affiliate WSVN.}}</ref>\n\nWhen the station gained the Fox affiliation on January 1, 1989, it retained a news schedule similar to the one it had as an NBC affiliate, in its early years with Fox, local news programming on the station ran on weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., Noon to 1:00 p.m., 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., weekends from 6:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. and nightly from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. The station became the second Fox affiliate to have a weekday morning newscast as a result and was the first one with weeknight 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. newscasts. On the date of the network switch, WSVN debuted a locally produced early evening [[newsmagazine|news magazine]] program, ''Inside Story'', the program eventually evolved into its present entertainment-based format as ''7:30'' (in reference to its timeslot) in 1994, and later changed its title to the current ''Deco Drive'' in 1996.\n\nUnder [[news director]] [[Joel Cheatwood]], WSVN became well known in South Florida, and throughout the nation, for its emphasis on crime stories and sensationalistic reporting\u2014summarized in the phrase, \"if it bleeds, it leads.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Jicha|first=Tom|title=News Show To Get WSVN's Familiar Tabloid Touch|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-03-29/features/9101160152_1_newscast-joel-cheatwood-wsvn|accessdate=July 9, 2012|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel]]|date=March 29, 1991}}</ref> Although this embrace of [[tabloid television]] was criticized, it rejuvenated a station that had languished in third place for most of its tenure with NBC. Within a few years, with anchor Rick Sanchez at the helm, WSVN became the market's highest-rated English-language station from sign-on to sign-off,<ref>http://www.flnewscenter.com/archives/696.html</ref> a rank it would hold for the better part of two decades until it was overtaken for the title by WFOR, though WSVN has been a solid runner-up and has tied for second with WPLG.\n\n[[Image:WSVN HD.JPG|225px|thumb|left|WSVN's Pre-2015 HD Newsplex studio.]]\nWSVN's success also influenced how newscasts on other Fox affiliates would look in later years; the station's decision to take on a news-intensive schedule would eventually serve as the template for the programming formats of the former \"Big Three\" stations that switched to Fox as a result of its 1994 affiliation agreement with New World Communications and certain transactions related to the deal, and was gradually adopted by many heritage Fox stations and certain news-producing stations that are not affiliated with the network, NBC, CBS or ABC. It was also the first station to take a cue from CNN, integrating its newsroom and studio into one large area, which the station has termed the \"newsplex\". It evolved out of their initial two sets around the time of the network switch in the late 1980s: one used for its morning and 5:00 p.m. newscasts, which was a small, enclosed area in the newsroom, and its main set, which was positioned in the station's control room. Other stations and networks, both in the U.S. and internationally, have taken cues from WSVN's set. The overall format was successful enough in Miami that in 1993, Ed Ansin assigned Cheatwood to overhaul Sunbeam's newly acquired Boston station WHDH, incorporating a considerably watered-down version of the WSVN format for its newscasts; as in Miami, the tabloid style helped WHDH rise from a perennial third place into a contender for first in the news ratings (against the more traditional [[WCVB-TV]]). WHDH uses many visual cues taken from WSVN including the use of flashy graphics, distinct music packages composed by Chris Crane (who has composed the various custom news themes used by WSVN since 1991) and a similarly designed \"newsplex\" set; WSVN's \"circle 7\" logo was also adopted by WHDH after Sunbeam assumed ownership.
