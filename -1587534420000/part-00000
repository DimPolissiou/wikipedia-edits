Other buildings are the [[Pest house]], [[Smokehouse]], and [[Barn]].\n\n===The Almshouse===\nConstructed of local limestone in 1872, the Almshouse was damaged by a fire in 1919 after which it was rebuilt. The building has been used in several different capacities since 1958 when modern methods of caring for the indigent dictated its closing as a poorhouse. The Historical Society and various county agencies have been located in the Almshouse since 1959. During the [[Cold War]], the Almshouse was used as a [[fallout shelter]]; emergency supplies from that era still reside in the basement.

Chief of these is  the [[Almshouse]] which houses the offices and library. Other buildings are the [[Pest house]], [[Smokehouse]], and [[Barn]].\n\n===The Almshouse===\nConstructed of local limestone in 1872, the Almshouse was damaged by a fire in 1919 after which it was rebuilt. The building has been used in several different capacities since 1958 when modern methods of caring for the indigent dictated its closing as a poorhouse. The Historical Society and various county agencies have been located in the Almshouse since 1959. During the [[Cold War]], the Almshouse was used as a [[fallout shelter]]; emergency supplies from that era still reside in the basement. The Almshouse was designated a Baltimore County Landmark in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=Landmarks List|url=http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/Agencies/planning/historic_preservation/landmarks_list.html|publisher=Baltimore County|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Baltimore County Pest House, in County Home Park, 2003.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The Pest House in 2003]]\n\n===The Pest House===\nThe Pest House (referring to [[Infectious disease|pestilence]]) was used to [[quarantine]] residents who were ill.

HMML\u2019s mission is to identify, digitally photograph, catalog, and archive the contents of [[manuscripts]] belonging to threatened communities and to make the copies available to users around the world through online catalogs.<ref>[http://www.hmml.org/frequently-asked-questions.html \"HMML: Frequently Asked Questions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313101422/http://www.hmml.org/frequently-asked-questions.html |date=2014-03-13 }}, ''Hill Museum & Manuscript Library''.</ref>\n\nSince its founding in 1965, HMML has partnered with 540 libraries and archives to photograph more than 140,000 manuscript books dating from the ancient to early modern eras, totaling some 40 million handwritten pages. HMML serves three constituencies: communities or libraries with endangered manuscript collections; scholars who research manuscript and textual history; and the non-specialist general public interested in the transmission of human knowledge and artistic creativity in manuscript form.\n\nIn October 2015, HMML launched a new and comprehensive online resource for manuscript studies, vHMML or \u201cVirtual HMML.\" at www.vhmml.org. A crucial extension of vHMML, vHMML Reading Room, went live at the end in the summer of 2016: https://www.vhmml.org/readingRoom/. vHMML Reading Room gives registered users access to HMML\u2019s photographic manuscript archives from around the world. The initial collections available in vHMML Reading Room include representative samples of HMML\u2019s diverse microfilm and digital resources, including images from Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and India. Highlights include manuscripts from Iraq and the famed Timbuktu manuscripts of Mali.\n\nOver 6,000 complete manuscripts in thirty languages are now in vHMML Reading Room. vHMML Reading Room lets users search for manuscripts by country, repository, author, language, genre, date, features, city or even script. Even uncataloged collections will be hosted in vHMML Reading Room, lowering all barriers to scholarly access. Users can contribute cataloging metadata using a simple tool only a click away. Researchers can view a highly-zoomable single page or view the manuscript as a larger whole.\n\nIn addition to its manuscript collections, HMML holds works of art and rare printed books from the Middle Ages to the present <ref>[http://www.csbsju.edu/Academics/Academic-Catalogs/2011-2012-catalog/SJU-overview/HMML.htm/ \"Hill Museum & Manuscript Library (HMML)\"], ''College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University''.</ref> and is home to ''[[The Saint John's Bible]]'', the first handwritten and illuminated Bible to have been commissioned by a Benedictine Abbey since the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] in the 15th century.<ref>[http://www.saintjohnsbible.org/process/principles_bible.htm/ \"A Bible for the Times\"], ''The Saint John's Bible''.</ref>\n\nSince 2003, [[Columba Stewart]], a monk of Saint John's Abbey, has served as HMML's executive director. HMML is located in the Alcuin Library, designed by Hungarian architect [[Marcel Breuer]].\n\n==How HMML Operates==\n\nHMML serves as the preservation archive in the event that original manuscripts are destroyed, stolen, or otherwise lost. For each collection to be digitized, HMML signs a contract with the owners of the manuscripts, who then receive copies of the images and retain commercial and publication rights. Collections never leave the owners. On-site digitizing work is done by local technicians trained and paid by HMML.  Administrative and funding activities are based at HMML\u2019s location in Collegeville, Minnesota, while catalogers from both Collegeville as well as from several countries contribute to the creation of metadata for the recently-digitized manuscripts. In addition, HMML maintains a field office in Beirut, Lebanon.<ref>[http://chronicle.com/article/A-Monk-Saves-Threatened/49283/ \"A Monk Saves Threatened Manuscripts Using Ultramodern Means\"], ''The Chronicle'', November 29, 2009.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Benedictine monks of [[Saint John's Abbey, Collegeville|Saint John's Abbey]] founded HMML in 1965 as a response to the loss of manuscripts and books in European libraries during two World Wars. Their plan was to create a [[microfilm]] collection of monastic manuscripts in Minnesota for safekeeping in the event that there would be another European war. Their work soon grew to include the microfilming of other manuscript collections throughout Europe and Ethiopia.<ref>[http://www.imls.gov/news/2011_medals_hill_museum_manuscript_library.aspx/ \"Hill Museum & Manuscript Library\"], ''Institute of Museum & Library Services''.</ref> HMML expanded its focus in 2003 to include the preservation of manuscripts from other [[Eastern Christian]] traditions. Two factors drove this decision: the importance of Eastern Christian cultures to world history and the unstable conditions found in many of the historic regions of Eastern Christianity. With the launch of this project, HMML began using digital technology to preserve collections. In addition to digitizing Christian manuscripts, HMML has also digitized Islamic manuscripts collections from libraries in Harar, Ethiopia and the Old City of Jerusalem.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion/july-dec10/sacredtexts_12-31.html/ \"Monastery Works to Preserve Ancient Christian Texts\"], ''PBS News Hour'', December 31, 2010.</ref> In 2014, HMML began working with [http://www.savamadci.net SAVAMA-DCI], a malian N60 founded by Dr. Abdel Kader Haidara, to digitize over 200,000 historic documents and manuscripts that were smuggled out of Timbuktu in 2013 and kept safe from radical Islamist rebels who were destroying works they considered to be in conflict with strict Islamic teachings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Where HMML is working|url=http://www.hmml.org/where-were-working.html|website=HMML|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> The copying of these [[Timbuktu Manuscripts]] is the largest project, by volume, of the HMML.<ref>{{cite news|title=Catholic monks in Minnesota are helping to save a trove of Islamic treasures in Mali|url=https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21683977-catholic-monks-minnesota-are-helping-save-trove-islamic-treasures|accessdate=20 December 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=19 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Collections at HMML==\n\nHMML holds photographic copies of more than 140,000 manuscript books and other handwritten documents from hundreds of partner libraries spread across Europe, Africa, and Asia.<ref>[http://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/grants/endangered-culture/hill-museum-and-manuscript-library/ \"Hill Museum & Manuscript Library\"], ''Arcadia''.</ref> Manuscripts photographed before 2003 are in microfilm format (especially collections from western Europe, Mali, Ethiopia and Malta), while later collections have been photographed digitally (Middle East, India, and recent projects in Ethiopia and Europe).

HMML\u2019s mission is to identify, digitally photograph, catalog, and archive the contents of [[manuscripts]] belonging to threatened communities and to make the copies available to users around the world through online catalogs.<ref>[http://www.hmml.org/frequently-asked-questions.html \"HMML: Frequently Asked Questions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313101422/http://www.hmml.org/frequently-asked-questions.html |date=2014-03-13 }}, ''Hill Museum & Manuscript Library''.</ref>\n\nSince its founding in 1965, HMML has partnered with 540 libraries and archives to photograph more than 140,000 manuscript books dating from the ancient to early modern eras, totaling some 40 million handwritten pages. HMML serves three constituencies: communities or libraries with endangered manuscript collections; scholars who research manuscript and textual history; and the non-specialist general public interested in the transmission of human knowledge and artistic creativity in manuscript form.\n\nIn October 2015, HMML launched a new and comprehensive online resource for manuscript studies, vHMML or \u201cVirtual HMML.\" at www.vhmml.org. A crucial extension of vHMML, vHMML Reading Room, went live at the end in the summer of 2016: https://www.vhmml.org/readingRoom/. vHMML Reading Room gives registered users access to HMML\u2019s photographic manuscript archives from around the world. The initial collections available in vHMML Reading Room include representative samples of HMML\u2019s diverse microfilm and digital resources, including images from Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and India. Highlights include manuscripts from Iraq and the famed Timbuktu manuscripts of Mali.\n\nOver 6,000 complete manuscripts in thirty languages are now in vHMML Reading Room. vHMML Reading Room lets users search for manuscripts by country, repository, author, language, genre, date, features, city or even script. Even uncataloged collections will be hosted in vHMML Reading Room, lowering all barriers to scholarly access. Users can contribute cataloging metadata using a simple tool only a click away. Researchers can view a highly-zoomable single page or view the manuscript as a larger whole.\n\nIn addition to its manuscript collections, HMML holds works of art and rare printed books from the Middle Ages to the present <ref>[http://www.csbsju.edu/Academics/Academic-Catalogs/2011-2012-catalog/SJU-overview/HMML.htm/ \"Hill Museum & Manuscript Library (HMML)\"], ''College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University''.</ref> and is home to ''[[The Saint John's Bible]]'', the first handwritten and illuminated Bible to have been commissioned by a Benedictine Abbey since the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] in the 15th century.<ref>[http://www.saintjohnsbible.org/process/principles_bible.htm/ \"A Bible for the Times\"], ''The Saint John's Bible''.</ref>\n\nSince 2003, [[Columba Stewart]], a monk of Saint John's Abbey, has served as HMML's executive director. HMML is located in the Alcuin Library, designed by Hungarian architect [[Marcel Breuer]].\n\n==How HMML Operates==\n\nHMML serves as the preservation archive in the event that original manuscripts are destroyed, stolen, or otherwise lost. For each collection to be digitized, HMML signs a contract with the owners of the manuscripts, who then receive copies of the images and retain commercial and publication rights. Collections never leave the owners. On-site digitizing work is done by local technicians trained and paid by HMML.  Administrative and funding activities are based at HMML\u2019s location in Collegeville, Minnesota, while catalogers from both Collegeville as well as from several countries contribute to the creation of metadata for the recently-digitized manuscripts. In addition, HMML maintains a field office in Beirut, Lebanon.<ref>[http://chronicle.com/article/A-Monk-Saves-Threatened/49283/ \"A Monk Saves Threatened Manuscripts Using Ultramodern Means\"], ''The Chronicle'', November 29, 2009.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Benedictine monks of [[Saint John's Abbey, Collegeville|Saint John's Abbey]] founded HMML in 1965 as a response to the loss of manuscripts and books in European libraries during two World Wars. Their plan was to create a [[microfilm]] collection of monastic manuscripts in Minnesota for safekeeping in the event that there would be another European war. Their work soon grew to include the microfilming of other manuscript collections throughout Europe and Ethiopia.<ref>[http://www.imls.gov/news/2011_medals_hill_museum_manuscript_library.aspx/ \"Hill Museum & Manuscript Library\"], ''Institute of Museum & Library Services''.</ref> HMML expanded its focus in 2003 to include the preservation of manuscripts from other [[Eastern Christian]] traditions. Two factors drove this decision: the importance of Eastern Christian cultures to world history and the unstable conditions found in many of the historic regions of Eastern Christianity. With the launch of this project, HMML began using digital technology to preserve collections. In addition to digitizing Christian manuscripts, HMML has also digitized Islamic manuscripts collections from libraries in Harar, Ethiopia and the Old City of Jerusalem.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion/july-dec10/sacredtexts_12-31.html/ \"Monastery Works to Preserve Ancient Christian Texts\"], ''PBS News Hour'', December 31, 2010.</ref> In 2014, HMML began working with [http://www.savamadci.net SAVAMA-DCI], a malian N60 founded by Dr. Abdel Kader Haidara, to digitize over 200,000 historic documents and manuscripts that were smuggled out of Timbuktu in 2013 and kept safe from radical Islamist rebels who were destroying works they considered to be in conflict with strict Islamic teachings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Where HMML is working|url=http://www.hmml.org/where-were-working.html|website=HMML|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> The copying of these [[Timbuktu Manuscripts]] is the largest project, by volume, of the HMML.<ref>{{cite news|title=Catholic monks in Minnesota are helping to save a trove of Islamic treasures in Mali|url=https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21683977-catholic-monks-minnesota-are-helping-save-trove-islamic-treasures|accessdate=20 December 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=19 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Collections at HMML==\n\nHMML holds photographic copies of more than 140,000 manuscript books and other handwritten documents from hundreds of partner libraries spread across Europe, Africa, and Asia.<ref>[http://www.arcadiafund.org.uk/grants/endangered-culture/hill-museum-and-manuscript-library/ \"Hill Museum & Manuscript Library\"], ''Arcadia''.</ref> Manuscripts photographed before 2003 are in microfilm format (especially collections from western Europe, Mali, Ethiopia and Malta), while later collections have been photographed digitally (Middle East, India, and recent projects in Ethiopia and Europe).

The Bar Association was a stock corporation that allowed members to pay for stock by contributing books, the value of which was determined by an appraisal committee. The law library's first location was a room on the second floor of a building on Nicollet Avenue adjoining the First National Bank at Washington Avenue. In August 1883 the collection was moved to the Academy of Music Building, at the corner of Washington and Hennepin Avenues. This magnificent building, a showplace for the arts and the center of the city's entertainment district, was gutted by fire on Christmas Day, 1884. The law library was completely destroyed. With the insurance proceeds of $15,000, the Bar Association began rebuilding the law library, which opened in the Boston Block on May 1, 1885. This was another famous building that boasted the first indoor court in Minneapolis. But in April 1886, it was also struck by fire, destroying the law library for a second time. With the insurance of $20,000, a third law library was established in the Temple Court building, which occupied the site of the former Academy of Music Building. By 1895 the law library contained about 7,000 volumes. In 1903 it was provided accommodations in Room 434 of the new Court House and City Hall building. In 1960 the law library moved to Room 318, where it remained until its move in September 1976 to its present location in the [[Hennepin County Government Center]].\n\nThe law library is named for Anne W. Grande, who served as law librarian for 33 years, from 1975 to 2008.\n\nThe law library was renovated in the summer of 2016.\n\n== Staff ==\nAccording to a 1941 Hennepin Lawyer article by Thomas Kneeland, one of the incorporators of the Minneapolis Bar Association, the Bar Association employed three librarians during the time it owned the law library. Kneeland listed the first as Edward S. Waters, though a newspaper article on December 26, 1884 in the Minneapolis Evening Journal stated that F. S. Gaylord was the librarian at the time of the Christmas Day fire. The History of the Bench and Bar of Minnesota, by Hiram F. Stevens (Minneapolis: Legal Publishing and Engraving Co., 1904) lists E.S. Waters as Treasurer of the Minneapolis Bar Association in 1904. Kneeland listed the second librarian as Frederic Klapp, who was succeeded in 1921 by his son, S. D.

The governing agency is a seven-member Board of Trustees consisting of three judges of the Fourth Judicial District, three practicing [[Lawyer|attorneys]], and a member of the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners.<ref>[http://www.hennepin.us/your-government#leadership Hennepin County Board of Commissioners]</ref> The library, which is open to the public, is funded by a combination of court fees, user fees, and an appropriation from the Hennepin County general revenue fund.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Hennepin County Law Library had its origin when the Minneapolis Bar Association incorporated on February 20, 1883. The Bar Association was a stock corporation that allowed members to pay for stock by contributing books, the value of which was determined by an appraisal committee. The law library's first location was a room on the second floor of a building on Nicollet Avenue adjoining the First National Bank at Washington Avenue. In August 1883 the collection was moved to the Academy of Music Building, at the corner of Washington and Hennepin Avenues. This magnificent building, a showplace for the arts and the center of the city's entertainment district, was gutted by fire on Christmas Day, 1884. The law library was completely destroyed. With the insurance proceeds of $15,000, the Bar Association began rebuilding the law library, which opened in the Boston Block on May 1, 1885. This was another famous building that boasted the first indoor court in Minneapolis. But in April 1886, it was also struck by fire, destroying the law library for a second time. With the insurance of $20,000, a third law library was established in the Temple Court building, which occupied the site of the former Academy of Music Building. By 1895 the law library contained about 7,000 volumes. In 1903 it was provided accommodations in Room 434 of the new Court House and City Hall building. In 1960 the law library moved to Room 318, where it remained until its move in September 1976 to its present location in the [[Hennepin County Government Center]].\n\nThe law library is named for Anne W. Grande, who served as law librarian for 33 years, from 1975 to 2008.\n\nThe law library was renovated in the summer of 2016.\n\n== Staff ==\nAccording to a 1941 Hennepin Lawyer article by Thomas Kneeland, one of the incorporators of the Minneapolis Bar Association, the Bar Association employed three librarians during the time it owned the law library. Kneeland listed the first as Edward S. Waters, though a newspaper article on December 26, 1884 in the Minneapolis Evening Journal stated that F. S. Gaylord was the librarian at the time of the Christmas Day fire. The History of the Bench and Bar of Minnesota, by Hiram F. Stevens (Minneapolis: Legal Publishing and Engraving Co., 1904) lists E.S. Waters as Treasurer of the Minneapolis Bar Association in 1904. Kneeland listed the second librarian as Frederic Klapp, who was succeeded in 1921 by his son, S. D. Kapp, who served until his death in 1937. Hennepin County law librarians include Lillian W. Taylor (1937-1944), Buelah C. Blaisdell (1944-1948), Ethel Kommes (1948-1975), Anne Grande (1975-2008), Ed Carroll (2008\u20132015), Karen Westwood (2015-current).<ref>[http://www.hclawlib.org/about Hennepin County Law Library About Page]</ref>\n\n==External links==\n* Hennepin County Law Library [http://hclaw.co.hennepin.mn.us website].\n* [http://www.hclawlib.org/about Board of Trustees]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|44.975848|-93.266339|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-MN|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Libraries in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Law libraries]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Minneapolis]]\n[[Category:Education in Minneapolis]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennepin_County_Law_Library"}

Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K.

Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk).

Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild.

It is located near the Pew Campus of [[Grand Valley State University]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. Ford's presidential museum is the only such facility under the auspices of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] to be separate from the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library|presidential library]], which is located approximately {{convert|130|mi|km}} to the east in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. Despite the separation, the library and museum are a single institution with one director.\n\n==Gerald Ford==\n{{main|Gerald Ford}}\n[[File:Ford A0627-09.jpeg|left|thumb|President Ford announcing his pardon of Richard Nixon from the Oval Office. September 8, 1974.]]\nGerald Rudolph Ford, Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King, Jr.) was born on July 14, 1913. Ford served nearly 25 years as a [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] of [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]], eight of them as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]]. Serving from 1973 to 1974 as the 40th [[Vice President of the United States]], Ford was the first person appointed to the vice-presidency under the terms of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]]. He then became President upon [[Richard Nixon]]'s resignation on August 9, 1974, and served until [[Inauguration of Jimmy Carter|January 20, 1977]] as the 38th [[President of the United States]]. Ford is the only President of the United States who was not elected by ballot for his terms as either President or Vice-President.\n\n==Building and dedication of the museum==\nFunds for the construction of the museum were raised from over 14,000 individual donations through the efforts of the Gerald Ford Commemorative Committee, the University of Michigan, the State of [[Michigan]], [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent County]], and the City of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]].\n\nThe {{convert|44000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} two-story triangular museum was designed by Marvin DeWinter Associates and built at a cost of $11 million. The museum is one of the highlights in a {{convert|20|acre|adj=on}} park complex that includes the [[Grand Rapids Public Museum]] along the west bank of the Grand River in downtown Grand Rapids. The building was dedicated September 18, 1981, with a gala celebration attended by [[Ronald Reagan|President]] and [[Nancy Reagan|Mrs. Reagan]], President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] of Mexico, Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Sunao Sonoda]], former French President [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], and former Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]].

Other exhibits, which are the core of the museum's program, enable visitors to travel by video with President Ford and Secretary Kissinger to various hot-spots around the globe; take a holographic tour of the Ford White House; and experience a day in the Oval Office through a sound and light show. A [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] gallery includes a six-minute, multi-screen history beginning with the June 1972 break-in and a display of the actual burglary tools. An interactive [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]] allows visitors to take part in presidential decision making. Visitors can see gifts presented by heads of state and other foreign dignitaries, as well as personal gifts to Ford from the American people.

Ford Presidential Foundation whose mission is to support historical exhibits, educational programs, conferences, research grants, and awards. In addition to providing funding for the library and museum, the foundation publishes a semi-annual report of activities, sponsors the [[William E. Simon]] Lectures in Public Affairs, awards journalism prizes for excellence in reporting on the presidency and defense issues and awards grants-in-aid of up to $2,000 to researchers who use the Ford Library archival holdings. Another part of the foundation's mission is to honor the principles and values demonstrated by Gerald Ford throughout his public service career.\n\nWith the assistance of the Ford Presidential Foundation, the museum sponsors scholarly conferences and community activities independently or in conjunction with other organizations such as the University of Michigan and the Domestic Policy Association.\n\nMuseum staff organizes and hosts special events that range from period fashion shows to activities for school children and in-service workshops for area teachers. The museum annually hosts naturalization ceremonies for new citizens and opens the grounds to community festivities and [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] fireworks. Other regular programs at the museum include the ''Great Decisions Lecture Series'' which brings guest speakers on selected foreign policy topics and features audience discussions and completion of \"opinion ballots\". It maintains an ongoing partnership with the [[Close Up Foundation]] that encourages student awareness of public issues and sponsors a Citizens Bee, a competitive exam for high school students with questions focused on history and political affairs. The American Political Film Series annually presents eight motion pictures that frequently deal with highly charged topics for discussion. At Christmas time, area youth are invited to create ornaments for the large tree in the museum lobby.\n\n==In the media==\nThe library was the taping site of a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series on ''The Presidency and the Constitution'' that aired in 1987. In December 1988, it hosted a gathering of representatives from 44 nations for an All-Democracies Conference.

Before the 1920s ended in the worst [[stock market crash]] in history, [[United States|America]] underwent a transformation from 19th century [[Victorian era|Victorian life]] and business to a 20th-century dynamo, setting the standard for a transformed society and industrial giant.

It is located near the Pew Campus of [[Grand Valley State University]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. Ford's presidential museum is the only such facility under the auspices of the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] to be separate from the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library|presidential library]], which is located approximately {{convert|130|mi|km}} to the east in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. Despite the separation, the library and museum are a single institution with one director.\n\n==Gerald Ford==\n{{main|Gerald Ford}}\n[[File:Ford A0627-09.jpeg|left|thumb|President Ford announcing his pardon of Richard Nixon from the Oval Office. September 8, 1974.]]\nGerald Rudolph Ford, Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King, Jr.) was born on July 14, 1913. Ford served nearly 25 years as a [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] of [[Michigan's 5th congressional district]], eight of them as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]]. Serving from 1973 to 1974 as the 40th [[Vice President of the United States]], Ford was the first person appointed to the vice-presidency under the terms of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]]. He then became President upon [[Richard Nixon]]'s resignation on August 9, 1974, and served until [[Inauguration of Jimmy Carter|January 20, 1977]] as the 38th [[President of the United States]]. Ford is the only President of the United States who was not elected by ballot for his terms as either President or Vice-President.\n\n==Building and dedication of the museum==\nFunds for the construction of the museum were raised from over 14,000 individual donations through the efforts of the Gerald Ford Commemorative Committee, the University of Michigan, the State of [[Michigan]], [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent County]], and the City of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]].\n\nThe {{convert|44000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} two-story triangular museum was designed by Marvin DeWinter Associates and built at a cost of $11 million. The museum is one of the highlights in a {{convert|20|acre|adj=on}} park complex that includes the [[Grand Rapids Public Museum]] along the west bank of the Grand River in downtown Grand Rapids. The building was dedicated September 18, 1981, with a gala celebration attended by [[Ronald Reagan|President]] and [[Nancy Reagan|Mrs. Reagan]], President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] of Mexico, Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Sunao Sonoda]], former French President [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], and former Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]]. [[Bob Hope]] served as master of ceremonies and part of the festivities were recorded for TV broadcast.<ref name=\"globe\">{{cite news |title= Reagan Praises Ford at Opening of Museum |first= Brian |last= Tucker |url= http://www.boston.com/news/specials/gerald_ford/articles/ford_museum_opens/ |date= September 18, 1981 |accessdate= February 26, 2014 |work= [[The Boston Globe]] |agency= [[Associated Press]]}}</ref> The east side of the structure is enclosed by a {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} glass wall providing a view of the river and downtown Grand Rapids beyond. The main entrance features a reflecting pool and fountain to welcome visitors. The site is linked with downtown hotels and shops by a pedestrian bridge spanning the river.\n\nThe core exhibits were completely redesigned as part of a major building expansion completed in 1997 allowing for a broader program of changing feature exhibits and events. Expanded funding from the Gerald R.

Other exhibits, which are the core of the museum's program, enable visitors to travel by video with President Ford and Secretary Kissinger to various hot-spots around the globe; take a holographic tour of the Ford White House; and experience a day in the Oval Office through a sound and light show. A [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] gallery includes a six-minute, multi-screen history beginning with the June 1972 break-in and a display of the actual burglary tools. An interactive [[Cabinet Room (White House)|Cabinet Room]] allows visitors to take part in presidential decision making. Visitors can see gifts presented by heads of state and other foreign dignitaries, as well as personal gifts to Ford from the American people. The award-winning film, \"A Time To Heal,\" is shown hourly in the museum auditorium. A section of the [[Berlin Wall]] stands in the museum's lobby, which was dedicated by Ford on September 6, 1991.<ref name=\"use\">{{cite web |title= Use of the Museum Facility |url= http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/museum/venue.asp |publisher= Gerald R.

Ford Museum in 1986]]\nThe Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum are sponsored by the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation whose mission is to support historical exhibits, educational programs, conferences, research grants, and awards. In addition to providing funding for the library and museum, the foundation publishes a semi-annual report of activities, sponsors the [[William E. Simon]] Lectures in Public Affairs, awards journalism prizes for excellence in reporting on the presidency and defense issues and awards grants-in-aid of up to $2,000 to researchers who use the Ford Library archival holdings. Another part of the foundation's mission is to honor the principles and values demonstrated by Gerald Ford throughout his public service career.\n\nWith the assistance of the Ford Presidential Foundation, the museum sponsors scholarly conferences and community activities independently or in conjunction with other organizations such as the University of Michigan and the Domestic Policy Association.\n\nMuseum staff organizes and hosts special events that range from period fashion shows to activities for school children and in-service workshops for area teachers. The museum annually hosts naturalization ceremonies for new citizens and opens the grounds to community festivities and [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] fireworks. Other regular programs at the museum include the ''Great Decisions Lecture Series'' which brings guest speakers on selected foreign policy topics and features audience discussions and completion of \"opinion ballots\". It maintains an ongoing partnership with the [[Close Up Foundation]] that encourages student awareness of public issues and sponsors a Citizens Bee, a competitive exam for high school students with questions focused on history and political affairs. The American Political Film Series annually presents eight motion pictures that frequently deal with highly charged topics for discussion. At Christmas time, area youth are invited to create ornaments for the large tree in the museum lobby.\n\n==In the media==\nThe library was the taping site of a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series on ''The Presidency and the Constitution'' that aired in 1987. In December 1988, it hosted a gathering of representatives from 44 nations for an All-Democracies Conference. Perhaps the most popular conference sponsored by the library and museum was ''Humor and the Presidency'' held at the museum September 17\u201319, 1986.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |title= Timeline of President Ford's Life and Career |url= http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/grf/timeline.asp |date= January 11, 2007 |publisher= Gerald R.

Before the 1920s ended in the worst [[stock market crash]] in history, [[United States|America]] underwent a transformation from 19th century [[Victorian era|Victorian life]] and business to a 20th-century dynamo, setting the standard for a transformed society and industrial giant.
