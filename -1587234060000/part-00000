Dennis McIntyre came to America in the 1850s and was a railroad car inspector for the West Point and Alabama Railroad. He settled first in Georgia, where he met his wife, and the family had moved to Alabama by 1860, when they are listed in census records. Dennis is listed on the roster of the Montgomery County Home Guard, CSA, in 1864. His wife Mary was originally from Crossmolina, County Mayo, where many Gaughans reside. She moved to Georgia in the 1850s to join her brother, Patrick Gaughan. Patrick later moved to Camden, Arkansas. He enlisted in the 33rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment, CSA, in 1863.   The surname [[McIntyre]] is a Scottish Highland name (also spelled MacIntyre) that means \"son of the carpenter\" or wright. The Gaelic original is ''Mac an-T Saoir''. McIntyres were originally to be found in Lorne where they possessed the lands of Glenoe from the 13th century until the early 19th century. According to family tradition, the MacIntyres/McIntyres came originally from the Hebrides. In the 13th century, they sailed from their ancestral home carrying a white cow, and settled on the mainland at Glen Noe by Ben Cruachan. On the mainland the MacIntyres/McIntyres were hereditary foresters  to the lords of Lorne. For many years, they paid the Campbells of Glenorchy a symbolic rent of a white calf and a snowball for their Glen Noe lands. During the 18th century, the rent was commuted to cash, then progressively raised. Donald, the 4th MacIntyre chief, could not pay so he emigrated to Canada. His brother and successor Captain Donald MacIntyre the fifth chief, tried but failed to make ends meet and the Glen Noe lands were lost two hundred years ago, in 1808. The present Clan Chief is Donald MacIntyre of Glenoe.\n\nFrank McIntyre was a grandson of James and Norah McIntyre of The Brockey, Killybegs, County Donegal, Ireland. His grandmother was Norah Cannon, the daughter of Dennis and Jane Cannon (n\u00e9e McBraerty) of Killybegs, County Donegal. Her sister Mary Cannon married Thomas Murrin of Croaghlin (1804\u20131882) Banagh barony, Killybegs, County Donegal, their daughter Jane Murrin (1829\u20131903) married Charles Dawson Lea (1819\u20131883) in 1851. Their son John Edward Dawson Lea (1859\u20131929) married Hannora McIntyre his cousin, who died on 10 October 1938.  John and Hannorah lived at Rathmines, Dublin, and Aileach House, Killybegs, County Donegal, where his cousin and sister-in-law Agnes McIntyre also lived and where she died on 5 February 1990, aged 92. Agnes and Hannorah McIntyre were first cousins of General Frank McIntyre and Judge Patrick McIntyre. On the distaff side their first cousin was S\u00e9amus Hegarty, D.D. an Irish Roman Catholic prelate, who served as Bishop of Raphoe from 1982 to 1994, then as Bishop of Derry from 1994 to 2011. Agnes and Hannorah were the daughters of John and Mary McIntyre n\u00e9e Carr, and like Frank the grandchildren of James and Nora McIntyre, Nora being a Cannon.\n\nThe Cannons are descended from two of Ireland's most renowned Kings: Conn of the Hundred Battles and Niall of the Nine Hostages. The O'Cannons have been described as \"Ancient Princes of Tir Connaill\" and \"Valiant Chiefs\". However their 350-year dynasty in Tir Connaill ended in 1250. Their ancient territory would seem to have been Tir Aeda (now the barony of Tirhigh) after the deaths of Rory O' Canannain and his son Niall O'Canannain in 1250, the sept declined greatly in power. Brian O'Neill died ten years later in 1260, he had supported an O'Canannain claimant to Tir Conaill i.e. to the Kingdom of Tir Conaill (Tirconnell).  The personal name Canannain is a diminutive of Cano meaning 'wolf cub'. Canannain was fifth in descent from Flaithbertach mac Loingsig (died 765), high-king of Ireland; they were the descendants of Neill of the Nine Hostages (Irish: Niall Noigiallach) who died c. 405 by his son, Conall Gulban who gave his name to Tir Conaill, the Land of Conall, now County Donegal.\n\nUi Canannain was the ancestral name of the Cannons and Tir Connaill (all of [[County Donegal]] and part of [[County Londonderry]]) was the \"Land of the Cannons\". By the early 17th century the name Ui Canannain had been anglicised to O'Cannon. Further anglicisation took place during the Penal laws in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and the name in County Donegal became Cannon. In the early 1880s, there were just 200 families bearing the Cannon surname living in County Donegal, who were mainly tenant farmers. The Cannons/O'Canannains, were of the ancient sept of  Cenell Conaill, a branch of the northern Ui Neill and descend from Ruaidri ua Canannain (died 30 November 950) King of Cenel Conaill, and grandson of Canannain, who flourished in the second half of the 9th century.  One of Neill's most famous descendants was George Washington, the first President of the United States of America. The site of the ancient seat of the O'Canannains was near Letterkenny the largest town of County  Donegal, which is said on good authority to represent the hillside of the O'Cannons (English translation).\n\n==Education ==\nFrank McIntyre was educated in public and private schools in Montgomery and at The University of Alabama from 1880 to 1882. While a student in Tuscaloosa, his professors noted his talents and recommended him for his home district's vacancy to West Point. McIntyre successfully passed a competitive examination and was enrolled at the United States Military Academy in the Fall of 1882. The son of Irish immigrants never forgot his roots. In a 1938 letter to his classmates at West Point, McIntyre reflected \"I can never forget the unsolicited kindness of these professors at the University [of Alabama] to a young boy without influence and with not the slightest obligation on their part. Their action reflects one phase of the spirit of Alabama. How could I forget it?\" McIntyre graduated from West Point in 1886, ranked tenth in his class.

During the [[World War I|War in Europe]], he was assistant chief of staff with the rank of [[Major General|major-general]]. McIntyre served as long-time Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs and played a significant role in the governance of the Philippines and Puerto Rico throughout this period. With respect to Puerto Rico, McIntyre wavered on the wisdom of granting [[United States citizenship]] to Puerto Ricans but ultimately supported the [[Jones\u2013Shafroth Act]] of 1917. At times, McIntyre had strained relations with other officials in Puerto Rico, such as U.S. District Judge and fellow Alabama native[[Peter J. Hamilton]] during the 1910s and Governor [[E. Mont Reily]] during the 1920s. In his 2007 book ''Planting the American Flag: Twelve Men Who Expanded the United States Overseas'', author Peter C. Stuart devoted an entire chapter to the career of Gen. McIntyre and his leadership of the Bureau of Insular Affairs. With respect to McIntyre's administration of the Philippines  and Puerto Rico, Stuart noted \" While others more assertive or egoistic imprinted on the protectorates their personal marks, McIntyre left no memorial....yet he wielded perhaps greater sway upon the United States' little empire than all his more visible imperial colleagues.\" Stuart credits Gen. McIntyre's stewardship over the Bureau of Insular Affairs as having been critical to its survival, and noting that within a decade following his retirement the Bureau was turned over to the Department of the Interior and disbanded in 1939. Reflecting upon the Bureau's demise, Stuart noted \"An era of American imperial administration--in many ways the McIntyre era--had ended.\"\n\nMcIntyre retired from the Army in 1929.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==In retirement ==\nFollowing retirement Gen. McIntyre served for several years as the Philippine trade commissioner in Washington and lived on Massachusetts Avenue. In this role he lobbied on behalf of the islands' interests.  He later purchased and maintained a home in Montgomery, Alabama on South Hull Street, from which he helped oversee the large plantation, cotton business, and real estate interests of his older brothers Jim and John McIntyre, who established McIntyre Brothers in 1878. The main plantation, named Killybegs after the ancestral hometown, is located in Ramer, Montgomery County, Alabama. Formerly 7600 acres, over 1500 acres remain in the McIntyre family as of 2019.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Personal life==\nHe was married in 1892 in [[Dallas]] to the former Marie Dennett, a native of [[New Orleans]] who grew up primarily in Texas. Marie Dennett was the daughter of James Wilson Dennett (1831-1888) a native of [[Huntsville, Alabama]] and Marie Dufilho Dennett, who was from an old New Orleans Creole family. James Dennett was an assistant quartermaster for the Confederacy in New Orleans prior to the Federals taking the city in 1862. Marie's great grandfather Christoval Toledano (1790-1869) was a sugar merchant and the son of Don Manuel Toledano y Valenzuela (1763-1806), a Spanish military official who arrived in New Orleans in the 1790s. Christoval served in Plauche's Battalion in the War of 1812 and fought at the Battle of New Orleans. The McIntyres were the parents of six children, who grew up primarily in Washington, DC: Frank Jr. James, Edward, Margaret, Marie, and Nora.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998|ISBN= 1571970886|oclc=40298151|page=259}}</ref> James continued the military tradition established by his father and retired as a major general in the United States Air Force. He served as the legislative liaison for the Air Force to Congress in the late 1940s, and is credited with helping establish the Air Force as an independent branch of the military through his efforts to help pass the National Security Act of 1947.

McIntyre served in the Philippines from 1899 to 1902, after which he served with the general staff.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n[[File:PHI-68c-Philippine Islands-Treasury Certificate-1 Peso (1924) Design proof.jpg|thumb|Design proof for a [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#American Period|1924 Philippine one peso note]], approved by McIntyre.]]\nMcIntyre was attached to the Bureau of Insular Affairs in 1905 and became its Chief in 1912, relieving General [[Clarence Ransom Edwards]].  During the [[World War I|War in Europe]], he was assistant chief of staff with the rank of [[Major General|major-general]]. McIntyre served as long-time Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs and played a significant role in the governance of the Philippines and Puerto Rico throughout this period. With respect to Puerto Rico, McIntyre wavered on the wisdom of granting [[United States citizenship]] to Puerto Ricans but ultimately supported the [[Jones\u2013Shafroth Act]] of 1917. At times, McIntyre had strained relations with other officials in Puerto Rico, such as U.S. District Judge and fellow Alabama native[[Peter J. Hamilton]] during the 1910s and Governor [[E. Mont Reily]] during the 1920s. In his 2007 book ''Planting the American Flag: Twelve Men Who Expanded the United States Overseas'', author Peter C. Stuart devoted an entire chapter to the career of Gen. McIntyre and his leadership of the Bureau of Insular Affairs. With respect to McIntyre's administration of the Philippines  and Puerto Rico, Stuart noted \" While others more assertive or egoistic imprinted on the protectorates their personal marks, McIntyre left no memorial....yet he wielded perhaps greater sway upon the United States' little empire than all his more visible imperial colleagues.\" Stuart credits Gen. McIntyre's stewardship over the Bureau of Insular Affairs as having been critical to its survival, and noting that within a decade following his retirement the Bureau was turned over to the Department of the Interior and disbanded in 1939. Reflecting upon the Bureau's demise, Stuart noted \"An era of American imperial administration--in many ways the McIntyre era--had ended.\"\n\nMcIntyre retired from the Army in 1929.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==In retirement ==\nFollowing retirement Gen. McIntyre served for several years as the Philippine trade commissioner in Washington and lived on Massachusetts Avenue. In this role he lobbied on behalf of the islands' interests.  He later purchased and maintained a home in Montgomery, Alabama on South Hull Street, from which he helped oversee the large plantation, cotton business, and real estate interests of his older brothers Jim and John McIntyre, who established McIntyre Brothers in 1878. The main plantation, named Killybegs after the ancestral hometown, is located in Ramer, Montgomery County, Alabama. Formerly 7600 acres, over 1500 acres remain in the McIntyre family as of 2019.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Personal life==\nHe was married in 1892 in Dallas to the former Marie Dennett, a native of New Orleans who grew up primarily in Texas. Marie Dennett was the daughter of James Wilson Dennett (1831-1888) a native of Huntsville, AL and Marie Dufilho Dennett, who was from an old New Orleans Creole family. James Dennett was an assistant quartermaster for the Confederacy in New Orleans prior to the Federals taking the city in 1862. Marie's great grandfather Christoval Toledano (1790-1869) was a sugar merchant and the son of Don Manuel Toledano y Valenzuela (1763-1806), a Spanish military official who arrived in New Orleans in the 1790s. Christoval served in Plauche's Battalion in the War of 1812 and fought at the Battle of New Orleans. The McIntyres were the parents of six children, who grew up primarily in Washington, DC: Frank Jr. James, Edward, Margaret, Marie, and Nora.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998|ISBN= 1571970886|oclc=40298151|page=259}}</ref> James continued the military tradition established by his father and retired as a major general in the United States Air Force.

Military berets are usually pushed to the right to free the shoulder that bears the rifle on most soldiers, but the armies of some countries, mostly within Europe, South America and Asia have influenced the push to the left.\n\nIn some countries, berets are associated with [[Military elite|elite units]], who often wear berets in more unusual colours. For instance, the [[maroon beret]] is mostly traditional headgear for elite [[airborne forces]] around the world with a few exceptions like the elite [[Russian Airborne Troops]] who instead wear a [[sky blue]] beret or the [[Portuguese Paratroopers]] that wear a [[green beret]].\n[[File:Bastille Day 2014 Paris - Color guards 010.jpg|thumb|270px|A Ukrainian military cadet in a light blue beret.]]\n[[File:ComandosPT.jpg|thumb|Portuguese Army Commandos with red beret|555x555px]]\n==History==\n[[File:C\u00e9sar PAYAN.jpg|thumb|right|A French ''[[chasseur alpin]]'' in World War I, with their distinctive large beret.]]\nThe use of beret-like headgear as a civilian headdress dates back hundreds of years, an early example being the Scottish Blue Bonnet, that became a ''de facto'' symbol of Scottish [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] forces in the 16th and 17th centuries. As an officially required military headdress, its use dates back to the [[Carlist Wars]] of Succession for the Spanish Crown in the 1830s by order of [[Carlism|Carlist]] General [[Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui]] who wanted a local and non-costly way to make headgear that was resistant to the mountain weather, easy to care for and could be used on formal occasions.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe French [[Chasseur Alpin|Chasseurs alpins]], created in the early 1880s, were the first regular unit to wear the military beret as a standard headgear.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.Y.|last=Carman|page=26|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniform|ISBN=0-684-15130-8}}</ref> These mountain troops were issued with a uniform which included several features which were innovative for the time, notably the large and floppy blue beret which they still retain.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Mollo|page=200|title=Military Fashion|ISBN=0-214-65349-8}}</ref> This was so unfamiliar a fashion outside France that it had to be described in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' of 1911 as \"a soft cap or [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]]\".<ref>\"Uniforms\", page 587, Volume XXVII ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911 Edition</ref>\n\nBerets have features that make them attractive to the military: they are cheap, easy to make in large numbers, can be manufactured in a wide range of colors, can be rolled up and stuffed into a pocket or beneath the shirt epaulette without damage, and can be worn with headphones (this is one of the reasons why early tank crews adopted the beret). The beret is not so useful in field conditions for the modern infantryman, who requires protective helmets, and non-camouflage versions are seldom seen on operations.\n\nThe beret was found particularly useful as a uniform for armored-vehicle crews, and the [[Royal Tank Regiment|British Tank Corps]] (later Royal Tank Corps) adopted the headdress as early as 1918.\n\nGerman AFV crews in the late 1930s also adopted a beret with the addition of a padded crash helmet inside. The colour black was worn by the Royal Tank Corps later Royal Tank Regiment, since it did not show oil stains picked up inside the interior of a vehicle. [[Black beret]]s continue to be worn by the Royal Tank Regiment, all other British armoured units wear [[blue beret]]s, regiments in many armies also adopted the wearing of berets.\n\nThe wearing of berets of distinctive colors by elite [[special forces]] originated with the British [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], whose [[maroon beret]] was officially approved in July 1942,<ref>{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=Rebecca |date=2010 |title=British Paratrooper 1940\u201345 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nLGdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6 |location= |publisher=Osprey Publishing  |page=6 |isbn=978-1472805126 }}</ref> followed by the [[Commandos (United Kingdom)|Commando Forces]] whose [[green beret]] was approved in October of that year.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bull |first=Stephen |date=2010 |title=Commando Tactics: The Second World War |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aH10gy_DENAC&pg=PA98 |location= |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |page=98 |isbn=978-1848840744 }}</ref> The [[United States Army Special Forces]] adopted a darker green beret in 1955, although it was not officially approved until 1961.<ref name=\"www.army.mil\" >{{cite web |url=https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm |title=A Short History of the Use of Berets in the U.S. Army |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010624053826/https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm#History |archive-date=24 June 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Camouflage berets==\n[[File:Vietnam p05.jpg|thumb|right|A U.S. Navy SEAL in Vietnam with a camouflage beret]]\nA '''camouflage beret''' is  intended for use in the battlefield when wearing [[Battledress|combat fatigues]]. They are mostly issued to the likes of [[special forces]], particularly in jungle warfare operations.\n\n===History===\nCamouflage berets possibly originate from the General Service cap \"Cap, General Service\" issued to the British Army in a Khaki material before the introduction of Berets. It was first introduced under \"Army Council Instruction 1407\" of September 1943. This cap was designed to replace the \"Field Service cap\" or \"FS Cap\" that had been worn since the outbreak of war. These caps were issued in priority to units serving overseas. UK based units got theirs later on. It was at first unpopular due to its over large appearance. This cap was not a beret. It was made from several pieces of drab cloth material, whereas a beret was a one piece item. It was based on the Scottish balmoral bonnet in design. First issues were made from the same gaberdine cloth as the old \"FS\" cap. Badges worn on it were the conventional Officers bronze, and OR's badges in both plastic and metal. Units which had special distinctions could still wear these on the \"GS\" cap. The General Service cap was worn by regulation one inch above the eyebrows, with badge over the left eye and the cap pulled down to the right. But many wartime photos will show it worn pushed back on the head, which seemed to be a fashion with many soldiers late in the War.\n\nOfficers could only obtain the cap upon repayment to the RAOC. They were not allowed to buy the cap until their unit had been issued with it wholesale. Higher ranking Officers often got away with wearing a Khaki beret, which was against regulations. Fashion conscious OR's would also risk punishment from NCO's/officers buying one of these for \"walking out\".\n\nNot exactly camouflage but an early example is the Jungle Beret issued to the Australian Army during WW2.<ref>The Australian Army in World War II - Page 57 Mark Johnson {{ISBN|1472805224}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medalsgonemissing.com/index.php?params_to_parse=Uniform-Kit-issued-to-the-AIF-During-WW2/5|title=Uniform & Kit issued to the AIF During WW2|website=www.medalsgonemissing.com}}</ref><ref>http://www.austcdoassocvic.com/history1.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Users===\n*{{flagcountry|Argentina}} - Jungle Troops (Brigada de Monte XII \"General Manuel Obligado\")<ref>The other Cazadores de Monte brigades use Dark Green berets</ref>\n*{{flagcountry|Bolivia}} - Special Forces \"Bolivian Condors\"\n*{{flagcountry|Brazil}} - Jungle Troops\n*{{flagcountry|PRC}} - During the 80s, camo berets were issued to some of the recon forces of PLA.

During World War II, berets were widely adopted in the [[Polish Army]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], armored troops - black, airborne - grey, commando - green. After the war in the communist era, berets were worn only by armoured units (black), navy for field and work uniform (black), paratroopers (maroon), and marines (light blue). After 1990, the beret became the standard headgear in the Armed Forces of Republic of Poland. Around the year 2000 the design of the Polish Army Beret changed, the beret sewn together from three pieces of material with four air holes, two at each side was changed to a smaller beret [[Molding (process)|molded]] from one piece of material with no air holes.\nThe following colours are in use:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Colour || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| Black || Armored troops, [[Polish Navy|Navy]], [[JW Formoza|Military Unit Formoza]] (for field and work uniform)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#1F75FE;\"| || Blue || [[7th Coastal Defense Brigade]], Peacekeeping Missions Training Center\n|-\n| style=\"background:#804000;\"| || Brown || [[Territorial Defense Forces (Poland)|Territorial Defence]] (discontinued) \n|-\n| style=\"background:#6b8e23;\"| || Olive Green || [[Territorial Defence Force (Poland)|Territorial Defence]] (present)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00563B;\"| || Green || Army general use\n|-\n| style=\"background:#013220;\"| || Dark Green || [[Polish Special Forces|Special Forces]] Command\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D3D3D3;\"| || Light Grey || [[JW GROM|Military Unit GROM]] (JW GROM)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#708090;\"| || Steel Grey || Air Force (no longer in use, replaced by camouflage side cap)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || Maroon || Paratroopers\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF2400;\"| || Scarlet Red || [[Military Gendarmerie (Poland)|Military Police]]\n|}\n\nBerets in other ministries:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Colour || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| Black || Border Guards Naval Units, Firefighters (for service dress)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00AB66;\"| || Light Green || [[Border Guard (Poland)|Border Guards]] (no longer in use, replaced by camouflage cap) \n|-\n| style=\"background:#708090;\"| || Steel Grey || Border Guards Air Units\n|-\n| style=\"background:#0F52BA;\"| || Sapphire || [[Biuro Ochrony Rz\u0105du|Government Protection Bureau]] (no longer in use) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs' Troops (disbanded)\n|-\n| style=\"background:navy;\"| || Navy Blue || [[Policja#Anti-terrorism units (BOA/SPAP)|Police anti-terrorist units]] (SPAP)\n|}\nThe black beret is also the distinctive headgear of World War II veterans, particularly [[Armia Krajowa]] veterans.\n\nThe dress code of the Polish armed forces states than when not worn on the head or kept in a locker the beret should be placed under the left [[shoulder mark|shoulder loop]]. This practice was discontinued due to introducing new field uniform (wz. 2010) with rank insignia placed on chest.\n\n===Portugal===\nThe beret was first introduced in the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] in 1956, when the Air Force Paratroopers adopted the green beret. The Portuguese Army adopted the brown beret for its ''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' special forces in 1960, generalizing its wear to all units in 1962.

Like most countries formerly associated with the [[British Empire]], Berets were coloured according to unit or service branch, with a distinctive regimental cap badge pinned above the left eye. The Rhodesian Security Forces were integrated into the new [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]] in 1980.\n\nRhodesia introduced the [[brown beret]] as a new colour for specialist berets, for use of the [[Selous Scouts]], which has since been used for specialist units in the Finnish and Brazilian forces, and with the [[New Zealand SAS]]\n\nRhodesian beret colours were as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Colour\n!Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:#7c7676;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|Grey\n|[[Grey's Scouts|Grey Scouts]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#630;\"|\n|[[Brown beret|Brown]]\n|[[Selous Scouts]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#000;\"|\n|[[black beret|Black]]\n|[[Rhodesian Armoured Corps]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"|\n|[[Maroon beret|Maroon]]\n|[[Rhodesian Medical Corps|Medical Corps]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:tan;\"|\n|[[Tan beret|Beige]]\n|[[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Special Air Service]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ff2400;\" |\n|[[Red beret|Scarlet]]\n|[[INTAF|Internal Affairs Ministry]] and the [[Rhodesian Military Police]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#2d6734;\" |\n|Green\n|Most infantry regiments, including the [[Rhodesia Regiment|Rhodesian Regiment]] and the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#0f3826;\" |\n|[[green beret|Tartan Green]]\n|[[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (from 1964, when they were designated a commando regiment)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00022b;\" |\n|Dark blue\n|Generic - worn by all other units of the [[Rhodesian Army|Army]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#3f4354;\" |\n|Blue Grey\n|[[Rhodesian Air Force]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#4169e1;\" |\n|Bright Blue\n|[[PSYOP|Psychological Operations]]\n|}\n\nLike the [[United Kingdom]], Rhodesia also used flashes and hackles behind cap badges on their berets as well such as:\n* The blue, yellow and red shield on the medical corps beret.\n* The blue diamond flash on the military police beret\n*The red outline of the Rhodesian Artillery beret\n*The red tombstone of the Grey Scouts beret\n*The red diamond hacking of the Rhodesian Regiment beret (similar to that of the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|KRRC]])\n*The Blue and Red hackle of the 4th Battalion Rhodesian Regiment Beret.\n\n===Romania===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Colour || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| Black || Anti-air Artillery and Missiles, Artillery, Military Automobile Troops (automobili\u015fti militari), Tanks, Communication and Informatics structures, Engineers, Nuclear Biological and Chemical (NBC) Defense and Naval Forces\n|-\n| style=\"background:#006A4E;\"| || Green || Mountain Troops (or Mountain Hunters, V\u00e2n\u0103tori de Munte), Special Operations Forces\n|-\n| style=\"background:#002147;\"| || Dark Blue || Military Justice, Romanian Gendarmerie (Jandarmeria Rom\u00e2n\u0103)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#B03060;\"| || Maroon || Paratroopers\n|-\n| style=\"background:red;\"| || Red || Military Music\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9F1D35;\"| || Dark red (bordeaux red) || Military Medicine\n|-\n| style=\"background:#7F00FF;\"| || Violet || Military Logistics, or administration (intenden\u0163\u0103)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#5D8AA8;\"| || Light Grey || Military Police\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ccf;\"| || Light Blue || Air Force and Radar Troops (radioloca\u0163ie)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#6B4423;\"| || Dark brown || Infantry\n|}\n\n===Russia===\n\nIn the Soviet Union berets were worn only by:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Colour || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| Black || Naval infantry, tank troops (only for coveralls), [[OMON]] special militia units\n|-\n| style=\"background:skyBlue;\"| || Sky blue || Airborne troops\n|-\n| style=\"background:#E30B5C\"| || Raspberry || Airborne troops (till 1969, unofficially from 1963 with jump uniform only)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00A550;\"| || Green || 103rd Airborne Division (while subordinate to Border Guards in 1989-91)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || Rust red (orig. {{transl|ru|Krapovyi}}) || [[MVD]] special troops (from end of the 1980s)\n|-\n| style=\"background:darkBlue;\"| || Blue || Navy (WMF) - as a part of working and technical uniform for enlisted and petty officers (officially {{transl|ru|matrosy i starshiny}} in Russian)\n|}\n\nDuring this period berets were also worn by female personnel of the Armed Forces for everyday and parade uniform.

The Chasseurs alpins wore a distinctive large beret (see above{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}) and Major-General Sir [[Hugh Elles]], the TC's Colonel, realised this style of headdress would be a practical option for his [[tank]] crews, forced to work in a reduced space. He thought, however, that the Chasseur beret was \"too sloppy\" and the [[Basque people|Basque]]-style beret of the French tank crews was \"too skimpy\", so a compromise based on the Scottish [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]] was designed and submitted for the approval of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in November 1923. It was adopted in March 1924.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the use of the black beret was extended to all the regiments of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] in 1940. The [[maroon beret]] was adopted by the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] in 1941 and the [[green beret]] by the [[British Commandos|Commandos]] in late 1942.

In response, from 1973 through 1979 HQDA permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions, however these distinctions were only allowed to be worn on the post. Consequently, many units embraced various colored berets, for example Armor and Armored Cavalry units often adopted the black beret. Similarly many other units embraced various colored berets in an attempt to improve dwindling morale. In particular, the First Cavalry Division assigned various colored berets to its three pronged TRICAP approach. In this implementation, Armored Cavalry, Airmobile Infantry units, Air Cavalry units, Division Artillery units, and Division Support units all wore different colored berets, including black, light blue, kelly green, and red. The 101st Airborne Division was authorised a dark blue beret.\n\nIn 1975 all female soldiers of the [[Women's Army Corps]] were authorized to wear a black beret variant as standard headgear for the service uniform.<ref>Stanton, Shelby (1994).

The Rangers were then authorized to wear a tan beret, exclusive to them. The decision was implemented in hopes of boosting morale among conventional units. However, many soldiers began complaining that the new black beret was not practical with the utility uniform. In June 2011, Army Secretary John McHugh, acting on the recommendations made by Chief of Staff Martin Dempsey and Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler, once again chose the traditional patrol cap to be worn with the utility uniform. The black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion for special ceremonies.

The beret is not so useful in field conditions for the modern infantryman, who requires protective helmets, and non-camouflage versions are seldom seen on operations.\n\nThe beret was found particularly useful as a uniform for armored-vehicle crews, and the [[Royal Tank Regiment|British Tank Corps]] (later Royal Tank Corps) adopted the headdress as early as 1918.\n\nGerman AFV crews in the late 1930s also adopted a beret with the addition of a padded crash helmet inside. The colour black was worn by the Royal Tank Corps later Royal Tank Regiment, since it did not show oil stains picked up inside the interior of a vehicle.

They are mostly issued to the likes of [[special forces]], particularly in jungle warfare operations.\n\n===History===\nCamouflage berets possibly originate from the General Service cap \"Cap, General Service\" issued to the British Army in a Khaki material before the introduction of Berets. It was first introduced under \"Army Council Instruction 1407\" of September 1943. This cap was designed to replace the \"Field Service cap\" or \"FS Cap\" that had been worn since the outbreak of war. These caps were issued in priority to units serving overseas. UK based units got theirs later on. It was at first unpopular due to its over large appearance. This cap was not a beret. It was made from several pieces of drab cloth material, whereas a beret was a one piece item. It was based on the Scottish balmoral bonnet in design. First issues were made from the same gaberdine cloth as the old \"FS\" cap. Badges worn on it were the conventional Officers bronze, and OR's badges in both plastic and metal. Units which had special distinctions could still wear these on the \"GS\" cap. The General Service cap was worn by regulation one inch above the eyebrows, with badge over the left eye and the cap pulled down to the right.

During World War II, berets were widely adopted in the [[Polish Army]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], armored troops - black, airborne - grey, commando - green. After the war in the communist era, berets were worn only by armoured units (black), navy for field and work uniform (black), paratroopers (maroon), and marines (light blue). After 1990, the beret became the standard headgear in the Armed Forces of Republic of Poland. Around the year 2000 the design of the Polish Army Beret changed, the beret sewn together from three pieces of material with four air holes, two at each side was changed to a smaller beret [[Molding (process)|molded]] from one piece of material with no air holes.\nThe following colours are in use:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Colour || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| Black || Armored troops, [[Polish Navy|Navy]], [[JW Formoza|Military Unit Formoza]] (for field and work uniform)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#1F75FE;\"| || Blue || [[7th Coastal Defense Brigade]], Peacekeeping Missions Training Center\n|-\n| style=\"background:#804000;\"| || Brown || [[Territorial Defense Forces (Poland)|Territorial Defence]] (discontinued) \n|-\n| style=\"background:#6b8e23;\"| || Olive Green || [[Territorial Defence Force (Poland)|Territorial Defence]] (present)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00563B;\"| || Green || Army general use\n|-\n| style=\"background:#013220;\"| || Dark Green || [[Polish Special Forces|Special Forces]] Command\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D3D3D3;\"| || Light Grey || [[JW GROM|Military Unit GROM]] (JW GROM)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#708090;\"| || Steel Grey || Air Force (no longer in use, replaced by camouflage side cap)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || Maroon || Paratroopers\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF2400;\"| || Scarlet Red || [[Military Gendarmerie (Poland)|Military Police]]\n|}\n\nBerets in other ministries:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Colour || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| Black || Border Guards Naval Units, Firefighters (for service dress)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00AB66;\"| || Light Green || [[Border Guard (Poland)|Border Guards]] (no longer in use, replaced by camouflage cap) \n|-\n| style=\"background:#708090;\"| || Steel Grey || Border Guards Air Units\n|-\n| style=\"background:#0F52BA;\"| || Sapphire || [[Biuro Ochrony Rz\u0105du|Government Protection Bureau]] (no longer in use) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs' Troops (disbanded)\n|-\n| style=\"background:navy;\"| || Navy Blue || [[Policja#Anti-terrorism units (BOA/SPAP)|Police anti-terrorist units]] (SPAP)\n|}\nThe black beret is also the distinctive headgear of World War II veterans, particularly [[Armia Krajowa]] veterans.\n\nThe dress code of the Polish armed forces states than when not worn on the head or kept in a locker the beret should be placed under the left [[shoulder mark|shoulder loop]]. This practice was discontinued due to introducing new field uniform (wz. 2010) with rank insignia placed on chest.\n\n===Portugal===\nThe beret was first introduced in the [[Portuguese Armed Forces]] in 1956, when the Air Force Paratroopers adopted the green beret. The Portuguese Army adopted the brown beret for its ''Ca\u00e7adores Especiais'' special forces in 1960, generalizing its wear to all units in 1962.

Like most countries formerly associated with the [[British Empire]], Berets were coloured according to unit or service branch, with a distinctive regimental cap badge pinned above the left eye. The Rhodesian Security Forces were integrated into the new [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]] in 1980.\n\nRhodesia introduced the [[brown beret]] as a new colour for specialist berets, for use of the [[Selous Scouts]], which has since been used for specialist units in the Finnish and Brazilian forces, and with the [[New Zealand SAS]]\n\nRhodesian beret colours were as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Colour\n!Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:#7c7676;\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|Grey\n|[[Grey's Scouts|Grey Scouts]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#630;\"|\n|[[Brown beret|Brown]]\n|[[Selous Scouts]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#000;\"|\n|[[black beret|Black]]\n|[[Rhodesian Armoured Corps]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"|\n|[[Maroon beret|Maroon]]\n|[[Rhodesian Medical Corps|Medical Corps]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:tan;\"|\n|[[Tan beret|Beige]]\n|[[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Special Air Service]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ff2400;\" |\n|[[Red beret|Scarlet]]\n|[[INTAF|Internal Affairs Ministry]] and the [[Rhodesian Military Police]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#2d6734;\" |\n|Green\n|Most infantry regiments, including the [[Rhodesia Regiment|Rhodesian Regiment]] and the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#0f3826;\" |\n|[[green beret|Tartan Green]]\n|[[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (from 1964, when they were designated a commando regiment)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00022b;\" |\n|Dark blue\n|Generic - worn by all other units of the [[Rhodesian Army|Army]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#3f4354;\" |\n|Blue Grey\n|[[Rhodesian Air Force]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#4169e1;\" |\n|Bright Blue\n|[[PSYOP|Psychological Operations]]\n|}\n\nLike the [[United Kingdom]], Rhodesia also used flashes and hackles behind cap badges on their berets as well such as:\n* The blue, yellow and red shield on the medical corps beret.\n* The blue diamond flash on the military police beret\n*The red outline of the Rhodesian Artillery beret\n*The red tombstone of the Grey Scouts beret\n*The red diamond hacking of the Rhodesian Regiment beret (similar to that of the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|KRRC]])\n*The Blue and Red hackle of the 4th Battalion Rhodesian Regiment Beret.\n\n===Romania===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Colour || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| Black || Anti-air Artillery and Missiles, Artillery, Military Automobile Troops (automobili\u015fti militari), Tanks, Communication and Informatics structures, Engineers, Nuclear Biological and Chemical (NBC) Defense and Naval Forces\n|-\n| style=\"background:#006A4E;\"| || Green || Mountain Troops (or Mountain Hunters, V\u00e2n\u0103tori de Munte), Special Operations Forces\n|-\n| style=\"background:#002147;\"| || Dark Blue || Military Justice, Romanian Gendarmerie (Jandarmeria Rom\u00e2n\u0103)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#B03060;\"| || Maroon || Paratroopers\n|-\n| style=\"background:red;\"| || Red || Military Music\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9F1D35;\"| || Dark red (bordeaux red) || Military Medicine\n|-\n| style=\"background:#7F00FF;\"| || Violet || Military Logistics, or administration (intenden\u0163\u0103)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#5D8AA8;\"| || Light Grey || Military Police\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ccf;\"| || Light Blue || Air Force and Radar Troops (radioloca\u0163ie)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#6B4423;\"| || Dark brown || Infantry\n|}\n\n===Russia===\n\nIn the Soviet Union berets were worn only by:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Colour || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| Black || Naval infantry, tank troops (only for coveralls), [[OMON]] special militia units\n|-\n| style=\"background:skyBlue;\"| || Sky blue || Airborne troops\n|-\n| style=\"background:#E30B5C\"| || Raspberry || Airborne troops (till 1969, unofficially from 1963 with jump uniform only)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00A550;\"| || Green || 103rd Airborne Division (while subordinate to Border Guards in 1989-91)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || Rust red (orig. {{transl|ru|Krapovyi}}) || [[MVD]] special troops (from end of the 1980s)\n|-\n| style=\"background:darkBlue;\"| || Blue || Navy (WMF) - as a part of working and technical uniform for enlisted and petty officers (officially {{transl|ru|matrosy i starshiny}} in Russian)\n|}\n\nDuring this period berets were also worn by female personnel of the Armed Forces for everyday and parade uniform.

The Chasseurs alpins wore a distinctive large beret (see above{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}) and Major-General Sir [[Hugh Elles]], the TC's Colonel, realised this style of headdress would be a practical option for his [[tank]] crews, forced to work in a reduced space. He thought, however, that the Chasseur beret was \"too sloppy\" and the [[Basque people|Basque]]-style beret of the French tank crews was \"too skimpy\", so a compromise based on the Scottish [[tam o'shanter (hat)|tam o'shanter]] was designed and submitted for the approval of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in November 1923. It was adopted in March 1924.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the use of the black beret was extended to all the regiments of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] in 1940. The [[maroon beret]] was adopted by the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] in 1941 and the [[green beret]] by the [[British Commandos|Commandos]] in late 1942.

In response, from 1973 through 1979 HQDA permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing uniform distinctions, however these distinctions were only allowed to be worn on the post. Consequently, many units embraced various colored berets, for example Armor and Armored Cavalry units often adopted the black beret. Similarly many other units embraced various colored berets in an attempt to improve dwindling morale. In particular, the First Cavalry Division assigned various colored berets to its three pronged TRICAP approach. In this implementation, Armored Cavalry, Airmobile Infantry units, Air Cavalry units, Division Artillery units, and Division Support units all wore different colored berets, including black, light blue, kelly green, and red. The 101st Airborne Division was authorised a dark blue beret.\n\nIn 1975 all female soldiers of the [[Women's Army Corps]] were authorized to wear a black beret variant as standard headgear for the service uniform.<ref>Stanton, Shelby (1994).

Stackpole Books. p. 223.</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the 172nd Light Infantry Brigade at Fort Richardson & Fort Wainwright, Alaska wore Olive Drab Berets.\n\nIn 2001, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki ordered the black beret worn as standard headgear army-wide, a controversial decision because it was previously reserved for the Rangers. The Rangers were then authorized to wear a tan beret, exclusive to them. The decision was implemented in hopes of boosting morale among conventional units. However, many soldiers began complaining that the new black beret was not practical with the utility uniform. In June 2011, Army Secretary John McHugh, acting on the recommendations made by Chief of Staff Martin Dempsey and Sergeant Major of the Army Raymond F. Chandler, once again chose the traditional patrol cap to be worn with the utility uniform. The black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion for special ceremonies. The beret remains part of the Army's dress uniform for all units.\n\nUnited States Army berets now use the following distinctive colors:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <center><big>'''US Army'''</big></center>\n! colspan=\"2\" | Color || Wearer\n|-\n| style=\"background:#00230D;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|| [[Green beret|Rifle green]] || [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces qualified soldiers]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:tan;\"| || [[Tan beret|Tan]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] and the [[Ranger School|Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade]] (Solders that have served one year in the regiment and are assigned to a [[USASOC]] component may continue to wear the Tan Beret.)\n|-\n| style=\"background:maroon;\"| || [[Maroon beret|Maroon]] || Soldiers assigned to units on active \"jump status,\" better known as Airborne/Parachute units\n|-\n| style=\"background: SaddleBrown;\"| || [[Brown]] || Soldiers assigned to the [[Security Force Assistance Command]] and its subordinate units\n|-\n| style=\"background:#000;\"| || [[Black beret|Black]] || Worn by all soldiers with Army Service Uniform as standard headgear (The [[patrol cap]] is the standard headgear with utility uniforms such as the ACUs; however, the black beret may be authorized with utility uniforms at commander's discretion.<ref>{{Cite news |first=C.

During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy created special boat teams, unofficially dubbed the [[brown-water navy]], to patrol coastlines, estuaries and rivers.

He overcame cost factors by first looking at the problem of frequent fractures of the motorcycles frames and evolved a six straight tubular frame with one of the pairs specially formed. The hub of the rear wheel up to the saddle and footrest formed a triangle and the frame below the tank an inverted triangle. The tank itself was held in position by similarly formed tubes. The frame could be bolted together with basic tools. In 1923 he exhibited a machine with this type of frame at Olympia.<ref>http://www.francis-barnett.co.uk/?page_id=27| FB History</ref><ref name=\"Tragatsch\">{{cite book|last=Tragatsch|first=Erwin|title=The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles|year=2000|publisher=Quantum Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1861603425|pages=560}}</ref> Riders like Tom Meeten took part at Brooklands and Scottish 6-Day Trials and stunts such as riding up Snowdon.<ref>https://speedtracktales.com/folks-n-motors/tommy-meeten-and-the-francis-barnett/</ref> On 12 July 1928 a trio of riders started at the foot of Snowdon at Llandberg Base Station.

The 147cc Villiers two-stroke engine with [[flywheel]] [[magneto]] was light with a two speed Albion gearbox, a three speed was an option, and very easily reassembled and at a very low cost. The construction came with a no breakage forever guarantee. Other 250cc and 350cc machines were also produced with a [[sidecars]] as an option. The Pullman model followed in 1928 with a 344cc vertical in-line two-stroke Villiers engine. From 1928 to 1930 the black motorcycles followed the fashion and were coloured cream. They reverted to black in 1931 and to Arden Green around 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/Q/Francis_barnett_motorcycle|title=Francis barnett motorcycle|website=Answers.com}}</ref> [[File:2015-03-07 - Thinktank - Sasha Taylor - 328.JPG|thumb|]]\n[[File:SLNSW 11535 Fred Loudons motorcycle shop with FrancisBarnett motorcycles corner Elizabeth and Goulburn Street.jpg|thumb|SLNSW 11535 Fred Loudons motorcycle shop with FrancisBarnett motorcycles corner Elizabeth and Goulburn Street]]\n\nIn 1937 Arthur Barnett died aged 74 and his son, Eric took over his fathers position at the company as sales director.

Barnett|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk}}</ref> From 1938 a new 98cc Powerbike was made alongside the 125cc Snipe and these were intended for the military soon after the outbreak of World War Two. During the air raids over Coventry in 1940 the Frances Barnett Factory was completely destroyed. The company continued making parts during the war at an alternative location. It was not until 1945 that production resumed back at Lower Ford Street with the 98cc Powerbike and then the 125cc Merlin. The Plover, Falcon and Kestrel machines followed.\n\nFrancis Barnett was amalgamated with Associated Motor Cycles in 1947. About that time Francis Barnett brought back the Cruiser names with a 171cc AMC engined Light Cruiser.<ref name=\"britishclassicmotorcycles.com\"/> The motorcycles Plover, Falcon and Cruiser were successful right into the 1950s as good light machines in Arden Green rather than the black finish of earlier days. James vehicles were in maroon. AMC considered Wolverhampton based Villiers to be dictatorial and they commissioned Italian designer Vincenzo Piatti to design a new engine to replace the Villier' engine. The Villiers engine was discontinued in new models in favour of AMC's Piatti designed unit. Unfortunately this did not work well due to cost and unreliability of the AMC manufactured engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2008/10/article/memorable-moto-francis-barnett-cruiser/|title=Memorable Moto Francis Barnett Cruiser - Motorcycle USA|publisher=}}</ref> AMC reverted Francis Barnett bikes back to a Villiers engine again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workingatamc.london/two_stroke.html|title=Working at AMC - Two Stroke Shop|first=Peter Attwood and Bill|last=Cakebread|website=www.workingatamc.london}}</ref> The Falcon 87 with a 199cc single cylinder two stroke AMC engine was introduced and remained in production until 1966. Also that year the Cruiser 84 with a fully enclosed rear wheel and leg shields as standard equipment was available. The first Cruiser was made in 1932 and is a quiet machine made for riders where special wet proof clothing was not required. The engine being enclosed with good leg-shield and mudguard protection. The Cruiser is displayed at Lord Montague's [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yesterdays.nl/product/francis-barnett-1940/|title=Francis Barnett 1940 - Yesterdays|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/The_Motor_Cycle|title=The National Motor Museum Trust|website=www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to break away from Villiers\u2019 monopoly supply of engines, AMC commissioned Italian designer Vincenzo Piatti to design all-new two-stroke engines. Piatti was already known to AMC management through his novel, but breathtakingly ugly, Piatti scooters, but the project was a total mess from start to finish. First of all, Piatti's design \u2013 constrained by AMC's demands for cost cutting rather than quality \u2013 was very conservative. Second, it was poorly made by AMC and soon gained a strong reputation for unreliability. Added to this was an all-enveloping dullness which reflected a tired management, distant from its customer base.\n\nIn the early 1960s changes in the marketplace caused a transfer of production to Greet in Birmingham in 1962 to join James motorcycles. The Lower Ford Rd, Coventry Factory was closed down and some staff moved to James. The James and Francis Barnett bikes became virtually the same apart from cosmetic changes of colours and badges. The last new model was produced in 1962, the newly designed Fulmar with a spine frame, pressed steel bodywork, leading link forks and 149cc AMC engine. Production of Francis Barnett motorcycles continued until 4 August 1966 when the AMC Empire was taken over by Manganese Bronze. Both Francis Barnett and James ceased to exist from October of that year.<ref>https://cybermotorcycle.com/marques/francis-barnett/</ref><ref name=\"britishclassicmotorcycles.com\"/>\n[[File:Francis-Barnett 175 cc JAP side valve 1926.jpg|thumb|Francis-Barnett 175 cc JAP side valve 1926]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett K 39 Cruiser.jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett K 39 Cruiser]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett Falcon Model 81 200cc (1959).jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett Falcon Model 81 200cc (1959)]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett Plover 150cc (1959) - 14709399311.jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett Plover 150cc (1959) \u2013 14709399311]]\n[[File:Villiers 10D Engine - 8335802962.jpg|thumb|Villiers 10D Engine \u2013 8335802962]]\n[[File:Villiers 10D Engine.jpg|thumb|Villiers 10D Engine]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett Fulmar 88 (1964).jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett Fulmar 88 (1964)]]\n\n==Francis-Barnett Powerbike and Motorcycle Models 1919\u20131966==\nList of models:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cybermotorcycle.com/euro/brands/francis-barnett.htm|title=Francis-Barnett Motorcycles|last=ManxNorton.com|website=Classic Motorcycles by Sheldon's Emu}}</ref>\n\n* 1919/1925 \u2013 Francis Barnet badged Invicta  269cc 4-stroke Villiers engine, 346cc 4-stroke engine, 678cc sv J.A.P chain driven 4-stroke engine and 499cc Abingdon 4-stroke engine, [[Abingdon Motorcycles]]: A Francis Barnett badged Invicta took part in the Isle of Man TT in 1922 but failed to finish.

Early motor cycles were affectionately known as ' Franny B'. Motorcycles were produced for enthusiasts and was reasonably affordable for citizens for use as general transport. The majority of the lighter motorcycles used [[Villiers Engineering|Villiers]] and later [[Two-stroke engine]] and later [[Associated Motor Cycles]] AMC engines. During the 1930s the 250cc Cruiser model {{convert|250|cc|abbr=on}} was developed with a faired engine that protected those riding from any oil or dirt \u2013 one of the first of its kind to do so. AMC took over Francis & Barnett Limited in 1947 combining this with the James motorcycle models in 1957. The combined company remained in business until 1966.<ref>http://www.francis-barnett.org|last page</ref><ref name=\"Tragatsch\" />[[File:Lea Francis 1914 V-Twin 1.jpg|thumb|Lea Francis 1914 V-Twin 1]] Lea Francis Works in Much Park Street.<ref>https://forum.historiccoventry.co.uk/images/Annewiggy_Lea_Francis.jpg</ref>\n\nThe Lea Francis cycle and motorcycle business had been formed by Graham Francis and R.H.

He overcame cost factors by first looking at the problem of frequent fractures of the motorcycles frames and evolved a six straight tubular frame with one of the pairs specially formed. The hub of the rear wheel up to the saddle and footrest formed a triangle and the frame below the tank an inverted triangle. The tank itself was held in position by similarly formed tubes. The frame could be bolted together with basic tools. In 1923 he exhibited a machine with this type of frame at Olympia.<ref>http://www.francis-barnett.co.uk/?page_id=27| FB History</ref><ref name=\"Tragatsch\">{{cite book|last=Tragatsch|first=Erwin|title=The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles|year=2000|publisher=Quantum Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1861603425|pages=560}}</ref> Riders like Tom Meeten took part at Brooklands and Scottish 6-Day Trials and stunts such as riding up Snowdon.<ref>https://speedtracktales.com/folks-n-motors/tommy-meeten-and-the-francis-barnett/</ref> On 12 July 1928 a trio of riders started at the foot of Snowdon at Llandberg Base Station.

The 147cc Villiers two-stroke engine with [[flywheel]] [[magneto]] was light with a two speed Albion gearbox, a three speed was an option, and very easily reassembled and at a very low cost. The construction came with a no breakage forever guarantee. Other 250cc and 350cc machines were also produced with a [[sidecars]] as an option. The Pullman model followed in 1928 with a 344cc vertical in-line two-stroke Villiers engine. From 1928 to 1930 the black motorcycles followed the fashion and were coloured cream. They reverted to black in 1931 and to Arden Green around 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/Q/Francis_barnett_motorcycle|title=Francis barnett motorcycle|website=Answers.com}}</ref> [[File:2015-03-07 - Thinktank - Sasha Taylor - 328.JPG|thumb|]]\n[[File:SLNSW 11535 Fred Loudons motorcycle shop with FrancisBarnett motorcycles corner Elizabeth and Goulburn Street.jpg|thumb|SLNSW 11535 Fred Loudons motorcycle shop with FrancisBarnett motorcycles corner Elizabeth and Goulburn Street]]\n\nIn 1937 Arthur Barnett died aged 74 and his son, Eric took over his fathers position at the company as sales director.

Barnett|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk}}</ref> From 1938 a new 98cc Powerbike was made alongside the 125cc Snipe and these were intended for the military soon after the outbreak of World War Two. During the air raids over Coventry in 1940 the Frances Barnett Factory was completely destroyed. The company continued making parts during the war at an alternative location. It was not until 1945 that production resumed back at Lower Ford Street with the 98cc Powerbike and then the 125cc Merlin. The Plover, Falcon and Kestrel machines followed.\n\nFrancis Barnett was amalgamated with Associated Motor Cycles in 1947. About that time Francis Barnett brought back the Cruiser names with a 171cc AMC engined Light Cruiser.<ref name=\"britishclassicmotorcycles.com\"/> The motorcycles Plover, Falcon and Cruiser were successful right into the 1950s as good light machines in Arden Green rather than the black finish of earlier days. James vehicles were in maroon. AMC considered Wolverhampton based Villiers to be dictatorial and they commissioned Italian designer Vincenzo Piatti to design a new engine to replace the Villier' engine. The Villiers engine was discontinued in new models in favour of AMC's Piatti designed unit. Unfortunately this did not work well due to cost and unreliability of the AMC manufactured engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2008/10/article/memorable-moto-francis-barnett-cruiser/|title=Memorable Moto Francis Barnett Cruiser - Motorcycle USA|publisher=}}</ref> AMC reverted Francis Barnett bikes back to a Villiers engine again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workingatamc.london/two_stroke.html|title=Working at AMC - Two Stroke Shop|first=Peter Attwood and Bill|last=Cakebread|website=www.workingatamc.london}}</ref> The Falcon 87 with a 199cc single cylinder two stroke AMC engine was introduced and remained in production until 1966. Also that year the Cruiser 84 with a fully enclosed rear wheel and leg shields as standard equipment was available. The first Cruiser was made in 1932 and is a quiet machine made for riders where special wet proof clothing was not required. The engine being enclosed with good leg-shield and mudguard protection. The Cruiser is displayed at Lord Montague's [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yesterdays.nl/product/francis-barnett-1940/|title=Francis Barnett 1940 - Yesterdays|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/The_Motor_Cycle|title=The National Motor Museum Trust|website=www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to break away from Villiers\u2019 monopoly supply of engines, AMC commissioned Italian designer Vincenzo Piatti to design all-new two-stroke engines. Piatti was already known to AMC management through his novel, but breathtakingly ugly, Piatti scooters, but the project was a total mess from start to finish. First of all, Piatti's design \u2013 constrained by AMC's demands for cost cutting rather than quality \u2013 was very conservative. Second, it was poorly made by AMC and soon gained a strong reputation for unreliability. Added to this was an all-enveloping dullness which reflected a tired management, distant from its customer base.\n\nIn the early 1960s changes in the marketplace caused a transfer of production to Greet in Birmingham in 1962 to join James motorcycles. The Lower Ford Rd, Coventry Factory was closed down and some staff moved to James. The James and Francis Barnett bikes became virtually the same apart from cosmetic changes of colours and badges. The last new model was produced in 1962, the newly designed Fulmar with a spine frame, pressed steel bodywork, leading link forks and 149cc AMC engine. Production of Francis Barnett motorcycles continued until 4 August 1966 when the AMC Empire was taken over by Manganese Bronze. Both Francis Barnett and James ceased to exist from October of that year.<ref>https://cybermotorcycle.com/marques/francis-barnett/</ref><ref name=\"britishclassicmotorcycles.com\"/>\n[[File:Francis-Barnett 175 cc JAP side valve 1926.jpg|thumb|Francis-Barnett 175 cc JAP side valve 1926]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett K 39 Cruiser.jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett K 39 Cruiser]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett Falcon Model 81 200cc (1959).jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett Falcon Model 81 200cc (1959)]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett Plover 150cc (1959) - 14709399311.jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett Plover 150cc (1959) \u2013 14709399311]]\n[[File:Villiers 10D Engine - 8335802962.jpg|thumb|Villiers 10D Engine \u2013 8335802962]]\n[[File:Villiers 10D Engine.jpg|thumb|Villiers 10D Engine]]\n[[File:Francis Barnett Fulmar 88 (1964).jpg|thumb|Francis Barnett Fulmar 88 (1964)]]\n\n==Francis-Barnett Powerbike and Motorcycle Models 1919\u20131966==\nList of models:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cybermotorcycle.com/euro/brands/francis-barnett.htm|title=Francis-Barnett Motorcycles|last=ManxNorton.com|website=Classic Motorcycles by Sheldon's Emu}}</ref>\n\n* 1919/1925 \u2013 Francis Barnet badged Invicta  269cc 4-stroke Villiers engine, 346cc 4-stroke engine, 678cc sv J.A.P chain driven 4-stroke engine and 499cc Abingdon 4-stroke engine, [[Abingdon Motorcycles]]: A Francis Barnett badged Invicta took part in the Isle of Man TT in 1922 but failed to finish.

Then, version 4.01 of RealPlayer was included as a selectable Internet tool in [[Windows 98]]'s installation package.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/mydotcom/howto/scripts/sysadmin/answerfile_w98.htm |title=msbatch.inf - Unattended and Customized Installation of Windows 98 |accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref> Subsequent versions of the software were titled \"RealPlayer G2\" (version 6) and \"RealOne Player\" (version 9), while free \"Basic\" versions as well as paid \"Plus\" versions, the latter with additional features, have also been offered. For the Windows OS, the RealPlayer version 9 [[wikt:subsume|subsumed]] the features of the separate program, [[RealJukebox]].\n \nRealPlayer 11 was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 2007 and for [[Mac OS X]] in May 2008. RealPlayer 15 was released on November 18, 2011. This version allows users to transfer video, music and photos between their computers and mobile devices, share links of videos and photos on sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]], and download videos from popular sites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Metacafe]].\n\nRealPlayer was initially accessed by many users as a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] to watch streaming video or listen to streaming audio (for example, most of the [[BBC]]'s websites formerly employed the plugin);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/help/faq/download_and_install_realplayer.shtml |title=How do I download and install RealPlayer?|publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref> but in the early 21st century, [[Adobe Flash]] and subsequently [[HTML5 video]] became preferred options for this purpose.\n\n==Current status==\nIn February 2016, RealNetworks released RealPlayer 18, which incorporated the features of the previous year's release of RealTimes, an app that makes multimedia montages from users' photographs and videos, backed up and accessible via [[cloud computing|cloud]] storage. The Real.com Blog states that \"RealPlayer with RealTimes (aka \"RealPlayer\" for short) will still include the legacy features, such as Downloader, Converter, and Web Videos.

Then, version 4.01 of RealPlayer was included as a selectable Internet tool in [[Windows 98]]'s installation package.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/mydotcom/howto/scripts/sysadmin/answerfile_w98.htm |title=msbatch.inf - Unattended and Customized Installation of Windows 98 |accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref> Subsequent versions of the software were titled \"RealPlayer G2\" (version 6) and \"RealOne Player\" (version 9), while free \"Basic\" versions as well as paid \"Plus\" versions, the latter with additional features, have also been offered. For the Windows OS, the RealPlayer version 9 [[wikt:subsume|subsumed]] the features of the separate program, [[RealJukebox]].\n \nRealPlayer 11 was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 2007 and for [[Mac OS X]] in May 2008. RealPlayer 15 was released on November 18, 2011. This version allows users to transfer video, music and photos between their computers and mobile devices, share links of videos and photos on sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]], and download videos from popular sites such as [[YouTube]] and [[Metacafe]].\n\nRealPlayer was initially accessed by many users as a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] to watch streaming video or listen to streaming audio (for example, most of the [[BBC]]'s websites formerly employed the plugin);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/help/faq/download_and_install_realplayer.shtml |title=How do I download and install RealPlayer?|publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref> but in the early 21st century, [[Adobe Flash]] and subsequently [[HTML5 video]] became preferred options for this purpose.\n\n==Current status==\nIn February 2016, RealNetworks released RealPlayer 18, which incorporated the features of the previous year's release of RealTimes, an app that makes multimedia montages from users' photographs and videos, backed up and accessible via [[cloud computing|cloud]] storage. The Real.com Blog states that \"RealPlayer with RealTimes (aka \"RealPlayer\" for short) will still include the legacy features, such as Downloader, Converter, and Web Videos. It will also still include our RealTimes features, such as Photos and RealTimes Stories, our automatic video collage feature.\"<ref name=\"realtimesblog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.real.com/resources/were-bringing-back-realplayer-for-pc/|title=We're Bringing Back RealPlayer for PC|author=RealNetworks, Inc.|work=RealPlayer}}</ref> Note that as of 2018, the publisher only provides RealTime for use on a Mac and no longer publishes a media player called RealPlayer for macOS.\n\n==Features==\nFeatures of RealPlayer include a video download utility, a web browser, \"visualizations\" (graphical animations or \"light shows\" that appear on the screen when playing music), equalizer and video controls (including Crossfade and Gapless playback in RealPlayer Plus), recording audio, CD ripping, and a media converter which allows converting files to a variety of common audio and video formats.\n* Photo and Video Sharing - users can post videos to [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] directly from the software, as well as share directly to friends and family via email or SMS messages.\n\n===Supported media formats===\nRealPlayer has used several data formats:\n* [[RealMedia]] formats:  RealAudio (*.ra, *.rm),  RealVideo (*.rv, *.rm, *.rmvb), RealMedia HD (*.rmhd), RealPix (*.rp), RealText (*.rt), RealMedia Shortcut (*.ram, *.rmm)\n* Streaming: RealTime Streaming Protocol (rtsp://), Progressive Networks Streaming Protocols (pna://, pnm://), [[Microsoft]] [[Windows Media]] Streaming Protocol (mms://),{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}<ref>{{cite news |last1=barnes |first1=brooks |title=The Streaming Era Has Finally Arrived |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/business/media/streaming-hollywood-revolution.html |accessdate=7 January 2020 |publisher=The new york times}}</ref> Real Scalable Multicast (*.sdp), [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language]] (*.smil, *.smi)\n* Audio: [[MP3]] (*.mp3, *.mp2, *.mp2, *.m3u), [[Red Book (CD standard)|CD Audio]] (*.cda), [[WAV]] (*.wav), [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]]/[[High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding|aacPlus]] v1 (*.aac, *.m4a, *.m4b, *.mp4, *.acp, *.m4p), [[Apple Lossless]], [[Audio Interchange File Format|AIFF]] (*.aif, *.aiff), AU Audio Files (*.au), [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]] AAC (*.acp)\n* Video: [[DVD]] (*.vob), [[Video CD]] (*.dat), [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] Video (*.mpg, *.mpeg, *.m2v, *.mpe etc.), [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] (*.avi, *.divx), MJPEG video playback from .avi files, [[Windows Media]] (*.wma, *.wmv etc.) (requires Windows Media Player 9/10), [[QuickTime]] (*.mov, *.qt) (QuickTime Player must be installed), [[Adobe Systems]] [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] (*.swf) (Flash or Shockwave Player must be installed), [[Flash Video]] (*.flv).\n* [[Playlist]]s (*.rpl, *.xpl, *.pls, *.m3u)\n* Graphics: [[Bitmap]] (*.bmp), [[GIF]] Images (*.gif), [[JPEG]] Images (*.jpeg, *.jpg), [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] (*.png)\n\n===Formats supported by optional plug-ins===\n<!-- What to do with the Formats section?

'''Peshay''', is a British [[drum and bass]], [[Jungle music|jungle]], [[record producer]] and  [[DJ]]. \n\n==Biography==\nPeshay began to come to prominence in the early 1990s, playing at East London raves and releasing classic tracks on [[Reinforced Records]], [[Good Looking Records]], and [[Metalheadz]] such as ''Protege EP'', ''19:5'', ''Piano Tune/Vocal Tune'', and ''Psychosis/Represent''. In the mid 1990s, he would play at the seminal ''Metalheadz at the Blue Note'' nights.<ref name=\"dnbarena\">{{cite web|url=https://breakbeat.co.uk/interviews/peshay-get-funky/|title=Peshay: Get Funky!|date=22 March 2013|work=Breakbeat.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995 at peak of drum and bass being recognised by the mainstream media Peshay suffered an accident that left him almost bed-bound for two years. His comeback set at the famed ''Metalheadz at the Blue Note'' nights went into the stuff that legends are made of and is still talked about today.<ref name=\"The Quietus\">{{cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/28122-state-of-bass-jungle-drum-bass-book-martin-james-playlist|title=Junglist Massive: State Of Bass Author Martin James's 20 Essential D&B Tracks |date=18 April 220|work=thequietus.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Mixmab\">{{cite web|url=https://mixmag.net/feature/the-20-best-jungle-mixes-you-can-listen-to-online|title=The 20 best jungle mixes you can listen to online|date=9 February 2018|work=mixmag.net}}</ref>\n\nHis early releases are often referenced as groundbreaking for his unique production techniques and pioneering use of samples and effects.

It stars [[Judi Dench]], [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Kelly Reilly]], and [[Will Young]] (in his acting debut). It tells the true story of [[Laura Henderson]], an eccentric British socialite who opened the [[Windmill Theatre]] in London in 1931.\n\n''Mrs Henderson Presents'' was theatrically released on 25 November 2005 by [[The Weinstein Company]]. It received generally positive reviews from critics but was a box office disappointment grossing just $27.8 million against its $20 million budget. It received two nominations at the [[78th Academy Awards]]; [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Dench) and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] (for [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]]).\n\n==Plot==\nEccentric 70-year-old widow Mrs [[Laura Henderson]] purchases a redundant cinema and remodels it to create the [[Windmill Theatre]] in [[London]], as a post-widowhood hobby and appoints autocratic manager [[Vivian Van Damm]]. In 1937, they start a continuous variety revue called \"Revudeville\", but after other theatres copy this innovation, they begin losing money. Mrs Henderson suggests they add female [[nudity]], similar to the [[Moulin Rouge]] in Paris, something unprecedented in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Lord Chamberlain]] ([[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer]]) reluctantly allows this under the condition that the nude performers remain immobile, so the performances can be considered art, the equivalent of nude statues in museums.\n\nBecause the theatre's auditorium is below street level, it is relatively safe during [[The Blitz|the bombing of London]], and performances continue. The performers bravely go on with the show even during frightening bombing raids, and the posed nude girls resume their poses, after ducking, as the whole theatre is shaken and the scene [[Flats (theatre)|flats]] all round them sways when a bomb lands close by.\n\nMaureen, one of the cast, becomes involved at Mrs Henderson's instigation with a young soldier, Paul, one of the audience regulars. Maureen becomes pregnant and receives word that after Paul is [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilised]], he intends to return to his girlfriend. She becomes very upset, and hands in her notice. Before further developments, she is killed by a bomb while leaving the theatre.\n\nOther scenes depict life in the theatre during the period. Mrs Henderson and Mr Van Damm frequently clash, but also show great appreciation for each other.\n\nEventually, the authorities want the theatre to close because of the danger from bombs to crowds gathering outside the theatre. Mrs Henderson successfully argues that for soldiers going to die in the war, this is their last chance, and for many of the young soldiers their only chance, to see female nudity. She reflects on the death of her son in the [[World War I|First World War]], and how he may never have even seen a naked girl except on a [[French postcard]] he had been carrying when he died in a [[Chemical warfare|gas attack]].\n\nThe film's closing credits explain that, on her death in 1944, Mrs Henderson bequeathed the theatre to Mr Van Damm.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Laura Henderson]]\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Vivian Van Damm]]\n* [[Will Young]] as Bertie\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as [[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Maureen\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Gordon\n* [[Thelma Barlow]] as Lady Margot Conway\n* [[Anna Brewster]] as Doris\n* [[Rosalind Halstead]] as Frances\n* [[Sarah Solemani]] as Vera\n* [[Natalia Tena]] as Peggy\n* [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Sir Thomas Allen]] as Eric Woodburn\n* Richard Syms as Ambrose\n* [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] as Paul\n* [[Ralph Nossek]] as Leslie Pearkes\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received mostly positive reviews. At [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 68% of the critics gave the film a positive review out of 141 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins shine in this warm, witty period piece.\"<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mrs_henderson_presents/ </ref>\n\nThe website ''Future Movies'' described the film as \"very funny, sweet and charming\".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Roger Ebert]] reacted fairly positively to the film, saying \"''Mrs Henderson Presents'' is not great cinema, and neither was the Windmill great theater, but they both put on a good show.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbAEim_dVQkC|title=Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook

It stars [[Judi Dench]], [[Bob Hoskins]], [[Kelly Reilly]], and [[Will Young]] (in his acting debut). It tells the true story of [[Laura Henderson]], an eccentric British socialite who opened the [[Windmill Theatre]] in London in 1931.\n\n''Mrs Henderson Presents'' was theatrically released on 25 November 2005 by [[The Weinstein Company]]. It received generally positive reviews from critics but was a box office disappointment grossing just $27.8 million against its $20 million budget. It received two nominations at the [[78th Academy Awards]]; [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] (for Dench) and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] (for [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]]).\n\n==Plot==\nEccentric 70-year-old widow Mrs [[Laura Henderson]] purchases a redundant cinema and remodels it to create the [[Windmill Theatre]] in [[London]], as a post-widowhood hobby and appoints autocratic manager [[Vivian Van Damm]]. In 1937, they start a continuous variety revue called \"Revudeville\", but after other theatres copy this innovation, they begin losing money. Mrs Henderson suggests they add female [[nudity]], similar to the [[Moulin Rouge]] in Paris, something unprecedented in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Lord Chamberlain]] ([[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer]]) reluctantly allows this under the condition that the nude performers remain immobile, so the performances can be considered art, the equivalent of nude statues in museums.\n\nBecause the theatre's auditorium is below street level, it is relatively safe during [[The Blitz|the bombing of London]], and performances continue. The performers bravely go on with the show even during frightening bombing raids, and the posed nude girls resume their poses, after ducking, as the whole theatre is shaken and the scene [[Flats (theatre)|flats]] all round them sways when a bomb lands close by.\n\nMaureen, one of the cast, becomes involved at Mrs Henderson's instigation with a young soldier, Paul, one of the audience regulars. Maureen becomes pregnant and receives word that after Paul is [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilised]], he intends to return to his girlfriend. She becomes very upset, and hands in her notice. Before further developments, she is killed by a bomb while leaving the theatre.\n\nOther scenes depict life in the theatre during the period. Mrs Henderson and Mr Van Damm frequently clash, but also show great appreciation for each other.\n\nEventually, the authorities want the theatre to close because of the danger from bombs to crowds gathering outside the theatre. Mrs Henderson successfully argues that for soldiers going to die in the war, this is their last chance, and for many of the young soldiers their only chance, to see female nudity. She reflects on the death of her son in the [[World War I|First World War]], and how he may never have even seen a naked girl except on a [[French postcard]] he had been carrying when he died in a [[Chemical warfare|gas attack]].\n\nThe film's closing credits explain that, on her death in 1944, Mrs Henderson bequeathed the theatre to Mr Van Damm.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[Laura Henderson]]\n* [[Bob Hoskins]] as [[Vivian Van Damm]]\n* [[Will Young]] as Bertie\n* [[Christopher Guest]] as [[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]\n* [[Kelly Reilly]] as Maureen\n* [[Toby Jones]] as Gordon\n* [[Thelma Barlow]] as Lady Margot Conway\n* [[Anna Brewster]] as Doris\n* [[Rosalind Halstead]] as Frances\n* [[Sarah Solemani]] as Vera\n* [[Natalia Tena]] as Peggy\n* [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Sir Thomas Allen]] as Eric Woodburn\n* Richard Syms as Ambrose\n* [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] as Paul\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film received mostly positive reviews.

described the film as \"very funny, sweet and charming\".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Roger Ebert]] reacted fairly positively to the film, saying \"''Mrs Henderson Presents'' is not great cinema, and neither was the Windmill great theater, but they both put on a good show.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbAEim_dVQkC|title=Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook
