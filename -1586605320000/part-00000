There was a secondary bimah in the eastern section. This synagogue is unique in Judea as it had a gallery, serving a dual-use of also reinforcing the western wall. East of the synagogue was an open courtyard surrounded on three sides by a roofed portico. The western side opened to the synagogue's [[narthex]], and the floor of the narthex composed of coloured mosaics set in an interlaced pattern. This model was of short duration, yielding in the late Byzantine phase (6th/7th) to the basilica form, already elsewhere dominant in synagogue architecture.<ref>David Amit, \"Architectural plans of Synagogues in the Southern Judean Hills and the 'Halakaha{{'\"}}. p. 156</ref>\n\nIn contrast to most Galilean synagogues with their fa\u00e7ade and [[Torah]] [[shrine]] on the same Jerusalem-oriented wall, the Judean synagogue at Susya, (as well as Esthtemoa and Maon) has the niche on the northern Jerusalem-oriented wall and entrances on the east side wall.<ref>Rachel Hachlili, \"Jewish Art and Iconography in the Land of Israel\", in Suzanne Richard (ed.), ''Near Eastern Archeology: A Reader, Eisenbrauns'', 2003 p. 449</ref> The synagogue floor of white [[tessera]]e has three mosaic panels, the eastern one a Torah Shrine, two [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]s, one on a screen relief showing two lamps<ref>or incense censers.

In the petition, Att. Qamar Mashraki from Israeli NGO Rabbis for Human Rights argued on behalf of the residents that their plan had been rejected for improper considerations, and that this constituted a double standard in planning and blatant discrimination against the Palestinian population. The state's treatment of Khirbet Susiya and its residents illustrates its systemic use of planning laws to prevent Palestinians in Area C, which is under full Israeli control, from construction and development that meet their needs: most Palestinians in the area live in villages where the Israeli authorities have refused to draw up master plans and connect them to water and power supplies, under various pretexts. With no other choice, the residents eventually build homes without permits and subsequently live under constant threat of demolition and expulsion. This policy is intended to serve the goal, explicitly declared by Israeli officials in the past, of taking over land in the southern Hebron hills in order to formally annex it to Israel in a permanent-status agreement with the Palestinians, and annex it de facto until such a time. In implementing this policy, Israel is acting in contradiction to its obligation to care for the needs of West Bank residents as the occupying power there.... The Israeli authorities' policy towards the residents of Khirbet Susiya starkly contrasts their generous planning policy towards Israeli settlers in the area. The settlers of Susiya and its outposts enjoy full provision of services and infrastructure and are in no danger of their homes being demolished \u2013 despite the fact that the outposts are illegal under Israel law and in the settlement itself, according to figures published by settler organization Regavim, 23 homes were built on privately-owned Palestinian land.\"</ref><ref>[https://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=765764 \"In shadow of settlement, Susiya villagers vow to fight displacement\"], [[Ma'an News Agency]] 4 June 2015.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Levinson|first1=Chaim|title=A tale of two West Bank building permit requests|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.560136 |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}: \"The small Palestinian village of Susya, located next to the southern Hebron Hills settlement of the same name, had no permits for its buildings either.

This was forgotten in Galilee, but in Judea there was a closer adherence to older traditions reflecting closer proximity to Jerusalem.<ref>David Amit, pp. 148\u2013155, pp. 148, 152</ref> The eastern orientation may be also related to the idea of dissuading heretics and Christians in the same area, who bowed to the east, in the belief that the [[Shekinah]] lay in that direction.<ref>p. 146</ref>\n[[File:SusyaSynogogueInterior.JPG|260px|thumb|Interior of the synagogue]]\n\nThe synagogue was built as a broadhouse, rather than along basilica lines,<ref>\"Uniquely Jewish adaptations of Christian architecture did occur.

In these buildings, the basilica form is turned on its side, and the focal point of the synagogue is the wide wall of the hall.

There was a secondary bimah in the eastern section. This synagogue is unique in Judea as it had a gallery, serving a dual-use of also reinforcing the western wall. East of the synagogue was an open courtyard surrounded on three sides by a roofed portico. The western side opened to the synagogue's [[narthex]], and the floor of the narthex composed of coloured mosaics set in an interlaced pattern. This model was of short duration, yielding in the late Byzantine phase (6th/7th) to the basilica form, already elsewhere dominant in synagogue architecture.<ref>David Amit, \"Architectural plans of Synagogues in the Southern Judean Hills and the 'Halakaha{{'\"}}. p. 156</ref>\n\nIn contrast to most Galilean synagogues with their fa\u00e7ade and [[Torah]] [[shrine]] on the same Jerusalem-oriented wall, the Judean synagogue at Susya, (as well as Esthtemoa and Maon) has the niche on the northern Jerusalem-oriented wall and entrances on the east side wall.<ref>Rachel Hachlili, \"Jewish Art and Iconography in the Land of Israel\", in Suzanne Richard (ed.), ''Near Eastern Archeology: A Reader, Eisenbrauns'', 2003 p. 449</ref> The synagogue floor of white [[tessera]]e has three mosaic panels, the eastern one a Torah Shrine, two [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]s, one on a screen relief showing two lamps<ref>or incense censers.

The central panel composed of geometric and floral patterns. A spoke-wheel design before the central bimah, has led Gutman to believe it is the remnant of a [[zodiac]] wheel. Zodiac mosaics are important witness to the time, since they were systematically suppressed by the Church, and, their frequent construction in Palestinian synagogue floors may be an index of 'the \"inculturation\" of non-Jewish imagery and its resulting [[Judaization]]'.<ref>Steven Fine, ''Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world'', pp. 196\u2013197</ref> The fragmentary state of the wheel mosaic is due to its replacement by a much cruder geometric pavement pattern, indicative of a desire to erase what later came to be thought of as objectionable imagery.<ref>Steven Fine,  p. 95</ref><ref>John Brian Harley, David Woodward, ''The History of Cartography: Cartography in prehistoric, ancient, and medieval Europe and the Mediterranean'', Humana Press, 1987 p. 266. \"Since mosaics were disapproved of by the Jews as graven images, they were both removed.

The figure, in an ''orans'' stance, flanked by lions, was scrubbed from the mosaics in line with later trends, in what Fine calls a \"new aesthetic\" at Khirbet Susiya, one that refurbished the designs to suppress iconographic forms thought by later generations to be objectionable. We can only reconstruct the allusion to Daniel from the remaining final Hebrew letters remaining, namely -el, {{rtl-lang|he|\u05d0\u05dc}}.<ref>Steven Fine,. p. 96. Fine speculates whether reluctance to erase these letters reflects a religious reluctance among iconoclasts to delete letters that spell out the [[Names of God in Judaism|Divine name]] [[El (deity)|El]], for, again highlighting the distinctiveness of the synagogue, \"in no instance does an explicit Divine name appear in any Jewish synagogue inscription.\"</ref>\n\nAnother unique feature is number of inscriptions.

In the petition, Att. Qamar Mashraki from Israeli NGO Rabbis for Human Rights argued on behalf of the residents that their plan had been rejected for improper considerations, and that this constituted a double standard in planning and blatant discrimination against the Palestinian population. The state's treatment of Khirbet Susiya and its residents illustrates its systemic use of planning laws to prevent Palestinians in Area C, which is under full Israeli control, from construction and development that meet their needs: most Palestinians in the area live in villages where the Israeli authorities have refused to draw up master plans and connect them to water and power supplies, under various pretexts. With no other choice, the residents eventually build homes without permits and subsequently live under constant threat of demolition and expulsion. This policy is intended to serve the goal, explicitly declared by Israeli officials in the past, of taking over land in the southern Hebron hills in order to formally annex it to Israel in a permanent-status agreement with the Palestinians, and annex it de facto until such a time. In implementing this policy, Israel is acting in contradiction to its obligation to care for the needs of West Bank residents as the occupying power there.... The Israeli authorities' policy towards the residents of Khirbet Susiya starkly contrasts their generous planning policy towards Israeli settlers in the area. The settlers of Susiya and its outposts enjoy full provision of services and infrastructure and are in no danger of their homes being demolished \u2013 despite the fact that the outposts are illegal under Israel law and in the settlement itself, according to figures published by settler organization Regavim, 23 homes were built on privately-owned Palestinian land.\"</ref><ref>[https://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=765764 \"In shadow of settlement, Susiya villagers vow to fight displacement\"], [[Ma'an News Agency]] 4 June 2015.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Levinson|first1=Chaim|title=A tale of two West Bank building permit requests|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.560136 |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}: \"The small Palestinian village of Susya, located next to the southern Hebron Hills settlement of the same name, had no permits for its buildings either.

Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, Bergoglio was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He became the [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] considered him a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[2013 papal conclave|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n\nThroughout his public life, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor and commitment to [[interfaith dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by previous popes. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming. He does not support unbridled [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], or Marxist versions of [[liberation theology]]. Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]], [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], and [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]. He opposes [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment]], and supports taking action on [[climate change]], a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of ''[[Laudato si']]''. In international diplomacy, he helped to temporarily restore [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba]] and [[Theology of Pope Francis#Refugees and migrants|supported the cause of refugees]] during the [[European migrant crisis|European]] and [[Central American migrant caravans|Central American migrant]] crises.

It is taken from the homilies of the [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] on [[Gospel of Matthew|Saint Matthew's Gospel]] relating to his vocation: 'Jesus saw the tax collector and by having mercy chose him as an apostle saying to him: Follow me.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/03/18/pope_francis_:_miserando_atque_eligendo.../en1-674605 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705010045/http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2013/03/18/pope_francis_%3A_miserando_atque_eligendo.../en1-674605 |archivedate= 5 July 2013 |title=Pope Francis: \"Miserando atque eligendo\"... |first=Veronica |last=Scarisbrick |date=18 March 2013 |website= |publisher=[[Vatican Radio]] |accessdate=19 March 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>}}\n}}\n{{Infobox pope styles\n|image=Coat of arms of Franciscus.svg\n|image_size=200px\n|dipstyle=[[His Holiness]]\n|offstyle=Your Holiness\n|relstyle=Holy Father\n|deathstyle=\n}}\n{{Catholic Church sidebar}}\n'''Pope Francis''' ({{lang-la|Franciscus}}; {{lang-it|Francesco}}; {{lang-es|link=no|Francisco}}; born '''Jorge Mario Bergoglio''';{{efn|Pronunciation: {{IPA-es|\u02c8xo\u027exe \u02c8ma\u027ejo \u03b2e\u027e\u02c8\u0263o\u0263ljo|}} (Spanish), {{IPA-it|ber\u02c8\u0261\u0254\u028e\u028eo|}} (Italian)}} 17 December 1936) is the head of the [[Catholic Church]] and [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City]] State. Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, Bergoglio was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He became the [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] considered him a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[2013 papal conclave|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n\nThroughout his public life, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor and commitment to [[interfaith dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by previous popes. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming. He does not support unbridled [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], or Marxist versions of [[liberation theology]]. Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|marriage]], [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], and [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]. He opposes [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment]], and supports taking action on [[climate change]], a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of ''[[Laudato si']]''. In international diplomacy, he helped to temporarily restore [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba]] and [[Theology of Pope Francis#Refugees and migrants|supported the cause of refugees]] during the [[European migrant crisis|European]] and [[Central American migrant caravans|Central American migrant]] crises. Since 2018, he has been a vocal opponent of [[neo-nationalism]]. Francis has faced increasingly open criticism, particularly from theological conservatives, on many questions, including the admission of civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion]] with the publication of ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'' and on the question of the alleged cover-up of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|clergy sexual abuse]], against which he promulgated ''[[Vos estis lux mundi]]''.\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Jorge Mario Bergoglio attended a salesian school between 1948 and 1949.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Jorge Mario Bergoglio (fourth boy from the left on the third row from the top) at age 12, while studying at the Salesian College (c. 1948\u201349)]]\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born on 17 December 1936<ref name=\"directory\">{{cite web|title=Direttorju Ekklezjastiku 2016|url=http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|date=30 June 2016|publisher=The Church in Malta|language=Maltese, English|pages=1\u20132|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122212612/http://ms.maltadiocese.org/WEBSITE/2016/DIRETTORJU2016.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2016}}</ref> in [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]],<ref name=Remeseira/> a [[Subdivisions of Buenos Aires|neighborhood]] of [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name=\"directory\"/> He was the eldest<ref name=Garrido/> of five children of Mario Jos\u00e9 Bergoglio (1908\u20131959) and Regina Mar\u00eda S\u00edvori (1911\u20131981).

The show documents [[RuPaul]] in the search for \"America's next [[drag queen|drag]] superstar.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.rightcelebrity.com/rupauls-drag-race/201|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403120950/http://tv.rightcelebrity.com/rupauls-drag-race/201|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 3, 2012|title=\"RuPaul's Drag Race\"!|accessdate=October 12, 2011|last=Hughes|first=Scarlett|date=May 16, 2008|work=Right TV|publisher=}}</ref> RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, [[Michelle Visage]], and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on [[drag queen]] and [[drag racing]], and the title sequence and song \"Drag Race\" both have a drag-racing theme.\n\n''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has spanned twelve seasons and inspired the spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars]]''. The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/160480_for_rupauls_drag_race_mainstream_is_jumping_the_shark/|title=For 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Mainstream Is Jumping the Shark|work=Entertainment Tonight}}</ref> and airs internationally, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel. The show earned RuPaul four consecutive [[Emmy]]s (2016 to 2019) for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. The show itself was awarded as a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] in 2018 and 2019, and the Outstanding Reality Program award at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]]. It has been nominated for four [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] including Best Reality Series \u2013 Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic). Later in 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year, a feat it has since repeated.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe show premiered in 2009 {{citation needed span|as a replacement for [[Rick and Steve]].|date=March 2020}} Casting calls are announced online, where prospective contestants submit audition tapes in hopes of being cast. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping.\n\nRuPaul plays several roles in the show: host, coach, and judge. ''USA Today''{{'}}s Lifeline explains: \"RuPaul the drag queen will be the final word in judging and eliminations, while RuPaul the man will offer guidance to contestants for each challenge.\"<ref name='ReferenceA'>{{cite journal|title=RuPaul Leads Hopefuls in 'Drag Race.'|journal=[[USA Today]]|date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of fifteen contestants (the maximum a season has started with) down to the final three or four, who will compete in the final challenge. In seasons 1-3 the contestants were narrowed down to a final two, with a winner being selected in the final episode. Each episode (with the exception of the casting special, \"recap\" episode, and reunion special) follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a main challenge, a [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lip sync battle, and the elimination of a contestant. There have been some exceptions to episodes, including double-eliminations, no-eliminations, a disqualification of a contestant, and the removal of a contestant due to an injury.\n\n===Mini challenges===\nIn mini challenges, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season. For instance, the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer [[Mike Ruiz]] that includes a special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to \"reading,\"  a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with an advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not.\n\n===Maxi challenges===\nThe requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges, and initially grant [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] to the winner in the next challenge (until RuPaul announced the discontinuation of that policy mid-season in season 5). However, as of season 6, immunity is no longer granted to challenge winners. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a special prize for their win. In the past, challenge winners have been rewarded with custom designer clothing, vacations, cruises, and quality cosmetic items. The final maxi challenge of every season up to season 8 involved the contestants starring in a RuPaul music video.\n\nThe goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges became a tradition across seasons, such as the \"[[Snatch Game]]\" (in which the contestants impersonate celebrities in a humorous recreation of ''[[Match Game]]''), a [[Ball culture|ball]] or a makeover, in which the contestants create drag personas for other people.\n\n===Runways===\nThe contestants walk down a [[runway (fashion)|runway]] presenting outfits. If the maxi challenge involves the creation of an outfit, that outfit is presented to the judges in the runway. Otherwise, a theme is assigned and the contestants must put together a look that fits the theme, which is presented to the judges. The runway looks and presentation are judged along with the maxi challenge performance.\n\n===Judging===\nA panel of judges cast opinions about the challenge performances and runway looks, first to the contestants onstage, and then again with them offstage.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| total_width = 150\n| header = Current main judges\n| image1 = RuPaul by David Shankbone cropped.jpg\n| caption1 = [[RuPaul]]\n| image2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Rupaul Dragcon 2018-223 (28203478058).jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Michelle Visage]]\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = [[Ross Matthews]]\n| image4 = Ross Mathews.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Carson Kressley]]\n| image5 = CarsonKressley.jpg\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" \n|+ '''Judges on ''RuPaul's Drag Race''''' \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\" scope=\"col\"| Judge\n! colspan=\"12\" | Season\n|-\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 8)|8]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 9)|9]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 10)|10]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|11]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)|12]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[RuPaul]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Merle Ginsberg\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Santino Rice]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Michelle Visage]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"10\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Billy B\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"8\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Ross Mathews]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}} \n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Carson Kressley]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|}\n\nBeginning with the seventh season, [[Michelle Visage]], [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]] are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the beginning of season three, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the beginning of season seven, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and [[Santino Rice]], who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season eight, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, the first season of ''All Stars'', and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging was provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (commonly known as Billy B), [[Mike Ruiz]], Jeffrey Moran ([[Absolut Vodka]] marketing executive), or [[Lucian Piane]]. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes in both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.<ref name=\"BillyB1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|title=Ep. 16, Episode 16, Season 3: Reunited!|publisher=[[Logo TV]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107020503/http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the grand finale, the three main judges are joined by celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included [[Pam Tillis]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Audra McDonald]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Troye Sivan]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Debbie Harry]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[La Toya Jackson]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Amber Riley]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bob Mackie]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Tamar Braxton]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Gigi Hadid]], [[Kate Upton]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[Lizzo]], [[Dan Savage]], [[John Waters]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Candis Cayne]], [[Martha Wash]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Dita Von Teese]], [[Niecy Nash]], [[Vanessa Williams]], [[Paulina Porizkova]], [[Wilmer Valderrama]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Trina]], [[Leah Remini]], [[The B-52's]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Mel B]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Kesha]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Adam Rippon]], [[Gus Kenworthy]], [[Cara Delevingne]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Miles Heizer]], [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]], and [[Tiffany Pollard]].\n\nThe judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the winner of the challenge and which two had the weakest performances.\n\n===Lip sync===\nThe contestants selected as the bottom two must \"[[lip sync]] for their lives\" to a previously assigned song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul decides which contestant won the lip sync and is safe, while the one who lost the lip sync is eliminated. Two contestants in the show run have been eliminated without going through a lip sync: [[Willam Belli]] for breaking the competition rules, and [[Eureka O'Hara]] due to an injury. In both cases, the bottom two contestants performed the lip sync, but neither of them were eliminated. The only instance with more than two contestants lip syncing \"for their lives\" was in [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|season 11]], where an entire six-person team was up for elimination after a losing a challenge. Ultimately though, only one contestant, [[Honey Davenport]], was eliminated.\n\nFrom Season 9 on, the final contestants are also made to \"lip sync for the crown\". RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=RuPaul's Drag Race Insider Clip |url=http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |title=WOW TV |publisher=Wow.wowtv.tv |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212030718/http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>  The phrase \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is [[cunt|CUNT]]. On the [[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|first season]] of ''All Stars'', \"synergy\" was added to provide an explanation behind the contestants being sorted into teams (expanding the acronym into CUNTS).\n\n===''Untucked''===\n{{Main|RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked}}\nThe first season of ''Drag Race'' was accompanied by a seven-episode [[web series]], titled ''Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race''. [[365Gay.com|LOGOonline]] published a [[webisode]] of ''Under the Hood'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the [[green room]], replays pertinent moments from ''Drag Race'', and airs deleted footage.<ref>{{cite web |title=RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 |url=http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_1/series.jhtml |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name='WOWUnder'>{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/2009/02/09/Under_The_Hood_of_RuPaul_s_Drag_/ |title=Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |last=Corfe |first=Steven |date=February 9, 2009 |work=The WOW Report |publisher=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the second season of ''Drag Race'' in 2010, Logo reformatted ''Under the Hood'', increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked]]''. Logo broadcast an episode of ''Untucked'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. ''Untucked'' replaces the basic green room of ''Under the Hood'' with two decorated rooms that were until season six sponsored by [[Absolut Vodka]] and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season six. These two backstage areas allow for separate group conversations.\n\nAt the start of the seventh season of the ''Drag Race'', ''Untucked'' reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, ''Untucked'' was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, ''Untucked'' returned to television, where it airs on [[VH1]] during the 30 minute time slot after the 90 minute episode airs.\n\n=== ''Whatcha Packin'' ===\n\"Whatcha Packin'\" is a ''Drag Race'' web series that began at the start of the sixth season, and has also included the third and fourth seasons of ''All Stars''. It features main stage judge Michelle Visage interviewing the most recently eliminated queen about their run on the show, as well as showcasing outfits that they had brought but did not have the opportunity to wear.\n\n=== ''The Pit Stop'' ===\nSince the eighth season, every episode of ''Drag Race'' has been followed by a 5 to 10-minute long aftershow called ''The Pit Stop''. It involves a host and guest, typically past competitors of ''Drag Race'', discussing the episode that has previously aired. The Pit Stop for the eighth season of ''Drag Race'' was hosted by YouTuber [[Kingsley (YouTuber)|Kingsley]]. Seasons 9-10 and ''All Stars'' season two were hosted by \u00a0[[Raja (drag queen)|Raja]], with [[Bob the Drag Queen]] filling in for the ninth and tenth-season finales. The third season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by previous winner [[Alaska Thunderfuck]]. The fourth season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by ''All Stars'' season three winner, [[Trixie Mattel]], with eliminated AS4 contestant [[Manila Luzon]] subbing for her in the finale episode. Luzon also hosted the Pit Stop for season eleven. The current host of the show is [[Bob the Drag Queen]], winner of Season 8.\n\n==Series overview==\n{{Main|List of RuPaul's Drag Race episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"height: 4em;\"\n! style=\"width:2em;\"|Season\n!

''RuPaul's Drag Race'' employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, [[Michelle Visage]], and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on [[drag queen]] and [[drag racing]], and the title sequence and song \"Drag Race\" both have a drag-racing theme.\n\n''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has spanned twelve seasons and inspired the spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars]]''. The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/160480_for_rupauls_drag_race_mainstream_is_jumping_the_shark/|title=For 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Mainstream Is Jumping the Shark|work=Entertainment Tonight}}</ref> and airs internationally, including in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Israel. The show earned RuPaul four consecutive [[Emmy]]s (2016 to 2019) for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. The show itself was awarded as a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] in 2018 and 2019, and the Outstanding Reality Program award at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]]. It has been nominated for four [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] including Best Reality Series \u2013 Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic). Later in 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year, a feat it has since repeated.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe show premiered in 2009 {{citation needed span|as a replacement for [[Rick and Steve]].|date=March 2020}} Casting calls are announced online, where prospective contestants submit audition tapes in hopes of being cast. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping.\n\nRuPaul plays several roles in the show: host, coach, and judge. ''USA Today''{{'}}s Lifeline explains: \"RuPaul the drag queen will be the final word in judging and eliminations, while RuPaul the man will offer guidance to contestants for each challenge.\"<ref name='ReferenceA'>{{cite journal|title=RuPaul Leads Hopefuls in 'Drag Race.'|journal=[[USA Today]]|date=December 1, 2008}}</ref> ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of fifteen contestants (the maximum a season has started with) down to the final three or four, who will compete in the final challenge. In seasons 1-3 the contestants were narrowed down to a final two, with a winner being selected in the final episode. Each episode (with the exception of the casting special, \"recap\" episode, and reunion special) follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a main challenge, a [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lip sync battle, and the elimination of a contestant. There have been some exceptions to episodes, including double-eliminations, no-eliminations, a disqualification of a contestant, and the removal of a contestant due to an injury.\n\n===Mini challenges===\nIn mini challenges, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season. For instance, the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer [[Mike Ruiz]] that includes a special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to \"reading,\"  a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with an advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not.\n\n===Maxi challenges===\nThe requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges, and initially grant [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] to the winner in the next challenge (until RuPaul announced the discontinuation of that policy mid-season in season 5). However, as of season 6, immunity is no longer granted to challenge winners. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a special prize for their win. In the past, challenge winners have been rewarded with custom designer clothing, vacations, cruises, and quality cosmetic items. The final maxi challenge of every season up to season 8 involved the contestants starring in a RuPaul music video.\n\nThe goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges became a tradition across seasons, such as the \"[[Snatch Game]]\" (in which the contestants impersonate celebrities in a humorous recreation of ''[[Match Game]]''), a [[Ball culture|ball]] or a makeover, in which the contestants create drag personas for other people.\n\n===Runways===\nThe contestants walk down a [[runway (fashion)|runway]] presenting outfits. If the maxi challenge involves the creation of an outfit, that outfit is presented to the judges in the runway. Otherwise, a theme is assigned and the contestants must put together a look that fits the theme, which is presented to the judges. The runway looks and presentation are judged along with the maxi challenge performance.\n\n===Judging===\nA panel of judges cast opinions about the challenge performances and runway looks, first to the contestants onstage, and then again with them offstage.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| total_width = 150\n| header = Current main judges\n| image1 = RuPaul by David Shankbone cropped.jpg\n| caption1 = [[RuPaul]]\n| image2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Rupaul Dragcon 2018-223 (28203478058).jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Michelle Visage]]\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = [[Ross Matthews]]\n| image4 = Ross Mathews.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Carson Kressley]]\n| image5 = CarsonKressley.jpg\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" \n|+ '''Judges on ''RuPaul's Drag Race''''' \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\" scope=\"col\"| Judge\n! colspan=\"12\" | Season\n|-\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 8)|8]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 9)|9]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 10)|10]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|11]]\n! style=\"width:6.67%;\" scope=\"colspan\"| [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)|12]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[RuPaul]]\n| colspan=\"12\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Merle Ginsberg\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Santino Rice]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Michelle Visage]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"10\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Billy B\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"8\" {{N/A|}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Ross Mathews]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{cGuest}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}} \n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[Carson Kressley]]\n| colspan=\"6\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"6\" {{cMain}}\n|}\n\nBeginning with the seventh season, [[Michelle Visage]], [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]] are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the beginning of season three, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the beginning of season seven, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and [[Santino Rice]], who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season eight, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, the first season of ''All Stars'', and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging was provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (commonly known as Billy B), [[Mike Ruiz]], Jeffrey Moran ([[Absolut Vodka]] marketing executive), or [[Lucian Piane]]. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes in both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.<ref name=\"BillyB1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|title=Ep. 16, Episode 16, Season 3: Reunited!|publisher=[[Logo TV]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107020503/http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the grand finale, the three main judges are joined by celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included [[Pam Tillis]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Audra McDonald]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Troye Sivan]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Debbie Harry]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[La Toya Jackson]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Amber Riley]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bob Mackie]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Tamar Braxton]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Chanel Iman]], [[Gigi Hadid]], [[Kate Upton]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Kelly Osbourne]], [[Lizzo]], [[Dan Savage]], [[John Waters]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Candis Cayne]], [[Martha Wash]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Dita Von Teese]], [[Niecy Nash]], [[Vanessa Williams]], [[Paulina Porizkova]], [[Wilmer Valderrama]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Trina]], [[Leah Remini]], [[The B-52's]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[Mel B]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Kesha]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Adam Rippon]], [[Gus Kenworthy]], [[Cara Delevingne]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Miles Heizer]], [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]], and [[Tiffany Pollard]].\n\nThe judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the winner of the challenge and which two had the weakest performances.\n\n===Lip sync===\nThe contestants selected as the bottom two must \"[[lip sync]] for their lives\" to a previously assigned song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul decides which contestant won the lip sync and is safe, while the one who lost the lip sync is eliminated. Two contestants in the show run have been eliminated without going through a lip sync: [[Willam Belli]] for breaking the competition rules, and [[Eureka O'Hara]] due to an injury. In both cases, the bottom two contestants performed the lip sync, but neither of them were eliminated. The only instance with more than two contestants lip syncing \"for their lives\" was in [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 11)|season 11]], where an entire six-person team was up for elimination after a losing a challenge. Ultimately though, only one contestant, [[Honey Davenport]], was eliminated.\n\nFrom Season 9 on, the final contestants are also made to \"lip sync for the crown\". RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as \"Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=RuPaul's Drag Race Insider Clip |url=http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |title=WOW TV |publisher=Wow.wowtv.tv |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212030718/http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>  The phrase \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent\" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is [[cunt|CUNT]]. On the [[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|first season]] of ''All Stars'', \"synergy\" was added to provide an explanation behind the contestants being sorted into teams (expanding the acronym into CUNTS).\n\n===''Untucked''===\n{{Main|RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked}}\nThe first season of ''Drag Race'' was accompanied by a seven-episode [[web series]], titled ''Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race''. [[365Gay.com|LOGOonline]] published a [[webisode]] of ''Under the Hood'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the [[green room]], replays pertinent moments from ''Drag Race'', and airs deleted footage.<ref>{{cite web |title=RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 |url=http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_1/series.jhtml |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name='WOWUnder'>{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/2009/02/09/Under_The_Hood_of_RuPaul_s_Drag_/ |title=Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |last=Corfe |first=Steven |date=February 9, 2009 |work=The WOW Report |publisher=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the second season of ''Drag Race'' in 2010, Logo reformatted ''Under the Hood'', increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked]]''. Logo broadcast an episode of ''Untucked'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. ''Untucked'' replaces the basic green room of ''Under the Hood'' with two decorated rooms that were until season six sponsored by [[Absolut Vodka]] and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season six. These two backstage areas allow for separate group conversations.\n\nAt the start of the seventh season of the ''Drag Race'', ''Untucked'' reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, ''Untucked'' was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, ''Untucked'' returned to television, where it airs on [[VH1]] during the 30 minute time slot after the 90 minute episode airs.\n\n=== ''Whatcha Packin'' ===\n\"Whatcha Packin'\" is a ''Drag Race'' web series that began at the start of the sixth season, and has also included the third and fourth seasons of ''All Stars''. It features main stage judge Michelle Visage interviewing the most recently eliminated queen about their run on the show, as well as showcasing outfits that they had brought but did not have the opportunity to wear.\n\n=== ''The Pit Stop'' ===\nSince the eighth season, every episode of ''Drag Race'' has been followed by a 5 to 10-minute long aftershow called ''The Pit Stop''. It involves a host and guest, typically past competitors of ''Drag Race'', discussing the episode that has previously aired. The Pit Stop for the eighth season of ''Drag Race'' was hosted by YouTuber [[Kingsley (YouTuber)|Kingsley]]. Seasons 9-10 and ''All Stars'' season two were hosted by \u00a0[[Raja (drag queen)|Raja]], with [[Bob the Drag Queen]] filling in for the ninth and tenth-season finales. The third season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by previous winner [[Alaska Thunderfuck]]. The fourth season of ''All Stars'' was hosted by ''All Stars'' season three winner, [[Trixie Mattel]], with eliminated AS4 contestant [[Manila Luzon]] subbing for her in the finale episode. Luzon also hosted the Pit Stop for season eleven. The current host of the show is [[Bob the Drag Queen]], winner of Season 8.\n\n==Series overview==\n{{Main|List of RuPaul's Drag Race episodes}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"height: 4em;\"\n! style=\"width:2em;\"|Season\n!

First conceived during [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration]] as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person [[Project Mercury]], which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s national goal of \"landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person [[Project Gemini]] conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.\n\nKennedy's goal was accomplished on the [[Apollo 11]] mission when astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed their [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in [[lunar orbit]] in the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the Moon, the last, [[Apollo 17]], in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|twelve men walked on the Moon]].\n\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|[[Buzz Aldrin]] (pictured) walked on the [[Moon]] with [[Neil Armstrong]], on [[Apollo 11]], July 20\u201321, 1969.|alt=Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, standing on the Moon]]\n[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|alt=|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', the iconic 1968 image from [[Apollo 8|Apollo{{nbsp}}8]] taken by astronaut [[William Anders]]]]\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when an [[Apollo 1]] cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first successful landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar [[geology of the Moon|geological]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the [[Apollo 13]] landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which destroyed the service module's capability to provide electrical power, crippling the CSM's propulsion and life support systems. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the lunar module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions. Apollo used [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family rockets]] as launch vehicles, which were also used for an [[Apollo Applications Program]], which consisted of [[Skylab]], a [[space station]] that supported three crewed missions in 1973\u201374, and the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]], a joint US-[[Soviet Union]] Earth-orbit mission in 1975.\n\nApollo set several major [[List of space exploration milestones, 1957\u20131969|human spaceflight milestones]]. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]]. [[Apollo 8]] was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and [[Apollo 11]] was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one.\n\nOverall the Apollo program returned {{convert|842|lb|kg}} of lunar rocks and [[lunar soil|soil]] to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its [[Johnson Space Center]] and [[Kennedy Space Center]]. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and [[human spaceflight]], including [[avionics]], telecommunications, and computers.\n\n==Background==\n===Origin and spacecraft feasibility studies===\n{{main|Apollo spacecraft feasibility study}}\n\nThe Apollo program was conceived during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to [[Project Mercury]]. While the Mercury [[space capsule|capsule]] could support only one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three. Possible missions included ferrying crews to a [[space station]], [[circumlunar trajectory|circumlunar flight]]s, and eventual crewed [[Moon landing|lunar landing]]s.\n\nThe program was named after [[Apollo]], the Greek god of light, music, and the Sun, by [[NASA]] manager [[Abe Silverstein]], who later said, \"I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby.\"<ref>[[#Murray & Cox|Murray & Cox 1989]], p. 55</ref> Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt \"Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program.\"<ref name=\"pressrelease\">{{cite press release |title=Release 69-36 |date=July 14, 1969 |publisher=[[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Research Center]] |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/apollo_press_release.html |location=Cleveland, OH |accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator [[Hugh L. Dryden]] announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of [[Space Task Group]] conferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a ''mission module'' cabin separate from the ''command module'' (piloting and reentry cabin), and a ''propulsion and equipment module''. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to [[Convair|General Dynamics/Convair]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by [[Maxime Faget]], to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.<ref name=\"chariots_feasibility\">[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 1.7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-7.html \"Feasility Studies\"]. pp. 16-21</ref>\n\n===Political pressure builds===\n{{main|Space Race}}\n\nIn November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the [[Soviet Union]] in the fields of [[space exploration]] and [[missile defense]]. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the \"[[missile gap]]\" that he and many other senators felt had developed between the Soviet Union and United States due to the inaction of President Eisenhower.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Christopher A. |last=Preble |title=\"Who Ever Believed in the 'Missile Gap'?\": John F.

Webb]] requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.<ref>[[#Beschloss|Beschloss 1997]], p. 55</ref>\n\nOn April 12, 1961, Soviet [[astronaut#Russian|cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the US House [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science and Astronautics]] one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.<ref>[[#87th Congress|87th Congress 1961]]</ref> Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.<ref>[[#Sidey|Sidey 1963]], p. 114</ref>\n\n[[File:Kennedy Giving Historic Speech to Congress - GPN-2000-001658.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

The mission module was determined to be useful only as an extra room, and therefore unnecessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/ch3-7.htm|title= Soyuz - Development of the Space Station; Apollo - Voyage to the Moon|access-date=June 12, 2016}}</ref> They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961.

LOR advocates including [[John Houbolt]] at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke \"somewhat as a voice in the wilderness\", Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.<ref>[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 3.4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch3-4.html \"Early Reaction to LOR\"]. p. 71</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Nicholas E.

Wiesner blurted out \"No, that's no good\" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was \"still subject to final review\". Webb held firm and issued a [[request for proposal]] to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb.

Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. In 1964 an MSC study concluded, \"The [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] [as lifeboat]{{nbsp}}... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|SPS]].\"<ref>Letterman, p. 404 (James Lovell, \"Explosion on Apollo 13; April 1970: From the Earth to the Moon and Back\".

Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a ''command and service Module'' (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the ''Lunar Excursion Module'' (LEM, later shortened to ''Lunar Module'', LM, but still pronounced \"lem\") which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.<ref name=\"SummaryReport\" />\n\n===Command and service module===\n{{main|Apollo command and service module}}\n[[File:Apollo CSM lunar orbit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollo 15]] [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] in lunar orbit|alt=The cone-shaped command module, attached to the cylindrical service module, orbits the Moon with a panel removed, exposing the scientific instrument module]]\n\nThe [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing.

Twenty-four of these left Earth's orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 (three of them twice). Half of the 24 walked on the Moon's surface, though none of them returned to it after landing once. One of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist.

The Saturn V experienced [[pogo oscillation]], a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo{{nbsp}}6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo{{nbsp}}6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn{{nbsp}}V ready to fly men, canceling a third uncrewed test.<ref>[[Apollo program#Brooks.2C et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 10.5: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch10-5.html \"Apollo 6: Saturn V's Shaky Dress Rehearsal\"]</ref>\n\n===Crewed development missions===\n\n<imagemap>\nFile:Apollo manned development missions insignia.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Apollo crewed development mission patches.

Apollo 13 launched Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in April 1970, headed for the [[Fra Mauro formation]]. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"lifeboat\" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.<ref name=\"KSC-Apollo_13\" /> Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch11-7.html \"Mission to Fra Mauro\"]. p. 199</ref>\n\nThe contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs was enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was [[Apollo/Skylab A7L#A7LB Spacesuit (Apollo, Skylab and ASTP)|revised for the extended missions]] to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 12-4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-4.html \"Changes for Extended Lunar Missions\"]. pp. 211-214</ref>\n\n====Mission cutbacks====\n{{main|Canceled Apollo missions}}\n\nAbout the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming [[Space Shuttle]]. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-2.html \"Cutbacks and Program Changes\"]. pp. 201-202</ref> The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the [[John F.

The final fiscal year of Apollo funding was 1973.\n\n==Apollo Applications Program==\n{{main|Apollo Applications Program}}\n\nLooking beyond the crewed lunar landings, NASA investigated several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (''Apollo X'',) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter]] (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/ch4.htm|title=A Science Program for Manned Spaceflight|access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a [[Manned Venus Flyby|Venus fly-by mission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=j74hfnr889reqoinelc27u5877&action=dlattach;topic=34776.0;attach=584256;sess=0 |title=Manned Venus Flyby |date=February 1, 1967 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board. Dubbed [[Skylab]], it was assembled on the ground rather than in space, and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount.

First conceived during [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration]] as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person [[Project Mercury]], which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s national goal of \"landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person [[Project Gemini]] conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.\n\nKennedy's goal was accomplished on the [[Apollo 11]] mission when astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed their [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in [[lunar orbit]] in the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the Moon, the last, [[Apollo 17]], in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|twelve men walked on the Moon]].\n\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|[[Buzz Aldrin]] (pictured) walked on the [[Moon]] with [[Neil Armstrong]], on [[Apollo 11]], July 20\u201321, 1969.|alt=Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, standing on the Moon]]\n[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|alt=|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', the iconic 1968 image from [[Apollo 8|Apollo{{nbsp}}8]] taken by astronaut [[William Anders]]]]\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when an [[Apollo 1]] cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first successful landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar [[geology of the Moon|geological]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the [[Apollo 13]] landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which destroyed the service module's capability to provide electrical power, crippling the CSM's propulsion and life support systems. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the lunar module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions. Apollo used [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family rockets]] as launch vehicles, which were also used for an [[Apollo Applications Program]], which consisted of [[Skylab]], a [[space station]] that supported three crewed missions in 1973\u201374, and the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]], a joint US-[[Soviet Union]] Earth-orbit mission in 1975.\n\nApollo set several major [[List of space exploration milestones, 1957\u20131969|human spaceflight milestones]]. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]]. [[Apollo 8]] was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and [[Apollo 11]] was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one.\n\nOverall the Apollo program returned {{convert|842|lb|kg}} of lunar rocks and [[lunar soil|soil]] to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its [[Johnson Space Center]] and [[Kennedy Space Center]]. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and [[human spaceflight]], including [[avionics]], telecommunications, and computers.\n\n==Background==\n===Origin and spacecraft feasibility studies===\n{{main|Apollo spacecraft feasibility study}}\n\nThe Apollo program was conceived during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to [[Project Mercury]]. While the Mercury [[space capsule|capsule]] could support only one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three. Possible missions included ferrying crews to a [[space station]], [[circumlunar trajectory|circumlunar flight]]s, and eventual crewed [[Moon landing|lunar landing]]s.\n\nThe program was named after [[Apollo]], the Greek god of light, music, and the Sun, by [[NASA]] manager [[Abe Silverstein]], who later said, \"I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby.\"<ref>[[#Murray & Cox|Murray & Cox 1989]], p. 55</ref> Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt \"Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program.\"<ref name=\"pressrelease\">{{cite press release |title=Release 69-36 |date=July 14, 1969 |publisher=[[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Research Center]] |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/apollo_press_release.html |location=Cleveland, OH |accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator [[Hugh L. Dryden]] announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of [[Space Task Group]] conferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a ''mission module'' cabin separate from the ''command module'' (piloting and reentry cabin), and a ''propulsion and equipment module''. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to [[Convair|General Dynamics/Convair]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by [[Maxime Faget]], to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.<ref name=\"chariots_feasibility\">[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 1.7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-7.html \"Feasility Studies\"]. pp. 16-21</ref>\n\n===Political pressure builds===\n{{main|Space Race}}\n\nIn November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the [[Soviet Union]] in the fields of [[space exploration]] and [[missile defense]].

Webb]] requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.<ref>[[#Beschloss|Beschloss 1997]], p. 55</ref>\n\nOn April 12, 1961, Soviet [[astronaut#Russian|cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the US House [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science and Astronautics]] one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.<ref>[[#87th Congress|87th Congress 1961]]</ref> Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.<ref>[[#Sidey|Sidey 1963]], p. 114</ref>\n\n[[File:Kennedy Giving Historic Speech to Congress - GPN-2000-001658.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

LOR advocates including [[John Houbolt]] at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke \"somewhat as a voice in the wilderness\", Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.<ref>[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 3.4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch3-4.html \"Early Reaction to LOR\"]. p. 71</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Nicholas E.

Wiesner blurted out \"No, that's no good\" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was \"still subject to final review\". Webb held firm and issued a [[request for proposal]] to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb.

Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. In 1964 an MSC study concluded, \"The [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] [as lifeboat]{{nbsp}}... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|SPS]].\"<ref>Letterman, p. 404 (James Lovell, \"Explosion on Apollo 13; April 1970: From the Earth to the Moon and Back\".

Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a ''command and service Module'' (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the ''Lunar Excursion Module'' (LEM, later shortened to ''Lunar Module'', LM, but still pronounced \"lem\") which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.<ref name=\"SummaryReport\" />\n\n===Command and service module===\n{{main|Apollo command and service module}}\n[[File:Apollo CSM lunar orbit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollo 15]] [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] in lunar orbit|alt=The cone-shaped command module, attached to the cylindrical service module, orbits the Moon with a panel removed, exposing the scientific instrument module]]\n\nThe [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing.

The capability of the command module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.\n\n[[Apollo 5]] (AS-204) was the first uncrewed test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a \"fire-in-the-hole\" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage.

The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced [[pogo oscillation]], a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection.

Apollo 13 launched Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in April 1970, headed for the [[Fra Mauro formation]]. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"lifeboat\" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.<ref name=\"KSC-Apollo_13\" /> Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch11-7.html \"Mission to Fra Mauro\"]. p. 199</ref>\n\nThe contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs was enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was [[Apollo/Skylab A7L#A7LB Spacesuit (Apollo, Skylab and ASTP)|revised for the extended missions]] to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 12-4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-4.html \"Changes for Extended Lunar Missions\"]. pp. 211-214</ref>\n\n====Mission cutbacks====\n{{main|Canceled Apollo missions}}\n\nAbout the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming [[Space Shuttle]]. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-2.html \"Cutbacks and Program Changes\"]. pp. 201-202</ref> The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the [[John F.

The final fiscal year of Apollo funding was 1973.\n\n==Apollo Applications Program==\n{{main|Apollo Applications Program}}\n\nLooking beyond the crewed lunar landings, NASA investigated several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (''Apollo X'',) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter]] (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/ch4.htm|title=A Science Program for Manned Spaceflight|access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a [[Manned Venus Flyby|Venus fly-by mission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=j74hfnr889reqoinelc27u5877&action=dlattach;topic=34776.0;attach=584256;sess=0 |title=Manned Venus Flyby |date=February 1, 1967 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board.

The two worst performing teams during the season, with the exception of [[Toulouse Olympique]], will be relegated to [[RFL League 1|Championship 1]].\n\nThere is no automatic promotion from this league to Super League, which uses a licensing system renewed every three years. Qualifying for the Grand Final is a prerequisite for Championship clubs to be able to apply for license in the next round of applications for the [[2012\u201314 Super League licences|2012\u201314 period]].\n\nThe competition was very close with most teams having a chance of making the top 6 going into the final round. In the end [[Barrow Raiders]] topped the standings followed by [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]. The [[Leigh Centurions]] were relegated on the final day of competition despite finishing only third to last and [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]] were also relegated but their fate had been sealed for some time. In the weeks following the competitions completion, Gateshead Thunder were eliminated following salary cap breaches and subsequently relegated to the Championship 1 for 2010, Leigh Centurions were therefore reprieved from relegation and remained in the Championship for 2010.\n\nIn the playoffs, [[Widnes Vikings]] and [[Featherstone Rovers]] advance from the first week to play each other. Featherstone won this game which gave them the chance to take on Halifax, who lost their game to Barrow, for a spot in the grand final. Halifax won and went on to play Barrow in the final but lost 26-18.\n\n==Table==\n{{RFL National Championship 2009 Ladder}}\n\n==Play-offs==\n\nThe Co-operative Championship uses a [[Top six play-offs|top 6 play-off system]].\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:80%; text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#c1d8ff;\"\n!

The two worst performing teams during the season, with the exception of [[Toulouse Olympique]], will be relegated to [[RFL League 1|Championship 1]].\n\nThere is no automatic promotion from this league to Super League, which uses a licensing system renewed every three years. Qualifying for the Grand Final is a prerequisite for Championship clubs to be able to apply for license in the next round of applications for the [[2012\u201314 Super League licences|2012\u201314 period]].\n\nThe competition was very close with most teams having a chance of making the top 6 going into the final round. In the end [[Barrow Raiders]] topped the standings followed by [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]. The [[Leigh Centurions]] were relegated on the final day of competition despite finishing only third to last and [[Doncaster R.L.F.C.|Doncaster]] were also relegated but their fate had been sealed for some time. In the weeks following the competitions completion, Gateshead Thunder were eliminated following salary cap breaches and subsequently relegated to the Championship 1 for 2010, Leigh Centurions were therefore reprieved from relegation and remained in the Championship for 2010.\n\nIn the playoffs, [[Widnes Vikings]] and [[Featherstone Rovers]] advance from the first week to play each other. Featherstone won this game which gave them the chance to take on Halifax, who lost their game to Barrow, for a spot in the grand final. Halifax won and went on to play Barrow in the final but lost 26-18.\n\n==Table==\n{{RFL National Championship 2009 Ladder}}\n\n==Play-offs==\n\nThe Co-operative Championship uses a [[Top six play-offs|top 6 play-off system]].\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:80%; text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#c1d8ff;\"\n!
