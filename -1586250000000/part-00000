It was thought that such a stadium could attract [[Davis Cup]] tennis matches, polo tournaments and the annual [[Army\u2013Navy Game|Army-Navy football game]]. A later effort by DC Director of Public Buildings and Parks [[Ulysses S. Grant III]] and Congressman [[Hamilton Fish III|Hamilton Fish]] of [[New York's 26th congressional district|New York]] sought to turn the National Stadium into a 100,000-seat memorial to [[Theodore Roosevelt]], suitable for hosting inaugurations, possibly on the [[National Mall]] or [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]]. This attracted the attention of the RMA, which suggested the East Capital location. This would allow the [[Lincoln Memorial]], then under construction west of the Capitol, and the Roosevelt memorial to become bookend monuments to the two great Republican presidents. The effort lost steam when Congress chose not to fund the stadium in time to move the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympics]] from [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dyersson|first1=Mark|last2=Trumpboer|first2=Robert|title=The Rise of Stadiums in the Modern United States: Cathedrals of Sport|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317989288|pages=59\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of a stadium gained support in 1938, when Senator [[Robert Rice Reynolds|Robert Reynolds]] of [[North Carolina]] pushed for the creation of a municipal outdoor stadium within the District, citing the \"fact that America is the only major country not possessing a stadium with facilities to accommodate the Olympic Games\". The following year a model of the proposed stadium, to be located near the current site of RFK Stadium, was presented to the public. By 1941, the National Capital Planning Commission had begun buying property for a stadium, purchasing the land between East Capitol, C, 19th and 21st NE.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nearly All Land for D.C.

Congressman [[Charles R. Howell]] of [[New Jersey's 4th congressional district|New Jersey]] proposed legislation to build a stadium, again with hopes of attracting the Olympics. He pushed for a report, completed in 1956 by the National Capital Planning Commission entitled \"Preliminary Report on Sites for National Memorial Stadium\", which identified the \"East Capitol Site\" to be used for the stadium. In September 1957, \"The District of Columbia Stadium Act\" was introduced and authorized a 50,000-seat stadium to be used by the Senators and Redskins at the Armory site. It was signed into law by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] on July 29, 1958, with an estimated cost of $7.5 to $8.6 million.<ref name=\"Return\"/> The lease for the stadium was signed by the D.C. Armory Board and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] on December 12, 1958. The stadium, the first major multisport facility built for both football and baseball, was designed by [[George Dahl]], Ewin Engineering Associates (since 1954 part of what became [[Volkert, Inc.]]) and [[Osborn Engineering]]. Groundbreaking for the {{nowrap|$24 million}} venue was in 1960 on July 8, and construction proceeded over the following 14 months.<ref name=\"History\"/> The existing venue for baseball (and football) in Washington was [[Griffith Stadium]], about {{convert|4|mi|0|spell=in}} northwest.\n\nWhile Redskins\u2019 owner [[George Preston Marshall]] was pleased with the stadium, Senators' owner [[Calvin Griffith]] was not.

In [[1974 North American Soccer League season|1974]], two Maryland businessmen purchased the rights to the Baltimore Bays of the semi-professional [[American Soccer League (1933\u201383)|American Soccer League]], moved the team to the District and renamed it the Washington Diplomats. They signed a lease calculating that an average of 12,000 spectators would allow them to break even. Despite [[white flight]], owners thought that recent completion of the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Beltway]], the stadium's 12,000 parking spaces and future completion of a [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station would facilitate attendance. Games were scheduled for Saturday and prices were set low. The Diplomats inaugural game was on May 4 with an attendance of 10,175; Mayor [[Walter Washington]] ceremonially kicked off the game, but the Dips lost 5\u20131 to the [[1973 North American Soccer League season|defending]] [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|NASL]] champion [[Philadelphia Atoms]]. Attendance dropped throughout the season.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\">{{cite book|last1=Elzey|first1=Chris|last2=Wiggins|first2=David K.|title=DC Sports: The Nation's Capital at Play|date=Jul 15, 2015|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=9781610755665|pages=159\u2013161}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1975 North American Soccer League season|1975]], the Diplomats were informed that the recently installed natural turf at RFK would not be ready for opening day, so they scheduled their first two home games that season for [[Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School|W.T. Woodson High School]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]]. After the games attracted more than 10,000 fans each, the Diplomats moved most of their home games to Woodson, but then moved the last five back to RFK once soccer superstar [[Pel\u00e9]] was added to the roster of the [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|New York Cosmos]]. Pel\u00e9 was so popular that the 1975 Cosmos-Diplomats match broke the NASL attendance record at 35,620.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pele Packs Stands at RFK Stadium|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/43269802|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=The Capitol|date=30 June 1975}}</ref> Even with the success of the Cosmos game, attendance declined again and before the [[1976 North American Soccer League season|1976]] season the Diplomats announced that they had scheduled every home game, except the one against the Cosmos, at Woodson. During the season, they moved that game to Woodson.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nAfter averaging 5,963 at Woodson, the Diplomats decided to ramp up their marketing and move back to RFK in [[1977 North American Soccer League season|1977]]. The team changed everything from the uniforms to the cheerleaders, but the team's disappointing on-the-field performance hurt attendance (a ~31,000 fan game against Pel\u00e9 and the Cosmos notwithstanding). In [[1978 North American Soccer League season|1978]], attendance continued to fall, even though the Dips made the playoffs. Success on the field during the 1978 and [[1979 North American Soccer League season|1979]] seasons (including a franchise-best 19 wins in '79) did not translate to ticket a sales and even with a negligible amount of revenue from \u201c[[Indoor soccer|indoor]] Dips\u201d games at the D.C. Armory during the offseason, the franchise continued to lose money.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nIn [[1980 North American Soccer League season|1980]], they signed Dutch international superstar [[Johan Cruyff]], the Pel\u00e9 of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], from the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]]. Needing 20,000 fans per game to break even, they managed to attract 24,000 for the opener and a District record 53,351 for the game against the Pele-less Cosmos (the fifth-largest soccer crowd at RFK ever), but the team failed to break-even financially. After racking up debts of $5 million, the first incarnation of the Dips folded.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nThree months later, the [[Detroit Express]] announced a move to D.C. for [[1981 North American Soccer League season|1981]], and that they would also be the Diplomats. They had trouble attracting fans;<!--after the NASL championship game, the \"[[Soccer Bowl '80|Soccer Bowl]]\", was held at RFK,--> and soon folded.\n\nThe Diplomats of the NASL, racked up an impressive {{winning percentage|60|29|record=y}} record at RFK, the best winning percentage of any RFK home team, and were {{nowrap|1\u20131}} in the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Washington Diplomats Games|url=http://soccerstats.us/teams/washington-diplomats/games/|website=Soccer Stats|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nIn 1987, a new soccer team also called the [[Washington Diplomats (1988\u201390)|Washington Diplomats]], was formed. They played at RFK, and sometimes at the RFK auxiliary field, for three seasons as part of the [[American Soccer League (1988\u201389)|ASL]] and then the [[American Professional Soccer League|APSL]]. They won the ASL Championship in 1988 but often drew fewer than 1000 fans. In 1990 they finished last in the Southern Division of the APSL East, were unable to pay the rent and folded in October 1990.<ref name=\"Merger\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=James H.|title=Bays, Stars merger Diplomats kick in|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-10-30/sports/1990303001_1_maryland-bays-diplomats-baltimore-washington-area|accessdate=31 January 2018|date=30 October 1990}}</ref> Over the course of 4 seasons they were {{winning percentage|18|15|record=y}} at RFK, and 2-0 at the RFK auxiliary field.\n\n===George Washington Colonials (1961\u20131966)===\nThe other team to move from Griffith to D.C. Stadium was the [[George Washington Colonials football|George Washington University Colonials]] [[college football]] team. The stadium was dedicated during the October 7, 1961 game against VMI, the first college football game there, which GWU won 30-6. The Colonials were forced to play their first three games on the road to allow the stadium to be completed. In the following years, because the Senators had priority, GWU waited until October (when baseball season was over) to schedule games. From 1961 to 1964 they played road games in September, and in 1965 and 1966 they played at high school stadiums in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia]].<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"History\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=George Washington U Drops Grid Program|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16522053/|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=20 January 1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Colonials, Like Cats, Seek First Win Saturday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16522071/|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=The Daily Herald|date=27 September 1962}}</ref>\n\nThe Colonials had no real success at D.C.

The Nationals played their first three seasons ([[2005 Washington Nationals season|2005]]\u2013[[2007 Washington Nationals season|2007]]) at RFK, then moved to [[Nationals Park]] in [[2008 Washington Nationals season|2008]].

However, in his lone season with the team in [[2006 Washington Nationals season|2006]], [[Alfonso Soriano]] hit 46 home runs.\n\nDuring their three seasons at RFK, the Nationals failed to make the playoffs or post a winning record. They went 41-40 at home in 2005 and 2006 and 40-41 in 2007 to finish with a {{winning percentage|122|121|record=y}} record at RFK.\n\n=== Howard Bison (1970\u20132016) ===\nNo team has a long history with RFK Stadium than the [[Howard Bison football]] team, who played there 42 times over nearly 46 years (the Detroit Tigers are 2nd by ~8 months, having played their first game there April 9, 1962, and they're last on June 20, 2007).

Over three years, the Freedom racked up a 15-9-6 record at RFK and finished as one of the league's top teams. They came in 2nd in 2002 and won the league's Founder's Cup in 2003. They played all of their home games at RFK, except for one in 2001 at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis to avoid the Washington Grand Prix. Their last game at RFK as part of WUSA was on August 2, 2003, when they defeated the San Jose Cyber Rays. They won the final Founder's Cup in August 2003 and returned to RFK a few days later - minus the players who were playing in the 2003 Women's World Cup - for a victory celebration with the fans, which would be their final WUSA event at RFK. WUSA suspended operation the next month. Their victory in the Founders Cup means that the Freedom won both the first and last games in WUSA history. For a time, their championship banner hung in RFK, but when the Nationals moved in, the banner was moved to the [[Maryland SoccerPlex|Maryland Soccerplex]].\n\nThe Freedom continued, first as an exhibition team called the Washington Freedom Soccer Club, and then as a member of the W-League and the Women's Professional Soccer league in 2006.

Towards the end of the 1967 season, the Whips resorted to organizing British Isles sporting contests such as cricket, hurling, and rugby before games in hopes of luring expatriates.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nIn 1968, to stay viable, they negotiated a reduction in the lease payment and reduced admission prices by one-third; among other discounts. The USA merged with the [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]] to form the new [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]]. Despite problems on and off the field, the team found itself in a battle for a playoff spot and towards the end of the season crowds swelled to as much as 14,227 in what proved to be the deciding match for the NASL Atlantic Division title. This September 7, 1968 match against the [[Atlanta Chiefs]] was the last for the Whips at D.C. Stadium. That season, the team went 15-10-7 drawing an average of 6,586 fans.

But attendance quickly dropped off, with as few as 7,303 showing up for a late-season game against the [[Boston Breakers]]. The team went 4-14 in 1983 and 3-15 in 1984, averaging 7,700 fans.\n\nWith six games remaining in the 1984 season, owner Berl Bernhard sold the team to Florida real estate developer Woody Weiser. In the off-season, that deal fell through. Donald Dizney bought the team, moved it to Orlando and renamed it the Renegades.\n\nAfter going {{winning percentage|7|29|record=y}} overall, and {{winning percentage|5|18|record=y}} at RFK, the Federals ended their run with a 20-17 win over the [[New Orleans Breakers]] on June 24, 1984.\n\n===Team America (1983)===\n[[Team America (NASL)|Team America]] was a professional version of the United States men's national soccer team which played like a franchise in the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL) during the 1983 season.

It was the first to use the so-called \"[[cookie-cutter stadium|cookie-cutter]]\" concept, an approach also used in [[Veterans Stadium|Philadelphia]], [[Shea Stadium|New York]], [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston]], [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium|Atlanta]], [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]], [[Qualcomm Stadium|San Diego]], [[Riverfront Stadium|Cincinnati]], [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum|Oakland]], and [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]]. RFK Stadium ultimately outlasted all of them except Houston, San Diego, and Oakland (the former is still standing but is no longer actively used, while the latter two are still active).\n\nWhile the perimeter of the stadium is circular, the front edge of the upper and lower decks form a \"V\" shape in deference to the baseball configuration.  The rows of seating in the upper and lower decks follow the \"V\" layout, and the discrepancy between the shapes of the inner and outer rings permits more rows of seats to be inserted along the foul lines than at home plate and in the outfield.  As a result, the height of the outside wall rises and falls in waves, and this is echoed in the roof, resulting in a \"butterfly\" appearance when seen at ground level from the west.  This feature is unique among the circular stadiums of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1961, the stadium represented a new level of luxury. It offered 50,000 seats, each {{convert|22|in|cm}} wide (at a time when the typical seat was only {{convert|15|\u2013|16|in|cm|abbr=on}}), air-conditioned locker rooms and a lounge for player's wives. It had a machine-operated tarpaulin to cover the field, yard-wide aisles, and ramps that made it possible to empty the stadium in just 15 minutes. The ticket office was connected to the ticket windows by pneumatic tubes. The press boxes could be enclosed and expanded for big events. The stadium had a holding cell for drunks and brawlers. It had 12,000 parking spaces and was served by 300 buses. It had lighting that was twice as bright as Griffith Stadium.<ref name=\"Jail\"/>\n\nIt was not ideal for either sport, due to the different geometries of the playing fields. As the playing field dimensions for football and baseball vary greatly, seating had to accommodate the larger playing surface. This would prove to be the case at nearly every multi-purpose/cookie-cutter stadium.\n\nAs a baseball park, RFK was a target of scorn from baseball purists, largely because it was one of the few stadiums with no lower-deck seats in the outfield. The only outfield seats were in the upper deck, above a high wall. According to ''[[The Sporting News|Sporting News]]'' publications in the 1960s, over 27,000 seats\u2014roughly 60% of the listed capacity of 45,000 for baseball\u2014were in the upper tier or mezzanine levels. The lower-to-upper proportion improved for the Redskins with end-zone seats. The first ten rows of the football configuration were nearly at the field level, making it difficult to see over the players. The baseball diamond was aligned due east (home plate to center field), and the football field ran along the first baseline (northwest to southeast).\n\n{{wide image|DC United.jpg|800px<!--|align-cap=center-->|Panoramic view <!--of Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium--> in 2012, from the west corner (home plate to center field, due east)}}\n\nA [[Movable seating|complex conversion]] was necessary, at a cost of $40,000 each time, to change the stadium from a football configuration to baseball and back again; in its final form, this included rolling the third-base lower-level seats into the outfield along a buried rail, dropping the hydraulic pitcher's mound {{convert|3|ft|1}} into the ground, and laying sod over the infield dirt. Later facilities were designed so the seating configuration could be changed more quickly and at a lower cost. The conversion was required several times per year during the Senators' joint tenancy with the Redskins (1962\u201371) but became much more frequent during the Nationals/D.C. United era; in 2005, the conversion was made over twenty times.\n\nOriginally the seats located behind the stadium's third-base dugout were removed for baseball games and put back in place when the stadium was converted to the football (and later soccer) configuration. When these sections were in place, RFK seated approximately 56,000. With the Nationals' arrival in 2005, this particular segment of the stands was permanently removed to facilitate the switch between the baseball and soccer configurations. These seats were not restored following the Nationals' move to Nationals Park, leaving the stadium's [[seating capacity]] at approximately 46,000. The majority of the upper-deck seats normally were not made available for D.C. United matches, so the stadium's reduced capacity normally was not problematic for the club.\n\n<!--The football/soccer field alignment is northwest to southeast, approximately along the baseball diamond's first base line.-->\nDuring the years when the stadium was without baseball (1972\u20132004)<!--used only for Redskins games (1972\u201396)-->, the rotating seats remained in the football configuration. If an exhibition baseball game was scheduled, the left-field wall was only {{convert|250|ft|0}} from home plate, and a large screen was erected in left field for some games.\n\n[[File:Capitol from top of Washington Monument.JPG|250px|thumb|View east from [[Washington Monument]],<br>RFK Stadium in background]]\nSome of RFK's quirks endear the venue to fans and players.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The large rolling bleacher section is less stable than other seating, allowing fans to jump in rhythm to cause the whole area to bounce. Also, despite its small size (it never seated more than 58,000), because of the stadium's design and the proximity of the fans to the field when configured for football, the stadium was extremely loud when the usual sell-out Redskins crowds became vocal. Legend has it that Redskins head coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] would order a large rolling door in the side of the stadium to be opened when visiting teams were attempting field goals at critical moments in games so that a swirling wind from off the Potomac and Anacostia rivers might interfere with the flight of the kicked ball.\n\nSince the stadium is on a direct sightline with the [[Washington Monument]] and the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], light towers were not allowed; instead, [[Arc lamp|arc lights]] were placed on its curved, dipping roof.\n\nEvents D.C.\u2014the city agency which operates RFK Stadium\u2014began a strategic planning process in November 2013 to study options for the future of the stadium, its {{convert|80|acre|ha}} campus and the nonmilitary portions of the adjacent [[D.C. Armory]]. Events D.C. said one option to be studied was demolition within a decade, while another would be the status quo. The strategic planning process also included the design and development of options. The agency said that RFK Stadium has generated $4 million to $5 million a year in revenues since 1997, which did not cover operating expenses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/top-shelf/2013/11/events-dc-looks-at-next-steps-for-rfk.html|last=Cooper|first=Rebecca|title=Events D.C.

It was thought that such a stadium could attract [[Davis Cup]] tennis matches, polo tournaments and the annual [[Army\u2013Navy Game|Army-Navy football game]]. A later effort by DC Director of Public Buildings and Parks [[Ulysses S. Grant III]] and Congressman [[Hamilton Fish III|Hamilton Fish]] of [[New York's 26th congressional district|New York]] sought to turn the National Stadium into a 100,000-seat memorial to [[Theodore Roosevelt]], suitable for hosting inaugurations, possibly on the [[National Mall]] or [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]]. This attracted the attention of the RMA, which suggested the East Capital location. This would allow the [[Lincoln Memorial]], then under construction west of the Capitol, and the Roosevelt memorial to become bookend monuments to the two great Republican presidents. The effort lost steam when Congress chose not to fund the stadium in time to move the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympics]] from [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dyersson|first1=Mark|last2=Trumpboer|first2=Robert|title=The Rise of Stadiums in the Modern United States: Cathedrals of Sport|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317989288|pages=59\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of a stadium gained support in 1938, when Senator [[Robert Rice Reynolds|Robert Reynolds]] of [[North Carolina]] pushed for the creation of a municipal outdoor stadium within the District, citing the \"fact that America is the only major country not possessing a stadium with facilities to accommodate the Olympic Games\". The following year a model of the proposed stadium, to be located near the current site of RFK Stadium, was presented to the public. By 1941, the National Capital Planning Commission had begun buying property for a stadium, purchasing the land between East Capitol, C, 19th and 21st NE.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nearly All Land for D.C.

Congressman [[Charles R. Howell]] of [[New Jersey's 4th congressional district|New Jersey]] proposed legislation to build a stadium, again with hopes of attracting the Olympics. He pushed for a report, completed in 1956 by the National Capital Planning Commission entitled \"Preliminary Report on Sites for National Memorial Stadium\", which identified the \"East Capitol Site\" to be used for the stadium. In September 1957, \"The District of Columbia Stadium Act\" was introduced and authorized a 50,000-seat stadium to be used by the Senators and Redskins at the Armory site. It was signed into law by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] on July 29, 1958, with an estimated cost of $7.5 to $8.6 million.<ref name=\"Return\"/> The lease for the stadium was signed by the D.C. Armory Board and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] on December 12, 1958. The stadium, the first major multisport facility built for both football and baseball, was designed by [[George Dahl]], Ewin Engineering Associates (since 1954 part of what became [[Volkert, Inc.]]) and [[Osborn Engineering]]. Groundbreaking for the {{nowrap|$24 million}} venue was in 1960 on July 8, and construction proceeded over the following 14 months.<ref name=\"History\"/> The existing venue for baseball (and football) in Washington was [[Griffith Stadium]], about {{convert|4|mi|0|spell=in}} northwest.\n\nWhile Redskins\u2019 owner [[George Preston Marshall]] was pleased with the stadium, Senators' owner [[Calvin Griffith]] was not.

In [[1974 North American Soccer League season|1974]], two Maryland businessmen purchased the rights to the Baltimore Bays of the semi-professional [[American Soccer League (1933\u201383)|American Soccer League]], moved the team to the District and renamed it the Washington Diplomats. They signed a lease calculating that an average of 12,000 spectators would allow them to break even. Despite [[white flight]], owners thought that recent completion of the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Beltway]], the stadium's 12,000 parking spaces and future completion of a [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station would facilitate attendance. Games were scheduled for Saturday and prices were set low. The Diplomats inaugural game was on May 4 with an attendance of 10,175; Mayor [[Walter Washington]] ceremonially kicked off the game, but the Dips lost 5\u20131 to the [[1973 North American Soccer League season|defending]] [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|NASL]] champion [[Philadelphia Atoms]]. Attendance dropped throughout the season.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\">{{cite book|last1=Elzey|first1=Chris|last2=Wiggins|first2=David K.|title=DC Sports: The Nation's Capital at Play|date=Jul 15, 2015|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=9781610755665|pages=159\u2013161}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1975 North American Soccer League season|1975]], the Diplomats were informed that the recently installed natural turf at RFK would not be ready for opening day, so they scheduled their first two home games that season for [[Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School|W.T. Woodson High School]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]]. After the games attracted more than 10,000 fans each, the Diplomats moved most of their home games to Woodson, but then moved the last five back to RFK once soccer superstar [[Pel\u00e9]] was added to the roster of the [[New York Cosmos (1970\u201385)|New York Cosmos]]. Pel\u00e9 was so popular that the 1975 Cosmos-Diplomats match broke the NASL attendance record at 35,620.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pele Packs Stands at RFK Stadium|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/43269802|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=The Capitol|date=30 June 1975}}</ref> Even with the success of the Cosmos game, attendance declined again and before the [[1976 North American Soccer League season|1976]] season the Diplomats announced that they had scheduled every home game, except the one against the Cosmos, at Woodson. During the season, they moved that game to Woodson.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nAfter averaging 5,963 at Woodson, the Diplomats decided to ramp up their marketing and move back to RFK in [[1977 North American Soccer League season|1977]]. The team changed everything from the uniforms to the cheerleaders, but the team's disappointing on-the-field performance hurt attendance (a ~31,000 fan game against Pel\u00e9 and the Cosmos notwithstanding). In [[1978 North American Soccer League season|1978]], attendance continued to fall, even though the Dips made the playoffs. Success on the field during the 1978 and [[1979 North American Soccer League season|1979]] seasons (including a franchise-best 19 wins in '79) did not translate to ticket a sales and even with a negligible amount of revenue from \u201c[[Indoor soccer|indoor]] Dips\u201d games at the D.C. Armory during the offseason, the franchise continued to lose money.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nIn [[1980 North American Soccer League season|1980]], they signed Dutch international superstar [[Johan Cruyff]], the Pel\u00e9 of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], from the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]]. Needing 20,000 fans per game to break even, they managed to attract 24,000 for the opener and a District record 53,351 for the game against the Pele-less Cosmos (the fifth-largest soccer crowd at RFK ever), but the team failed to break-even financially. After racking up debts of $5 million, the first incarnation of the Dips folded.<ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nThree months later, the [[Detroit Express]] announced a move to D.C. for [[1981 North American Soccer League season|1981]], and that they would also be the Diplomats. They had trouble attracting fans;<!--after the NASL championship game, the \"[[Soccer Bowl '80|Soccer Bowl]]\", was held at RFK,--> and soon folded.\n\nThe Diplomats of the NASL, racked up an impressive {{winning percentage|60|29|record=y}} record at RFK, the best winning percentage of any RFK home team, and were {{nowrap|1\u20131}} in the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Washington Diplomats Games|url=http://soccerstats.us/teams/washington-diplomats/games/|website=Soccer Stats|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DartsWhipsDips\"/>\n\nIn 1987, a new soccer team also called the [[Washington Diplomats (1988\u201390)|Washington Diplomats]], was formed. They played at RFK, and sometimes at the RFK auxiliary field, for three seasons as part of the [[American Soccer League (1988\u201389)|ASL]] and then the [[American Professional Soccer League|APSL]]. They won the ASL Championship in 1988 but often drew fewer than 1000 fans. In 1990 they finished last in the Southern Division of the APSL East, were unable to pay the rent and folded in October 1990.<ref name=\"Merger\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=James H.|title=Bays, Stars merger Diplomats kick in|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-10-30/sports/1990303001_1_maryland-bays-diplomats-baltimore-washington-area|accessdate=31 January 2018|date=30 October 1990}}</ref> Over the course of 4 seasons they were {{winning percentage|18|15|record=y}} at RFK, and 2-0 at the RFK auxiliary field.\n\n===George Washington Colonials (1961\u20131966)===\nThe other team to move from Griffith to D.C. Stadium was the [[George Washington Colonials football|George Washington University Colonials]] [[college football]] team. The stadium was dedicated during the October 7, 1961 game against VMI, the first college football game there, which GWU won 30-6. The Colonials were forced to play their first three games on the road to allow the stadium to be completed. In the following years, because the Senators had priority, GWU waited until October (when baseball season was over) to schedule games. From 1961 to 1964 they played road games in September, and in 1965 and 1966 they played at high school stadiums in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia]].<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"History\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=George Washington U Drops Grid Program|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16522053/|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=20 January 1967}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Colonials, Like Cats, Seek First Win Saturday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16522071/|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=The Daily Herald|date=27 September 1962}}</ref>\n\nThe Colonials had no real success at D.C.

The Nationals played their first three seasons ([[2005 Washington Nationals season|2005]]\u2013[[2007 Washington Nationals season|2007]]) at RFK, then moved to [[Nationals Park]] in [[2008 Washington Nationals season|2008]].

However, in his lone season with the team in [[2006 Washington Nationals season|2006]], [[Alfonso Soriano]] hit 46 home runs.\n\nDuring their three seasons at RFK, the Nationals failed to make the playoffs or post a winning record.

Over three years, the Freedom racked up a 15-9-6 record at RFK and finished as one of the league's top teams. They came in 2nd in 2002 and won the league's Founder's Cup in 2003. They played all of their home games at RFK, except for one in 2001 at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis to avoid the Washington Grand Prix. Their last game at RFK as part of WUSA was on August 2, 2003, when they defeated the San Jose Cyber Rays. They won the final Founder's Cup in August 2003 and returned to RFK a few days later - minus the players who were playing in the 2003 Women's World Cup - for a victory celebration with the fans, which would be their final WUSA event at RFK. WUSA suspended operation the next month. Their victory in the Founders Cup means that the Freedom won both the first and last games in WUSA history.

The USA merged with the [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]] to form the new [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]]. Despite problems on and off the field, the team found itself in a battle for a playoff spot and towards the end of the season crowds swelled to as much as 14,227 in what proved to be the deciding match for the NASL Atlantic Division title. This September 7, 1968 match against the [[Atlanta Chiefs]] was the last for the Whips at D.C. Stadium. That season, the team went 15-10-7 drawing an average of 6,586 fans.

For the opening game, 38,000 fans showed up to see the return of former Redskins coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]], the coach of the [[Chicago Blitz]], in a game, the Federals lost, 28\u20137. But attendance quickly dropped off, with as few as 7,303 showing up for a late-season game against the [[Boston Breakers]]. The team went 4-14 in 1983 and 3-15 in 1984, averaging 7,700 fans.\n\nWith six games remaining in the 1984 season, owner Berl Bernhard sold the team to Florida real estate developer Woody Weiser. In the off-season, that deal fell through. Donald Dizney bought the team, moved it to Orlando and renamed it the Renegades.\n\nAfter going {{winning percentage|7|29|record=y}} overall, and {{winning percentage|5|18|record=y}} at RFK, the Federals ended their run with a 20-17 win over the [[New Orleans Breakers]] on June 24, 1984.\n\n===Team America (1983)===\n[[Team America (NASL)|Team America]] was a professional version of the United States men's national soccer team which played like a franchise in the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL) during the 1983 season. The team played its home games at RFK Stadium and was intended by the NASL and the United States Soccer Federation to build fan support for the league and create a cohesive and internationally competitive national team. However, the team finished in the last place drawing 12,000 fans per game.\n\nTeam America played 19 games at RFK. In those games they went 5-10 in NASL matches and tied three friendlies against [[Watford F.C.]] (from the [[United Kingdom]]), [[FC Dinamo Minsk]] (from the [[Soviet Union]]), and [[Juventus F.C.]] (from [[Italy]]) for a final record of {{winning percentage|5|10|3|record=y}}.\n\nThe team's attendance averaged 19,952 through the first seven home matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com:80/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121147/index.htm|title=Red, White, Black and Blue|publisher=Sports Illustrated|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504211958/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121147/index.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> including the 50,108 who attended a match vs. Fort Lauderdale that featured a free [[Beach Boys]] concert. Losses led to declining attendance as the season wore on. Attendance averaged 13,002 for the entire 1983 season, having played only a single season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenn.com/the_blog/?page_id=496|title=Attendance Project: NASL \u2013 kenn.com blog|website=www.kenn.com}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe stadium's design was circular, attempting to facilitate both football and baseball. It was the first to use the so-called \"[[cookie-cutter stadium|cookie-cutter]]\" concept, an approach also used in [[Veterans Stadium|Philadelphia]], [[Shea Stadium|New York]], [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston]], [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium|Atlanta]], [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]], [[Qualcomm Stadium|San Diego]], [[Riverfront Stadium|Cincinnati]], [[Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum|Oakland]], and [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]]. RFK Stadium ultimately outlasted all of them except Houston, San Diego, and Oakland (the former is still standing but is no longer actively used, while the latter two are still active).\n\nWhile the perimeter of the stadium is circular, the front edge of the upper and lower decks form a \"V\" shape in deference to the baseball configuration.  The rows of seating in the upper and lower decks follow the \"V\" layout, and the discrepancy between the shapes of the inner and outer rings permits more rows of seats to be inserted along the foul lines than at home plate and in the outfield.  As a result, the height of the outside wall rises and falls in waves, and this is echoed in the roof, resulting in a \"butterfly\" appearance when seen at ground level from the west.  This feature is unique among the circular stadiums of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1961, the stadium represented a new level of luxury. It offered 50,000 seats, each {{convert|22|in|cm}} wide (at a time when the typical seat was only {{convert|15|\u2013|16|in|cm|abbr=on}}), air-conditioned locker rooms and a lounge for player's wives. It had a machine-operated tarpaulin to cover the field, yard-wide aisles, and ramps that made it possible to empty the stadium in just 15 minutes. The ticket office was connected to the ticket windows by pneumatic tubes. The press boxes could be enclosed and expanded for big events. The stadium had a holding cell for drunks and brawlers. It had 12,000 parking spaces and was served by 300 buses. It had lighting that was twice as bright as Griffith Stadium.<ref name=\"Jail\"/>\n\nIt was not ideal for either sport, due to the different geometries of the playing fields. As the playing field dimensions for football and baseball vary greatly, seating had to accommodate the larger playing surface. This would prove to be the case at nearly every multi-purpose/cookie-cutter stadium.\n\nAs a baseball park, RFK was a target of scorn from baseball purists, largely because it was one of the few stadiums with no lower-deck seats in the outfield. The only outfield seats were in the upper deck, above a high wall. According to ''[[The Sporting News|Sporting News]]'' publications in the 1960s, over 27,000 seats\u2014roughly 60% of the listed capacity of 45,000 for baseball\u2014were in the upper tier or mezzanine levels. The lower-to-upper proportion improved for the Redskins with end-zone seats. The first ten rows of the football configuration were nearly at the field level, making it difficult to see over the players. The baseball diamond was aligned due east (home plate to center field), and the football field ran along the first baseline (northwest to southeast).\n\n{{wide image|DC United.jpg|800px<!--|align-cap=center-->|Panoramic view <!--of Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium--> in 2012, from the west corner (home plate to center field, due east)}}\n\nA [[Movable seating|complex conversion]] was necessary, at a cost of $40,000 each time, to change the stadium from a football configuration to baseball and back again; in its final form, this included rolling the third-base lower-level seats into the outfield along a buried rail, dropping the hydraulic pitcher's mound {{convert|3|ft|1}} into the ground, and laying sod over the infield dirt. Later facilities were designed so the seating configuration could be changed more quickly and at a lower cost. The conversion was required several times per year during the Senators' joint tenancy with the Redskins (1962\u201371) but became much more frequent during the Nationals/D.C. United era; in 2005, the conversion was made over twenty times.\n\nOriginally the seats located behind the stadium's third-base dugout were removed for baseball games and put back in place when the stadium was converted to the football (and later soccer) configuration. When these sections were in place, RFK seated approximately 56,000. With the Nationals' arrival in 2005, this particular segment of the stands was permanently removed to facilitate the switch between the baseball and soccer configurations. These seats were not restored following the Nationals' move to Nationals Park, leaving the stadium's [[seating capacity]] at approximately 46,000. The majority of the upper-deck seats normally were not made available for D.C. United matches, so the stadium's reduced capacity normally was not problematic for the club.\n\n<!--The football/soccer field alignment is northwest to southeast, approximately along the baseball diamond's first base line.-->\nDuring the years when the stadium was without baseball (1972\u20132004)<!--used only for Redskins games (1972\u201396)-->, the rotating seats remained in the football configuration. If an exhibition baseball game was scheduled, the left-field wall was only {{convert|250|ft|0}} from home plate, and a large screen was erected in left field for some games.\n\n[[File:Capitol from top of Washington Monument.JPG|250px|thumb|View east from [[Washington Monument]],<br>RFK Stadium in background]]\nSome of RFK's quirks endear the venue to fans and players.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The large rolling bleacher section is less stable than other seating, allowing fans to jump in rhythm to cause the whole area to bounce. Also, despite its small size (it never seated more than 58,000), because of the stadium's design and the proximity of the fans to the field when configured for football, the stadium was extremely loud when the usual sell-out Redskins crowds became vocal. Legend has it that Redskins head coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] would order a large rolling door in the side of the stadium to be opened when visiting teams were attempting field goals at critical moments in games so that a swirling wind from off the Potomac and Anacostia rivers might interfere with the flight of the kicked ball.\n\nSince the stadium is on a direct sightline with the [[Washington Monument]] and the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], light towers were not allowed; instead, [[Arc lamp|arc lights]] were placed on its curved, dipping roof.\n\nEvents D.C.\u2014the city agency which operates RFK Stadium\u2014began a strategic planning process in November 2013 to study options for the future of the stadium, its {{convert|80|acre|ha}} campus and the nonmilitary portions of the adjacent [[D.C. Armory]]. Events D.C. said one option to be studied was demolition within a decade, while another would be the status quo. The strategic planning process also included the design and development of options. The agency said that RFK Stadium has generated $4 million to $5 million a year in revenues since 1997, which did not cover operating expenses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/top-shelf/2013/11/events-dc-looks-at-next-steps-for-rfk.html|last=Cooper|first=Rebecca|title=Events D.C.

The CPB pump itself is often referred to as a '''heart\u2013lung machine''' or \"the pump\". Cardiopulmonary bypass pumps are operated by [[perfusionist]]s.  CPB is a form of [[extracorporeal]] circulation. [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] is generally used for longer-term treatment.\n\nCPB mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood for the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. It uses a heart\u2013lung machine to maintain perfusion to other body organs and tissues while the surgeon works in a bloodless surgical field. The surgeon places a [[cannula]] in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the body. Venous blood is removed from the body by the cannula and then filtered, cooled or warmed, and oxygenated before it is returned to the body by a mechanical pump. The cannula used to return oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, but it may be inserted in the femoral artery, axillary artery, or brachiocephalic artery (among others).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Cardiac surgery in the adult|others=Cohn, Lawrence H., 1937-2016|isbn=978-0-07-184487-1|edition=Fifth|location=New York|oclc=930496902|date = 2017-08-28}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe patient is administered [[heparin]] to prevent clotting, and [[protamine sulfate]] is given after to reverse effects of heparin. During the procedure, hypothermia may be maintained; body temperature is usually kept at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C (82.4\u201389.6&nbsp;\u00b0F). The blood is cooled during CPB and returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body's basal metabolic rate, decreasing its demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the crystalloid solution used to prime the bypass tubing dilutes the blood.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Blausen 0468 Heart-Lung Machine.png|thumb|300px|Illustration of one typical way that a heart-lung machine may be connected to the veins and arteries near the heart.

The technique allows the surgical team to oxygenate and circulate the patient's blood, thus allowing the surgeon to operate on the heart.<ref name=\":3\" /> In many operations, such as [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary artery bypass grafting]] (CABG), the heart is arrested (i.e., stopped) because of the difficulty of operating on the beating heart. Operations requiring the opening of the chambers of the heart, for example, [[mitral valve repair]] or [[Mitral valve replacement|replacement]], requires the use of CPB to avoid engulfing air systemically and to provide a bloodless field to increase visibility for the surgeon. The machine pumps the blood and, using an oxygenator, allows red blood cells to pick up oxygen, as well as allowing carbon dioxide levels to decrease.<ref name=\":2\" /> This mimics the function of the heart and the lungs, respectively.\n\nCPB can be used for the induction of total body [[therapeutic hypothermia|hypothermia]], a state in which the body can be maintained for up to 45 minutes without [[perfusion]] (blood flow).<ref name=\":3\" /> If blood flow is stopped at normal [[body temperature]], permanent [[brain damage]] normally occurs in three to four minutes \u2013 death may follow shortly afterward.

As a consequence, CPB is only used during the several hours a cardiac surgery may take. CPB is known to activate the coagulation cascade and stimulate inflammatory mediators. leading to hemolysis and coagulopathies. This problem worsens as complement proteins build on the membrane oxygenators.<ref name=\":4\" /> For this reason, most oxygenators come with a manufacturer's recommendation that they are only used for a maximum of six hours, although they are sometimes used for up to ten hours, with care being taken to ensure they do not clot off and stop working. For longer periods than this, an [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation|ECMO]] (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) is used, which can be in operation for up to 31 days \u2013 such as in this Taiwanese case, for 16 days, after which the patient received a heart transplant.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news126460484.html Man survives 16 days without a heart] United Press International.

The heart-lung blood circulation system and the connection surgery itself release a variety of debris into the bloodstream, including bits of blood cells, tubing, and plaque. For example, when surgeons clamp and connect the aorta to tubing, resulting emboli may block blood flow and cause mini strokes. Other heart surgery factors related to mental damage may be events of hypoxia, high or low body temperature, abnormal blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and fever after surgery.<ref>Stutz, Bruce [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pumphead-heart-lung-machine \"Pumphead: Does the heart-lung machine have a dark side?\"] ''Scientific American'', January 9, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Components==\nCardiopulmonary bypass consists of two main functional units, the [[pump]] and the [[oxygenator]] which removes relatively oxygen-depleted blood from a patient's body and replaces it with oxygen-rich blood through a series of tubes (hoses). A [[heat exchanger]] is used to control body temperature by heating or cooling the blood in the circuit. It is important that all components of the circuit are coated internally by [[heparin]] or another anticoagulant to prevent clotting within the circuit.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[File:Perfusionist opearting heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|250px|Perfusionist operating a modern heart lung machine]]\n\n===Tubing===\nThe components of the CPB circuit are interconnected by a series of tubes made of [[silicone rubber]] or [[PVC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebme.co.uk/articles/clinical-engineering/cardiopulmonary-bypass-machine-cpb|title=Cardiopulmonary bypass machine - CPB|last=Davies|first=Huw|website=www.ebme.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===Pumps===\n\n====Centrifugal pump====\nMany CPB circuits now employ a [[centrifugal pump]] for the maintenance and control of blood flow during CPB. By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the pump head, blood flow is produced by [[centrifugal force]]. This type of pumping action is considered to be superior to the action of the roller pump by many because it is thought to prevent overpressurization, clamping or kinking of lines, and produce less damage to blood products ([[hemolysis]], etc.).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Roller pump====\nThe pump console usually comprises several rotating motor-driven pumps that [[peristalsis|peristaltically]] \"massage\" tubing.  This action gently propels the blood through the tubing. This is commonly referred to as a roller pump, or [[peristaltic pump]]. The pumps are more affordable than their centrifugal counterparts, but are susceptible to overpressurization if the lines become clamped or kinked.<ref name=\":0\" /> They are also more likely to cause a massive air embolism and require constant, close supervision by the perfusionist.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Oxygenator===\nThe [[oxygenator]] is designed to add [[oxygen]] to infused [[blood]] and remove some of the [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[venous blood]].  Cardiac surgery was made possible by CPB using [[bubble oxygenator]]s, but [[membrane oxygenator]]s have supplanted bubble oxygenators since the 1980s. The main reasons for this are that [[membrane oxygenator]]s tend to generate many fewer micro-bubbles, referred to as gaseous microemboli, which is generally considered harmful to the patient <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15\u201326|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> and reduce damage to blood cells,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: haemocompatibility|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=81\u201398|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> compared to [[bubble oxygenator]]s. More recently, the use of hollow-fiber oxygenators has become more widespread. These derivatives of membrane oxygenators further reduce the occurrence of microemboli by reducing the direct air-blood interface while simultaneously providing adequate gas exchange.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother type of oxygenator gaining favour recently is the heparin-coated blood oxygenator which is believed to produce less systemic inflammation and decrease the propensity for blood to clot in the CPB circuit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Heat Exchangers ===\nBecause hypothermia is frequently used in CPB to reduce metabolic demands (including that of the heart), heat exchangers are implemented to warm and cool blood within the circuit. The heating and cooling is accomplished by passing the line through a warm or ice water bath. A separate heat exchanger is required for the cardiopledgia line.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Cannulae===\nMultiple [[cannula]]e are sewn into the patient's body in a variety of locations, depending on the type of surgery. A venous cannula removes oxygen depleted venous blood from a patient's body. An arterial cannula infuses oxygen-rich blood into the arterial system. The main determinants of cannula size selection is determined by the patient's size and weight, anticipated flow rate, and the size of the vessel being cannulated.<ref name=\":3\" /> A [[cardioplegia]] cannula delivers a cardioplegia solution to cause the heart to stop beating.\n\nSome commonly used cannulation sites:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is delivered via a cannula to the opening of the coronary arteries (usually by way of the aortic root) and/or to the cardiac veins (by way of the coronary sinus).<ref name=\":0\" /> These delivery methods are referred to antegrade and retrograde, respectively. Cardiopledgia solution protects the heart by arresting (i.e. stopping) the heart, thereby decreasing its metabolic demand. There are multiple types of cardiopledgia solutions, but most work by inhibiting [[Sodium channel|fast sodium currents]] in the heart, thereby preventing conduction of the [[action potential]]. Other types of solutions act by inhibiting calcium's actions on [[myocyte]]s.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Technique==\n\n===Pre-operative planning===\nCPB requires significant forethought before surgery.

Preoperative imaging or an [[ultrasound]] probe may be used to help identify aortic calcifications that could potentially become dislodged and cause an occlusion or [[stroke]]. Once the cannulation site has been deemed safe, two concentric, diamond-shaped [[Purse string|pursestring]] sutures are placed in the distal ascending aorta. A stab incision with a [[scalpel]] is made within the pursestrings and the arterial cannula is passed through the incision. It is important the cannula is passed perpendicular to the aorta to avoid creating an [[aortic dissection]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The pursestrings sutures are cinched around the cannula using a tourniquet and secured to the cannula.<ref name=\":0\" /> At this point, the perfusionist advances the arterial line of the CPB circuit and the surgeon connects the arterial line coming from the patient to the arterial line coming from the CPB machine. Care must be taken to ensure no air is in the circuit when the two are connected, or else the patient could suffer from an [[air embolism]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Other sites for arterial cannulation include the [[axillary artery]], [[brachiocephalic artery]], or [[femoral artery]].\n\nAside from the differences in location, [[Vein|venous]] cannulation is performed similarly to arterial cannulation. Since calcification of the [[Vein|venous system]] is less common, the inspection or use of an ultrasound for calcification at the cannulation sites is unnecessary. Also, because the venous system is under much less pressure than the arterial system, only a single suture is required to hold the cannula in place.<ref name=\":1\" /> If only a single cannula is to be used (dual-stage cannulation), it is passed though the [[right atrial appendage]], through the tricuspid valve, and into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> If two cannula are required (single-stage cannulation), the first one is typically passed through the superior vena cava and the second through the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[femoral vein]] may also be cannulated in select patients.\n\nIf the heart must be stopped for the operation, [[cardioplegia]] cannulas are also required. Antegrade cardiopledgia (forward flowing, through the heart's arteries), retrograde cardiopledgia (backwards flowing, through the heart's veins), or both types may be used depending on the operation and surgeon preference. For antegrade cardiopledgia, a small incision is made in the aorta proximal to the arterial cannulation site (between the heart and arterial cannulation site) and the cannula is placed through this to deliver cardiopledgia to the [[coronary arteries]]. For retrograde cardiopledgia, an incision is made on the posterior (back) surface of the heart through the [[right ventricle]]. The cannula is placed in this incision, passed through the tricuspid valve, and into the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The cardiopledgia lines are connected to the CPB machine.\n\nAt this point, the patient is ready to go on bypass. Blood from the venous cannula(s) enters the CPB machine by gravity where it is oxygenated and cooled (if necessary) before returning to the body through the arterial cannula. Cardiopledgia can now be administered to stop the heart, and a cross-clamp is placed across the aorta between the arterial cannula and cardiopledgia cannula to prevent the arterial blood from flowing backwards into the heart.\n\nOnce the patient is ready to come off of bypass support, the cross-clamp and cannulas are removed and [[protamine sulfate]] is administered to reverse the anticoagulative effects of heparin.\n\n==History==\n[[File:1955 heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|right|A heart lung machine used in London's [[Middlesex Hospital]] in 1958.

The CPB pump itself is often referred to as a '''heart\u2013lung machine''' or \"the pump\". Cardiopulmonary bypass pumps are operated by [[perfusionist]]s.  CPB is a form of [[extracorporeal]] circulation. [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] is generally used for longer-term treatment.\n\nCPB mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood for the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. It uses a heart\u2013lung machine to maintain perfusion to other body organs and tissues while the surgeon works in a bloodless surgical field. The surgeon places a [[cannula]] in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the body. Venous blood is removed from the body by the cannula and then filtered, cooled or warmed, and oxygenated before it is returned to the body by a mechanical pump. The cannula used to return oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, but it may be inserted in the femoral artery, axillary artery, or brachiocephalic artery (among others).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Cardiac surgery in the adult|others=Cohn, Lawrence H., 1937-2016|isbn=978-0-07-184487-1|edition=Fifth|location=New York|oclc=930496902|date = 2017-08-28}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe patient is administered [[heparin]] to prevent clotting, and [[protamine sulfate]] is given after to reverse effects of heparin. During the procedure, hypothermia may be maintained; body temperature is usually kept at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C (82.4\u201389.6&nbsp;\u00b0F). The blood is cooled during CPB and returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body's basal metabolic rate, decreasing its demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the crystalloid solution used to prime the bypass tubing dilutes the blood.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Blausen 0468 Heart-Lung Machine.png|thumb|300px|Illustration of one typical way that a heart-lung machine may be connected to the veins and arteries near the heart. The three implements on the left represent (''from top to bottom'') the pump, the oxygenator, and the reservoir.]]\nCardiopulmonary bypass is commonly used in operations involving the heart. The technique allows the surgical team to oxygenate and circulate the patient's blood, thus allowing the surgeon to operate on the heart.<ref name=\":3\" /> In many operations, such as [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary artery bypass grafting]] (CABG), the heart is arrested (i.e., stopped) because of the difficulty of operating on the beating heart. Operations requiring the opening of the chambers of the heart, for example, [[mitral valve repair]] or [[Mitral valve replacement|replacement]], requires the use of CPB to avoid engulfing air systemically and to provide a bloodless field to increase visibility for the surgeon. The machine pumps the blood and, using an oxygenator, allows red blood cells to pick up oxygen, as well as allowing carbon dioxide levels to decrease.<ref name=\":2\" /> This mimics the function of the heart and the lungs, respectively.\n\nCPB can be used for the induction of total body [[therapeutic hypothermia|hypothermia]], a state in which the body can be maintained for up to 45 minutes without [[perfusion]] (blood flow).<ref name=\":3\" /> If blood flow is stopped at normal [[body temperature]], permanent [[brain damage]] normally occurs in three to four minutes \u2013 death may follow shortly afterward.

For Type III reactions, heparin is redosed and the patient may need to go back on bypass.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nCPB may contribute to immediate cognitive decline. The heart-lung blood circulation system and the connection surgery itself release a variety of debris into the bloodstream, including bits of blood cells, tubing, and plaque. For example, when surgeons clamp and connect the aorta to tubing, resulting emboli may block blood flow and cause mini strokes. Other heart surgery factors related to mental damage may be events of hypoxia, high or low body temperature, abnormal blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and fever after surgery.<ref>Stutz, Bruce [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pumphead-heart-lung-machine \"Pumphead: Does the heart-lung machine have a dark side?\"] ''Scientific American'', January 9, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Components==\nCardiopulmonary bypass consists of two main functional units, the [[pump]] and the [[oxygenator]] which removes relatively oxygen-depleted blood from a patient's body and replaces it with oxygen-rich blood through a series of tubes (hoses). A [[heat exchanger]] is used to control body temperature by heating or cooling the blood in the circuit. It is important that all components of the circuit are coated internally by [[heparin]] or another anticoagulant to prevent clotting within the circuit.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[File:Perfusionist opearting heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|250px|Perfusionist operating a modern heart lung machine]]\n\n===Tubing===\nThe components of the CPB circuit are interconnected by a series of tubes made of [[silicone rubber]] or [[PVC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebme.co.uk/articles/clinical-engineering/cardiopulmonary-bypass-machine-cpb|title=Cardiopulmonary bypass machine - CPB|last=Davies|first=Huw|website=www.ebme.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===Pumps===\n\n====Centrifugal pump====\nMany CPB circuits now employ a [[centrifugal pump]] for the maintenance and control of blood flow during CPB. By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the pump head, blood flow is produced by [[centrifugal force]]. This type of pumping action is considered to be superior to the action of the roller pump by many because it is thought to prevent overpressurization, clamping or kinking of lines, and produce less damage to blood products ([[hemolysis]], etc.).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Roller pump====\nThe pump console usually comprises several rotating motor-driven pumps that [[peristalsis|peristaltically]] \"massage\" tubing.  This action gently propels the blood through the tubing. This is commonly referred to as a roller pump, or [[peristaltic pump]]. The pumps are more affordable than their centrifugal counterparts, but are susceptible to overpressurization if the lines become clamped or kinked.<ref name=\":0\" /> They are also more likely to cause a massive air embolism and require constant, close supervision by the perfusionist.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Oxygenator===\nThe [[oxygenator]] is designed to add [[oxygen]] to infused [[blood]] and remove some of the [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[venous blood]].  Cardiac surgery was made possible by CPB using [[bubble oxygenator]]s, but [[membrane oxygenator]]s have supplanted bubble oxygenators since the 1980s. The main reasons for this are that [[membrane oxygenator]]s tend to generate many fewer micro-bubbles, referred to as gaseous microemboli, which is generally considered harmful to the patient <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15\u201326|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> and reduce damage to blood cells,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: haemocompatibility|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=81\u201398|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> compared to [[bubble oxygenator]]s. More recently, the use of hollow-fiber oxygenators has become more widespread. These derivatives of membrane oxygenators further reduce the occurrence of microemboli by reducing the direct air-blood interface while simultaneously providing adequate gas exchange.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother type of oxygenator gaining favour recently is the heparin-coated blood oxygenator which is believed to produce less systemic inflammation and decrease the propensity for blood to clot in the CPB circuit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Heat Exchangers ===\nBecause hypothermia is frequently used in CPB to reduce metabolic demands (including that of the heart), heat exchangers are implemented to warm and cool blood within the circuit. The heating and cooling is accomplished by passing the line through a warm or ice water bath. A separate heat exchanger is required for the cardiopledgia line.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Cannulae===\nMultiple [[cannula]]e are sewn into the patient's body in a variety of locations, depending on the type of surgery. A venous cannula removes oxygen depleted venous blood from a patient's body. An arterial cannula infuses oxygen-rich blood into the arterial system. The main determinants of cannula size selection is determined by the patient's size and weight, anticipated flow rate, and the size of the vessel being cannulated.<ref name=\":3\" /> A [[cardioplegia]] cannula delivers a cardioplegia solution to cause the heart to stop beating.\n\nSome commonly used cannulation sites:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is delivered via a cannula to the opening of the coronary arteries (usually by way of the aortic root) and/or to the cardiac veins (by way of the coronary sinus).<ref name=\":0\" /> These delivery methods are referred to antegrade and retrograde, respectively. Cardiopledgia solution protects the heart by arresting (i.e. stopping) the heart, thereby decreasing its metabolic demand. There are multiple types of cardiopledgia solutions, but most work by inhibiting [[Sodium channel|fast sodium currents]] in the heart, thereby preventing conduction of the [[action potential]]. Other types of solutions act by inhibiting calcium's actions on [[myocyte]]s.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Technique==\n\n===Pre-operative planning===\nCPB requires significant forethought before surgery. In particular, the cannulation, cooling, and cardio-protective strategies must be coordinated between the [[surgeon]], [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]], [[perfusionist]], and [[Nursing|nursing staff]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Cardiopulmonary bypass : a primer|last=Mokadam, Nahush A., author, editor.|oclc=922073684}}</ref>\n\n==== Cannulation strategy ====\nThe cannulation strategy varies on several operation-specific and patient-specific details. The typical arterial cannulation involves the placement of a single cannulation within distal [[Aorta|ascending aorta]]. The most simple form on involves placement of a single cannula (known as a dual-stage cannula) passed through the [[right atrium]] and into the [[inferior vena cava]]. In some operations, such as those involving the [[Tricuspid valve|tricuspid]] or [[mitral valve]], two cannula are used\u2014one is passed though the inferior vena cava and one through the [[superior vena cava]]. This is known as single-stage cannulation.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=TSRA Primer of Cardiothoracic Surgery|last=Youssef|first=Samuel J.|last2=Williams|first2=Jason A.|publisher=TSRA/TSDA|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9894023-0-9|location=Chicago, IL|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Cooling strategy ====\n\n==== Cardio-protective strategy ====\n\n=== Intra-operative technique ===\nA CPB circuit must be primed with fluid and all air expunged from the arterial line/cannula before connection to the patient. The circuit is primed with a [[intravenous therapy|crystalloid]] solution and sometimes blood products are also added. Prior to cannulation (typically after opening the pericardium when using central cannulation), [[heparin]] or another [[anticoagulant]] is administered until the [[activated clotting time]] is above 480 seconds.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Kirklin/Barratt-Boyes cardiac surgery : morphology, diagnostic criteria, natural history, techniques, results, and indications|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|others=Kouchoukos, Nicholas T., Kirklin, John W. (John Webster).|isbn=978-1-4557-4605-7|edition=4th|location=Philadelphia|oclc=812289395}}</ref>\n\nThe arterial cannulation site is inspected for [[calcification]] or other disease. Preoperative imaging or an [[ultrasound]] probe may be used to help identify aortic calcifications that could potentially become dislodged and cause an occlusion or [[stroke]]. Once the cannulation site has been deemed safe, two concentric, diamond-shaped [[Purse string|pursestring]] sutures are placed in the distal ascending aorta. A stab incision with a [[scalpel]] is made within the pursestrings and the arterial cannula is passed through the incision. It is important the cannula is passed perpendicular to the aorta to avoid creating an [[aortic dissection]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The pursestrings sutures are cinched around the cannula using a tourniquet and secured to the cannula.<ref name=\":0\" /> At this point, the perfusionist advances the arterial line of the CPB circuit and the surgeon connects the arterial line coming from the patient to the arterial line coming from the CPB machine. Care must be taken to ensure no air is in the circuit when the two are connected, or else the patient could suffer from an [[air embolism]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Other sites for arterial cannulation include the [[axillary artery]], [[brachiocephalic artery]], or [[femoral artery]].\n\nAside from the differences in location, [[Vein|venous]] cannulation is performed similarly to arterial cannulation. Since calcification of the [[Vein|venous system]] is less common, the inspection or use of an ultrasound for calcification at the cannulation sites is unnecessary. Also, because the venous system is under much less pressure than the arterial system, only a single suture is required to hold the cannula in place.<ref name=\":1\" /> If only a single cannula is to be used (dual-stage cannulation), it is passed though the [[right atrial appendage]], through the tricuspid valve, and into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> If two cannula are required (single-stage cannulation), the first one is typically passed through the superior vena cava and the second through the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[femoral vein]] may also be cannulated in select patients.\n\nIf the heart must be stopped for the operation, [[cardioplegia]] cannulas are also required. Antegrade cardiopledgia (forward flowing, through the heart's arteries), retrograde cardiopledgia (backwards flowing, through the heart's veins), or both types may be used depending on the operation and surgeon preference. For antegrade cardiopledgia, a small incision is made in the aorta proximal to the arterial cannulation site (between the heart and arterial cannulation site) and the cannula is placed through this to deliver cardiopledgia to the [[coronary arteries]]. For retrograde cardiopledgia, an incision is made on the posterior (back) surface of the heart through the [[right ventricle]]. The cannula is placed in this incision, passed through the tricuspid valve, and into the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The cardiopledgia lines are connected to the CPB machine.\n\nAt this point, the patient is ready to go on bypass. Blood from the venous cannula(s) enters the CPB machine by gravity where it is oxygenated and cooled (if necessary) before returning to the body through the arterial cannula. Cardiopledgia can now be administered to stop the heart, and a cross-clamp is placed across the aorta between the arterial cannula and cardiopledgia cannula to prevent the arterial blood from flowing backwards into the heart.\n\nOnce the patient is ready to come off of bypass support, the cross-clamp and cannulas are removed and [[protamine sulfate]] is administered to reverse the anticoagulative effects of heparin.\n\n==History==\n[[File:1955 heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|right|A heart lung machine used in London's [[Middlesex Hospital]] in 1958.

In 1994, it became one of the first countries in the world to adopt a [[flat tax]], with a uniform rate of 26% regardless of personal income. Estonia received more foreign investment per capita in the second half of the 1990s than any other country in Central and Eastern Europe.

The economy was largely an agricultural one, but Estonia being a country with a long coastline, there were also many maritime activities. Autonomous development was brought to an end by the [[Northern Crusades]] undertaken by the King of Denmark, the German Livonian and the Teutonic military orders. The Estonian world was transformed by military conquest. The war against the invaders lasted from 1208\u20131227. The last Estonian county to fall was the island of Saaremaa in 1261.\n\nThereafter, through many centuries until [[World War I|WWI]], Estonian agriculture consisted of native peasants working large feudal-type estates held by ethnic [[Baltic Germans|German]] [[landlord]]s. In the decades prior to independence, centralised [[Czar]]ist rule had created a rather large industrial sector dominated by the [[Kreenholm Manufacturing Company]], then the world's largest [[cotton mill]].\n\n===Independence===\nAfter declaring independence in 1918, the [[Estonian War of Independence]] and the subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] in 1920, the new Estonian state inherited a ruined post-war economy and an inflated ruble currency. Despite considerable hardship, dislocation, and unemployment, Estonia spent the first decade of independence entirely transforming its economy. In 1918, The Czarist ruble was replaced by the [[Estonian mark]], which was in circulation until 1927. By 1929, a stable currency, the [[Estonian kroon|kroon]], had been established. It was issued by the [[Bank of Estonia]], the country's [[central bank]]. Compensating the German landowners for their holdings, the government confiscated the estates and divided them into small farms, which subsequently formed the basis of Estonian prosperity. Trade focused on the local market and the West, particularly Germany and the United Kingdom. Only 3% of all commerce was with the [[USSR]].\n\n===Soviet occupation===\nThe USSR's forcible annexation of Estonia in 1940 and the ensuing [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] destruction during [[World War II]] crippled the Estonian economy. Post-war Soviet occupation and Sovietisation of life continued with the integration of Estonia's economy and industry into the USSR's centrally planned structure. More than 56% of Estonian farms were [[collective|collectivised]] in the month of April 1949 alone after mass deportations to Siberia the previous month. Moscow expanded on those Estonian industries which had locally available raw materials, such as [[oil shale]] mining and phosphorites.\n\n===Restoration of independence, modernisation and liberalisation===\n{{Update section|date=January 2019}}[[File:Tln1.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Maakri]] has become the [[Central business district]] of Tallinn in the 21st century]]\nSince reestablishing independence, Estonia has styled itself as the gateway between East and West and pursued economic reform and integration with the West.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former [[COMECON]] area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} A balanced budget, almost non-existent [[public debt]], flat-rate [[income tax]], [[free trade]] regime, fully convertible currency backed by [[currency board]] and a strong peg to the [[euro]], competitive commercial banking sector, hospitable environment for foreign investment, innovative [[e-Services]] and mobile-based services are all hallmarks of Estonia's free-market-based economy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn June 1992, Estonia replaced the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] with its own freely convertible currency, the [[Estonian kroon|kroon]] (EEK). A [[currency board]] was created and the new currency was pegged to the German Mark at the rate of 8 Estonian kroons for 1 [[Deutsche Mark]]. When Germany introduced the [[euro]] the peg was changed to 15.6466 kroons for 1 euro.\n\nEstonia was set to adopt the euro in 2008, but due to the inflation rate being above the required 3%, the adoption date was delayed to 2011. On 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th [[eurozone]] member state.<ref name=\"reuters-2011-01-01\" />\n\nThe [[privatisation]] of state-owned firms is virtually complete, with only the port and the main power plants remaining in government hands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe constitution requires a balanced budget, and the protection afforded by Estonia's intellectual property laws is on a par of that of Europe's.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn early 1992, both liquidity problems and structural weakness stemming from the communist era precipitated a banking crisis. As a result, effective bankruptcy legislation was enacted and privately owned; well-managed banks emerged as market leaders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Today, near-ideal conditions for the banking sector exist.

In the year 2000, Estonian GDP grew by 6.4%.\n\nUpon accession to the [[European Union]] in 2004, double-digit growth was soon after observed.\n\nGDP grew by 7.9% in 2007 alone. Increases in labor costs, the imposition of tax on tobacco, alcohol, electricity, fuel, gas, and other external pressures (growing prices of oil and food on the global market) were expected to inflate price levels by 10% in the first months of 2009.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===The 2008 financial crisis, response and recovery===\n[[File:Real GDP growth in Estonia, 2002-2012.png|thumb|300px|Real GDP growth in Estonia, 2002\u20132012.]]\nThe [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] has had a deep effect on the Estonian economy, primarily as a result of an investment and consumption slump that followed the burst of the real estate market bubble that had been building up during the preceding years.\n\nAfter a long period of very high growth of GDP, the GDP of Estonia decreased.

Products, such as butter, milk, and cheese were widely known in the [[west Europe]]an markets. The main markets were Germany and the United Kingdom, and only 3% of all commerce was with the neighbouring [[USSR]]. Estonia and [[Finland]] had a relatively similar standard of living.<ref name=\"maddison185\">{{Harvnb|Maddison|2006|p=185}}</ref>\n\nThe USSR's [[Estonian SSR|annexation of Estonia]] in 1940 and the ensuing [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] destruction during World War II crippled the Estonian economy. The subsequent Soviet occupation and post-war [[Sovietization]] of life continued with the integration of Estonia's economy and industry into the [[USSR]]'s centrally planned structure.

The economy was largely an agricultural one, but Estonia being a country with a long coastline, there were also many maritime activities. Autonomous development was brought to an end by the [[Northern Crusades]] undertaken by the King of Denmark, the German Livonian and the Teutonic military orders. The Estonian world was transformed by military conquest. The war against the invaders lasted from 1208\u20131227. The last Estonian county to fall was the island of Saaremaa in 1261.\n\nThereafter, through many centuries until [[World War I|WWI]], Estonian agriculture consisted of native peasants working large feudal-type estates held by ethnic [[Baltic Germans|German]] [[landlord]]s. In the decades prior to independence, centralised [[Czar]]ist rule had created a rather large industrial sector dominated by the [[Kreenholm Manufacturing Company]], then the world's largest [[cotton mill]].\n\n===Independence===\nAfter declaring independence in 1918, the [[Estonian War of Independence]] and the subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] in 1920, the new Estonian state inherited a ruined post-war economy and an inflated ruble currency. Despite considerable hardship, dislocation, and unemployment, Estonia spent the first decade of independence entirely transforming its economy. In 1918, The Czarist ruble was replaced by the [[Estonian mark]], which was in circulation until 1927. By 1929, a stable currency, the [[Estonian kroon|kroon]], had been established. It was issued by the [[Bank of Estonia]], the country's [[central bank]]. Compensating the German landowners for their holdings, the government confiscated the estates and divided them into small farms, which subsequently formed the basis of Estonian prosperity. Trade focused on the local market and the West, particularly Germany and the United Kingdom. Only 3% of all commerce was with the [[USSR]].\n\n===Soviet occupation===\nThe USSR's forcible annexation of Estonia in 1940 and the ensuing [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] destruction during [[World War II]] crippled the Estonian economy. Post-war Soviet occupation and Sovietisation of life continued with the integration of Estonia's economy and industry into the USSR's centrally planned structure. More than 56% of Estonian farms were [[collective|collectivised]] in the month of April 1949 alone after mass deportations to Siberia the previous month. Moscow expanded on those Estonian industries which had locally available raw materials, such as [[oil shale]] mining and phosphorites.\n\n===Restoration of independence, modernisation and liberalisation===\n{{Update section|date=January 2019}}[[File:Tln1.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Maakri]] has become the [[Central business district]] of Tallinn in the 21st century]]\nSince reestablishing independence, Estonia has styled itself as the gateway between East and West and pursued economic reform and integration with the West.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former [[COMECON]] area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} A balanced budget, almost non-existent [[public debt]], flat-rate [[income tax]], [[free trade]] regime, fully convertible currency backed by [[currency board]] and a strong peg to the [[euro]], competitive commercial banking sector, hospitable environment for foreign investment, innovative [[e-Services]] and mobile-based services are all hallmarks of Estonia's free-market-based economy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn June 1992, Estonia replaced the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] with its own freely convertible currency, the [[Estonian kroon|kroon]] (EEK). A [[currency board]] was created and the new currency was pegged to the German Mark at the rate of 8 Estonian kroons for 1 [[Deutsche Mark]]. When Germany introduced the [[euro]] the peg was changed to 15.6466 kroons for 1 euro.\n\nEstonia was set to adopt the euro in 2008, but due to the inflation rate being above the required 3%, the adoption date was delayed to 2011. On 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th [[eurozone]] member state.<ref name=\"reuters-2011-01-01\" />\n\nThe [[privatisation]] of state-owned firms is virtually complete, with only the port and the main power plants remaining in government hands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe constitution requires a balanced budget, and the protection afforded by Estonia's intellectual property laws is on a par of that of Europe's.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn early 1992, both liquidity problems and structural weakness stemming from the communist era precipitated a banking crisis.

This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

He provides data that the viral waves hit the [[Central Powers]] before the Allied powers and that both [[morbidity]] and mortality in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] were considerably higher than in Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]].{{sfn|Price-Smith|2008}}\n\nDespite the high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s.{{sfn|Honigsbaum|2008}} This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a \"forgotten pandemic\".{{sfn|Crosby|2003}}\n\nThere are various theories of why the Spanish flu was \"forgotten\". The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n\n{{external media| float = right| width=230px |video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?465724-7/influenza-pandemic-world-war Presentation by Nancy Bristow on the Influenza Pandemic and World War I, November 1, 2019], [[C-SPAN]]}} \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nRegarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was due in part to the failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]].

They examined the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns and their correlation to patterns of mortality and morbidity.

Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus.

She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

He provides data that the viral waves hit the [[Central Powers]] before the Allied powers and that both [[morbidity]] and mortality in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] were considerably higher than in Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]].{{sfn|Price-Smith|2008}}\n\nDespite the high morbidity and mortality rates that resulted from the epidemic, the Spanish flu began to fade from public awareness over the decades until the arrival of news about [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and other pandemics in the 1990s and 2000s.{{sfn|Honigsbaum|2008}} This has led some historians to label the Spanish flu a \"forgotten pandemic\".{{sfn|Crosby|2003}}\n\nThere are various theories of why the Spanish flu was \"forgotten\". The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n\n{{external media| float = right| width=230px |video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?465724-7/influenza-pandemic-world-war Presentation by Nancy Bristow on the Influenza Pandemic and World War I, November 1, 2019], [[C-SPAN]]}} \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nRegarding global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]].

She is described as having four, eight, ten, or twelve arms, holding a [[damaru]] (drum), trishula (trident), sword, a snake ([[n\u0101ga]]), skull-mace ([[khatvanga]]), thunderbolt ([[vajra]]), a severed head and panapatra (drinking vessel, wine cup) or skullcup (kapala), filled with blood.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kali 003 copy.jpg|thumb|right|Four armed image of Kali, holding a severed head and a skullcup (kapala) in her two left hands]] -->\n\n== The Kapalikas ==\n{{main|Kapalika}}\n\n==Uses==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Kapala Mala courtesy The WOVENSOULS collection.jpg|thumb|Kapala Mala, 19th century, Tibet, courtesy of the Wovensouls collection]]\n\nIn Tibetan monasteries a kapala is used symbolically to hold bread or dough cakes, [[torma]], and wine instead of blood and flesh as offerings to wrathful deities, such as the ferocious [[Dharmap\u0101la]] (\"defender of the faith\"). The dough cakes are shaped to resemble human eyes, ears and tongues. The ''kapala'' is made in the form of a skull, specially collected and prepared. It is elaborately anointed and consecrated before use. The cup is also elaborately decorated and kept in a triangular pedestal. The heavily embossed cup is usually made of [[silver-gilt]] bronze with lid shaped like a skull and with a handle made in the form of a thunderbolt.<ref name=EB>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9044643/kapala Kapala]</ref>\n\nKapalas are used mainly for esoteric purposes such as rituals. Among the rituals using kapalas are higher tantric meditation to achieve a transcendental state of thought and mind within the shortest possible time; libation to gods and deities to win their favor; by Tibetan Lamas as an offering bowl on the altar, being filled with wine or blood as a gift to the Yidam Deity or all the Deities; and the [[Vajrayana]] empowerment ceremony.\n\n== Charnel ground or sky burial ==\n{{Main|Sky burial}}\nThe kapala is one of several charnel ground implements made from human bone found by tantrics at sky burial sites.\n[[Image:Sky burial site, Yerpa Valley.JPG|thumb|left| Sky burial site in Yerpa valley in Tibet where kapalas are searched for by tantric practitioners]]\n\nThe charnel ground, an ancient Tibetan burial custom, is distinctly different from the customs of graveyards and cremation, but all three of them have been a part of the home ground of [[tantra|tantric]] practitioners\u2019 such as the yogis and yoginis, Shaiva Kapalikas and Aghoris, shamans and sadhus. The charnel ground, often referred to as \"sky burial\" by Western sources, is an area demarcated specifically in Tibet, defined by the Tibetan word Jhator (literal meaning is \u2019giving alms to the birds\u2019), a way of  exposing the corpse to nature, where human bodies are disposed as it were or in a chopped (chopped after the rituals) condition in the open ground as a ritual that has great religious meaning of the ascent of the mind to be reincarnated into another circle of life. Such a practice results in finding human bones, half or whole skeletons, more or less putrefying corpses and disattached limbs lying scattered around. Items made from human skulls or bones are found in the sky burial grounds by the [[Sadhus]] and Yogins of the tantric cult. The charnel grounds are also known by the epithets the \"field of death\" or the  \"valley of corpses\". In Tibet,  a class distinction in the burial practices is also noted. The dead High Lamas are buried in [[Stupa]]s or cremated but the dead commoners are disposed of in the Charnel ground or in a Sky burial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_g.html|title=Charnel- and Cremation Grounds|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|website=www.yoniversum.nl|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/tibet/sky-buria.htm|title=Sky Burial, Tibetan Religious Ritual, Funeral Party|website=www.travelchinaguide.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe products from the charnel ground are the charnel ground ornaments such as the i) Crown of five skulls, ii) Bone necklace, iii) Bone armlets, iv)  Bone bracelets, v) Bone skirt and vi) Bone anklets which decorate  many images of dakinis, yoginis, dharmapalas and a few other deities (as may be seen in some of the pictures and stone images depicted in the gallery here), and other products such as the Bone trumpet, the Skull cup and Skull drum used by the tantric practitioners.

She is described as having four, eight, ten, or twelve arms, holding a [[damaru]] (drum), trishula (trident), sword, a snake ([[n\u0101ga]]), skull-mace ([[khatvanga]]), thunderbolt ([[vajra]]), a severed head and panapatra (drinking vessel, wine cup) or skullcup (kapala), filled with blood.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kali 003 copy.jpg|thumb|right|Four armed image of Kali, holding a severed head and a skullcup (kapala) in her two left hands]] -->\n\n== The Kapalikas ==\n{{main|Kapalika}}\n\n==Uses==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Kapala Mala courtesy The WOVENSOULS collection.jpg|thumb|Kapala Mala, 19th century, Tibet, courtesy of the Wovensouls collection]]\n\nIn Tibetan monasteries a kapala is used symbolically to hold bread or dough cakes, [[torma]], and wine instead of blood and flesh as offerings to wrathful deities, such as the ferocious [[Dharmap\u0101la]] (\"defender of the faith\"). The dough cakes are shaped to resemble human eyes, ears and tongues. The ''kapala'' is made in the form of a skull, specially collected and prepared. It is elaborately anointed and consecrated before use. The cup is also elaborately decorated and kept in a triangular pedestal. The heavily embossed cup is usually made of [[silver-gilt]] bronze with lid shaped like a skull and with a handle made in the form of a thunderbolt.<ref name=EB>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9044643/kapala Kapala]</ref>\n\nKapalas are used mainly for esoteric purposes such as rituals. Among the rituals using kapalas are higher tantric meditation to achieve a transcendental state of thought and mind within the shortest possible time; libation to gods and deities to win their favor; by Tibetan Lamas as an offering bowl on the altar, being filled with wine or blood as a gift to the Yidam Deity or all the Deities; and the [[Vajrayana]] empowerment ceremony.\n\n== Charnel ground or sky burial ==\n{{Main|Sky burial}}\nThe kapala is one of several charnel ground implements made from human bone found by tantrics at sky burial sites.\n[[Image:Sky burial site, Yerpa Valley.JPG|thumb|left| Sky burial site in Yerpa valley in Tibet where kapalas are searched for by tantric practitioners]]\n\nThe charnel ground, an ancient Tibetan burial custom, is distinctly different from the customs of graveyards and cremation, but all three of them have been a part of the home ground of [[tantra|tantric]] practitioners\u2019 such as the yogis and yoginis, Shaiva Kapalikas and Aghoris, shamans and sadhus. The charnel ground, often referred to as \"sky burial\" by Western sources, is an area demarcated specifically in Tibet, defined by the Tibetan word Jhator (literal meaning is \u2019giving alms to the birds\u2019), a way of  exposing the corpse to nature, where human bodies are disposed as it were or in a chopped (chopped after the rituals) condition in the open ground as a ritual that has great religious meaning of the ascent of the mind to be reincarnated into another circle of life. Such a practice results in finding human bones, half or whole skeletons, more or less putrefying corpses and disattached limbs lying scattered around. Items made from human skulls or bones are found in the sky burial grounds by the [[Sadhus]] and Yogins of the tantric cult. The charnel grounds are also known by the epithets the \"field of death\" or the  \"valley of corpses\". In Tibet,  a class distinction in the burial practices is also noted. The dead High Lamas are buried in [[Stupa]]s or cremated but the dead commoners are disposed of in the Charnel ground or in a Sky burial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_g.html|title=Charnel- and Cremation Grounds|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|website=www.yoniversum.nl|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/tibet/sky-buria.htm|title=Sky Burial, Tibetan Religious Ritual, Funeral Party|website=www.travelchinaguide.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe products from the charnel ground are the charnel ground ornaments such as the i) Crown of five skulls, ii) Bone necklace, iii) Bone armlets, iv)  Bone bracelets, v) Bone skirt and vi) Bone anklets which decorate  many images of dakinis, yoginis, dharmapalas and a few other deities (as may be seen in some of the pictures and stone images depicted in the gallery here), and other products such as the Bone trumpet, the Skull cup and Skull drum used by the tantric practitioners.

''MEGA<sup>1</sup>'' was originally intended to comprise 42 volumes, of which 12 volumes were published between 1927 and 1935.<ref name=\"MEGAc\">[http://marxdialecticalstudies.blogspot.de/2010/09/marx-engels-gesamtausgabe-mega-project.html Marx.

The cooperation between German and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] editors, new editorial guidelines and innovative concepts led to the publication of a first sample volume in 1972, followed by the first volume of the new, ''second MEGA'' (or ''MEGA<sup>2</sup>'') in 1975.<ref name=\"MEGAc\" />\n\n===Structure===\n''MEGA'' contains material written by Marx between 1835 and his death in 1883, and by Engels between 1838 and his death in 1895. The project is divided into four general sections:\n\n==== I. Abteilung (Werke, Artikel, Entw\u00fcrfe) ====\n\n*All philosophical, economic, historical and political works, publications, articles and speeches of Marx and Engels. Well-known works of Marx and Engels, including ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (volume I/5), ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848-1850]]'' (volume I/10), ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' (volume I/11), ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'' (volume I/25) and ''[[Anti-D\u00fchring]]'' (volume I/27) are part of this section. It will comprise 32 volumes.<ref>[http://mega.bbaw.de/struktur/abteilung_i ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften'': MEGA, Erste Abteilung (German).]</ref>\n\n==== II. Abteilung (Das Kapital und Vorarbeiten) ====\n\n*This section contains Marx's major work, ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]'' (with all three volumes), and all the economic works and manuscripts related to it, beginning with the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' from 1857/58 (volume II/1). This section is so far the only completed one, it was finished with volume II/4.3 in 2012 and comprises 15 volumes in 23 books.<ref>[http://mega.bbaw.de/struktur/abteilung_ii ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften'': MEGA, Zweite Abteilung (German).]</ref>\n\n==== III. Abteilung (Briefwechsel) ====\n\n*The complete correspondence of Marx and Engels, both the exchange of letters between each other, as well as from Marx and Engels to third persons, whose letters to both authors are also completely printed in the edition. The section will comprise 35 volumes.<ref>[http://mega.bbaw.de/struktur/abteilung_iii ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften'': MEGA, Dritte Abteilung (German).]</ref>\n\n==== IV. Abteilung (Exzerpte, Notizen, Marginalien) ====\n\n*The previously largely unpublished excerpts, notes and marginalia of Marx and Engels. The section will comprise 32 volumes.<ref>[http://mega.bbaw.de/struktur/abteilung_iv ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften'': MEGA, Vierte Abteilung (German).]</ref>\n\n===Plan===\nSince 1990 ''MEGA'' is being published by the ''Internationale Marx-Engels-Stiftung (IMES)'' in Amsterdam. \n\nThe IMES is an international network of the [[International Institute of Social History]], the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] (BBAW), the [[Karl Marx House|Karl-Marx-Haus]] (KMH) of the [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] in [[Trier]], the [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History|Russian State Archive for Social/Political History]] (RGA) and the [[Russian Independent Institute for the Study of Social and National Problems]] (RNI), the latter two in Moscow.<ref name=\"MEGAa\" /> The main task of the IMES is to continue the publication of the ''Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe''.\n\nIn 2015 the {{Lang|de|Gemeinsame Wissenschaftskonferenz}} (federal science conference) of the German federal states and the German national government decided to continue funding the publication of ''MEGA'', albeit in a newly conceptualized form: All the letters in the third section of ''MEGA'' from 1866 to 1895 (from volume III/14 onwards) and large parts of the fourth section will only be published digitally in the future. \n\nAll further volumes of the first and important volumes of the fourth section will, however, still be published in printed form.<ref>[http://www.bbaw.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilungen-2015/gwk Press release of BBAW after GWK conference, October 30, 2015 (German).]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Marx/Engels Collected Works]]'' (''MECW'')\n* ''[[Marx-Engels-Werke]]'' (''MEW'')\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mega.bbaw.de/ Official website of BBAW for the ''MEGA'' project]\n* [https://marxforschung.de/ Website of the ''Berliner Verein zur F\u00f6rderung der MEGA-Edition e.V.''

The cooperation between German and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] editors, new editorial guidelines and innovative concepts led to the publication of a first sample volume in 1972, followed by the first volume of the new, ''second MEGA'' (or ''MEGA<sup>2</sup>'') in 1975.<ref name=\"MEGAc\" />\n\n===Structure===\n''MEGA'' contains material written by Marx between 1835 and his death in 1883, and by Engels between 1838 and his death in 1895. The project is divided into four general sections:\n\n==== I. Abteilung (Werke, Artikel, Entw\u00fcrfe) ====\n\n*All philosophical, economic, historical and political works, publications, articles and speeches of Marx and Engels. Well-known works of Marx and Engels, including ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (volume I/5), ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848-1850]]'' (volume I/10), ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' (volume I/11), ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]'' (volume I/25) and ''[[Anti-D\u00fchring]]'' (volume I/27) are part of this section. It will comprise 32 volumes.<ref>[http://mega.bbaw.de/struktur/abteilung_i ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften'': MEGA, Erste Abteilung (German).]</ref>\n\n==== II. Abteilung (Das Kapital und Vorarbeiten) ====\n\n*This section contains Marx's major work, ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]'' (with all three volumes), and all the economic works and manuscripts related to it, beginning with the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' from 1857/58 (volume II/1). This section is so far the only completed one, it was finished with volume II/4.3 in 2012 and comprises 15 volumes in 23 books.<ref>[http://mega.bbaw.de/struktur/abteilung_ii ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften'': MEGA, Zweite Abteilung (German).]</ref>\n\n==== III. Abteilung (Briefwechsel) ====\n\n*The complete correspondence of Marx and Engels, both the exchange of letters between each other, as well as from Marx and Engels to third persons, whose letters to both authors are also completely printed in the edition. The section will comprise 35 volumes.<ref>[http://mega.bbaw.de/struktur/abteilung_iii ''Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften'': MEGA, Dritte Abteilung (German).]</ref>\n\n==== IV. Abteilung (Exzerpte, Notizen, Marginalien) ====\n\n*The previously largely unpublished excerpts, notes and marginalia of Marx and Engels.

Gangster Kabir Bhai decides to eliminate Karan instead. In comes Vijju, a hitman who returns to Mumbai after a long exile in Paris, France in order to perform one last job. While the gangsters and Vijju try to take down Karan, Karan is trying to woo his old college friend Tanya, and Tanya's friend Amrita is trying to figure out the relationship between Vijju and her mother. Vijju later reveals that he is not the contract killer and is rather trying to protect his son, ACP Karan. The story rolls on, showing Vijju climbing the ladder of underworld to reach Kabir and plot with him the murder of Karan. One of Kabir Bhai's associates, {{Proper name|Yera}}, goes against his decision of roping in Vijju and attempts to shoot Karan. He misses narrowly and returns to base, facing mockery from Vijju. Meanwhile, Vijju meets his estranged wife Sita and tries to patch the relationship. {{Proper name|Yera}} attempts once again and is successful to pump some bullets into Karan, failing Vijju's attempts to stop him from going to the place of shootout. A hurt and angry Vijju then admits Karan to a hospital and visits Kabir's den. After reciting a short story and explaining three morals, Vijju informs that Karan is alive and that the den is surrounded by police.

The motet was one of the pre-eminent [[polyphonic]] forms of [[Renaissance music]]. According to [[Margaret Bent]], \"a piece of music in several parts with words\" is as precise a definition of the motet as will serve from the 13th to the late 16th century and beyond.<ref name=bent>Margaret Bent, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=_UmMn1EgB7IC&pg=PA114 The Late-Medieval Motet]\" in ''Companion to Medieval & Renaissance Music'', edited by Tess Knighton and David Fallows, 114\u201319 ([[Berkeley, California]]: University of California Press, 1992): 114. {{ISBN|9780520210813}}.</ref> The late 13th-century theorist [[Johannes de Grocheo]] believed that the motet was \"not to be celebrated in the presence of common people, because they do not notice its subtlety, nor are they delighted in hearing it, but in the presence of the educated and of those who are seeking out subtleties in the arts\". It's been commonly understood that Johannes de Grocheio was very wrong, woof.<ref>Johannes de Grocheio, ''Ars Musice'', edited and translated by Constant J. Mews, John N.

The [[Medieval]] Latin for \"motet\" is ''motectum'', and the Italian ''mottetto'' was also used.<ref>{{CathEncy|author=William Henry Grattan Flood|wstitle=Motet}}</ref> If the word is from Latin, the name describes the movement of the different voices against one another.

Sanders and Peter M. Lefferts, \"Motet, \u00a7I: Middle Ages\", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref> The motet probably arose from [[Clausula (music)|clausula]] sections in a longer sequence of organum. Clausulae represent brief sections of longer polyphonic settings of chant with a note-against-note texture. In some cases, these sections were composed independently and \"substituted\" for existing setting. These clausulae could then be \"troped,\" or given new text in the upper part(s), creating motets.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Flotzinger |first1=Rudolf |authorlink1=Rudolf Flotzinger|title=Clausula |website=Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000005897|access-date=17 November 2018 |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.05897 |date=2001}}</ref> From these first motets arose a [[medieval music|medieval]] tradition of [[secular]] motets.  These were two- to four-part compositions in which different texts, sometimes in different [[vernacular]] languages, were sung simultaneously over a (usually Latin-texted) ''[[cantus firmus]]'' that once again was usually adapted from a passage of [[Gregorian chant]]. It is also increasingly argued that the term \"motet\" could in fact include certain brief single-voice songs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peraino |first1=Judith |title=Monophonic Motets: Sampling and Grafting in the Middle Ages |journal=Musical Quarterly |date=2001 |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=644\u2013680 |doi=10.1093/mq/85.4.644}}</ref> The texts of upper voices include subjects as diverse as courtly love odes, pastoral encounters with shepherdesses, political attacks, and many Christian devotion, especially to the Virgin Mary. The vast majority of medieval motets are anonymous compositions, and there is significant re-use of music and text. They are transmitted in a number of contexts, but were most popular in northern France and Paris; the largest surviving collection is in the [[Montpellier Codex]].\n\nIncreasingly in the 14th and 15th centuries, motets made use of repetitive patters often termed  [[isorhythm|panisorhythmic]]; that is, they employed repeated rhythmic patterns in all voices&mdash;not only the ''cantus firmus''&mdash;which did not necessarily coincide with repeating melodic patterns. [[Philippe de Vitry]] was one of the earliest composers to use this technique, and his work evidently had an influence on that of [[Guillaume de Machaut]], one of the most famous named composers of late medieval motets.\n\n===Medieval composers===\nOther medieval motet composers include:\n\n* [[Adam de la Halle]] (1237?\u20131288? or after 1306)\n* [[Johannes Ciconia]] (c. 1370\u20131412)\n* [[John Dunstaple]] (c. 1390\u20131453)\n* [[Franco of Cologne]] (fl. mid-13th century)\n* [[Jacopo da Bologna]] (fl. 1340\u20131385)\n* [[Marchetto da Padova]] (fl. 1305\u20131319)\n* [[Petrus de Cruce]] (fl. second half of the 13th century)\n* [[Willelmus de Winchecumbe]] (fl. 1270s)\n\n==Renaissance examples==\n[[Image:Cantoria luca della robbia22.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Luca della Robbia]]: fragment from a choir. [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]] in [[Florence]].]]\n\nThe motet was preserved in the transition from medieval to [[Renaissance music]], but the character of the composition was entirely changed.  While it grew out of the medieval isorhythmic motet, the Renaissance composers of the motet generally abandoned the use of a repeated figure as a ''cantus firmus''. [[Guillaume Dufay]] was a transitional figure in this regard; he wrote one of the last important motets in the medieval, isorhythmic style, ''[[Nuper rosarum flores]]'' (1436), written to commemorate the completion of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s [[dome]] in the [[Cathedral of Florence]].<ref>[[Alec Robertson (music critic)|Alec Robertson]] and [[Denis Stevens]], eds., ''A History of Music'', Volume 2 (New York: Barnes and Noble, Inc., 1965), 85.</ref><ref>Edgar H. Sparks, Cantus Firmus in Mass and Motet 1420&ndash;1520 (New York: Da Capo Press, 1975), 86.</ref>  During the second half of the fifteenth century, motets came to adopt the ''cantus firmus'' technique found in contemporary \"tenor masses,\" in which the ''cantus firmus'' was stretched out to great lengths compared to the multivoice counterpoint surrounding it.<ref name=\"NewGrove2\">Leeman L. Perkins and Patrick Macey, \"Motet, \u00a7II: Renaissance\", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref> This tended to obscure the rhythm supplied by the ''cantus firmus'' that had been apparent in the medieval isorhythmic motet.  The cascading, [[passing chord]]s created by the interplay between multiple voices, and the absence of a strong or obvious beat, are the features that distinguish medieval and renaissance motet styles. Instead, the Renaissance motet is a [[polyphony|polyphonic]] musical setting, sometimes in imitative counterpoint, for chorus, of a Latin text, usually sacred, not specifically connected to the [[liturgy]] of a given day, and therefore suitable for use in any service.  The texts of [[antiphon]]s were frequently used as motet texts.  This is the sort of composition that is most familiarly designated by the term \"motet\", and the Renaissance period marked the flowering of the form.\n\nIn essence, these motets were sacred [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s.  The relationship between the two forms is most obvious in the composers who concentrated on sacred music, especially [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], whose \"motets\" setting texts from the ''[[Song of Solomon|Canticum Canticorum]]'', the biblical \"Song of Solomon\", are among the most lush and madrigal-like of Palestrina's compositions, while his \"madrigals\" that set poems of [[Petrarch]] in praise of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] would not be out of place in church.  The language of the text was the decisive feature: if it is [[Latin]], it is a motet; if the vernacular, a madrigal.<ref>The [[Hilliard Ensemble]], ''Palestrina: Canticum canticorum, Motets Book IV; Spiritual madrigals'' (Virgin Classics, 1994; sound recording liner notes)</ref>  Religious compositions in vernacular languages were often called ''[[madrigale spirituale|madrigali spirituali]]'', \"spiritual madrigals\".  Like their madrigal cousins, Renaissance motets developed in episodic format, with separate phrases of the source text being given independent melodic treatment and contrapuntal development; contrapuntal passages often alternate with monody.\n\nSecular (non-religious) motets continued to be written, however. These motets typically set a Latin text in praise of a monarch, commemorating some public triumph, or even praising music itself. Nevertheless, the themes of [[courtly love]] often found in the medieval secular motet were banished from the Renaissance motet.  Many secular motets are known as \"ceremonial motets\".<ref name=blanche>Blanche Gangwere, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=v5Oz7vPCQXoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Music History During the Renaissance Period, 1520\u20131550]'' (Westport, CT, Praeger Publishers: 2004), pp. 451\u201354.</ref> Characteristic of ceremonial motets was a clarity of diction, for the audience was not presumed to be familiar already with the text (as would have been true with Latin hymns) and also a clear articulation of formal structure, for example a setting apart of successive portions of text with sharp contrasts of texture or rhythm. [[Adrian Willaert]], [[Ludwig Senfl]], and [[Cipriano de Rore]] were among the most prominent composers of ceremonial motets during the first half of the 16th century.<ref name=blanche/>\n\n===Renaissance composers===\nThe motet was one of the preeminent forms of [[Renaissance music]]. Important composers of Renaissance motets include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=17em}}\n* [[Alexander Agricola]]\n* [[Gilles Binchois]]\n* [[Antoine Busnois]]\n* [[William Byrd]]\n* [[Johannes Vodnianus Campanus]]\n* [[Loyset Comp\u00e8re]]\n* [[Josquin des Prez]]\n* [[John Dunstaple]]\n* [[Antoine de F\u00e9vin]]\n* [[Carlo Gesualdo]]\n* [[Nicolas Gombert]]\n* [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]]\n* [[Heinrich Isaac]]\n* [[Pierre de La Rue]]\n* [[Orlande de Lassus]]\n* [[Crist\u00f3bal de Morales]]\n* [[Jean Mouton]]\n* [[Jacob Obrecht]]\n* [[Johannes Ockeghem]]\n* [[Martin Peerson]]\n* [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]\n* [[Thomas Tallis]]\n* [[John Taverner]]\n* [[Robert Carver (composer)|Robert Carver]]\n* [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]\n* [[Manuel Cardoso]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nIn the latter part of the 16th century, [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] and other composers developed a new style, the [[polychoral]] motet, in which two or more [[choir]]s of singers (or instruments) alternated. This style of motet was sometimes called the ''Venetian motet'' to distinguish it from the ''Netherlands'' or ''Flemish'' motet written elsewhere. \"[[If Ye Love Me]]\" by Thomas Tallis serves the demand of the Church of England for English texts, and a focus on understanding the words, beginning in [[homophony]].\n\n==Baroque examples==\nIn [[Baroque music]], especially in France, there were two distinct, and very different types of motet: ''petits motets'', sacred choral or chamber compositions whose only accompaniment was a [[basso continuo]]; and ''[[grands motets]]'', which included massed choirs and instruments up to and including a full orchestra. [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] was an important composer of this sort of motet. Lully's motets often included parts for soloists as well as choirs; they were longer, including multiple movements in which different soloist, choral, or instrumental forces were employed. Lully's motets also continued the Renaissance tradition of semi-secular Latin motets in works such as ''[[Plaude Laetare Gallia]]'', written to celebrate the baptism of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s son; its text by [[Pierre Perrin]] begins:\n\n<blockquote><poem>''Plaude laetare Gallia''\n''Rore caelesti rigantur lilia,''\n''Sacro Delphinus fonte lavatur''\n''Et christianus Christo dicatur.''</poem>\n\n(\"Rejoice and sing, France: the lily is bathed with heavenly dew. The [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] is bathed in the sacred font, and the Christian is dedicated to Christ.\")</blockquote>\n\nIn Germany, too, pieces called motets were written in the new musical languages of the Baroque. [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] wrote many motets in series of publications, for example three books of [[Symphoniae sacrae I|Symphoniae sacrae]], some in Latin and some in German. [[Hans Leo Hassler]] composed motets such as ''[[Dixit Maria]]'', on which he also based a mass composition.\n\n=== J. S.

The motet [[Sei Lob und Preis mit Ehren, BWV 231|''Sei Lob und Preis mit Ehren'', BWV 231]] is an arrangement of a movement from Bach's Cantata 28, and the authenticity of the arrangement is not certain. For a few more motets, such as [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh 159]], Bach's authorship is debated.\n\n== 18th century ==\nLater 18th-century composers wrote few motets, but for example his son [[Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach]] composed an extended [[chorale motet]] ''[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme (J.

[[Felix Mendelssohn]] composed motets such as ''[[Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (Mendelssohn)|Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt]]'' and ''[[Denn er hat seinen Engeln befohlen]]''. [[Johannes Brahms]] composed for example three motets on biblical verses, ''[[Fest- und Gedenkspr\u00fcche]]''. Josef Rheinberger composed motets such as ''[[Abendlied (Rheinberger)|Abendlied]]''. [[Anton Bruckner]] composed about 40 [[Motets (Bruckner)|motets]], mainly in Latin, including ''[[Locus iste (Bruckner)|Locus iste]]''. French composers of motets included [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], and [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]. Similar compositions in the English language are called [[anthem]]s, but some later English composers, such as [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], wrote [[Three Latin Motets|motets in Latin]].

The motet was one of the pre-eminent [[polyphonic]] forms of [[Renaissance music]].

Sanders and Peter M.

Clausulae represent brief sections of longer polyphonic settings of chant with a note-against-note texture. In some cases, these sections were composed independently and \"substituted\" for existing setting. These clausulae could then be \"troped,\" or given new text in the upper part(s), creating motets.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Flotzinger |first1=Rudolf |authorlink1=Rudolf Flotzinger|title=Clausula |website=Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000005897|access-date=17 November 2018 |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.05897 |date=2001}}</ref> From these first motets arose a [[medieval music|medieval]] tradition of [[secular]] motets.  These were two- to four-part compositions in which different texts, sometimes in different [[vernacular]] languages, were sung simultaneously over a (usually Latin-texted) ''[[cantus firmus]]'' that once again was usually adapted from a passage of [[Gregorian chant]]. It is also increasingly argued that the term \"motet\" could in fact include certain brief single-voice songs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peraino |first1=Judith |title=Monophonic Motets: Sampling and Grafting in the Middle Ages |journal=Musical Quarterly |date=2001 |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=644\u2013680 |doi=10.1093/mq/85.4.644}}</ref> The texts of upper voices include subjects as diverse as courtly love odes, pastoral encounters with shepherdesses, political attacks, and many Christian devotion, especially to the Virgin Mary. The vast majority of medieval motets are anonymous compositions, and there is significant re-use of music and text. They are transmitted in a number of contexts, but were most popular in northern France and Paris; the largest surviving collection is in the [[Montpellier Codex]].\n\nIncreasingly in the 14th and 15th centuries, motets made use of repetitive patters often termed  [[isorhythm|panisorhythmic]]; that is, they employed repeated rhythmic patterns in all voices&mdash;not only the ''cantus firmus''&mdash;which did not necessarily coincide with repeating melodic patterns. [[Philippe de Vitry]] was one of the earliest composers to use this technique, and his work evidently had an influence on that of [[Guillaume de Machaut]], one of the most famous named composers of late medieval motets.\n\n===Medieval composers===\nOther medieval motet composers include:\n\n* [[Adam de la Halle]] (1237?\u20131288? or after 1306)\n* [[Johannes Ciconia]] (c. 1370\u20131412)\n* [[John Dunstaple]] (c. 1390\u20131453)\n* [[Franco of Cologne]] (fl. mid-13th century)\n* [[Jacopo da Bologna]] (fl. 1340\u20131385)\n* [[Marchetto da Padova]] (fl. 1305\u20131319)\n* [[Petrus de Cruce]] (fl. second half of the 13th century)\n* [[Willelmus de Winchecumbe]] (fl. 1270s)\n\n==Renaissance examples==\n[[Image:Cantoria luca della robbia22.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Luca della Robbia]]: fragment from a choir. [[Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence)|Museo dell'Opera del Duomo]] in [[Florence]].]]\n\nThe motet was preserved in the transition from medieval to [[Renaissance music]], but the character of the composition was entirely changed.  While it grew out of the medieval isorhythmic motet, the Renaissance composers of the motet generally abandoned the use of a repeated figure as a ''cantus firmus''. [[Guillaume Dufay]] was a transitional figure in this regard; he wrote one of the last important motets in the medieval, isorhythmic style, ''[[Nuper rosarum flores]]'' (1436), written to commemorate the completion of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s [[dome]] in the [[Cathedral of Florence]].<ref>[[Alec Robertson (music critic)|Alec Robertson]] and [[Denis Stevens]], eds., ''A History of Music'', Volume 2 (New York: Barnes and Noble, Inc., 1965), 85.</ref><ref>Edgar H. Sparks, Cantus Firmus in Mass and Motet 1420&ndash;1520 (New York: Da Capo Press, 1975), 86.</ref>  During the second half of the fifteenth century, motets came to adopt the ''cantus firmus'' technique found in contemporary \"tenor masses,\" in which the ''cantus firmus'' was stretched out to great lengths compared to the multivoice counterpoint surrounding it.<ref name=\"NewGrove2\">Leeman L. Perkins and Patrick Macey, \"Motet, \u00a7II: Renaissance\", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).</ref> This tended to obscure the rhythm supplied by the ''cantus firmus'' that had been apparent in the medieval isorhythmic motet.  The cascading, [[passing chord]]s created by the interplay between multiple voices, and the absence of a strong or obvious beat, are the features that distinguish medieval and renaissance motet styles. Instead, the Renaissance motet is a [[polyphony|polyphonic]] musical setting, sometimes in imitative counterpoint, for chorus, of a Latin text, usually sacred, not specifically connected to the [[liturgy]] of a given day, and therefore suitable for use in any service.  The texts of [[antiphon]]s were frequently used as motet texts.  This is the sort of composition that is most familiarly designated by the term \"motet\", and the Renaissance period marked the flowering of the form.\n\nIn essence, these motets were sacred [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s.  The relationship between the two forms is most obvious in the composers who concentrated on sacred music, especially [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], whose \"motets\" setting texts from the ''[[Song of Solomon|Canticum Canticorum]]'', the biblical \"Song of Solomon\", are among the most lush and madrigal-like of Palestrina's compositions, while his \"madrigals\" that set poems of [[Petrarch]] in praise of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] would not be out of place in church.  The language of the text was the decisive feature: if it is [[Latin]], it is a motet; if the vernacular, a madrigal.<ref>The [[Hilliard Ensemble]], ''Palestrina: Canticum canticorum, Motets Book IV; Spiritual madrigals'' (Virgin Classics, 1994; sound recording liner notes)</ref>  Religious compositions in vernacular languages were often called ''[[madrigale spirituale|madrigali spirituali]]'', \"spiritual madrigals\".  Like their madrigal cousins, Renaissance motets developed in episodic format, with separate phrases of the source text being given independent melodic treatment and contrapuntal development; contrapuntal passages often alternate with monody.\n\nSecular (non-religious) motets continued to be written, however. These motets typically set a Latin text in praise of a monarch, commemorating some public triumph, or even praising music itself. Nevertheless, the themes of [[courtly love]] often found in the medieval secular motet were banished from the Renaissance motet.  Many secular motets are known as \"ceremonial motets\".<ref name=blanche>Blanche Gangwere, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=v5Oz7vPCQXoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Music History During the Renaissance Period, 1520\u20131550]'' (Westport, CT, Praeger Publishers: 2004), pp. 451\u201354.</ref> Characteristic of ceremonial motets was a clarity of diction, for the audience was not presumed to be familiar already with the text (as would have been true with Latin hymns) and also a clear articulation of formal structure, for example a setting apart of successive portions of text with sharp contrasts of texture or rhythm. [[Adrian Willaert]], [[Ludwig Senfl]], and [[Cipriano de Rore]] were among the most prominent composers of ceremonial motets during the first half of the 16th century.<ref name=blanche/>\n\n===Renaissance composers===\nThe motet was one of the preeminent forms of [[Renaissance music]]. Important composers of Renaissance motets include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=17em}}\n* [[Alexander Agricola]]\n* [[Gilles Binchois]]\n* [[Antoine Busnois]]\n* [[William Byrd]]\n* [[Johannes Vodnianus Campanus]]\n* [[Loyset Comp\u00e8re]]\n* [[Josquin des Prez]]\n* [[John Dunstaple]]\n* [[Antoine de F\u00e9vin]]\n* [[Carlo Gesualdo]]\n* [[Nicolas Gombert]]\n* [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]]\n* [[Heinrich Isaac]]\n* [[Pierre de La Rue]]\n* [[Orlande de Lassus]]\n* [[Crist\u00f3bal de Morales]]\n* [[Jean Mouton]]\n* [[Jacob Obrecht]]\n* [[Johannes Ockeghem]]\n* [[Martin Peerson]]\n* [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]]\n* [[Thomas Tallis]]\n* [[John Taverner]]\n* [[Robert Carver (composer)|Robert Carver]]\n* [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]\n* [[Manuel Cardoso]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nIn the latter part of the 16th century, [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] and other composers developed a new style, the [[polychoral]] motet, in which two or more [[choir]]s of singers (or instruments) alternated. This style of motet was sometimes called the ''Venetian motet'' to distinguish it from the ''Netherlands'' or ''Flemish'' motet written elsewhere. \"[[If Ye Love Me]]\" by Thomas Tallis serves the demand of the Church of England for English texts, and a focus on understanding the words, beginning in [[homophony]].\n\n==Baroque examples==\nIn [[Baroque music]], especially in France, there were two distinct, and very different types of motet: ''petits motets'', sacred choral or chamber compositions whose only accompaniment was a [[basso continuo]]; and ''[[grands motets]]'', which included massed choirs and instruments up to and including a full orchestra. [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] was an important composer of this sort of motet. Lully's motets often included parts for soloists as well as choirs; they were longer, including multiple movements in which different soloist, choral, or instrumental forces were employed. Lully's motets also continued the Renaissance tradition of semi-secular Latin motets in works such as ''[[Plaude Laetare Gallia]]'', written to celebrate the baptism of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s son; its text by [[Pierre Perrin]] begins:\n\n<blockquote><poem>''Plaude laetare Gallia''\n''Rore caelesti rigantur lilia,''\n''Sacro Delphinus fonte lavatur''\n''Et christianus Christo dicatur.''</poem>\n\n(\"Rejoice and sing, France: the lily is bathed with heavenly dew. The [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] is bathed in the sacred font, and the Christian is dedicated to Christ.\")</blockquote>\n\nIn Germany, too, pieces called motets were written in the new musical languages of the Baroque. [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]] wrote many motets in series of publications, for example three books of [[Symphoniae sacrae I|Symphoniae sacrae]], some in Latin and some in German.

The partitions were conducted by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Russian Empire]], which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures and annexations.<ref name=\"Brit\" /><ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Bideleux |first2=Ian |last2=Jeffries |title=A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |page=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Judy |last1=Batt |first2=Kataryna |last2=Wolczuk |title=Region, State and Identity in Central and Eastern Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=153}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Sinkoff |title=Out of the Shtetl: Making Jews Modern in the Polish Borderlands |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |year=2004 |page=271}}</ref>\n\nThe [[First Partition of Poland]] was decided on August 5, 1772. Two decades later, Russian and Prussian troops entered the Commonwealth again and the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition]] was signed on January 23, 1793. Austria did not participate in the Second Partition. The [[Third Partition of Poland]] took place on October 24, 1795, in reaction to the unsuccessful Polish [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] the previous year. With this partition, the Commonwealth ceased to exist.<ref name=\"Brit\" />\n\nIn English, the term \"Partitions of Poland\" is sometimes used geographically as [[toponymy]], to mean the three parts that the partitioning powers divided the Commonwealth into, namely:  the [[Austrian Partition]], the [[Prussian Partition]] and the [[Russian Partition]]. In Polish, there are two separate words for the two meanings. The consecutive acts of dividing and [[annexation]] of Poland are referred to as ''{{lang|pl|rozbi\u00f3r}}'' (plural: ''{{lang|pl|rozbiory}}''), while the term ''{{lang|pl|zab\u00f3r}}'' (pl. ''{{lang|pl|zabory}}'') means each part of the Commonwealth annexed in 1772\u201395 becoming part of Imperial Russia, Prussia, or Austria. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the borders of the three partitioned sectors were redrawn; the Austrians established [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] in the Austrian partition, whereas the Russians gained [[Warsaw]] from Prussia and formed an autonomous [[polity]] of [[Congress Poland]] in the Russian partition.\n\nIn Polish historiography, the term [[#Fourth Partition|\"Fourth Partition of Poland\"]] has also been used, in reference to any subsequent annexation of Polish lands by foreign invaders. Depending on source and historical period, this could mean the events of [[Congress of Vienna|1815]], or [[Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland|1832]] and [[Krak\u00f3w Uprising|1846]], or [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939]]. The term \"Fourth Partition\" in a temporal sense can also mean the diaspora communities that played an important political role in re-establishing the Polish sovereign state after 1918.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Allegory of the 1st partition of Poland crop.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the [[First Partition of Poland|1st partition]] of [[Poland]], showing [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia (left), [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]] and [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia (right) quarrelling over their territorial seizures]]\n[[File:Alegoria Umarlej Polski.jpg|thumb|[[W\u0142odzimierz Tetmajer]], ''Allegory of Dead Poland'', St. Nicholas Cathedral, [[Kalisz]]]]\n\nDuring the reign of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]] (1632\u201348), the ''{{lang|la|[[liberum veto]]}}'' was developed, a policy of parliamentary procedure based on the assumption of the political equality of every \"[[Szlachta|gentleman/Polish nobleman]],\" with the corollary that unanimous consent was needed for all measures.<ref name=\"Brit\" /> A single member of parliament's belief that a measure was injurious to his own constituency (usually simply his own estate), even after the act had been approved, became enough to strike the act. Thus it became increasingly difficult to undertake action. The ''{{lang|la|liberum veto}}'' also provided openings for foreign diplomats to get their ways, through bribing nobles to exercise it.<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Thus, one could characterise Poland\u2013Lithuania in its final period (mid-18th century) before the partitions as already in a state of disorder and not a completely sovereign state, and almost as a [[vassal state]],<ref name=\"Scott\" /> with Russian [[tsar]]s effectively choosing Polish kings. This applies particularly to the last Commonwealth King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], who for some time had been a lover of Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great]].\n\nIn 1730 the neighbors of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (''{{lang|pl|[[Rzeczpospolita]]}}''), namely Prussia, Austria and Russia, signed a secret agreement to maintain the ''{{lang|la|status quo}}'': specifically, to ensure that the Commonwealth laws would not change. Their alliance later became known in Poland as the \"[[Treaty of the Three Black Eagles|Alliance of the Three Black Eagles]]\" (or ''{{lang|de|L\u00f6wenwolde}}'s Treaty''), because all three states used a black eagle as a state symbol (in contrast to the [[coat of arms of Poland|white eagle]], a symbol of Poland). The Commonwealth had been forced to rely on Russia for protection against the rising [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which demanded a slice of the northwest in order to unite its Western and Eastern portions; this would leave the Commonwealth with a [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast only in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Catherine had to use diplomacy to win Austria to her side.\n\nThe Commonwealth had remained neutral in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), yet it sympathized with the alliance of France, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], and Russia, and allowed Russian troops access to its western lands as bases against Prussia. [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] retaliated by ordering enough Polish currency counterfeited to severely affect the Polish economy. Through the [[szlachta|Polish nobles]] whom Russia controlled and the Russian Minister to Warsaw, ambassador and Prince [[Nicholas Repnin]], Empress Catherine the Great forced a constitution on the Commonwealth at the so-called [[Repnin Sejm]] of 1767, named after ambassador Repnin, who effectively dictated the terms of that Sejm (and ordered the capture and exile to [[Kaluga]] of some vocal opponents of his policies,<ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite book |first=Hamish M. |last=Scott |title=The Emergence of the Eastern Powers, 1756\u20131775 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-79269-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN052179269X&pg=PA182&dq=Repnin+Poland |pages=181\u2013182}}</ref><ref name=\"Steed,\">H.

Repnin also demanded religious freedom for the Protestant and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and the resulting reaction among some of Poland's Roman Catholics, as well as the deep resentment of Russian intervention in the Commonwealth's domestic affairs, led to the War of the [[Bar Confederation|Confederation of Bar]] of 1768\u20131772, formed in [[Bar, Ukraine|Bar]], where the Poles tried to expel Russian forces from Commonwealth territory.<ref name=\"Scott\" /><ref name=\"Seton-Watson\" /> The irregular and poorly commanded Polish forces had little chance in the face of the regular Russian army and suffered a major defeat. Adding to the chaos was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Cossacks|Cossack]] and peasant rebellion, the [[Koliyivshchyna]], which erupted in 1768 and resulted in massacres of [[szlachta|noblemen]] (''{{lang|pl|szlachta}}''), Jews, [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniates]], and Catholic priests, before it was put down by Polish and Russian troops.\n\nIn 1769 Austria annexed a small territory of [[Spi\u0161|Spisz]] and in 1770 it annexed [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] and [[Nowy Targ]]. These territories had been a bone of contention between Poland and [[Hungary]], which was a part of the Austrian crown lands.\n\n=== First Partition ===\n{{Main|First Partition of Poland}}\n[[File:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1773-1789.PNG|thumb|right|300px|The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth after the First Partition, as a protectorate of the Russian Empire (1773\u201389)]]\n\nIn February 1772, the agreement of partition was signed in [[Vienna]]. Early in August, Russian, Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously invaded the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves. On August 5, 1772, the occupation manifesto was issued, much to the consternation of a country too exhausted by the endeavors of the [[Confederation of Bar]] to offer successful resistance;<ref name=\"Brit\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/466910/Partitions-of-Poland |title=Partitions of Poland |year=2008 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] Online |accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref> nevertheless, several battles and sieges took place, as Commonwealth troops refused to lay down their arms (most notably, in [[Tyniec]], [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]]).\n\nThe partition treaty was ratified by its signatories on September 22, 1772. [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II of Prussia]] was elated with his success; Prussia took most of German-speaking [[Royal Prussia]] (without [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]]) that stood between its possessions in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], as well as Ermland ([[Warmia]]), northern areas of [[Greater Poland]] along the [[Note\u0107]] River (the [[Netze District]]), and parts of [[Kujawy|Kuyavia]] (but not the city of [[Toru\u0144]]).<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Despite token criticism of the partition from Austrian Empress [[Maria Theresa]], Austrian statesman [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg]], was proud of wresting as large a share as he did, with the rich [[salt mining|salt mines]] of [[Bochnia]] and [[Wieliczka]]. To Austria fell [[Zator]] and Auschwitz ([[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]]), part of [[Lesser Poland]] embracing parts of the counties of [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Sandomierz|Sandomir]] and the whole of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], less the city of [[Krak\u00f3w]]. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine of Russia]] was also very satisfied. By this \"diplomatic document\" Russia came into possession of that section of [[Livonia]] that had remained in Commonwealth control, and of [[Belarus]] embracing the counties of [[Vitebsk]], [[Polotsk]] and [[Mstsislaw|Mstislavl]].<ref name=\"Brit\" />\n[[File:Rejtan Upadek Polski Matejko.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Rejtan (painting)|Rejtan at Sejm 1773]]'', oil on canvas by Jan Matejko, 1866, {{convert|282|x|487|cm|0|abbr=on}}, [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]]\n\nBy this partition, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 30% of its territory and half of its population<ref name=\"Brit\" /> (four million people), of which a large portion had not been ethnically Polish. By seizing northwestern Poland, Prussia instantly gained control over 80% of the Commonwealth's total foreign trade. Through levying enormous customs duties, Prussia accelerated the collapse of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=139}}</ref>\n\nAfter having occupied their respective territories, the three partitioning powers demanded that King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw]] and the [[Sejm]] approve their action. When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to their will. The so-called [[Partition Sejm]], with Russian military forces threatening the opposition, on September 18, 1773, signed the treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories.\n\n=== Second Partition ===\n{{Main|Second Partition of Poland}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 2.png|thumb|300px|right|The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Second Partition (1793)]]\n\nBy 1790 the First Polish Republic had been weakened to such a degree that it was forced into an unnatural and terminal alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The [[Polish\u2013Prussian alliance|Polish\u2013Prussian Pact]] of 1790 was signed. The conditions of the Pact contributed to the subsequent final two partitions of Poland\u2013Lithuania.\n\nThe [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|May Constitution of 1791]] enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established the separation of the three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of the [[Repnin Sejm]]. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]] then at high tide in France, Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.\n\nIn the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792|War in Defense of the Constitution]], pro-Russian conservative Polish [[magnate]]s, the [[Targowica Confederation|Confederation of Targowica]], fought against Polish forces supporting the constitution, believing that Russians would help them restore the [[Golden Liberty]]. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, Polish pro-constitution forces, faced with Targowica units and the regular Russian army, were defeated. Prussia signed a treaty with Russia, agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked and both countries would receive chunks of Commonwealth territory. In 1793, deputies to the [[Grodno Sejm]], last Sejm of the Commonwealth, in the presence of the Russian forces, agreed to Russian territorial demands. In the Second Partition, Russia and Prussia helped themselves to enough land so that only one-third of the 1772 population remained in Poland. Prussia named its newly gained province [[South Prussia]], with [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]] (and later Warsaw) as the capital of the new province.\n\nTargowica confederates, who did not expect another partition, and the king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], who joined them near the end, both lost much prestige and support. The reformers, on the other hand, were attracting increasing support, and in 1794 the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] began.\n\n=== Third Partition ===\n{{Main|Third Partition of Poland}}\nKosciuszko's ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes, but they eventually fell before the superior forces of the Russian Empire. The partitioning powers, seeing the increasing unrest in the remaining Commonwealth, decided to solve the problem by erasing any independent Polish state from the map. On 24 October 1795 their representatives signed a treaty, dividing the remaining territories of the Commonwealth between their three countries.\n\nThe Russian part included {{convert|120000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} and 1.2&nbsp;million people with [[Vilnius]], the Prussian part (new provinces of [[New East Prussia]] and [[New Silesia]]) {{convert|55000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} and 1&nbsp;million people with Warsaw, and the Austrian {{convert|47000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} with 1.2&nbsp;million and [[Lublin]] and Krak\u00f3w.\n\n== Summary ==\nWith regard to population, in the First Partition, Poland lost over four to five million citizens (about a third of its population of 14&nbsp;million before the partitions).<ref name=\"LukowskiZawadzki2001-96\">{{cite book |author1=Jerzy Lukowski |author2=W.

After his defeat and the implementation of the [[Congress of Vienna]] treaty in 1815, the Russian-dominated [[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom of Poland]] was created in its place. After the Congress, Russia gained a larger share of Poland (with [[Warsaw]]) and, after crushing [[November Uprising|an insurrection in 1831]], the Congress Kingdom's autonomy was abolished and Poles faced confiscation of property, deportation, forced military service, and the closure of their own universities. After the [[January Uprising|uprising of 1863]], [[Russification]] of Polish secondary schools was imposed and the literacy rate dropped dramatically. In the Austrian sector which now was called [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Poles fared better and were allowed to have representation in Parliament and to form their own universities, and Krak\u00f3w with [[Lw\u00f3w|Lemberg]] (Lw\u00f3w/Lviv) became centers of Polish culture and education. Meanwhile, Prussia [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanized]] the entire school system of its Polish subjects, and had no more respect for Polish culture and institutions than the Russian Empire. In 1915 a [[client state]] of the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] was proposed and accepted by the [[Central Powers]] of World War I: the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916\u201318)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]]. After the end of World War I, the Central Powers' surrender to the [[Allies of World War I|Western Allies]], the chaos of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] finally allowed and helped the restoration of Poland's full independence after 123 years.\n\n== Fourth Partition ==\n[[File:Occupation of Poland 1939.png|right|thumb|250px|The partition of Poland according to [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|the German\u2013Soviet Pact]]; division of Polish territories in the years 1939\u20131941]]\nThe term \"Fourth Partition of Poland\" may refer to any subsequent division of Polish lands, including:\n* after the [[Napoleonic era]], the 1815 division of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]];\n* the 1832 incorporation of the \"[[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom]]\" into Russia, the 1846 incorporation of the [[Free City of Cracow|Republic of Krak\u00f3w]] into Austria, and the 1848 incorporation of the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] into Prussia; and\n* the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|1939 division of Poland]] between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] pursuant to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]].<ref name=\"Brecher\">{{cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Brecher |first2=Jonathan |last2=Wilkenfeld |title=A Study of Crisis |year=1997 |pages=255 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-10806-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&pg=PA255&dq=Zeligowski+state }}</ref>\nIf one accepts more than one of those events as partitions, fifth, sixth, and even seventh partitions can be counted, but these terms are very rare.

The partitions were conducted by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and the [[Russian Empire]], which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures and annexations.<ref name=\"Brit\" /><ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Bideleux |first2=Ian |last2=Jeffries |title=A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |page=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Judy |last1=Batt |first2=Kataryna |last2=Wolczuk |title=Region, State and Identity in Central and Eastern Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=153}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Sinkoff |title=Out of the Shtetl: Making Jews Modern in the Polish Borderlands |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |year=2004 |page=271}}</ref>\n\nThe [[First Partition of Poland]] was decided on August 5, 1772. Two decades later, Russian and Prussian troops entered the Commonwealth again and the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition]] was signed on January 23, 1793. Austria did not participate in the Second Partition. The [[Third Partition of Poland]] took place on October 24, 1795, in reaction to the unsuccessful Polish [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] the previous year. With this partition, the Commonwealth ceased to exist.<ref name=\"Brit\" />\n\nIn English, the term \"Partitions of Poland\" is sometimes used geographically as [[toponymy]], to mean the three parts that the partitioning powers divided the Commonwealth into, namely:  the [[Austrian Partition]], the [[Prussian Partition]] and the [[Russian Partition]]. In Polish, there are two separate words for the two meanings. The consecutive acts of dividing and [[annexation]] of Poland are referred to as ''{{lang|pl|rozbi\u00f3r}}'' (plural: ''{{lang|pl|rozbiory}}''), while the term ''{{lang|pl|zab\u00f3r}}'' (pl. ''{{lang|pl|zabory}}'') means each part of the Commonwealth annexed in 1772\u201395 becoming part of Imperial Russia, Prussia, or Austria. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the borders of the three partitioned sectors were redrawn; the Austrians established [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] in the Austrian partition, whereas the Russians gained [[Warsaw]] from Prussia and formed an autonomous [[polity]] of [[Congress Poland]] in the Russian partition.\n\nIn Polish historiography, the term [[#Fourth Partition|\"Fourth Partition of Poland\"]] has also been used, in reference to any subsequent annexation of Polish lands by foreign invaders. Depending on source and historical period, this could mean the events of [[Congress of Vienna|1815]], or [[Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland|1832]] and [[Krak\u00f3w Uprising|1846]], or [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|1939]]. The term \"Fourth Partition\" in a temporal sense can also mean the diaspora communities that played an important political role in re-establishing the Polish sovereign state after 1918.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Allegory of the 1st partition of Poland crop.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the [[First Partition of Poland|1st partition]] of [[Poland]], showing [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia (left), [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]] and [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia (right) quarrelling over their territorial seizures]]\n[[File:Alegoria Umarlej Polski.jpg|thumb|[[W\u0142odzimierz Tetmajer]], ''Allegory of Dead Poland'', St. Nicholas Cathedral, [[Kalisz]]]]\n\nDuring the reign of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]] (1632\u201348), the ''{{lang|la|[[liberum veto]]}}'' was developed, a policy of parliamentary procedure based on the assumption of the political equality of every \"gentleman/[[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]]\", with the corollary that unanimous consent was needed for all measures.<ref name=\"Brit\" /> A single member of parliament's belief that a measure was injurious to his own constituency (usually simply his own estate), even after the act had been approved, became enough to strike the act. Thus it became increasingly difficult to undertake action. The ''{{lang|la|liberum veto}}'' also provided openings for foreign diplomats to get their ways, through bribing nobles to exercise it.<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Thus, one could characterise Poland\u2013Lithuania in its final period (mid-18th century) before the partitions as already in a state of disorder and not a completely sovereign state, and almost as a [[vassal state]],<ref name=\"Scott\" /> with Russian [[tsar]]s effectively choosing Polish kings. This applies particularly to the last Commonwealth King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], who for some time had been a lover of Russian Empress [[Catherine the Great]].\n\nIn 1730 the neighbors of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (''{{lang|pl|[[Rzeczpospolita]]}}''), namely Prussia, Austria and Russia, signed a secret agreement to maintain the ''{{lang|la|status quo}}'': specifically, to ensure that the Commonwealth laws would not change. Their alliance later became known in Poland as the \"[[Treaty of the Three Black Eagles|Alliance of the Three Black Eagles]]\" (or ''{{lang|de|L\u00f6wenwolde}}'s Treaty''), because all three states used a black eagle as a state symbol (in contrast to the [[coat of arms of Poland|white eagle]], a symbol of Poland). The Commonwealth had been forced to rely on Russia for protection against the rising [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which demanded a slice of the northwest in order to unite its Western and Eastern portions; this would leave the Commonwealth with a [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast only in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Catherine had to use diplomacy to win Austria to her side.\n\nThe Commonwealth had remained neutral in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), yet it sympathized with the alliance of France, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], and Russia, and allowed Russian troops access to its western lands as bases against Prussia. [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] retaliated by ordering enough Polish currency counterfeited to severely affect the Polish economy. Through the [[szlachta|Polish nobles]] whom Russia controlled and the Russian Minister to Warsaw, ambassador and Prince [[Nicholas Repnin]], Empress Catherine the Great forced a constitution on the Commonwealth at the so-called [[Repnin Sejm]] of 1767, named after ambassador Repnin, who effectively dictated the terms of that Sejm (and ordered the capture and exile to [[Kaluga]] of some vocal opponents of his policies,<ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite book |first=Hamish M. |last=Scott |title=The Emergence of the Eastern Powers, 1756\u20131775 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-79269-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN052179269X&pg=PA182&dq=Repnin+Poland |pages=181\u2013182}}</ref><ref name=\"Steed,\">H.

Repnin also demanded religious freedom for the Protestant and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and the resulting reaction among some of Poland's Roman Catholics, as well as the deep resentment of Russian intervention in the Commonwealth's domestic affairs, led to the War of the [[Bar Confederation|Confederation of Bar]] of 1768\u20131772, formed in [[Bar, Ukraine|Bar]], where the Poles tried to expel Russian forces from Commonwealth territory.<ref name=\"Scott\" /><ref name=\"Seton-Watson\" /> The irregular and poorly commanded Polish forces had little chance in the face of the regular Russian army and suffered a major defeat. Adding to the chaos was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Cossacks|Cossack]] and peasant rebellion, the [[Koliyivshchyna]], which erupted in 1768 and resulted in massacres of [[szlachta|noblemen]] (''{{lang|pl|szlachta}}''), Jews, [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniates]], and Catholic priests, before it was put down by Polish and Russian troops.\n\nIn 1769 Austria annexed a small territory of [[Spi\u0161|Spisz]] and in 1770 it annexed [[Nowy S\u0105cz]] and [[Nowy Targ]]. These territories had been a bone of contention between Poland and [[Hungary]], which was a part of the Austrian crown lands.\n\n=== First Partition ===\n{{Main|First Partition of Poland}}\n[[File:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1773-1789.PNG|thumb|right|300px|The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth after the First Partition, as a protectorate of the Russian Empire (1773\u201389)]]\n\nIn February 1772, the agreement of partition was signed in [[Vienna]]. Early in August, Russian, Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously invaded the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves. On August 5, 1772, the occupation manifesto was issued, much to the consternation of a country too exhausted by the endeavors of the [[Confederation of Bar]] to offer successful resistance;<ref name=\"Brit\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/466910/Partitions-of-Poland |title=Partitions of Poland |year=2008 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] Online |accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref> nevertheless, several battles and sieges took place, as Commonwealth troops refused to lay down their arms (most notably, in [[Tyniec]], [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]]).\n\nThe partition treaty was ratified by its signatories on September 22, 1772. [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II of Prussia]] was elated with his success; Prussia took most of German-speaking [[Royal Prussia]] (without [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]]) that stood between its possessions in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], as well as Ermland ([[Warmia]]), northern areas of [[Greater Poland]] along the [[Note\u0107]] River (the [[Netze District]]), and parts of [[Kujawy|Kuyavia]] (but not the city of [[Toru\u0144]]).<ref name=\"Brit\" /> Despite token criticism of the partition from Austrian Empress [[Maria Theresa]], Austrian statesman [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg]], was proud of wresting as large a share as he did, with the rich [[salt mining|salt mines]] of [[Bochnia]] and [[Wieliczka]]. To Austria fell [[Zator]] and Auschwitz ([[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]]), part of [[Lesser Poland]] embracing parts of the counties of [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Sandomierz|Sandomir]] and the whole of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], less the city of [[Krak\u00f3w]]. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine of Russia]] was also very satisfied. By this \"diplomatic document\" Russia came into possession of that section of [[Livonia]] that had remained in Commonwealth control, and of [[Belarus]] embracing the counties of [[Vitebsk]], [[Polotsk]] and [[Mstsislaw|Mstislavl]].<ref name=\"Brit\" />\n[[File:Rejtan Upadek Polski Matejko.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Rejtan (painting)|Rejtan at Sejm 1773]]'', oil on canvas by Jan Matejko, 1866, {{convert|282|x|487|cm|0|abbr=on}}, [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]]\n\nBy this partition, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 30% of its territory and half of its population<ref name=\"Brit\" /> (four million people), of which a large portion had not been ethnically Polish. By seizing northwestern Poland, Prussia instantly gained control over 80% of the Commonwealth's total foreign trade. Through levying enormous customs duties, Prussia accelerated the collapse of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book|last=von Guttner|first=Darius|title=The French Revolution|year=2015|publisher=Nelson Cengage|pages=139}}</ref>\n\nAfter having occupied their respective territories, the three partitioning powers demanded that King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw]] and the [[Sejm]] approve their action. When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to their will. The so-called [[Partition Sejm]], with Russian military forces threatening the opposition, on September 18, 1773, signed the treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories.\n\n=== Second Partition ===\n{{Main|Second Partition of Poland}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 2.png|thumb|300px|right|The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Second Partition (1793)]]\n\nBy 1790 the First Polish Republic had been weakened to such a degree that it was forced into an unnatural and terminal alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The [[Polish\u2013Prussian alliance|Polish\u2013Prussian Pact]] of 1790 was signed. The conditions of the Pact contributed to the subsequent final two partitions of Poland\u2013Lithuania.\n\nThe [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|May Constitution of 1791]] enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established the separation of the three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of the [[Repnin Sejm]]. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]] then at high tide in France, Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.\n\nIn the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792|War in Defense of the Constitution]], pro-Russian conservative Polish [[magnate]]s, the [[Targowica Confederation|Confederation of Targowica]], fought against Polish forces supporting the constitution, believing that Russians would help them restore the [[Golden Liberty]]. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, Polish pro-constitution forces, faced with Targowica units and the regular Russian army, were defeated. Prussia signed a treaty with Russia, agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked and both countries would receive chunks of Commonwealth territory. In 1793, deputies to the [[Grodno Sejm]], last Sejm of the Commonwealth, in the presence of the Russian forces, agreed to Russian territorial demands. In the Second Partition, Russia and Prussia helped themselves to enough land so that only one-third of the 1772 population remained in Poland. Prussia named its newly gained province [[South Prussia]], with [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]] (and later Warsaw) as the capital of the new province.\n\nTargowica confederates, who did not expect another partition, and the king, [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]], who joined them near the end, both lost much prestige and support. The reformers, on the other hand, were attracting increasing support, and in 1794 the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] began.\n\n=== Third Partition ===\n{{Main|Third Partition of Poland}}\nKosciuszko's ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes, but they eventually fell before the superior forces of the Russian Empire. The partitioning powers, seeing the increasing unrest in the remaining Commonwealth, decided to solve the problem by erasing any independent Polish state from the map. On 24 October 1795 their representatives signed a treaty, dividing the remaining territories of the Commonwealth between their three countries.\n\nThe Russian part included {{convert|120000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} and 1.2&nbsp;million people with [[Vilnius]], the Prussian part (new provinces of [[New East Prussia]] and [[New Silesia]]) {{convert|55000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} and 1&nbsp;million people with Warsaw, and the Austrian {{convert|47000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} with 1.2&nbsp;million and [[Lublin]] and Krak\u00f3w.\n\n== Summary ==\nWith regard to population, in the First Partition, Poland lost over four to five million citizens (about a third of its population of 14&nbsp;million before the partitions).<ref name=\"LukowskiZawadzki2001-96\">{{cite book |author1=Jerzy Lukowski |author2=W.

After his defeat and the implementation of the [[Congress of Vienna]] treaty in 1815, the Russian-dominated [[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom of Poland]] was created in its place. After the Congress, Russia gained a larger share of Poland (with [[Warsaw]]) and, after crushing [[November Uprising|an insurrection in 1831]], the Congress Kingdom's autonomy was abolished and Poles faced confiscation of property, deportation, forced military service, and the closure of their own universities. After the [[January Uprising|uprising of 1863]], [[Russification]] of Polish secondary schools was imposed and the literacy rate dropped dramatically. In the Austrian sector which now was called [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], Poles fared better and were allowed to have representation in Parliament and to form their own universities, and Krak\u00f3w with [[Lw\u00f3w|Lemberg]] (Lw\u00f3w/Lviv) became centers of Polish culture and education. Meanwhile, Prussia [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanized]] the entire school system of its Polish subjects, and had no more respect for Polish culture and institutions than the Russian Empire. In 1915 a [[client state]] of the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] was proposed and accepted by the [[Central Powers]] of World War I: the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916\u201318)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]]. After the end of World War I, the Central Powers' surrender to the [[Allies of World War I|Western Allies]], the chaos of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] finally allowed and helped the restoration of Poland's full independence after 123 years.\n\n== Fourth Partition ==\n[[File:Occupation of Poland 1939.png|right|thumb|250px|The partition of Poland according to [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|the German\u2013Soviet Pact]]; division of Polish territories in the years 1939\u20131941]]\nThe term \"Fourth Partition of Poland\" may refer to any subsequent division of Polish lands, including:\n* after the [[Napoleonic era]], the 1815 division of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]];\n* the 1832 incorporation of the \"[[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom]]\" into Russia, the 1846 incorporation of the [[Free City of Cracow|Republic of Krak\u00f3w]] into Austria, and the 1848 incorporation of the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] into Prussia; and\n* the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|1939 division of Poland]] between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] pursuant to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]].<ref name=\"Brecher\">{{cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Brecher |first2=Jonathan |last2=Wilkenfeld |title=A Study of Crisis |year=1997 |pages=255 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-10806-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&pg=PA255&dq=Zeligowski+state }}</ref>\nIf one accepts more than one of those events as partitions, fifth, sixth, and even seventh partitions can be counted, but these terms are very rare.
