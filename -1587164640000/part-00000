She then made history becoming one of the first few Black models to have been in a [[Prada]] runway show in Milan which made international headlines and was seen as some fashion insiders as an opening of doors for more models of color to work for international fashion brands who primarily cast Caucasian models.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/fashion/models/rnarciso/robertanarciso/|title=Roberta Narciso|website=New York}}</ref>\n\nMaria Borges was also scouted and trained by Cor\u00e9on and his team at the same time. Though she did not win the 2010 Elite Model Look Angola contest, she has become its most successful alumna.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/lifestyle/fashion-and-beauty/2018-08-18-african-model-maria-borges-is-smiling-her-way-to-success/|title=African model Maria Borges is smiling her way to success|website=TimesLIVE}}</ref> In 2011 she moved to [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] where she became a favorite model of several local designers and editorial creatives before she was hand-picked by [[Riccardo Tisci]] for an exclusive deal [[Givenchy]] which catapulted her into international stardom.  Since then Maria has cemented her career as one of a new generation of top international supermodels with a record number of participations in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, countless international campaigns and covers and a coveted brand ambassadorship with [[Riccardo Tisci]].\n\nIn 2011 he discovered Al\u00e9cia Morais in [[Cape Verde]] who made her debut at the last [[Paris Fashion Week]] show for [[Louis Vuitton]] [[with Marc Jacob]]s as creative director which is still one of the most visible young Cape Verdean female models in the industry with participations in numerous international runways and campaigns for the likes of [[Chanel]], [[Bobbi Brown]] Cosmetics, [[H&M]] [[Victoria's Secret]] Pink, and many more.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://models.com/models/Alecia-Morais|title=Al\u00e9cia Morais \u2013 Model|website=MODELS.com}}</ref>\n\nAngolan Amilna Estev\u00e3o scouted at the age of 14 in Angola, became the first Black model in 30 years to be in Elite Model Look World Final top 3 at the contest's World final in 2013 after having participated in the Angolan version of the contest. Amilna became a rising star from her first steps in fashion and continues to work steadily in fashion doing campaigns for brands such as [[Tom Ford]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Kenzo]], [[MAC Cosmetics]], [[The GAP]] and many more.<ref name=\"M\u00e1xima 2013\"/> Elite Model Look Angola 2013 was also the last produced by Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa who continues scouting for models, but parted ways with the contest.\n\nCor\u00e9on's most recent discovery Bl\u00e9snya Minher, from the [[Lunda Norte]] province of Angola, has given strong first steps in the fashion world debuting her career in style landing the Spring/Summer 2017 campaign with [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]] followed by an exclusive contract with [[Calvin Klein]] which ended spring of 2018.  She has since been in campaigns for [[Versace]] COACH, and announced an exclusive with Louis Vuitton for its Spring/Summer 2019 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lux.iol.ptmoda/04-10-2018/modelo-angolana-blesnya-minher-escolhida-para-exclusivo-com-louis-vuitton-em-paris|title=Modelo angolana Bl\u00e9snya Minher escolhida para exclusivo com Louis Vuitton em Paris!|website=Lux}}</ref>\n\nSome other notable modeling talents scouted and represented by Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa's Da Banda Model Management include model & [[influencer]] Rethabile 'Retha' Lethoko from South Africa, Angolan newcomer [[Sompa Antonnio]], Portuguese-Angolan model [[Elsa Baldaia]], Portuguese-Cape Verdian model Claudia Morais, South African Model [[Bianca Rentzke]], and Cheikh Mbunga who was recently one of the faces of the [[Coca-Cola]] Africa campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4ZPJMl0tQQ|title=Cover story &#124; Retha Lethoko \u2013 supermodel, entrepreneur, activist|date=May 15, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dabanda.com/|title=DA BANDA|website=DA BANDA}}</ref>\n \nOutside of the modeling world, Cor\u00e9on's mentoring and coaching talents have been notable in the market for quite some time. He's become known as somewhat of a star maker in Angola for his ability to take unknown talents from obscurity into stardom but also for transforming working professionals into stars.  Such was the case with model turned actor [[Freddy Costa]] who had been working as model and occasional soap opera actor in Angola until he started working closely and being mentored by Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa in 2009. The two collaborated professionally in 2004 when Cor\u00e9on was working in the wardrobe department of soap opera Sede de Viver and in previous local fashion weeks in Angola. However, in 2009, Costa started working closely with Cor\u00e9on having been the star of his first fictional short film Momentos de Gloria and later in his first international production [[Voo Directo]] for [[Radio and Television of Portugal|RTP]]. He continued to participate in the various actors' workshops and coaching sessions Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa organized at [[Semba Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o]] and his international career continued to take off after his roles in the [[International Emmy]] nominated [[Windeck]] and [[Jikulumessu]]. Through his role as production consultant for Portuguese telenovela [[A Unica Mulher]] for [[Grupo Prisa]] owned Portuguese TV channel [[Televis\u00e3o Independente (TVI)]], Costa was able to audition and land a role in the show which has led him to many more opportunities in the Portuguese market where he has become one of the most sought-after leading men.  After his participation in Cor\u00e9on's productions especially Windeck and Jikulumessu he has also participated in productions in Brazil, Nigeria and has made appearances all over Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3743721/|title=Freddy Costa|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly Cor\u00e9on has also been credited for mentoring [[Micaela Reis]]. The former Miss World Africa and Miss World runner up was motivated to start her acting career when Cor\u00e9on invited her to audition for RTP's Voo Directo. Her very first acting role surprised critics in Angola who often discriminated her talents due to her beauty pageant curriculum. Her role in Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa's Windeck has made her a star all over Africa and the African diaspora where she often is called \"Africa\u00b4s favorite villain\" for her role as Victoria Kajibanga the main villain of the show. She also participated in several Angolan and Portuguese theater productions before pursuing a bachelor's degree in acting and film-making at the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles and currently stars in the Portuguese FOX affiliate [[Mundo FOX]] series Maison Afrochic produced her Windeck colleagues Freddy Costa and Portuguese actress Grace Mendes .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://angorussia.com/entretenimento/micaela-reis-termina-licenciatura-artes-performativas-televisao-cinema-nos-eua/|title=Micaela Reis termina licenciatura em 'Artes Performativas \u2013 Televis\u00e3o e Cinema' nos EUA|date=June 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2669483/|title=Micaela Reis|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n[[Lesliana Pereira]] is another actor that credits Cor\u00e9on and his team's guidance for being instrumental to her professional growth.  After having won Miss Angola, she hosted a slew of infotainment programs. However, Pereira strived for more. She was asked to audition for Cor\u00e9on's production of the historical drama [[Njinga: Queen Of Angola]] ([[Njinga \u2013 Njinga: Rainha de Angola]]). According to an anecdote by the actress, Cor\u00e9on challenged her to start preparing for the role by removing her hair extensions and stop relaxing her hair which she claims was a shock at first, but really allowed her to connect with the essence of the character on a deeper level even before the production team provided her with additional acting coaching and training for the stunts and combat choreography she needed to perform as [[Queen Njinnga Mbandi]]. In addition to having done a cameo appearance at Cor\u00e9on's Jikulumessu, Lesliana Pereira has since then appeared in productions by Brazil's telenovela juggernaut [[Rede Globo]]. She has also been working as both host and producer on local Angolan television shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3079710/|title=Lesliana Pereira|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nCor\u00e9on D\u00fa's mentoring work has also been recognized by numerous local young TV professionalsfroberts, local dance and music artists in Angola who have participated in his various projects including Bounce, I Love Kuduro, Angola Encanta, Eu Na TV and others whose careers he has launched, many of whom still consider him a trusted professional advisor.\n\n==Creative relatives==\nAsides from the relatives in the world of music such as Liceu Vieira Dias, Beto Gourgel, Carlitos Vieira Dias, Andr\u00e9 Mingas, and Kizua Gourgel, Cor\u00e9on has several relatives from his generation and younger generations working in the creative world.\n\nHis maternal first cousins [[Glen Abrantes]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.okayafrica.com/style-2/angolan-male-model-glen-abrantes-boxfresh-josh-stika-pret-a-poundo//|title=Angolan Male Model Glen Abrantes For BoxFresh x Josh Stika|date=April 23, 2014|work=OkayAfrica|access-date=July 10, 2017}}</ref> and [[Emmanuel Abrantes]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesquadmanagement.com/men/new-faces/?modelId=3431&firstName=EMANUEL|title=Emanuel {{!}} New faces {{!}} The Squad|website=thesquadmanagement.com|access-date=July 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pictame.com/media/1190544701676209081_2318547191|title=Double trouble!

He later changed his name to make clear he does not desire any political connotations or confusion associated with his work and name.\n\nBefore the release of his first album in 2010 he briefly used the Jos\u00e9, and his full last name Paulino dos Santos dropping Eduardo from his first name.\n\nSince 2010 he has been using the name Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa exclusively in most of his professional and artistic work.\n\nPrior to the 1992 Angolan election, very few people used the name \"Z\u00e9 D\u00fa\" to refer to Mr. Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos (Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa's father, and second president of Angola). Election campaign marketers popularized this name since then and this branding of the name \"Z\u00e9 D\u00fa\" associated to Mr. Dos Santos has become a part of pop culture especially after Angola reached peace in 2002.\n\nCor\u00e9on D\u00fa has established himself as somewhat of an independent thinker focused on arts, empowerment of young Angolans with creative talent, as well as creating visibility opportunities for LGBTQ professionals locally and regionally.  As the \"black sheep\" of the Dos Santos family is often considered politically incorrect by the status quo. His lack of desire to associate himself with politics led to his name change, and remains politically neutral.  Speculators presume what his political affiliation may be, but Cor\u00e9on refuses to publicly endorse anything political as seen in his social media, Interviews / public statements and most public appearances.<ref>{{YouTube|fcBJaoPh91U |M\u00e3e do Cor\u00e9on D\u00f9 Dra.Maria Lu\u00ecsa Abrantes diz que Cor\u00e9on D\u00f9 j\u00e0 n\u00e3o quer ser chamado de Z\u00e9 D\u00f9}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\nThere have been critics of Cor\u00e9on and negative speculations have risen due to his father being the President of Angola, [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]].

He also recounts that most Angolan radio stations and DJs in his home country refuse to play his music, and most major concert promoters refuse to book him for shows. He only started gained visibility mainly through catchy songs that became favorites of Luanda taxi drivers and music pirates, and innovative music video concepts.  Though most speculated Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa was referring to independent or opposition owned media, Cor\u00e9on was also referring to state-owned media as well as private mainstream media and professionals.  Independent radio professionals and even DJs at [[Radio Despertar]] owned by one of Angola's large opposition parties have been claimed to be early supporters of Cor\u00e9on's music in their airwaves.

Though conservative viewers celebrated this, the fans of the showed voiced their discontent especially through social media.\n\nThis incident became headline news nationally and caught the attention of international media outlets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tetu.com/2015/02/05/news/angola-censure-dune-serie-apres-un-baiser-gay/ |title=Angola : censure d\u2019une s\u00e9rie apr\u00e8s un baiser gay|date=February 5, 2015|website=tetu.com|accessdate=February 12, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212164404/http://www.tetu.com/2015/02/05/news/angola-censure-dune-serie-apres-un-baiser-gay/ |archivedate=February 12, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-31128863 |title=Angolan TV producers apologise over gays kissing |work=BBC News |accessdate=February 17, 2016}}</ref> On February 5, 2015, TPA returned ''Jikulumessu'' to the air after fans pleas for its return.

The fabricated nature of the story was so evident, that his longtime fans showed, and social media commenters noticed this was simply another humorous meme shared by the artist and not a \"coming out\".\n\nCor\u00e9on D\u00fa does not often discuss his personal life often, however he never hid his sexuality. For over a decade he never ran away from participating in work that had LGBTQ representation and aesthetics, such as his work as costume designer / stylist for the 2004\u20132005 youth telenovela \"Sede de Viver\", with script written by acclaimed author Ondjaki, which had the first ever openly gay character on Angolan television played by actor-comedian Kitengo Kunga, and some of his later body of work in both the social and commercial sphere.

The program caused conservatives in Angola to complain that the show was perverting young minds, though the program was still popular. It featured psychologists, healthcare professionals, and other specialists answering questions from studio and street audiences, as well as local celebrities sharing personal stories about themes including infertility, relationships, sex toys, teen pregnancy, and STD prevention.\n\n== Political controversies ==\n\nIn recent international media interviews Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa has mentioned his choice to no longer live in Angola full-time since 2014 and indefinitely leaving his home-country in 2017 due to being a target of a growing institutionalized homophobia and increasing political intolerance.<ref name=\"advocate1\"/> When interviewed in 2019, by Portugal\u00b4s National News Agency LUSA, about new Angolan laws decriminalizing \"Acts against nature\" as being synonymous with decriminalizing LGBTQ+ relationships , he cautioned that these regulatory changes seemed vague and may have been publicity driven to appeal Angola\u00b4s vast young electorate of voters. However further real regulatory and social education initiatives were needed.  Within the same year, 2019, popular musician and LGBTQ+ rights advocate [[Titica]] announced publicly that Angola\u00b4s public government-owned broadcaster [[Televis\u00e3o P\u00fablica de Angola|TPA]] has forbidden her from being on any of their television programs because she is a transsexual person<ref name=\"angola-online1\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=SAPO |url=https://banda.sapo.ao/tv/atualidade-tv/artigos/titica-nao-posso-voltar-a-aparecer-na-tpa-por-ser-transexual |title=Titica: \"N\u00e3o posso voltar a aparecer na TPA por ser transexual\" \u2013 Atualidade \u2013 SAPO Banda |publisher=Banda.sapo.ao |date=November 7, 2019 |accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2017 and the present the election of Angola's new president, the new leader of the country and former vice president of the ruling party MPLA have started a veritable witch hunt against anyone with the \"Dos Santos\" last name including campaigns of public intimidation campaigns and now attempting to jail his older siblings who served in public companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://observador.pt/2018/03/29/isabel-dos-santos-queixa-se-de-caca-as-bruxas-em-angola/|title=Isabel dos Santos queixa-se de \"ca\u00e7a \u00e0s bruxas\" em Angola|first1=Ag\u00eancia|last1=Lusa|first2=Ag\u00eancia|last2=Lusa|website=Observador}}</ref> Despite Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa's father being a historic member of the party in question, the new leader of the country and MPLA have been running a large campaign against all the Dos Santos family, including Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa. Angola's leadership have vehemently denied any witch-hunts in all public press releases locally and internationally, however their actions consistently prove otherwise.  Following the new government's very public decision to end the content production and brand consulting agreements between public station TPA with Cor\u00e9on's company [[Semba Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o]], they invoked several false and contractually inaccurate allegations. The main allegations were that the channels were returning to the \"public ownership\" when they were always publicly owned and only using Semba's services. Semba never owned any of the three TPA channels, and has had to clarify many years its position as a service provider.\n\nAfter public dismay of the new programming and cancellation of some favourite television shows in January 2018 the Angolan Government's new leadership tried to save face and [[approval ratings]] by throwing Cor\u00e9on and his company under the bus. The company responded with a public statement clarifying its role and even how much it was earning for its content services in comparison to the publicly published yearly national television budget ( Semba produced most of the entertainment and promotional content for two of the three TPA channels reportedly charging under fees approximating only one-fifth of the budget spent on the main TPA channel).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angonoticias.com/Artigos/item/56716/semba-comunicacao-esclarece-fim-da-parceria-com-a-tpa|title=Semba Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o esclarece fim da parceria com a TPA|website=ANGONOT\u00cdCIAS}}</ref> To excuse their poor image quality and the embarrassment of being exposed the new government used all the national public media to announce that Semba had stolen the HD equipment previously used to make TPA's channel 2 and international channel programming, however many well known employees of the channel have all throughout the year posed and posted pictures boasting about exactly the same HD equipment having always been in TPA's studios and currently in use. To which the station and Ministry of Information and Propaganda of the country then made a public statement with the excuse the lack of image quality was due to a temporary technical difficulty that was soon to be resolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://angola-online.net/noticias/tpa-2-vai-melhorar-qualidade-de-imagem-nos-proximos-dias|title=TPA 2 vai melhorar qualidade de imagem nos pr\u00f3ximos dias|website=Angola-Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://club-k.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30672:luisa-abrantes-afirma-que-contrato-entre-semba-e-tpa-foi-a-convite-de-rabelais&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=1069&amp;lang=pt|title=Luisa Abrantes afirma que contrato entre Semba e TPA foi a convite de Rabelais|website=CLUB-K ANGOLA \u2013 Not\u00edcias Imparciais de Angola}}</ref> They alleged using a series of news stories and social media fake news campaigns that companies allegedly linked to Cor\u00e9on were receiving large sums of money to produce content for TPA, while for years there has been public knowledge of TPA's history of late or non-payments to Semba and many of its private sector vendors. There was even recent controversy involving the administration admitting that due to lower ratings they would need to rehire former Semba's former talent/ employees due to significantly lowered ratings after all Semba-produced content was taken of the TPA airwaves. This was followed by some protests by TPA employees claiming the decision to publicly shame the company and associated talent and then rehire talent individually has put the station in the position where they are now paying very expensive reparations to get that talent back.<ref>[http://vivaportal.co.ao/vp/2018/06/04/jose-guerreiro-irritado-com-fuga-de-informacao-na-tpa/]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\nNearly a year after Semba's content was taken of the air by their former client, a new market study has shown that TPA 2 had dropped from being in a leading position amongst viewers in primetime slots to the now being one of least viewed according to the market study reflecting the last quarter of 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://platinaline.com/tv-zimbo-televisao-vista-angola-marktest/|title=Tv Zimbo \u00e9 a televis\u00e3o Mais vista em Setembro diz marktest|first=Platina|last=Line|date=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the party in power has continued a very intense campaign now also using the famous micro-targeting and social media trolls trying to provoke the more right-wing conservative and religious homophobic population to turn against Cor\u00e9on by generating various blog and social media troll campaigns targeting Cor\u00e9on's sexuality and even having spreading a rumor that Cor\u00e9on was to wed a same-sex partner in Angola ( where same sex-unions are still illegal) in the year of 2018.  This is not a new campaign, as members of the ruling party of Angola similarly attempted to prove conservative public opinions against Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa and his company for several years due to his open support and inclusion of women's issues and LGBT issues in his work. A noteworthy case was the telenovela Jikulumessu which was pulled off the air by command of high-ranking government officials on the public broadcaster due to their non-negative portrayal of same sex relationships and of \"sexually liberated \" female characters ( also seen in a past incident when host of sex education TV show Sexolandia was refused membership to the ruling political party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://club-k.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4634:pedido-de-militancia-de-tatiana-durao-ao-mpla-rejeitado-pela-oma&amp;catid=8:bastidores&amp;Itemid=713&amp;lang=pt|title=Pedido de Milit\u00e2ncia de Tatiana Dur\u00e3o ao MPLA rejeitado pela OMA \u2013 v\u00eddeo|website=CLUB-K ANGOLA \u2013 Not\u00edcias Imparciais de Angola}}</ref>) Some infer that this move was not only to attempt to denigrate D\u00fa's image amongst the more conservative population, but also due to fear that especially the LGBT community would start to organize socially to advocate more aggressively for their civil rights.  This move by government officials failed, as TV viewers and social groups massively protested the decision to take the show off the air, and that move motivated LGBT activists who have become more vocal and active since that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dezanove.pt/queremos-a-igualdade-para-todas-as-868606|title=Queremos a igualdade para todas as minorias sexuais de Angola|website=dezanove.pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mambaonline.com/2019/03/26/wade-schaerer-no-shame-about-living-with-hiv/|title=Wade Schaerer \u2013 No shame about living with HIV|date=March 26, 2019|website=MambaOnline \u2013 Gay South Africa online}}</ref>\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homofobos.blogspot.com/2015/02/filhos-do-presidente-querem-lei.html|title=HOM\u00d3FOBO: Filhos do presidente querem lei homossexual.

The former Miss World Africa and Miss World runner up was motivated to start her acting career when Cor\u00e9on invited her to audition for RTP's Voo Directo. Her very first acting role surprised critics in Angola who often discriminated her talents due to her beauty pageant curriculum. Her role in Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa's Windeck has made her a star all over Africa and the African diaspora where she often is called \"Africa\u00b4s favorite villain\" for her role as Victoria Kajibanga the main villain of the show. She also participated in several Angolan and Portuguese theater productions before pursuing a bachelor's degree in acting and film-making at the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles and currently stars in the Portuguese FOX affiliate [[Mundo FOX]] series Maison Afrochic produced her Windeck colleagues Freddy Costa and Portuguese actress Grace Mendes .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://angorussia.com/entretenimento/micaela-reis-termina-licenciatura-artes-performativas-televisao-cinema-nos-eua/|title=Micaela Reis termina licenciatura em 'Artes Performativas \u2013 Televis\u00e3o e Cinema' nos EUA|date=June 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2669483/|title=Micaela Reis|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n[[Lesliana Pereira]] is another actor that credits Cor\u00e9on and his team's guidance for being instrumental to her professional growth.  After having won Miss Angola, she hosted a slew of infotainment programs. However, Pereira strived for more. She was asked to audition for Cor\u00e9on's production of the historical drama [[Njinga: Queen Of Angola]] ([[Njinga \u2013 Njinga: Rainha de Angola]]). According to an anecdote by the actress, Cor\u00e9on challenged her to start preparing for the role by removing her hair extensions and stop relaxing her hair which she claims was a shock at first, but really allowed her to connect with the essence of the character on a deeper level even before the production team provided her with additional acting coaching and training for the stunts and combat choreography she needed to perform as [[Queen Njinnga Mbandi]]. In addition to having done a cameo appearance at Cor\u00e9on's Jikulumessu, Lesliana Pereira has since then appeared in productions by Brazil's telenovela juggernaut [[Rede Globo]]. She has also been working as both host and producer on local Angolan television shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3079710/|title=Lesliana Pereira|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nCor\u00e9on D\u00fa's mentoring work has also been recognized by numerous local young TV professionalsfroberts, local dance and music artists in Angola who have participated in his various projects including Bounce, I Love Kuduro, Angola Encanta, Eu Na TV and others whose careers he has launched, many of whom still consider him a trusted professional advisor.\n\n==Creative relatives==\nAsides from the relatives in the world of music such as Liceu Vieira Dias, Beto Gourgel, Carlitos Vieira Dias, Andr\u00e9 Mingas, and Kizua Gourgel, Cor\u00e9on has several relatives from his generation and younger generations working in the creative world.\n\nHis maternal first cousins [[Glen Abrantes]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.okayafrica.com/style-2/angolan-male-model-glen-abrantes-boxfresh-josh-stika-pret-a-poundo//|title=Angolan Male Model Glen Abrantes For BoxFresh x Josh Stika|date=April 23, 2014|work=OkayAfrica|access-date=July 10, 2017}}</ref> and [[Emmanuel Abrantes]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesquadmanagement.com/men/new-faces/?modelId=3431&firstName=EMANUEL|title=Emanuel {{!}} New faces {{!}} The Squad|website=thesquadmanagement.com|access-date=July 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pictame.com/media/1190544701676209081_2318547191|title=Double trouble!

He later changed his name to make clear he does not desire any political connotations or confusion associated with his work and name.\n\nBefore the release of his first album in 2010 he briefly used the Jos\u00e9, and his full last name Paulino dos Santos dropping Eduardo from his first name.\n\nSince 2010 he has been using the name Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa exclusively in most of his professional and artistic work.\n\nPrior to the 1992 Angolan election, very few people used the name \"Z\u00e9 D\u00fa\" to refer to Mr. Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos (Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa's father, and second president of Angola). Election campaign marketers popularized this name since then and this branding of the name \"Z\u00e9 D\u00fa\" associated to Mr. Dos Santos has become a part of pop culture especially after Angola reached peace in 2002.\n\nCor\u00e9on D\u00fa has established himself as somewhat of an independent thinker focused on arts, empowerment of young Angolans with creative talent, as well as creating visibility opportunities for LGBTQ professionals locally and regionally.  As the \"black sheep\" of the Dos Santos family is often considered politically incorrect by the status quo. His lack of desire to associate himself with politics led to his name change, and remains politically neutral.  Speculators presume what his political affiliation may be, but Cor\u00e9on refuses to publicly endorse anything political as seen in his social media, Interviews / public statements and most public appearances.<ref>{{YouTube|fcBJaoPh91U |M\u00e3e do Cor\u00e9on D\u00f9 Dra.Maria Lu\u00ecsa Abrantes diz que Cor\u00e9on D\u00f9 j\u00e0 n\u00e3o quer ser chamado de Z\u00e9 D\u00f9}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\nThere have been critics of Cor\u00e9on and negative speculations have risen due to his father being the President of Angola, [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]].

He also recounts that most Angolan radio stations and DJs in his home country refuse to play his music, and most major concert promoters refuse to book him for shows. He only started gained visibility mainly through catchy songs that became favorites of Luanda taxi drivers and music pirates, and innovative music video concepts.  Though most speculated Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa was referring to independent or opposition owned media, Cor\u00e9on was also referring to state-owned media as well as private mainstream media and professionals.  Independent radio professionals and even DJs at [[Radio Despertar]] owned by one of Angola's large opposition parties have been claimed to be early supporters of Cor\u00e9on's music in their airwaves.

The program caused conservatives in Angola to complain that the show was perverting young minds, though the program was still popular. It featured psychologists, healthcare professionals, and other specialists answering questions from studio and street audiences, as well as local celebrities sharing personal stories about themes including infertility, relationships, sex toys, teen pregnancy, and STD prevention.\n\n== Political controversies ==\n\nIn recent international media interviews Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa has mentioned his choice to no longer live in Angola full-time since 2014 and indefinitely leaving his home-country in 2017 due to being a target of a growing institutionalized homophobia and increasing political intolerance.<ref name=\"advocate1\"/> When interviewed in 2019, by Portugal\u00b4s National News Agency LUSA, about new Angolan laws decriminalizing \"Acts against nature\" as being synonymous with decriminalizing LGBTQ+ relationships , he cautioned that these regulatory changes seemed vague and may have been publicity driven to appeal Angola\u00b4s vast young electorate of voters. However further real regulatory and social education initiatives were needed.  Within the same year, 2019, popular musician and LGBTQ+ rights advocate [[Titica]] announced publicly that Angola\u00b4s public government-owned broadcaster [[Televis\u00e3o P\u00fablica de Angola|TPA]] has forbidden her from being on any of their television programs because she is a transsexual person<ref name=\"angola-online1\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=SAPO |url=https://banda.sapo.ao/tv/atualidade-tv/artigos/titica-nao-posso-voltar-a-aparecer-na-tpa-por-ser-transexual |title=Titica: \"N\u00e3o posso voltar a aparecer na TPA por ser transexual\" \u2013 Atualidade \u2013 SAPO Banda |publisher=Banda.sapo.ao |date=November 7, 2019 |accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nBetween 2017 and the present the election of Angola's new president, the new leader of the country and former vice president of the ruling party MPLA have started a veritable witch hunt against anyone with the \"Dos Santos\" last name including campaigns of public intimidation campaigns and now attempting to jail his older siblings who served in public companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://observador.pt/2018/03/29/isabel-dos-santos-queixa-se-de-caca-as-bruxas-em-angola/|title=Isabel dos Santos queixa-se de \"ca\u00e7a \u00e0s bruxas\" em Angola|first1=Ag\u00eancia|last1=Lusa|first2=Ag\u00eancia|last2=Lusa|website=Observador}}</ref> Despite Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa's father being a historic member of the party in question, the new leader of the country and MPLA have been running a large campaign against all the Dos Santos family, including Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa. Angola's leadership have vehemently denied any witch-hunts in all public press releases locally and internationally, however their actions consistently prove otherwise.  Following the new government's very public decision to end the content production and brand consulting agreements between public station TPA with Cor\u00e9on's company [[Semba Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o]], they invoked several false and contractually inaccurate allegations. The main allegations were that the channels were returning to the \"public ownership\" when they were always publicly owned and only using Semba's services. Semba never owned any of the three TPA channels, and has had to clarify many years its position as a service provider.\n\nAfter public dismay of the new programming and cancellation of some favourite television shows in January 2018 the Angolan Government's new leadership tried to save face and [[approval ratings]] by throwing Cor\u00e9on and his company under the bus. The company responded with a public statement clarifying its role and even how much it was earning for its content services in comparison to the publicly published yearly national television budget ( Semba produced most of the entertainment and promotional content for two of the three TPA channels reportedly charging under fees approximating only one-fifth of the budget spent on the main TPA channel).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angonoticias.com/Artigos/item/56716/semba-comunicacao-esclarece-fim-da-parceria-com-a-tpa|title=Semba Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o esclarece fim da parceria com a TPA|website=ANGONOT\u00cdCIAS}}</ref> To excuse their poor image quality and the embarrassment of being exposed the new government used all the national public media to announce that Semba had stolen the HD equipment previously used to make TPA's channel 2 and international channel programming, however many well known employees of the channel have all throughout the year posed and posted pictures boasting about exactly the same HD equipment having always been in TPA's studios and currently in use. To which the station and Ministry of Information and Propaganda of the country then made a public statement with the excuse the lack of image quality was due to a temporary technical difficulty that was soon to be resolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://angola-online.net/noticias/tpa-2-vai-melhorar-qualidade-de-imagem-nos-proximos-dias|title=TPA 2 vai melhorar qualidade de imagem nos pr\u00f3ximos dias|website=Angola-Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://club-k.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30672:luisa-abrantes-afirma-que-contrato-entre-semba-e-tpa-foi-a-convite-de-rabelais&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=1069&amp;lang=pt|title=Luisa Abrantes afirma que contrato entre Semba e TPA foi a convite de Rabelais|website=CLUB-K ANGOLA \u2013 Not\u00edcias Imparciais de Angola}}</ref> They alleged using a series of news stories and social media fake news campaigns that companies allegedly linked to Cor\u00e9on were receiving large sums of money to produce content for TPA, while for years there has been public knowledge of TPA's history of late or non-payments to Semba and many of its private sector vendors. There was even recent controversy involving the administration admitting that due to lower ratings they would need to rehire former Semba's former talent/ employees due to significantly lowered ratings after all Semba-produced content was taken of the TPA airwaves. This was followed by some protests by TPA employees claiming the decision to publicly shame the company and associated talent and then rehire talent individually has put the station in the position where they are now paying very expensive reparations to get that talent back.<ref>[http://vivaportal.co.ao/vp/2018/06/04/jose-guerreiro-irritado-com-fuga-de-informacao-na-tpa/]{{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>\n\nNearly a year after Semba's content was taken of the air by their former client, a new market study has shown that TPA 2 had dropped from being in a leading position amongst viewers in primetime slots to the now being one of least viewed according to the market study reflecting the last quarter of 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://platinaline.com/tv-zimbo-televisao-vista-angola-marktest/|title=Tv Zimbo \u00e9 a televis\u00e3o Mais vista em Setembro diz marktest|first=Platina|last=Line|date=July 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the party in power has continued a very intense campaign now also using the famous micro-targeting and social media trolls trying to provoke the more right-wing conservative and religious homophobic population to turn against Cor\u00e9on by generating various blog and social media troll campaigns targeting Cor\u00e9on's sexuality and even having spreading a rumor that Cor\u00e9on was to wed a same-sex partner in Angola ( where same sex-unions are still illegal) in the year of 2018.  This is not a new campaign, as members of the ruling party of Angola similarly attempted to prove conservative public opinions against Cor\u00e9on D\u00fa and his company for several years due to his open support and inclusion of women's issues and LGBT issues in his work. A noteworthy case was the telenovela Jikulumessu which was pulled off the air by command of high-ranking government officials on the public broadcaster due to their non-negative portrayal of same sex relationships and of \"sexually liberated \" female characters ( also seen in a past incident when host of sex education TV show Sexolandia was refused membership to the ruling political party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://club-k.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4634:pedido-de-militancia-de-tatiana-durao-ao-mpla-rejeitado-pela-oma&amp;catid=8:bastidores&amp;Itemid=713&amp;lang=pt|title=Pedido de Milit\u00e2ncia de Tatiana Dur\u00e3o ao MPLA rejeitado pela OMA \u2013 v\u00eddeo|website=CLUB-K ANGOLA \u2013 Not\u00edcias Imparciais de Angola}}</ref>) Some infer that this move was not only to attempt to denigrate D\u00fa's image amongst the more conservative population, but also due to fear that especially the LGBT community would start to organize socially to advocate more aggressively for their civil rights.  This move by government officials failed, as TV viewers and social groups massively protested the decision to take the show off the air, and that move motivated LGBT activists who have become more vocal and active since that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dezanove.pt/queremos-a-igualdade-para-todas-as-868606|title=Queremos a igualdade para todas as minorias sexuais de Angola|website=dezanove.pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mambaonline.com/2019/03/26/wade-schaerer-no-shame-about-living-with-hiv/|title=Wade Schaerer \u2013 No shame about living with HIV|date=March 26, 2019|website=MambaOnline \u2013 Gay South Africa online}}</ref>\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homofobos.blogspot.com/2015/02/filhos-do-presidente-querem-lei.html|title=HOM\u00d3FOBO: Filhos do presidente querem lei homossexual.
