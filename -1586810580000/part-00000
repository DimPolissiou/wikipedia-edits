A famous example is Nightwish's cover of \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" from the album \"Century Child.\"\n\nDuring Nightwish's shows, Turunen would take a break halfway through the set. Before Hietala joined the band, the band would perform an instrumental song during this time. After Hietala joined the band, they performed covers of well-known songs, with Hietala singing the lead vocal part in this break. The band has performed [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s \"[[Crazy Train]]\", [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]'s \"Wild Child\", [[Dio (band)|Dio]]'s \"Don't Talk to Strangers\", [[Megadeth]]'s \"[[Symphony of Destruction]]\" and [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]\". Some of these songs have been put up for sale as well on various Nightwish album releases. Following Turunen's departure from Nightwish, Hietala was much more involved with the production of ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'', which was released in September 2007. He sang some songs, completely, and wrote the music for the song \"[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]\", on which he also plays acoustic guitar instead of bass. Hietala is also credited alongside [[Tuomas Holopainen|Holopainen]] for co-writing the song \"[[The Crow, the Owl and the Dove]]\" from Nightwish's 2011 album, ''[[Imaginaerum]]''.\n\nIn [[Delain]], Hietala played bass for the album ''[[Lucidity (album)|Lucidity]]'' and was also the main male vocalist on the album with featured vocals on the song ''The Gathering''. He is also featured as vocalist in two of the songs on [[Delain]]'s second album ''[[April Rain]]'' and two songs from [[Delain]]'s fourth album ''[[The Human Contradiction]]''.\n\nIn March 2009, Hietala joined the band [[Sapattivuosi]]. They cover [[Black Sabbath]] songs in Finnish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122574 |title=Marco Hietala's Black Sabbath Tribute Band To Play in Poland |date=June 25, 2009 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]] |accessdate=March 19, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In this band, however, Hietala does not play bass; he only performs vocals.\n\nOn 1 April 2010 it was said that Hietala would leave the band to concentrate on a [[choir]] career.  This was identified as an April Fool's joke, but was also a reference to his participation in ''Kuorosota'' (the localized Finnish version of ''[[Clash of the Choirs]]'') in 2010.  Hietala was the master of the [[Kuopio]] choir in the program's second season.  He came second in the contest, losing in the finals to the [[Joensuu]] choir, headed by pop rock singer [[Ilkka Alanko]].  Tarot's single \"I Walk Forever,\" from the ''[[Gravity of Light (Tarot album)|Gravity of Light]]'' album, was performed for the first time by Hietala, [[Tommi Salmela|Tommi \"Tuple\" Salmela]] and the Kuopio choir during Kuorosota 2010; other songs performed included \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]],\" which Hietala has covered with Nightwish as well.\n\nIn June 2010, Hietala joined the heavy metal supergroup HAIL! on two occasions, performing [[Black Sabbath]]'s [[Neon Knights]] with [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens|Ripper Owens]], [[Andreas Kisser]], [[James LoMenzo]] and [[Paul Bostaph]] at two of their shows in [[Finland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HAIL!

He also owns a Warwick Buzzard JE with a rusty finish equipped with a detuner (Used, among others, in the music videoes for Elan and Endless Forms Most Beautiful), and a Kramer bass. He uses Warwick's Hellborg amplifier and cabs. After joining Nightwish he used a SansAmp GT2 distortion pedal for some time. \u00a8\u00a8\n\nHietala also uses a custom made Warwick/Framus doubleneck bass/electric guitar, based on the Warwick Infinity.\n\nFrom Century Child until the End of an Era Hietala used an Infinity almost exclusively for live and studio applications. Later, the Vampyre became his axe of choice (almost for the whole period with Anette as Nightwish's vocalist). The first time he can be seen with a Vampyre is the Bye Bye Beautiful music video. From the Imaginaerum tour going forward Buzzard became his preferred brand, but occasionally he still can be seen with an Infinity.\n\n==Influences==\nHietala has stated that the biggest influence on him as a bassist is [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Bob Daisley]], while [[Ronnie James Dio]] and [[Rob Halford]] are his biggest influence as a vocalist. He has also stated that he listens to wide array of music ranging from \"really sensitive stuff to a lot of really hard stuff\", saying that he \"tend[s] to soak up almost everything\" which \"somehow ends up being used\" when he writes his own music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaQgZtMjhVE|title=Marco Hietala interview|date=July 5, 2009|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wingsofdarkness.net/php/profile_marco.php |title=~ Wings of Darkness ~ The Official Tarot Website |publisher=Wingsofdarkness.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>\n{{cquote|''How is your musical taste towards metal music / other genres?''|author=Question on the official Tarot website (2006)}}\n{{cquote|''Anything works for me, if it's good enough.

A famous example is Nightwish's cover of \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" from the album \"Century Child.\"\n\nDuring Nightwish's shows, Turunen would take a break halfway through the set. Before Hietala joined the band, the band would perform an instrumental song during this time. After Hietala joined the band, they performed covers of well-known songs, with Hietala singing the lead vocal part in this break. The band has performed [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s \"[[Crazy Train]]\", [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]'s \"Wild Child\", [[Dio (band)|Dio]]'s \"Don't Talk to Strangers\", [[Megadeth]]'s \"[[Symphony of Destruction]]\" and [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]\". Some of these songs have been put up for sale as well on various Nightwish album releases. Following Turunen's departure from Nightwish, Hietala was much more involved with the production of ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'', which was released in September 2007. He sang some songs, completely, and wrote the music for the song \"[[The Islander (song)|The Islander]]\", on which he also plays acoustic guitar instead of bass. Hietala is also credited alongside [[Tuomas Holopainen|Holopainen]] for co-writing the song \"[[The Crow, the Owl and the Dove]]\" from Nightwish's 2011 album, ''[[Imaginaerum]]''.\n\nIn [[Delain]], Hietala played bass for the album ''[[Lucidity (album)|Lucidity]]'' and was also the main male vocalist on the album with featured vocals on the song ''The Gathering''. He is also featured as vocalist in two of the songs on [[Delain]]'s second album ''[[April Rain]]'' and two songs from [[Delain]]'s fourth album ''[[The Human Contradiction]]''.\n\nIn March 2009, Hietala joined the band [[Sapattivuosi]]. They cover [[Black Sabbath]] songs in Finnish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122574 |title=Marco Hietala's Black Sabbath Tribute Band To Play in Poland |date=June 25, 2009 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]] |accessdate=March 19, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In this band, however, Hietala does not play bass; he only performs vocals.\n\nOn 1 April 2010 it was said that Hietala would leave the band to concentrate on a [[choir]] career.  This was identified as an April Fool's joke, but was also a reference to his participation in ''Kuorosota'' (the localized Finnish version of ''[[Clash of the Choirs]]'') in 2010.  Hietala was the master of the [[Kuopio]] choir in the program's second season.  He came second in the contest, losing in the finals to the [[Joensuu]] choir, headed by pop rock singer [[Ilkka Alanko]].  Tarot's single \"I Walk Forever,\" from the ''[[Gravity of Light (Tarot album)|Gravity of Light]]'' album, was performed for the first time by Hietala, [[Tommi Salmela|Tommi \"Tuple\" Salmela]] and the Kuopio choir during Kuorosota 2010; other songs performed included \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]],\" which Hietala has covered with Nightwish as well.\n\nIn June 2010, Hietala joined the heavy metal supergroup HAIL! on two occasions, performing [[Black Sabbath]]'s [[Neon Knights]] with [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens|Ripper Owens]], [[Andreas Kisser]], [[James LoMenzo]] and [[Paul Bostaph]] at two of their shows in [[Finland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HAIL!

He also owns a Warwick Buzzard JE with a rusty finish equipped with a detuner (Used, among others, in the music videoes for Elan and Endless Forms Most Beautiful), and a Kramer bass. He uses Warwick's Hellborg amplifier and cabs. After joining Nightwish he used a SansAmp GT2 distortion pedal for some time. \u00a8\u00a8\n\nHietala also uses a custom made Warwick/Framus doubleneck bass/electric guitar, based on the Warwick Infinity.\n\nFrom Century Child until the End of an Era Hietala used an Infinity almost exclusively for live and studio applications. Later, the Vampyre became his axe of choice (almost for the whole period with Anette as Nightwish's vocalist). The first time he can be seen with a Vampyre is the Bye Bye Beautiful music video. From the Imaginaerum tour going forward Buzzard became his preferred brand, but occasionally he still can be seen with an Infinity.\n\n==Influences==\nHietala has stated that the biggest influence on him as a bassist is [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Bob Daisley]], while [[Ronnie James Dio]] and [[Rob Halford]] are his biggest influence as a vocalist. He has also stated that he listens to wide array of music ranging from \"really sensitive stuff to a lot of really hard stuff\", saying that he \"tend[s] to soak up almost everything\" which \"somehow ends up being used\" when he writes his own music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaQgZtMjhVE|title=Marco Hietala interview|date=July 5, 2009|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wingsofdarkness.net/php/profile_marco.php |title=~ Wings of Darkness ~ The Official Tarot Website |publisher=Wingsofdarkness.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}</ref>\n{{cquote|''How is your musical taste towards metal music / other genres?''|author=Question on the official Tarot website (2006)}}\n{{cquote|''Anything works for me, if it's good enough.

A long process of development and financing began in 2005, with filming commencing in April 2010.\n\n[[Tilda Swinton]] stars as the mother of Kevin, struggling to come to terms with her son and the horrors he has committed. The film premiered at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] and was released in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2011.\n\nSwinton was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] for Best Actress in a Leading Role. It received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences alike.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenager Kevin Khatchadourian is in prison after committing a [[massacre]] at his high school. His mother, Eva, once a successful [[travel writer]], lives alone in a rundown house and works in a travel agency near the prison, where she visits Kevin. She looks back at her memories of him growing up as she tries to cope with the hostility of her neighbors. \n\nKevin is detached and difficult from childhood. He appears to loathe and deliberately antagonize Eva, and she has trouble bonding with him. As a baby, he cries incessantly, but only around her; as a child, he resists [[toilet training]], rebuffs Eva's attempts at affection, and shows no interest in anything. He behaves like a happy, loving son when his father Franklin is watching. Eva's frustration drives her to throw Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm. Kevin tells Franklin he fell, using the incident to manipulate Eva into doing what he wants.\n\nFranklin dismisses Eva's concerns and makes excuses for Kevin's behavior. When Kevin is confined to bed with a fever, Eva reads him a book about [[Robin Hood]]; when Robin competes in [[John, King of England|Prince John]]'s archery contest, Kevin shows Eva affection for the first time. Franklin gives him a [[bow and arrow]] and teaches him [[archery]].\n\nEva and Franklin have a second child, Celia, who is lively and cheerful. However, Kevin is disdainful and jealous. A few years later, Celia's pet guinea pig is killed and she is blinded in one eye by caustic cleaning fluid. Eva suspects Kevin is to blame, but Franklin defends him. Eva's suspicion strains the couple's marriage and they discuss divorce. Eva comes to fear her son, as she sees growing evidence of Kevin's sadism.\n\nAs a teenager, Kevin locks several students in the school gymnasium and murders them with his bow. When Eva arrives home, she finds Kevin has murdered Franklin and Celia. On the second anniversary of the massacre, Eva visits Kevin in prison. Eva asks him why he committed the murders. Kevin, who is about to be transferred to an adult prison, responds that he used to think he knew but is no longer sure. Eva hugs Kevin and walks away sadly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Eva Khatchadourian\n* [[John C.

A long process of development and financing began in 2005, with filming commencing in April 2010.\n\n[[Tilda Swinton]] stars as the mother of Kevin, struggling to come to terms with her son and the horrors he has committed. The film premiered at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] and was released in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2011.\n\nSwinton was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild]], and the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] for Best Actress in a Leading Role. It received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences alike.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenager Kevin Khatchadourian is in prison after committing a [[massacre]] at his high school. His mother, Eva, once a successful [[travel writer]], lives alone in a rundown house and works in a travel agency near the prison, where she visits Kevin. She looks back at her memories of him growing up as she tries to cope with the hostility of her neighbors. \n\nKevin is detached and difficult from childhood. He appears to loathe and deliberately antagonize Eva, and she has trouble bonding with him. As a baby, he cries incessantly, but only around her; as a child, he resists [[toilet training]], rebuffs Eva's attempts at affection, and shows no interest in anything. He behaves like a happy, loving son when his father Franklin is watching. Eva's frustration drives her to throw Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm. Kevin tells Franklin he fell, using the incident to manipulate Eva into doing what he wants.\n\nFranklin dismisses Eva's concerns and makes excuses for Kevin's behavior. When Kevin is confined to bed with a fever, Eva reads him a book about [[Robin Hood]]; when Robin competes in [[John, King of England|Prince John]]'s archery contest, Kevin shows Eva affection for the first time. Franklin gives him a [[bow and arrow]] and teaches him [[archery]].\n\nEva and Franklin have a second child, Celia, who is lively and cheerful. However, Kevin is disdainful and jealous. A few years later, Celia's pet guinea pig is killed and she is blinded in one eye by caustic cleaning fluid. Eva suspects Kevin is to blame, but Franklin defends him. Eva's suspicion strains the couple's marriage and they discuss divorce. Eva comes to fear her son, as she sees growing evidence of Kevin's sadism.\n\nAs a teenager, Kevin locks several students in the school gymnasium and murders them with his bow. When Eva arrives home, she finds Kevin has murdered Franklin and Celia. On the second anniversary of the massacre, Eva visits Kevin in prison. Eva asks him why he committed the murders. Kevin, who is about to be transferred to an adult prison, responds that he used to think he knew but is no longer sure. Eva hugs Kevin and walks away sadly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Eva Khatchadourian\n* [[John C.
