She was the first US Navy vessel to bear the name 'Concord' and was so named after the town of [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] for its role at the beginning of the [[American Revolution]]. The vessel had a [[tonnage]] of 700. The ''Concord'' had a complement of 190 officers and seamen with an armament of 20 guns and saw service protecting American merchant ships and other interests in several places around the world. The ship and her crew, who also functioned as [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], fought in the [[Seminole Wars]] in Florida.

The sloop type provoked dissatisfaction, due to the [[Board of Navy Commissioners|navy board's]] insistence that they be made to carry 24 guns, despite their dimensions making them better suited to carrying 20 guns. They were criticized for being slow, due in part to their full after body and often being overloaded, a practice typical of vessels in a navy during peace time.

Because of the extreme shortage of trained soldiers in the territory a Commodore [[Alexander J. Dallas (U.S. Navy officer)|Alexander J. Dallas]] agreed to provide crewmen from the ''Concord'' to assist in the fighting against the [[Seminole Indians]]. In January 1837, some 50 men, including 10 marines, from the ''Concord's'' crew under the command of Lieutenant [[Thomas J. Leib]] were sent north from [[Tampa]] to the newly completed [[Fort Foster]] at the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]] Bridge to relieve the troops of the [[garrison]] there so they could search the surrounding swamps for the Seminoles who had been harassing the fort and other locations in the area.

Because of the extreme shortage of trained soldiers in the territory a Commodore [[Alexander J. Dallas (U.S. Navy officer)|Alexander J. Dallas]] agreed to provide crewmen from the ''Concord'' to assist in the fighting against the [[Seminole Indians]]. In January 1837, some 50 men, including 10 marines, from the ''Concord's'' crew under the command of Lieutenant [[Thomas J. Leib]] were sent north from [[Tampa]] to the newly completed [[Fort Foster]] at the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]] Bridge to relieve the troops of the [[garrison]] there so they could search the surrounding swamps for the Seminoles who had been harassing the fort and other locations in the area. The crewmen served there for three months, and then returned to the ''Concord'' where they set sail west to the Mexican coast to protect American shipping interests there.<ref name=\"Chapelle\"/><ref name=\"W.W.Norton\">{{cite web |url=http://members.cox.net/tdshiflett/ships/data/sow/concord_sow.html |title=Concord |publisher=W.W.

Boerum was replaced by Lieutenant J. M. Gardner, who decided that the situation was hopeless, and consequently the ''Concord'' was abandoned by the remainder of her crew. Gardner then chartered the Portuguese [[brig]] ''Unao'' to take the crew of the ''Concord'' to [[Rio de Janeiro]].
