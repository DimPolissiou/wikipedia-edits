At the airport he is greeted by his uncle, Karl Hummel ([[Massimo Girotti]]), who invites him to stay at his house. Peter learns from Karl that his great-grandfather, Baron Otto Von Kleist, nicknamed \"Baron Blood\", was a notorious sadist who tortured and murdered over 100 villagers. Legend says he burned a witch named Elizabeth H\u00f6lle, who cursed him with a spell that would allow him to rise from the dead so she could take her revenge on him again and again. The Baron's old castle and former residence is being remodeled into a hotel for tourists. Peter persuades his uncle to take him to the castle. \n\nAt the castle, they meet Herr Dortmund (Dieter Tressler), the entrepreneur responsible for the hotel project, and Eva ([[Elke Sommer]]), a former college student of Karl, whose job is to ensure Dortmundt does not make any lasting changes to the castle's architecture. After a tour of the castle, Karl invites Eva to his house for dinner. During the meal, Peter brings up the subject of Baron Von Kleist. Gretchen (Nicoletta Elmi), Karl's young daughter, claims to have seen the Baron in the woods near the castle, but nobody listens to her. Peter produces an ancient document he found at his grandfather's house back in America. It is an incantation which, if read in the castle bell tower at midnight, will supposedly bring the Baron back to life.\n\nAgainst Karl's warnings, Peter and Eva go to the castle and read the incantation. Although it is midnight, the bell tolls two o'clock, the same time Baron Von Kleist was murdered. Heavy footsteps approach from outside. Eva implores Peter to recant the incantation, using the alternate spell on the same document. But a gust of wind blows the parchment into a fireplace. Peter goes outside to investigate, but there is no one there.\n\nIn the woods surrounding the castle, the Baron emerges from his grave and visits a doctor's office. The doctor (Gustavo De Nardo) dresses his wounds. When the doctor insists on calling an ambulance, the Baron grabs a scalpel and stabs him to death.\n\nThe next morning, Peter and Eva admit what they've done. Karl insists they are imagining things and tells them to forget about it. The Baron secretly enters his castle and kills Dortmundt, hanging him from the castle ceiling. When the body is found by Fritz ([[Luciano Pigozzi]]), the caretaker of the castle, the Baron kills him. With Dortmundt dead, the plans for restoring the castle fall through and the property goes up for auction.\n\nThe next day, the castle is purchased by Alfred Becker ([[Joseph Cotten]]), a millionaire who uses a wheelchair. He offers Eva a job in assisting him to restore the castle to its original condition. She gladly accepts. Later, Eva is attacked in one of the castle corridors by the Baron. She is saved by the intrusion of Peter. Eva quits her job and decides to make a fresh start elsewhere.\n\nThat evening, Eva returns to her apartment in town, only to find the Baron waiting for her. She escapes through a window and seeks shelter at Karl's home. Finally convinced that the Baron is alive, Karl agrees to help Eva and Peter find a way to destroy him. They visit Christina ([[Rada Rassimov]]), a local medium, who conjures H\u00f6lle's spirit from the netherworld for information about the Baron. Christina gives them a magic amulet and tells them that the ones who raised the Baron are the only ones who can destroy him. Because of this, he will do everything in his power to kill Peter and Eva. After Peter, Eva and Karl leave, Christina is killed by the Baron.\n\nOn her way home from school, Gretchen is terrorized by the Baron, who chases her though the woods. Returning to the castle, Gretchen meets Becker for the first time. She tells her father that Becker is the Baron; she recognizes his eyes. Karl, Peter and Eva confront Becker. He shows them the restored castle, complete with dummies impaled on stakes. Becker rises from his wheelchair and knocks out Peter, Karl, and Eva. He then takes them to his torture chamber.\n\nWhen Eva wakes up, she is tied to a chair and sees Fritz's dead body in the open spike-lined coffin beside her. Becker ties up Karl to a [[Rack (torture)|rack]], while he tortures Peter with red-hot pokers. As Eva struggles to untie herself, she accidentally drops the amulet onto Fritz's body. A few drops of Eva's blood from her wounds land on Fritz's body and the amulet. The secret of how to destroy the Baron comes to light: the Baron's victims all rise from their coffins, empowered by the magic amulet and the blood of the ones who raised him. The undead victims attack the Baron and rip him apart. Eva unties Peter and Karl, and the trio flee from the castle, while the Baron's dying screams and H\u00f6lle's laughter echo into the night air.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Baron Otto von Kleist/Alfred Becker\n* [[Elke Sommer]] as Eva Arnold\n* [[Massimo Girotti]] as Dr. Karl Hummel\n* [[Rada Rassimov]] as Christina Hoffmann/Elizabeth H\u00f6lle\n* [[Antonio Cantafora]] as Peter Kleist\n* [[Umberto Raho]] (as Humi Raho) as Inspector\n* [[Luciano Pigozzi]] (as Alan Collins) as Fritz\n* Nicoletta Elmi as Gretchen Hummel\n\n==Style and themes==\nIn his analysis of the film, Danny Shipka noted how the film reflects Bava's disillusion towards society and all its members.{{sfn|Shipka|2011|p=51}}\n\n==Production==\n''Baron Blood'' originated as a screenplay written by Vincent G. Fotre, a professional [[tennis]] player who dabbled in writing movies.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=872}} The screenplay was acquired by independent producer Jerry Briskin, who showed it to Alfredo Leone in hopes he would be interested in co-producing it. Leone greatly liked the script and saw it as an opportunity to work with director [[Mario Bava]] again after their first collaboration, ''[[Four Times That Night]]'', had turned out disastrously.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=872-3}} Leone had turned down an offer from Bava to produce ''[[Hatchet for the Honeymoon]]'',{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=809}} but felt ''Baron Blood'' to be a more appropriate vehicle for Bava. When Briskin proved unable to meet his end of the production deal, Leone took on sole control of the project.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=872}} Bava initially turned down Leone's offer because one of the production associates had set the condition that the movie be filmed in one or more of the castles located in [[Vienna]], and he was resolved to remain in Italy. However, with his career on the wane, he ultimately became resigned that a better offer than ''Baron Blood'' was unlikely to come along in the foreseeable future.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=873}} \n\n''Baron Blood'' marked the return of Bava to the horror genre, six years after ''[[Kill, Baby... Kill!]]''.{{sfn|Shipka|2011|p=51}} Leone handled the casting,{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=876}} though Nicoletta Elmi, who had appeared in Bava's earlier film ''[[Twitch of the Death Nerve]]'', was cast at Bava's request.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=878}}\n\nThe film began shooting in 1971, which included location work at the Austrian castle [[Burg Kreuzenstein]].{{sfn|Hughes|2011|p=97}}{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=54}} According to Leone, Bava was so excited by the castle's filming possibilities that when Leone told him he had secured the deal to use the castle, Bava embraced and kissed him.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=873}} The film's credited cinematographer is [[Antonio Rinaldi (cinematographer)|Antonio Rinaldi]], although producer Alfredo Leone stated that Bava took over cinematography for the film,{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=53}}{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=56}} with Rinaldi handling the [[second unit]] shots.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=879}} To satisfy a distributor's agreement, most of the film's violent scenes were filmed twice, one for theatrical release and one for television, with the violence being toned down in the television version.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=881-2}}\n\nOne week into filming, ''Baron Blood'' faced a financial crisis as the [[Bank of America]] cancelled their agreement to discount Leone's [[letter of credit]] in response to the [[Nixon shock]]. To solve the issue, Leone flew to New York to secure funding of $125,000 from J. Arthur Elliot and Sam Lang.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=879-881}}\n\nDespite the film's complicated and contradicting writing credits across different countries, Leone has maintained that the script is almost entirely Fotre's work; Mario Bava and William Bairn's contributions were minimal, while \"Wilibald Eser\" is a fictional person presumably credited to satisfy the Italian/German co-production agreement.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=883}}\n\n==Release==\n''Baron Blood'' was released in Italy, where it was distributed by Jumbo Cinematografica, on 25 February 1972.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221234833/https://allmovie.com/movie/baron-blood-v153768|url=https://allmovie.com:80/movie/baron-blood-v153768|accessdate=August 14, 2017|last=Firsching|first=Robert|website=AllMovie |archivedate=21 December 2012|title=Baron Blood|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=53}} The film grossed a total of 269,812,000 [[Italian lire]], which Italian film historian Roberto Curti described as \"mediocre\".{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=56}}\n\n''Baron Blood'' was acquired for release in the United States by [[American International Pictures]], which cut the film by ten minutes and replaced [[Stelvio Cipriani]]'s score with one by [[Les Baxter]].{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=19}} The American print of the film also credits the screenplay to Vincent Fotre and William A.

At the airport he is greeted by his uncle, Karl Hummel ([[Massimo Girotti]]), who invites him to stay at his house. Peter learns from Karl that his great-grandfather, Baron Otto Von Kleist, nicknamed \"Baron Blood\", was a notorious sadist who tortured and murdered over 100 villagers. Legend says he burned a witch named Elizabeth H\u00f6lle, who cursed him with a spell that would allow him to rise from the dead so she could take her revenge on him again and again. The Baron's old castle and former residence is being remodeled into a hotel for tourists. Peter persuades his uncle to take him to the castle. \n\nAt the castle, they meet Herr Dortmund (Dieter Tressler), the entrepreneur responsible for the hotel project, and Eva ([[Elke Sommer]]), a former college student of Karl, whose job is to ensure Dortmundt does not make any lasting changes to the castle's architecture. After a tour of the castle, Karl invites Eva to his house for dinner. During the meal, Peter brings up the subject of Baron Von Kleist. Gretchen (Nicoletta Elmi), Karl's young daughter, claims to have seen the Baron in the woods near the castle, but nobody listens to her. Peter produces an ancient document he found at his grandfather's house back in America. It is an incantation which, if read in the castle bell tower at midnight, will supposedly bring the Baron back to life.\n\nAgainst Karl's warnings, Peter and Eva go to the castle and read the incantation. Although it is midnight, the bell tolls two o'clock, the same time Baron Von Kleist was murdered. Heavy footsteps approach from outside. Eva implores Peter to recant the incantation, using the alternate spell on the same document. But a gust of wind blows the parchment into a fireplace. Peter goes outside to investigate, but there is no one there.\n\nIn the woods surrounding the castle, the Baron emerges from his grave and visits a doctor's office. The doctor (Gustavo De Nardo) dresses his wounds. When the doctor insists on calling an ambulance, the Baron grabs a scalpel and stabs him to death.\n\nThe next morning, Peter and Eva admit what they've done. Karl insists they are imagining things and tells them to forget about it. The Baron secretly enters his castle and kills Dortmundt, hanging him from the castle ceiling. When the body is found by Fritz ([[Luciano Pigozzi]]), the caretaker of the castle, the Baron kills him. With Dortmundt dead, the plans for restoring the castle fall through and the property goes up for auction.\n\nThe next day, the castle is purchased by Alfred Becker ([[Joseph Cotten]]), a millionaire who uses a wheelchair. He offers Eva a job in assisting him to restore the castle to its original condition. She gladly accepts. Later, Eva is attacked in one of the castle corridors by the Baron. She is saved by the intrusion of Peter. Eva quits her job and decides to make a fresh start elsewhere.\n\nThat evening, Eva returns to her apartment in town, only to find the Baron waiting for her. She escapes through a window and seeks shelter at Karl's home. Finally convinced that the Baron is alive, Karl agrees to help Eva and Peter find a way to destroy him. They visit Christina ([[Rada Rassimov]]), a local medium, who conjures H\u00f6lle's spirit from the netherworld for information about the Baron. Christina gives them a magic amulet and tells them that the ones who raised the Baron are the only ones who can destroy him. Because of this, he will do everything in his power to kill Peter and Eva. After Peter, Eva and Karl leave, Christina is killed by the Baron.\n\nOn her way home from school, Gretchen is terrorized by the Baron, who chases her though the woods. Returning to the castle, Gretchen meets Becker for the first time. She tells her father that Becker is the Baron; she recognizes his eyes. Karl, Peter and Eva confront Becker. He shows them the restored castle, complete with dummies impaled on stakes. Becker rises from his wheelchair and knocks out Peter, Karl, and Eva. He then takes them to his torture chamber.\n\nWhen Eva wakes up, she is tied to a chair and sees Fritz's dead body in the open spike-lined coffin beside her. Becker ties up Karl to a [[Rack (torture)|rack]], while he tortures Peter with red-hot pokers. As Eva struggles to untie herself, she accidentally drops the amulet onto Fritz's body. A few drops of Eva's blood from her wounds land on Fritz's body and the amulet. The secret of how to destroy the Baron comes to light: the Baron's victims all rise from their coffins, empowered by the magic amulet and the blood of the ones who raised him. The undead victims attack the Baron and rip him apart. Eva unties Peter and Karl, and the trio flee from the castle, while the Baron's dying screams and H\u00f6lle's laughter echo into the night air.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Baron Otto von Kleist/Alfred Becker\n* [[Elke Sommer]] as Eva Arnold\n* [[Massimo Girotti]] as Dr. Karl Hummel\n* [[Rada Rassimov]] as Christina Hoffmann/Elizabeth H\u00f6lle\n* [[Antonio Cantafora]] as Peter Kleist\n* [[Umberto Raho]] (as Humi Raho) as Inspector\n* [[Luciano Pigozzi]] (as Alan Collins) as Fritz\n* Nicoletta Elmi as Gretchen Hummel\n\n==Style and themes==\nIn his analysis of the film, Danny Shipka noted how the film reflects Bava's disillusion towards society and all its members.{{sfn|Shipka|2011|p=51}}\n\n==Production==\n''Baron Blood'' originated as a screenplay written by Vincent G. Fotre, a professional [[tennis]] player who dabbled in writing movies.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=872}} The screenplay was acquired by independent producer Jerry Briskin, who showed it to Alfredo Leone in hopes he would be interested in co-producing it. Leone greatly liked the script and saw it as an opportunity to work with director [[Mario Bava]] again after their first collaboration, ''[[Four Times That Night]]'', had turned out disastrously.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=872-3}} Leone had turned down an offer from Bava to produce ''[[Hatchet for the Honeymoon]]'',{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=809}} but felt ''Baron Blood'' to be a more appropriate vehicle for Bava. When Briskin proved unable to meet his end of the production deal, Leone took on sole control of the project.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=872}} Bava initially turned down Leone's offer because one of the production associates had set the condition that the movie be filmed in one or more of the castles located in [[Vienna]], and he was resolved to remain in Italy. However, with his career on the wane, he ultimately became resigned that a better offer than ''Baron Blood'' was unlikely to come along in the foreseeable future.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=873}} \n\n''Baron Blood'' marked the return of Bava to the horror genre, six years after ''[[Kill, Baby... Kill!]]''.{{sfn|Shipka|2011|p=51}} Leone handled the casting,{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=876}} though Nicoletta Elmi, who had appeared in Bava's earlier film ''[[Twitch of the Death Nerve]]'', was cast at Bava's request.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=878}}\n\nThe film began shooting in 1971, which included location work at the Austrian castle [[Burg Kreuzenstein]].{{sfn|Hughes|2011|p=97}}{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=54}} According to Leone, Bava was so excited by the castle's filming possibilities that when Leone told him he had secured the deal to use the castle, Bava embraced and kissed him.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=873}} The film's credited cinematographer is [[Antonio Rinaldi (cinematographer)|Antonio Rinaldi]], although producer Alfredo Leone stated that Bava took over cinematography for the film,{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=53}}{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=56}} with Rinaldi handling the [[second unit]] shots.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=879}} To satisfy a distributor's agreement, most of the film's violent scenes were filmed twice, one for theatrical release and one for television, with the violence being toned down in the television version.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=881-2}}\n\nOne week into filming, ''Baron Blood'' faced a financial crisis as the [[Bank of America]] cancelled their agreement to discount Leone's [[letter of credit]] in response to the [[Nixon shock]]. To solve the issue, Leone flew to New York to secure funding of $125,000 from J. Arthur Elliot and Sam Lang.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=879-881}}\n\nDespite the film's complicated and contradicting writing credits across different countries, Leone has maintained that the script is almost entirely Fotre's work; Mario Bava and William Bairn's contributions were minimal, while \"Wilibald Eser\" is a fictional person presumably credited to satisfy the Italian/German co-production agreement.{{sfn|Lucas|2007|p=883}}\n\n==Release==\n''Baron Blood'' was released in Italy, where it was distributed by Jumbo Cinematografica, on 25 February 1972.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221234833/https://allmovie.com/movie/baron-blood-v153768|url=https://allmovie.com:80/movie/baron-blood-v153768|accessdate=August 14, 2017|last=Firsching|first=Robert|website=AllMovie |archivedate=21 December 2012|title=Baron Blood|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=53}} The film grossed a total of 269,812,000 [[Italian lire]], which Italian film historian Roberto Curti described as \"mediocre\".{{sfn|Curti|2017|p=56}}\n\n''Baron Blood'' was acquired for release in the United States by [[American International Pictures]], which cut the film by ten minutes and replaced [[Stelvio Cipriani]]'s score with one by [[Les Baxter]].{{sfn|Smith|2009|p=19}} The American print of the film also credits the screenplay to Vincent Fotre and William A.

Situated about 70 milion light years, it is a member of the [[Eridanus cluster]] of galaxies, a cluster of about 200 galaxies. It is also the brightest member of the [[NGC 1332 Group]]. It was discovered by [[William Herschel]] on 9 December 1784.\n\nNGC 1332 has a [[Hubble classification]] of E, which indicates it is an elliptical galaxy. It is moving from away from the [[Milky Way]] at a rate of 1,553&nbsp;km/s. Its size on the night sky is 4.5' x 1.4' which is proportional to its real size of the 92 000 ly.\n\nNGC 1332 is an early-type galaxy. Despite their name, early-type galaxies are much older than spiral galaxies, and mostly comprise old, red-colored stars. Very little star formation occurs in these galaxies; the lack of star formation in elliptical galaxies appears to start at the center and then slowly propagates outward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/29123-ancient-galaxies-die-inside-out.html|website=space.com|title=Colossal Ancient Galaxies Die from the Inside Out|author1=Howell, Elizabeth|date=2015|accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Black hole ==\nNGC 1332 is known by its possessing a [[supermassive black hole]] at the center.

Situated about 70 milion light years, it is a member of the [[Eridanus cluster]] of galaxies, a cluster of about 200 galaxies. It is also the brightest member of the [[NGC 1332 Group]]. It was discovered by [[William Herschel]] on 9 December 1784.\n\nNGC 1332 has a [[Hubble classification]] of E, which indicates it is a elliptical galaxy. It is moving from away from the [[Milky Way]] at a rate of 1,553 km/s. Its size on the night sky is 4.5' x 1.4' which is proportional to its real size of the 92 000 ly.\n\nNGC 1332 is an early-type galaxy. Despite their name, early-type galaxies are much older than spiral galaxies, and mostly comprise old, red-colored stars. Very little star formation occurs in these galaxies; the lack of star formation in elliptical galaxies appears to start at the center and then slowly propagates outward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/29123-ancient-galaxies-die-inside-out.html|website=space.com|title=Colossal Ancient Galaxies Die from the Inside Out|author1=Howell, Elizabeth|date=2015|accessdate=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Black hole ==\nNGC 1332 is known by its possesing a [[supermassive black hole]] at the center.

The longitudinal motion consists of two distinct oscillations, a long-period oscillation called a [[phugoid]] mode and a short-period oscillation referred to as the short-period mode.\n\n===Phugoid (longer period) oscillations===\n{{main|Phugoid}}\nThe longer period mode, called the \"phugoid mode\" is the one in which there is a large-amplitude variation of air-speed, pitch angle, and altitude, but almost no angle-of-attack variation. The phugoid oscillation is a slow interchange of [[kinetic energy]] (velocity) and [[potential energy]] (height) about some equilibrium energy level as the aircraft attempts to re-establish the equilibrium level-flight condition from which it had been disturbed. The motion is so slow that the effects of [[inertia]] forces and damping forces are very low. Although the damping is very weak, the period is so long that the pilot usually corrects for this motion without being aware that the oscillation even exists. Typically the period is 20\u201360 seconds. This oscillation can generally be controlled by the pilot.\n\n===Short period oscillations===\nWith no special name, the shorter period mode is called simply the \"short-period mode\".  The short-period mode is a usually heavily damped oscillation with a period of only a few seconds. The motion is a rapid pitching of the aircraft about the center of gravity, essentially an angle-of-attack variation. The time to damp the amplitude to one-half of its value is usually on the order of 1 second. Ability to quickly self damp when the stick is briefly displaced is one of the many criteria for general aircraft [[type certificate|certification]].\n\n==Lateral-directional modes==\n\"Lateral-directional\" modes involve rolling motions and yawing motions.  Motions in one of these axes almost always couples into the other so the modes are generally discussed as the \"lateral-directional modes\".<ref>\"Lateral\" is used although the rolling motions are about the ''longitudinal'' axis</ref>\n\nThere are three types of possible lateral-directional dynamic motion: roll subsidence mode, spiral mode, and Dutch roll mode.\n\n===Roll subsidence mode===\nRoll subsidence mode is simply the damping of rolling motion.  There is no direct aerodynamic moment created tending to directly restore wings-level, i.e. there is no returning \"spring force/moment\" proportional to roll angle.  However, there is a damping moment (proportional to roll ''rate'') created by the slewing-about of long wings.  This prevents large roll rates from building up when roll-control inputs are made or it damps the roll ''rate'' (not the angle) to zero when there are no roll-control inputs.\n\nRoll mode can be improved by [[Dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral]] effects coming from design characteristics, such as high wings, dihedral angles or sweep angles.\n\n===Dutch roll mode===\n{{main|Dutch roll}}\nThe second lateral motion is an oscillatory combined roll and yaw motion called Dutch roll, perhaps because of its similarity to an ice-skating motion of the same name made by Dutch skaters; the origin of the name is unclear. The Dutch roll may be described as a yaw and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and a yaw and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on. The period is usually on the order of 3\u201315 seconds, but it can vary from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Damping is increased by large directional stability and small dihedral and decreased by small directional stability and large dihedral. Although usually stable in a normal aircraft, the motion may be so slightly damped that the effect is very unpleasant and undesirable. In swept-back wing aircraft, the Dutch roll is solved by installing a [[yaw damper]], in effect a special-purpose automatic pilot that damps out any yawing oscillation by applying rudder corrections. Some swept-wing aircraft have an unstable Dutch roll. If the Dutch roll is very lightly damped or unstable, the yaw damper becomes a safety requirement, rather than a pilot and passenger convenience. Dual yaw dampers are required and a failed yaw damper is cause for limiting flight to low altitudes, and possibly lower [[Mach number|Mach]] numbers, where the Dutch roll stability is improved.\n\n=== Spiral divergence ===\n\nSpiraling is inherent. Most aircraft trimmed for straight-and-level flight, if flown stick-fixed, will eventually develop a tightening spiral-dive.<ref>Perkins, Courtland; Hage, Robert (1949). ''Airplane performance stability and control''. John Wiley and Sons. p. 431. {{ISBN|0-471-68046-X}}</ref> If a spiral dive is entered unintentionally, the result can be fatal.\n\nA spiral dive is not a spin; it starts, not with a stall or from torque but with a random, increasing roll and airspeed.  Without prompt intervention by the pilot, this can lead to structural failure of the [[airframe]], either as a result of excess [[Load factor (aeronautics)|aerodynamic loading]] or flight into terrain.  The aircraft initially gives little indication that anything has changed. The pilot's \"down\" sensation continues to be with respect to the bottom of the airplane, although the aircraft actually has increasingly rolled off the true vertical.  Under [[Visual flight rules|VFR]] conditions, the pilot corrects for this deviation from level automatically using the true horizon, while it is very small; but in IMC or dark conditions it can go unnoticed: the roll will increase and the lift, no longer vertical, is insufficient to support the airplane.  The nose drops and speed increases: the spiral dive has begun.\n\n====The forces involved====\n\nSay the roll is to the right.  A sideslip develops, resulting in a slip-flow which is right-to-left.  Now examine the resulting forces one at a time, calling any rightward influence yaw-in, leftward yaw-out, or roll-in or -out, whichever applies.  The slip-flow will:\n\n* push the fin, rudder, and other side areas aft of c.g. to the left, causing a right yaw-in,\n* push side areas ahead of the c.g. to the left, causing a left yaw-out,\n* push the right wingtip up, the left down, a left roll-out owing to the dihedral angle,\n* cause the left wing to go faster, the right wing slower, a roll-in,\n* push the side areas of the aircraft above the c.g. to the left, a roll-out,\n* push the side areas of the aircraft below the c.g. to the left, a roll-in,\n\nAlso, an aerodynamic force is imposed by the relative vertical positions of the fuselage and the wings, creating a roll-in leverage if the fuselage is above the wings, as in a low wing configuration; or roll-out if below, as in a high-wing configuration.\n\nA propeller rotating under power will influence the airflow passing it. Its effect depends on throttle setting (high at high rpm, low at low) and the attitude of the aircraft.\n\nThus, a spiral dive results from the netting-out of many forces depending partly on the design of the aircraft, partly on its attitude, and partly on its throttle setting (a susceptible design will spiral dive under power but may not in the glide).\n\n====Recovery ====\n\nA diving aircraft has more kinetic energy (which varies as the square of speed) than when straight-and-level.  To get back to straight-and-level, the recovery must get rid of this excess energy safely.  The sequence is:  Power all off; level the wings to the horizon or, if horizon has been lost, to the instruments; reduce speed using gentle back-pressure on the controls until a desired speed is reached; level off and restore power. The pilot should be alert to a pitch up tendency as the aircraft is rolled to wings level.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aircraft flight mechanics]]\n*[[Visual flight]]\n*[[Aeronautics]]\n*[[Flight dynamics]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aircraft Dynamic Modes}}\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=December 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}\nThe dynamic stability of an aircraft refers to how the aircraft behaves after it has been disturbed following steady non-oscillating flight.<ref>Etkin, Bernard; Dynamics of Flight; 1982; {{ISBN|0-471-08936-2}}\n</ref>\n\n==Longitudinal modes==\n[[Oscillating]] motions can be described by two parameters, the period of time required for one complete oscillation, and the time required to damp to half-amplitude, or the time to double the [[amplitude]] for a dynamically unstable motion.

The phugoid oscillation is a slow interchange of [[kinetic energy]] (velocity) and [[potential energy]] (height) about some equilibrium energy level as the aircraft attempts to re-establish the equilibrium level-flight condition from which it had been disturbed. The motion is so slow that the effects of [[inertia]] forces and damping forces are very low. Although the damping is very weak, the period is so long that the pilot usually corrects for this motion without being aware that the oscillation even exists. Typically the period is 20\u201360 seconds. This oscillation can generally be controlled by the pilot.\n\n===Short period oscillations===\nWith no special name, the shorter period mode is called simply the \"short-period mode\".  The short-period mode is a usually heavily damped oscillation with a period of only a few seconds. The motion is a rapid pitching of the aircraft about the center of gravity. The period is so short that the speed does not have time to change, so the oscillation is essentially an angle-of-attack variation. The time to damp the amplitude to one-half of its value is usually on the order of 1 second. Ability to quickly self damp when the stick is briefly displaced is one of the many criteria for general aircraft [[type certificate|certification]].\n\n==Lateral-directional modes==\n\"Lateral-directional\" modes involve rolling motions and yawing motions.  Motions in one of these axes almost always couples into the other so the modes are generally discussed as the \"lateral-directional modes\".<ref>\"Lateral\" is used although the rolling motions are about the ''longitudinal'' axis</ref>\n\nThere are three types of possible lateral-directional dynamic motion: roll subsidence mode, spiral mode, and Dutch roll mode.\n\n===Roll subsidence mode===\nRoll subsidence mode is simply the damping of rolling motion.  There is no direct aerodynamic moment created tending to directly restore wings-level, i.e. there is no returning \"spring force/moment\" proportional to roll angle.  However, there is a damping moment (proportional to roll ''rate'') created by the slewing-about of long wings.  This prevents large roll rates from building up when roll-control inputs are made or it damps the roll ''rate'' (not the angle) to zero when there are no roll-control inputs.\n\nRoll mode can be improved by [[Dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral]] effects coming from design characteristics, such as high wings, dihedral angles or sweep angles.\n\n===Dutch roll mode===\n{{main|Dutch roll}}\nThe second lateral motion is an oscillatory combined roll and yaw motion called Dutch roll, perhaps because of its similarity to an ice-skating motion of the same name made by Dutch skaters; the origin of the name is unclear. The Dutch roll may be described as a yaw and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and a yaw and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on. The period is usually on the order of 3\u201315 seconds, but it can vary from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Damping is increased by large directional stability and small dihedral and decreased by small directional stability and large dihedral. Although usually stable in a normal aircraft, the motion may be so slightly damped that the effect is very unpleasant and undesirable. In swept-back wing aircraft, the Dutch roll is solved by installing a [[yaw damper]], in effect a special-purpose automatic pilot that damps out any yawing oscillation by applying rudder corrections. Some swept-wing aircraft have an unstable Dutch roll. If the Dutch roll is very lightly damped or unstable, the yaw damper becomes a safety requirement, rather than a pilot and passenger convenience. Dual yaw dampers are required and a failed yaw damper is cause for limiting flight to low altitudes, and possibly lower [[Mach number|Mach]] numbers, where the Dutch roll stability is improved.\n\n=== Spiral divergence ===\n\nSpiraling is inherent. Most aircraft trimmed for straight-and-level flight, if flown stick-fixed, will eventually develop a tightening spiral-dive.<ref>Perkins, Courtland; Hage, Robert (1949). ''Airplane performance stability and control''. John Wiley and Sons. p. 431. {{ISBN|0-471-68046-X}}</ref> If a spiral dive is entered unintentionally, the result can be fatal.\n\nA spiral dive is not a spin; it starts, not with a stall or from torque but with a random, increasing roll and airspeed.  Without prompt intervention by the pilot, this can lead to structural failure of the [[airframe]], either as a result of excess [[Load factor (aeronautics)|aerodynamic loading]] or flight into terrain.  The aircraft initially gives little indication that anything has changed. The pilot's \"down\" sensation continues to be with respect to the bottom of the airplane, although the aircraft actually has increasingly rolled off the true vertical.  Under [[Visual flight rules|VFR]] conditions, the pilot corrects for this deviation from level automatically using the true horizon, while it is very small; but in IMC or dark conditions it can go unnoticed: the roll will increase and the lift, no longer vertical, is insufficient to support the airplane.  The nose drops and speed increases: the spiral dive has begun.\n\n====The forces involved====\n\nSay the roll is to the right.  A sideslip develops, resulting in a slip-flow which is right-to-left.  Now examine the resulting forces one at a time, calling any rightward influence yaw-in, leftward yaw-out, or roll-in or -out, whichever applies.  The slip-flow will:\n\n* push the fin, rudder, and other side areas aft of c.g. to the left, causing a right yaw-in,\n* push side areas ahead of the c.g. to the left, causing a left yaw-out,\n* push the right wingtip up, the left down, a left roll-out owing to the dihedral angle,\n* cause the left wing to go faster, the right wing slower, a roll-in,\n* push the side areas of the aircraft above the c.g. to the left, a roll-out,\n* push the side areas of the aircraft below the c.g. to the left, a roll-in,\n\nAlso, an aerodynamic force is imposed by the relative vertical positions of the fuselage and the wings, creating a roll-in leverage if the fuselage is above the wings, as in a low wing configuration; or roll-out if below, as in a high-wing configuration.\n\nA propeller rotating under power will influence the airflow passing it. Its effect depends on throttle setting (high at high rpm, low at low) and the attitude of the aircraft.\n\nThus, a spiral dive results from the netting-out of many forces depending partly on the design of the aircraft, partly on its attitude, and partly on its throttle setting (a susceptible design will spiral dive under power but may not in the glide).\n\n====Recovery ====\n\nA diving aircraft has more kinetic energy (which varies as the square of speed) than when straight-and-level.  To get back to straight-and-level, the recovery must get rid of this excess energy safely.  The sequence is:  Power all off; level the wings to the horizon or, if horizon has been lost, to the instruments; reduce speed using gentle back-pressure on the controls until a desired speed is reached; level off and restore power. The pilot should be alert to a pitch up tendency as the aircraft is rolled to wings level.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aircraft flight mechanics]]\n*[[Visual flight]]\n*[[Aeronautics]]\n*[[Flight dynamics]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aircraft Dynamic Modes}}\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n", "name_user": "David Lloyd-Jones", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eShort period oscillations:unnecessary \"The period is so short that the speed does not have time to change, so the oscillation is\" removed.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_dynamic_modes"}

Kicking in a locked door is also sometimes attempted or performed by neighbors and ordinary passers-by who witness an emergency situation such as a house that is on fire (though the first step should always be to call [[emergency services]]) in order to ensure that everyone is out of the house or to notify/assist anyone who is not.

Of the available shotgun ammunition, [[shotgun slug]]s pose the highest risk, as they will retain significant energy to cause lethal wounds well after they have penetrated the door. Buckshot is far safer and [[birdshot]] even more so, as the multiple small projectiles disperse quickly after penetration, reducing the chances of causing a lethal wound.

Depending on the situation, explosive breaching is potentially slower than a ballistic breach due to the large standoff required when using explosives, if there is no cover available.<ref name=fm7-8 /> Breaching can be performed with a specially formed breaching charge placed in contact with the door, or with various standoff breaching devices, such as specialized [[rifle grenade]]s like the [[SIMON breach grenade]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ausa.org/publications/armymagazine/archive/2007/4/Documents/SA_0407.pdf |date=April 2007 |title=M100 Grenade Rifle Entry Munition |author=Scott R.

Explosive breaching charges can range from highly focused methods, such as [[Detonating cord|detcord]], [[plastic explosives]], or strip shaped charges that explosively cut through doors or latches, to large [[satchel charge]]s, containing 20 pounds (9&nbsp;kg) of [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]], that can breach even [[reinforced concrete]] [[bunker]]s.<ref name=fm_8>{{cite book |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-06-11/ch8.htm |title=FM 3-06-11 |publisher=US Army}} Table 8-7, Summary of breaching charges</ref>\n\n=== Thermal ===\nThermal breaching is one of the least common techniques and also one of the slowest.
