She is the recipient of a [[Golden Globe Award]] and has been nominated for two [[Academy Awards]], a [[BAFTA Award]], and four [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\nAfter Ryder's film debut in  ''[[Lucas (film)|Lucas]]'' (1986), she gained attention with her performance in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988). She further rose to prominence with major roles in ''[[Heathers]]'' (1988), ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'' (1990), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990) and ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992). She garnered critical acclaim and two consecutive [[Academy Award]] nominations for her portrayals of socialite May Welland in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]'' (1993) and [[Jo March]] in the film adaptation of ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]'' (1994). Her other films during this period were ''[[Reality Bites]]'' (1994), '' [[How to Make an American Quilt]]'' (1995), ''[[The Crucible (1996 film)|The Crucible]]'' (1996), ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1999), and ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' (1999), which she also executive produced.\n\nIn 2002, Ryder appeared in the critically panned box office hit ''[[Mr. Deeds]]'', after which her career declined and she took a break from films. In 2009, she returned in the high-profile film ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]''. In 2010, she was nominated for two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]]: as the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie|lead actress]] in ''[[When Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story]]'' and as part of the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture|cast]] of ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sagawards.org/awards/nominees-and-recipients/17th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards|title=The 17th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards|publisher=[[Screen Actors Guild]]|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}</ref> She also reunited with Burton for ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]'' (2012). Since 2016, she has starred as a single mother in the [[Netflix]] science fiction series ''[[Stranger Things]]'', for which she has received [[74th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] and [[23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild]] nominations, and in 2020, she starred in the [[HBO]] drama miniseries ''[[The Plot Against America (miniseries)|The Plot Against America]]'' based on the [[Philip Roth]] novel. \n\nRyder's personal life has attracted significant media attention.

She is the recipient of a [[Golden Globe Award]] and has been nominated for two [[Academy Awards]], a [[BAFTA Award]], and four [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].\n\nAfter Ryder's film debut in  ''[[Lucas (film)|Lucas]]'' (1986), she gained attention with her performance in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988). She further rose to prominence with major roles in ''[[Heathers]]'' (1988), ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'' (1990), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990) and ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992).

{"title_page": "Single-player video game", "text_new": "{{short description|Video game that permits only one player}}\n{{pp-pc|small=yes}}\n{{More footnotes|date=July 2019}}\nA '''single-player video game''' is a [[video game]] where input from only one player is expected throughout the course of the gaming session. A single-player game is usually a game that can only be played by one person, while \"single-player mode\" is usually a [[game mode]] designed to be played by a single-player, though the game also contains multi-player modes.<ref>{{cite book  | last1 = Oosterhu | last2 = Feireiss | first2 = Lukas  | title = The Architecture Co-laboratory: Game Set and Match II : on Computer Games, Advanced Geometries, and Digital Technologies | publisher = Delft University of Technology | location = Delft | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXBdOoZ-faYC&pg=RA2-PA108&dq=single+player+simulations#PRA2-PA108,M1 | date = March 2006 | page = 180 | isbn = 9789059730366}}</ref>\n\nMost modern [[console game]]s and [[arcade game]]s are designed so that they can be played by a single player; although many of these games have modes that allow two or more players tGTAo play (not necessarily simultaneously), very few actually require more than one player for the game to be played. The ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' series is one example of such.<ref>\"Unreal Tournament 3 Single-player Campaign Preview.\" Unreal Tournament 3 Single-player Campaign Pr. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2013.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest video games, such as ''[[Tennis for Two]]'' (1958), ''[[Spacewar!]]'' (1962), and ''[[Pong]]'' (1972), were symmetrical games designed to be played by two players. Single-player games gained popularity only after this, with early titles such as ''[[Tomohiro Nishikado#Speed Race|Speed Race]]'' (1974)<ref>\"Speed Race.\" (Game). N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2013.</ref> and ''[[Space Invaders]]'' (1978).\n\nThe reason for this, according to [[Raph Koster]], is down to a combination of several factors: increasingly sophisticated computers and interfaces that enabled [[asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] gameplay, [[cooperative gameplay]] and story delivery within a gaming framework, coupled with the fact that the majority of early games players had introverted personality types (according to the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator|Myers-Briggs personality type indicator]]).<ref name='RaphKoster'>{{cite web | url = http://www.raphkoster.com/2006/02/10/are-single-player-games-doomed | title = Are single-player games doomed? | accessdate = 2013-02-25 | last = Koster | first = Raph | authorlink = Raph Koster | date = 10 Feb 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130208222638/http://www.raphkoster.com/2006/02/10/are-single-player-games-doomed | archivedate = 8 Feb 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlthough most modern games incorporate a single-player element either as the core or as one of several game modes, single-player gaming is currently viewed by the [[video game industry]] as peripheral to the future of gaming, with [[Electronic Arts]] vice president [[Frank Gibeau]] stating in 2012 that he had not approved one game to be developed as a single-player experience.<ref name='CVG'>{{cite news | title = Is single-player gaming under-threat? | date = 28 Oct 2012 | publisher = [[Future plc]] | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/374796/features/is-single-player-gaming-under-threat/ | work = Computer and Video Games | accessdate = 2013-02-25}}</ref>\n\nThe question of the financial viability of single-player [[AAA (video gaming)|AAA]] games was raised following the closure of [[Visceral Games]] by [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) in October 2017. Visceral had been a studio that established itself on a strong narrative single-player focus with ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'', and had been working on a single-player, linear narrative ''[[Star Wars]]'' game at the time of the closure; EA announced following this that they would be taking the game in a different direction, specifically \"a broader experience that allows for more variety and player agency\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-17-ea-has-shut-down-visceral-games | title = EA has shut down Visceral Games | first = Matt | last= Wales | date = October 17, 2017 | accessdate = October 17, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> Many commentators felt that EA made the change as they did not have confidence that a studio with an AAA-scale budget could produce a viable single-player game based on the popular ''Star Wars'' franchise. Alongside this, as well as relatively poor sales of games in the year prior that were principally AAA single-player games (''[[Resident Evil 7]]'', ''[[Prey (2017 video game)|Prey]]'', ''[[Dishonored 2]]'', and ''[[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided]]'') against financially successful multiplayer games and those offer a games-as-a-service model (''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', ''[[Destiny 2]]'', and ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront 2]]''), were indicators to many that the single-player model for AAA was waning.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/18/16491188/ea-star-wars-visceral-games-single-player  |title = EA\u2019s Star Wars \u2018pivot\u2019 is a vote of no confidence in single-player games | first =Samit | last = Sarkar | date = October 18, 2017 | accessdate = October 20, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/307836/Does_Viscerals_closure_prove_AAA_singleplayer_games_are_dying.php | title = Does Visceral's closure prove AAA single-player games are dying? | author = Staff | date = October 19, 2017 | accessdate = October 20, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/59dn78/todays-star-wars-news-makes-the-future-of-single-player-look-very-messy | title = Today's Star Wars News Makes the Future of Single-Player Look Very Messy | first=  Patrick |last= Klepek |date = October 17, 2017 | accessdate = October 20, 2017 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref><ref name=\"usgamer history\">{{cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-visceral-games|  title = The Rise and Fall of Visceral Games | first = Caty | last = McCarthy | date = October 19, 2017 | accessdate = October 20, 2017 | work  = [[US Gamer]] }}</ref> Manveer Heir, who had left EA after finishing his gameplay design work for ''[[Mass Effect Andromeda]]'', acknowledged that the culture within EA was against the development of single-player games, and with Visceral's closure, \"that the linear single-player triple-A game at EA is dead for the time being\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-23-manveer-heir-bioware-mass-effect-ea-monetisation | title = \"I've seen people literally spend $15,000 on Mass Effect multiplayer cards\" | first = Robert | last = Purchase | date = October 23, 2017 | accessdate = October 23, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> [[Bethesda Softworks|Bethesda]] in December 7, 2017, decided to collaborate with [[Lynda Carter]] to launch a Public Safety Announcement to save single-player gaming.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-kicks-off-a-save-player-1-sale-for-its-single-player-games/ | title = \"Bethesda kicks off a 'Save Player 1' sale for its single-player games\" | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date = December 7, 2017 | accessdate = December 14, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n==Game elements==\nAs the narrative and conflict in single-player gameplay is created by a computer rather than a human opponent, single-player games are able to deliver certain gaming experiences that are typically absent - or de-emphasised - in multiplayer games.<ref>\"ThomasDaPsycho.\" : Video Game Story Elements. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2013.</ref>\n\n===Story===\nSingle-player games rely more heavily on compelling stories to draw the player into the experience and to create a sense of investment. Humans are unpredictable, so human players - allies or enemies - cannot be relied upon to carry a narrative in a particular direction, and so multiplayer games tend not to focus heavily on a linear narrative.

A single-player game is usually a game that can only be played by one person, while \"single-player mode\" is usually a [[game mode]] designed to be played by a single-player, though the game also contains multi-player modes.<ref>{{cite book  | last1 = Oosterhu | last2 = Feireiss | first2 = Lukas  | title = The Architecture Co-laboratory: Game Set and Match II : on Computer Games, Advanced Geometries, and Digital Technologies | publisher = Delft University of Technology | location = Delft | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXBdOoZ-faYC&pg=RA2-PA108&dq=single+player+simulations#PRA2-PA108,M1 | date = March 2006 | page = 180 | isbn = 9789059730366}}</ref>\n\nMost modern [[console game]]s and [[arcade game]]s are designed so that they can be played by a single player; although many of these games have modes that allow two or more players to play (not necessarily simultaneously), very few actually require more than one player for the game to be played. The ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' series is one example of such.<ref>\"Unreal Tournament 3 Single-player Campaign Preview.\" Unreal Tournament 3 Single-player Campaign Pr. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2013.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest video games, such as ''[[Tennis for Two]]'' (1958), ''[[Spacewar!]]'' (1962), and ''[[Pong]]'' (1972), were symmetrical games designed to be played by two players. Single-player games gained popularity only after this, with early titles such as ''[[Tomohiro Nishikado#Speed Race|Speed Race]]'' (1974)<ref>\"Speed Race.\" (Game). N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2013.</ref> and ''[[Space Invaders]]'' (1978).\n\nThe reason for this, according to [[Raph Koster]], is down to a combination of several factors: increasingly sophisticated computers and interfaces that enabled [[asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] gameplay, [[cooperative gameplay]] and story delivery within a gaming framework, coupled with the fact that the majority of early games players had introverted personality types (according to the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator|Myers-Briggs personality type indicator]]).<ref name='RaphKoster'>{{cite web | url = http://www.raphkoster.com/2006/02/10/are-single-player-games-doomed | title = Are single-player games doomed? | accessdate = 2013-02-25 | last = Koster | first = Raph | authorlink = Raph Koster | date = 10 Feb 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130208222638/http://www.raphkoster.com/2006/02/10/are-single-player-games-doomed | archivedate = 8 Feb 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlthough most modern games incorporate a single-player element either as the core or as one of several game modes, single-player gaming is currently viewed by the [[video game industry]] as peripheral to the future of gaming, with [[Electronic Arts]] vice president [[Frank Gibeau]] stating in 2012 that he had not approved one game to be developed as a single-player experience.<ref name='CVG'>{{cite news | title = Is single-player gaming under-threat? | date = 28 Oct 2012 | publisher = [[Future plc]] | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/374796/features/is-single-player-gaming-under-threat/ | work = Computer and Video Games | accessdate = 2013-02-25}}</ref>\n\nThe question of the financial viability of single-player [[AAA (video gaming)|AAA]] games was raised following the closure of [[Visceral Games]] by [[Electronic Arts]] (EA) in October 2017. Visceral had been a studio that established itself on a strong narrative single-player focus with ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'', and had been working on a single-player, linear narrative ''[[Star Wars]]'' game at the time of the closure; EA announced following this that they would be taking the game in a different direction, specifically \"a broader experience that allows for more variety and player agency\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-17-ea-has-shut-down-visceral-games | title = EA has shut down Visceral Games | first = Matt | last= Wales | date = October 17, 2017 | accessdate = October 17, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> Many commentators felt that EA made the change as they did not have confidence that a studio with an AAA-scale budget could produce a viable single-player game based on the popular ''Star Wars'' franchise. Alongside this, as well as relatively poor sales of games in the year prior that were principally AAA single-player games (''[[Resident Evil 7]]'', ''[[Prey (2017 video game)|Prey]]'', ''[[Dishonored 2]]'', and ''[[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided]]'') against financially successful multiplayer games and those offer a games-as-a-service model (''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', ''[[Destiny 2]]'', and ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront 2]]''), were indicators to many that the single-player model for AAA was waning.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/18/16491188/ea-star-wars-visceral-games-single-player  |title = EA\u2019s Star Wars \u2018pivot\u2019 is a vote of no confidence in single-player games | first =Samit | last = Sarkar | date = October 18, 2017 | accessdate = October 20, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/307836/Does_Viscerals_closure_prove_AAA_singleplayer_games_are_dying.php | title = Does Visceral's closure prove AAA single-player games are dying? | author = Staff | date = October 19, 2017 | accessdate = October 20, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/59dn78/todays-star-wars-news-makes-the-future-of-single-player-look-very-messy | title = Today's Star Wars News Makes the Future of Single-Player Look Very Messy | first=  Patrick |last= Klepek |date = October 17, 2017 | accessdate = October 20, 2017 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref><ref name=\"usgamer history\">{{cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-visceral-games|  title = The Rise and Fall of Visceral Games | first = Caty | last = McCarthy | date = October 19, 2017 | accessdate = October 20, 2017 | work  = [[US Gamer]] }}</ref> Manveer Heir, who had left EA after finishing his gameplay design work for ''[[Mass Effect Andromeda]]'', acknowledged that the culture within EA was against the development of single-player games, and with Visceral's closure, \"that the linear single-player triple-A game at EA is dead for the time being\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-23-manveer-heir-bioware-mass-effect-ea-monetisation | title = \"I've seen people literally spend $15,000 on Mass Effect multiplayer cards\" | first = Robert | last = Purchase | date = October 23, 2017 | accessdate = October 23, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> [[Bethesda Softworks|Bethesda]] in December 7, 2017, decided to collaborate with [[Lynda Carter]] to launch a Public Safety Announcement to save single-player gaming.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/bethesda-kicks-off-a-save-player-1-sale-for-its-single-player-games/ | title = \"Bethesda kicks off a 'Save Player 1' sale for its single-player games\" | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date = December 7, 2017 | accessdate = December 14, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n==Game elements==\nAs the narrative and conflict in single-player gameplay is created by a computer rather than a human opponent, single-player games are able to deliver certain gaming experiences that are typically absent - or de-emphasised - in multiplayer games.<ref>\"ThomasDaPsycho.\" : Video Game Story Elements. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2013.</ref>\n\n===Story===\nSingle-player games rely more heavily on compelling stories to draw the player into the experience and to create a sense of investment. Humans are unpredictable, so human players - allies or enemies - cannot be relied upon to carry a narrative in a particular direction, and so multiplayer games tend not to focus heavily on a linear narrative. By contrast, many single-player games are built around a compelling story.<ref>\"Tales of the Rampant Coyote: What Makes a Great RPG - Mechanics.\" Tales of the Rampant Coyote. N.p., n.d.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

For the [[Diocese of Rome]], these functions are ''not'' handled by the Roman Curia, but by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicariate General of His Holiness for the City of Rome]], as provided by the apostolic constitution ''[[Ecclesia in Urbe]]''. The pope has, going back to [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]], been the bishop of Rome. There is also the [[Vicar General of Rome]], traditionally a cardinal, and his deputy the vicegerent, who holds the personal title of archbishop, supervise the governance of the diocese by reference to the Pope himself, but with no more dependence on the Roman Curia, as such, than other Catholic dioceses throughout the world. A distinct office, the [[Vicar General for Vatican City]], administers the portion of the Diocese of Rome in [[Vatican City]].\n\nUntil recently, there still existed [[hereditary officers of the Roman Curia]], holding titles denominating functions that had ceased to be a reality when the [[Papal States]] were lost to the papacy. A reorganization, ordered by [[Pope Pius X]], was incorporated into the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]]. Further steps toward reorganization were begun by [[Pope Paul VI]] in the 1960s. Among the goals of this curial reform were the modernization of procedures and the internationalization of the curial staff. These reforms are reflected in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507667/Roman-Curia |title=Roman Curia (Roman Catholicism) \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref> The offices of the Vatican City State are not part of the Roman Curia, which is composed only of offices of the [[Holy See]].

The Secretariat is divided into two sections, the Section for General Affairs and the Section for Relations with States, known as the First Section and Second Section, respectively. The Secretariat of State was created in the 15th century<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/documents/rc_seg-st_12101998_profile_en.htm]</ref> and is now the department of the curia most involved in coordinating the Holy See's activities.
