It was last active at [[Moron Air Base]], Spain, supporting [[Operation Odyssey Dawn|Operations Odyssey Dawn]] and [[Operation Unified Protector|Unified Protector]] to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya. It was inactivated on 31 October 2011.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the group was assigned to both [[Twelfth Air Force|Twelfth]] and [[Ninth Air Force]]s in North Africa, Italy and Western Europe. The 313 TCG was highly decorated for its combat parachute infantry drops during the Invasion of [[Sicily]] ([[Operation Husky]]); Invasion of [[Italy]] ([[Operation Avalanche]]); Invasion of France ([[Operation Overlord]]); the airborne invasion of the [[Netherlands]] ([[Operation Market-Garden]]); and the airborne crossing of the [[Rhine River]], ([[Operation Varsity]]).\n\n==History==\n: ''For related history and lineage, see [[313th Tactical Airlift Wing]]''\n\n===World War II===\nThe [[group (military aviation unit)|group]] was activated at [[Daniel Field]], Georgia in March 1942 as the '''313th Transport Group''', with only a [[headquarters#Military|headquarters]] and a single [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]], the [[29th Transport Squadron]], assigned.  In June, the group added three additional squadrons (the [[47th Airlift Flight|47th]], [[48th Airlift Squadron|48th]] and [[49th Troop Carrier Squadron|49th Transport Squadrons]]) and moved to [[Bowman Field (Kentucky)|Bowman Field]], Kentucky to begin training.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/><ref>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 147, 207\u2013208, 210, 214</ref> The group trained under Air Transport Command with [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] and the C-53 Skytrooper modification of the C-47.  In July, the [[Army Air Forces]] gave the \"transport\" designation to its strategic airlift units, and the group became the '''313th Troop Carrier Group''' under [[I Troop Carrier Command]].  The 313th trained in the southeastern United States until April 1943, when it deployed to North Africa.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\n====Mediterranean operations====\n[[File:47th Troop Carrier Squadron C-47A-70-DL Skytrain 42-100646.jpg|thumb|47th Troop Carrier Squadron C-47<ref group=note>Aircraft is Douglas C-47A-70-DL Skytrain serial 42-100646, at [[AAF Station Nordholz]], Germany in July 1945.</ref>]]\nThe group began flying combat missions from [[Oujda Airfield]] in French Morocco. It performed troop carrier and transport airlift of supplies to ground forces advancing through Algeria into Tunisia as part [[Twelfth Air Force]].  it also evacuated wounded from the battle area.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nThe 313th took part in [[Operation Husky]], the invasion of [[Sicily]].  Although blown far off course on the first airdrops on the island by strong winds, the group managed to drop its paratroops near [[Avola]], where they were able to assist British forces in seizing that town.<ref>Warren , p. 35</ref> Two days later, 11 July 1943, the 313th Group led the stream of troop carrier units of the [[52d Troop Carrier Wing]] bringing reinforcements, planning to drop [[paratroop]]s near [[Gela]].  However, attacks in the Gela area by enemy aircraft had sunk two ships and forced other ships in the invasion force to disperse.  The heaviest enemy attack came at 2150 hours.  Fifty minutes later, the first 313th Group aircraft approached the [[drop zone]].  The group was able to successfully make its drop on Farello Airfield.  Mistaking the troop carriers for another enemy attack, ships of the assault force and antiaircraft units ashore began a heavy fire on the group's C-47s as they departed.  Of the 144 planes of the 52d Wing that participated in the mission, 23 were shot down and an additional 37 were heavily damaged.<ref>Garland & Smyth, pp. 177\u2013181</ref><ref>Warren, p. 39</ref> For its completion of this mission the group earned its first [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC).<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nIt moved to Sicily for [[Operation Avalanche]], the invasion of Italy. It dropped [[paratrooper]]s of [[82d Airborne Division]] south of [[Salerno]] on the night of 13 September 1943 and flew a reinforcement mission the following night.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\n====European operations====\n[[File:47th Troop Carrier Squadron Curtiss C-46D-10-CU Commando 44-77541.jpg|thumb|313th Troop Carrier Group C-46 Commando<ref group=note>Aircraft is Curtiss C-46D-10-CU Commando serial 44-77541 at Achiet Airfield in April 1945.

On [[D-Day]] the group dropped paratroopers near [[Picauville]], Normandy and dropped reinforcements the following day.  The group's efforts during [[Operation Overlord]] earned it a second DUC.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nOn 17 September, the 313th participated in [[Operation Market Garden]], the airborne assault on the Netherlands, when it dropped troopers near [[Arnhem]] and [[Nijmegen]].  In February 1945, the unit moved to Achiet Airfield in France, where it began converting to [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s in preparation for [[Operation Varsity]], the airborne assault across the [[Rhine]].  On 24 March 1945 it dropped elements of the [[17th Airborne Division]] near [[Wesel]].<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nThe group continued to operate from Achiet during 1945, performing transportation of personnel and supplies within Europe.  It evacuated wounded and former [[prisoners of war]] and brought gasoline, ammunition to forward areas.  After [[V-E Day]], it continued to transport medical equipment and other supplies.  In September, the squadron's personnel returned to the United States and it was inactivated on arrival at the Port of Embarkation.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\n===Berlin Airlift===\n[[File:C-54 landing at Tempelhof 1948.jpg|thumb|C-54 landing at [[Tempelhof Central Airport]] in 1948.]]\nThe group was reactivated at [[Tulln Air Base]], Austria, although one of its squadrons was stationed at [[Capodichino Airport]], near [[Naples]], Italy and another at [[Tempelhof Central Airport]] in [[Berlin]], Germany.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/><ref name=Maurer29TCS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 147</ref><ref name=Maurer47TCS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 207\u2013208</ref> The unit formed part of the [[military occupation|occupation forces]] and served as part of the European Air Transport Service, returning to operating the C-47.  In May, all squadrons gathered at Tulln and in June 1947, the group was moved (less its personnel and equipment) back to the United States.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/> In July, it moved to [[Bergstrom Field]], Texas, where it was manned and began to train with [[Fairchild C-82 Packet]] aircraft and gliders.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/> Shortly after its arrival at Bergstrom, the group and its supporting units were reorganized under the [[Hobson Plan|wing base organization]], with both operational and support elements reporting to the [[313th Troop Carrier Wing]].<ref name=Ravenstein313TAW>Ravenstein, pp. 160\u2013161</ref>\n\nIn July 1948, group deployed its 48th Squadron to [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] to reinforce [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] in the [[Berlin Airlift]].  As winter approached and the demand for supplies increased, the group and its squadrons moved to [[RAF Fassberg]], Germany, and began to operate [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]]s, with which it flew food, medicine and coal into Berlin.  In January 1949, the 313th Wing was inactivated and the group was assigned directly to the 1st Airlift Task Force, but attached to the [[60th Troop Carrier Wing]] at Rhein Main.<ref name=Ravenstein313TAW/><ref name=Ravenstein60TCW>Ravenstein, p. 95</ref> Berlin Airlift operations continued until September 1949, with the Soviet blockade of Berlin ended, and, faced with President [[Harry S.

The group was inactivated in September 1949.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/><ref>Knaack, p. 25</ref>\n\n===Tactical Air Command===\nThe group was activated at [[Mitchel Air Force Base]], New York on 1 February 1953,<ref name=Maurer313TCG/> when it replaced the [[514th Troop Carrier Group]], a reserve unit that had been mobilized for the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/433967/514-operations-group-afrc/ |last1=Endicott|first1=Judy G.|title=Factsheet 514 Operations Group (AFRC)|date=2 January 2008|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|url-status=live |accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> The 514th was in the process of converting from C-46 Commandos to [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s, and the 313th took over its personnel and equipment.  Meanwhile, [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) was preparing the [[465th Troop Carrier Group]] at [[Donaldson Air Force Base]], South Carolina for deployment to France, but no [[wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] headquarters was at Donaldson for the 465th Group and its support units. In August, TAC inactivated the 313th Troop Carrier Wing at Mitchel and replaced it and its support units with the [[465th Troop Carrier Wing]].  The 313th Group was reassigned directly to [[Eighteenth Air Force]], but was attached to the new wing for the remainder of the group's stay at Mitchel.<ref name=Ravenstein465TAW>Ravenstein, p. 260</ref>\n\nIn October 1953, the group moved to [[Sewart Air Force Base]], Tennessee.

It was last active at [[Moron Air Base]], Spain, supporting [[Operation Odyssey Dawn|Operations Odyssey Dawn]] and [[Operation Unified Protector|Unified Protector]] to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya. It was inactivated on 31 October 2011.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the group was assigned to both [[Twelfth Air Force|Twelfth]] and [[Ninth Air Force]]s in North Africa, Italy and Western Europe. The 313 TCG was highly decorated for its combat parachute infantry drops during the Invasion of [[Sicily]] ([[Operation Husky]]); Invasion of [[Italy]] ([[Operation Avalanche]]); Invasion of France ([[Operation Overlord]]); the airborne invasion of the [[Netherlands]] ([[Operation Market-Garden]]); and the airborne crossing of the [[Rhine River]], ([[Operation Varsity]]).\n\n==History==\n: ''For related history and lineage, see [[313th Tactical Airlift Wing]]''\n\n===World War II===\nThe [[group (military aviation unit)|group]] was activated at [[Daniel Field]], Georgia in March 1942 as the '''313th Transport Group''', with only a [[headquarters#Military|headquarters]] and a single [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]], the [[29th Transport Squadron]], assigned.  In June, the group added three additional squadrons (the [[47th Airlift Flight|47th]], [[48th Airlift Squadron|48th]] and [[49th Troop Carrier Squadron|49th Transport Squadrons]]) and moved to [[Bowman Field (Kentucky)|Bowman Field]], Kentucky to begin training.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/><ref>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 147, 207\u2013208, 210, 214</ref> The group trained under Air Transport Command with [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] and the C-53 Skytrooper modification of the C-47.  In July, the [[Army Air Forces]] gave the \"transport\" designation to its strategic airlift units, and the group became the '''313th Troop Carrier Group''' under [[I Troop Carrier Command]].  The 313th trained in the southeastern United States until April 1943, when it deployed to North Africa.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\n====Mediterranean operations====\n[[File:47th Troop Carrier Squadron C-47A-70-DL Skytrain 42-100646.jpg|thumb|47th Troop Carrier Squadron C-47<ref group=note>Aircraft is Douglas C-47A-70-DL Skytrain serial 42-100646, at [[AAF Station Nordholz]], Germany in July 1945.</ref>]]\nThe group began flying combat missions from [[Oujda Airfield]] in French Morocco. It performed troop carrier and transport airlift of supplies to ground forces advancing though Algeria into Tunisia as part [[Twelfth Air Force]].  it also evacuated wounded from the battle area.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nThe 313th took part in [[Operation Husky]], the invasion of [[Sicily]].  Although blown far off course on the first airdrops on the island by strong winds, the group managed to drop its paratroops near [[Avola]], where they were able to assist British forces in seizing that town.<ref>Warren , p. 35</ref> Two days later, 11 July 1943, the 313th Group led the stream of troop carrier units of the [[52d Troop Carrier Wing]] bringing reinforcements, planning to drop [[paratroop]]s near [[Gela]].  However, attacks in the Gela area by enemy aircraft had sunk two ships and forced other ships in the invasion force to disperse.  The heaviest enemy attack came at 2150 hours.  Fifty minutes later, the first 313th Group aircraft approached the [[drop zone]].  The group was able to successfully make its drop on Farello Airfield.  Mistaking the troop carriers for another enemy attack, ships of the assault force and antiaircraft units ashore began a heavy fire on the group's C-47s as they departed.  Of the 144 planes of the 52d Wing that participated in the mission, 23 were shot down and an additional 37 were heavily damaged.<ref>Garland & Smyth, pp. 177\u2013181</ref><ref>Warren , p. 39</ref> For its completion of this mission the group earned its first [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC).<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nIt moved to Sicily for [[Operation Avalanche]], the invasion of Italy. It dropped [[paratrooper]]s of [[82d Airborne Division]] south of [[Salerno]] on the night of 13 September 1943 and flew a reinforcement mission the following night.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\n====European operations====\n[[File:47th Troop Carrier Squadron Curtiss C-46D-10-CU Commando 44-77541.jpg|thumb|313th Troop Carrier Group C-46 Commando<ref group=note>Aircraft is Curtiss C-46D-10-CU Commando serial 44-77541 at Achiet Airfield in April 1945.

On [[D-Day]] the group dropped paratroopers near [[Picauville]], Normandy and dropped reinforcements the following day.  The group's efforts during [[Operation Overlord]] earned it a second DUC.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nOn 17 September, the 313th participated in [[Operation Market Garden]], the airborne assault on the Netherlands, when it dropped troopers near [[Arnhem]] and [[Nijmegen]].  In February 1945, the unit moved to Achiet Airfield in France, where it began converting to [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s in preparation for [[Operation Varsity]], the airborne assault across the [[Rhine]].  On 24 March 1945 it dropped elements of the [[17th Airborne Division]] near [[Wesel]].<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\nThe group continued to operate from Achiet during 1945, performing transportation of personnel and supplies within Europe.  It evacuated wounded and former [[prisoners of war]] and brought gasoline, ammunition to forward areas.  After [[V-E Day]], it continued to transport medical equipment and other supplies.  In September, the squadron's personnel returned to the United States and it was inactivated on arrival at the Port of Embarkation.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/>\n\n===Berlin Airlift===\n[[File:C-54 landing at Tempelhof 1948.jpg|thumb|C-54 landing at [[Tempelhof Central Airport]] in 1948.]]\nThe group was reactivated at [[Tulln Air Base]], Austria, although one of its squadrons was stationed at [[Capodichino Airport]], near [[Naples]], Italy and another at [[Tempelhof Central Airport]] in [[Berlin]], Germany.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/><ref name=Maurer29TCS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 147</ref><ref name=Maurer47TCS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 207\u2013208</ref> The unit formed part of the [[military occupation|occupation forces]] and served as part of the European Air Transport Service, returning to operating the C-47.  In May, all squadrons gathered at Tulln and in June 1947, the group was moved (less its personnel and equipment) back to the United States.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/> In July, it moved to [[Bergstrom Field]], Texas, where it was manned and began to train with [[Fairchild C-82 Packet]] aircraft and gliders.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/> Shortly after its arrival at Bergstrom, the group and its supporting units were reorganized under the [[Hobson Plan|wing base organization]], with both operational and support elements reporting to the [[313th Troop Carrier Wing]].<ref name=Ravenstein313TAW>Ravenstein, pp. 160\u2013161</ref>\n\nIn July 1948, group deployed its 48th Squadron to [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] to reinforce [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] in the [[Berlin Airlift]].  As winter approached and the demand for supplies increased, the group and its squadrons moved to [[RAF Fassberg]], Germany, and began to operate [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]]s, with which it flew food, medicine and coal into Berlin.  In January 1949, the 313th Wing was inactivated and the group was assigned directly to the 1st Airlift Task Force, but attached to the [[60th Troop Carrier Wing]] at Rhein Main.<ref name=Ravenstein313TAW/><ref name=Ravenstein60TCW>Ravenstein, p. 95</ref> Berlin Airlift operations continued until September 1949, with the Soviet blockade of Berlin ended, and, faced with President [[Harry S.

The group was inactivated in September 1949.<ref name=Maurer313TCG/><ref>Knaack, p. 25</ref>\n\n===Tactical Air Command===\nThe group was activated at [[Mitchel Air Force Base]], New York on 1 February 1953,<ref name=Maurer313TCG/> when it replaced the [[514th Troop Carrier Group]], a reserve unit that had been mobilized for the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/433967/514-operations-group-afrc/ |last1=Endicott|first1=Judy G.|title=Factsheet 514 Operations Group (AFRC)|date=2 January 2008|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|url-status=live |accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref> The 514th was in the process of converting from C-46 Commandos to [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s, and the 313th took over its personnel and equipment.  Meanwhile, [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) was preparing the [[465th Troop Carrier Group]] at [[Donaldson Air Force Base]], South Carolina for deployment to France, but no [[wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] headquarters was at Donaldson for the 465th Group and its support units. In August, TAC inactivated the 313th Troop Carrier Wing at Mitchel and replaced it and its support units with the [[465th Troop Carrier Wing]].  The 313th Group was reassigned directly to [[Eighteenth Air Force]], but was attached to the new wing for the remainder of the group's stay at Mitchel.<ref name=Ravenstein465TAW>Ravenstein, p. 260</ref>\n\nIn October 1953, the group moved to [[Sewart Air Force Base]], Tennessee.

His absence in Iran was followed by a conspiracy led by [[Taghachar]] and his follower Sad al-Din Zanjani. They falsely informed viceroy Anbarchi - via Sad al-Din's brother Qutb al-Din, who was Anbarchi's vizier - of Gaykhatu's defeat by Turkmens in Anatolia and called him to take the throne. While ambitious, Anbarchi regarded this news with suspicion. After contacting Shiktur Noyan who was residing near [[Qara\u00e7ala|Karachal]]<ref name=\":0\" />, Anbarchi had them imprisoned by Shiktur. Gaykhatu arrived at Aladagh on 29 June 1292, had second enthroment, possibly receiving a confirmation by [[Kublai Khan|Kublai Khagan]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gaykatu-khan-|title=GAY\u1e34\u0100T\u016a KHAN \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nUpon returning, Gaykhatu allowed his wife Padishah Khatun's gaining Kirman in October 1292; pardoned both Taghachar and Sad al-Din Zanjani, even appointing the latter to the post of vizier on 18 November 1292 while confirming his father-in-law Aq Buqa Jalair as commander-in-chief. Shiktur and Taghachar were subordinated to him.

Former emirs Hasan and Taiju attempted to accuse him of embezzlement of state funds unsuccessfully. \n\nIn 1292, Gaykhatu had sent a message to the [[Egypt]]ian [[Mamluk]] [[Sultan]] [[Al-Ashraf Khalil]], threatening to conquer the whole of the [[Levant]] if he doesn't return [[Aleppo]]. Al-Ashraf replied: \"''The khan has the same ideas as me. I too hope to bring back Baghdad to the fold of [[Islam]] as previously. We will see which of us two will be quicker''\".<ref>Al-Maqrizi, p. 242, vol. 2.</ref> However, there were no major battles between Mongols and Mamlukes afterwards.\n\nDuring his reign, the princess [[K\u00f6k\u00f6chin|K\u00f6k\u00f6tchin]] had arrived from the court of his Khagan [[Kublai]] in 1293, escorted by none other than [[Marco Polo]]. The new Ilkhan decreed that the princess be married to his nephew [[Ghazan Khan|Ghazan]], who had fully supported his right to rule. Ghazan on the other hand sent a tiger to Gaykhatu as an answer. Marco Polo and his entourage stayed with Gaykhatu with 9 months.\n\n[[Golden Horde]] khan [[Toqta]] who ascended the throne at same time as Gaykhatu sent Prince Qalintay and Pulad as envoys to Ilkhanate on 28 March 1294 to make truce and possibly ask for help against Toqta's rivals. They were returned to Golden Horde 3 days later.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Introduction of paper money ==\nIn 1294, Gaykhatu wanted to replenish his treasury emptied by a great cattle plague. In response, his [[vizier]] Sad al-Din Zanjani<ref name=\":3\" /> proposed the introduction of a recent Chinese invention called ''[[Jiaochao]]'' ([[banknote|paper money]]). Gaykhatu agreed and called for [[Kublai Khan]]'s ambassador [[Bolad]] in [[Tabriz]]. After the ambassador showed how the system worked, Gaykhatu printed banknotes which imitated the Chinese ones so closely that they even had Chinese words printed on them. The [[Muslim]] confession of faith was printed on the banknotes to placate local sentiment. Gaykhatu's Buddhist name Rinchindorj was also present on money. Shiktur Noyan objected to introduction, calling this a foul attempt. First circulation started on 12 September 1294 in [[Tabriz]]. Gaykhatu ordered anyone who is going to refuse to use money to be executed on the spot. Poets, including [[Wassaf]] started to praise chao in order to appease Gaykhatu.<ref name=\":0\" />Paper moneys circulated were worth from half [[dirham]] to 10 [[dinar]]<nowiki/>s.\n\nThe plan was to get his subjects to use only paper money, and allow Gaykhatu to control the treasury. The experiment was a complete failure, as the people and merchants refused to accept the banknotes. Soon, [[bazaar]] riots broke out, economic activities came to a standstill, and the Persian historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid ud-din]] speaks even of \"'the ruin of [[Basra]]' which ensued upon the emission of the new money\".<ref>Ashtor 1976, p.&nbsp;257.</ref> Gaykhatu had no choice but to withdraw the use of paper money.\n[[File:Assassinat de Geikhatu.jpeg|thumb|365x365px|Assassination of Gaykhatu. [[Hayton of Corycus]], ''Fleur des histoires d'orient''.]]\n\n== Revolt of Baydu ==\nGaykhatu insulted [[Baydu]] telling one of his servants to hit Baydu while being drunk. This grew a resentment in Baydu towards him. Baydu left hastily towards to his appanage near [[Baghdad]] leaving his son Qipchak as a hostage in Gaykhatu's court. He was supported by [[Oirats|Oirat]] emir Chichak (son of Sulaimish b. Tengiz G\u00fcregen), Lagzi K\u00fcregen (son of [[Arghun Aqa]]), El-Temur (son of Hinduqur Noyan) and Todachu Yarquchi, who followed him to Baghdad. He was also aided by his vizier Jamal ud-Din Dastgerdani. According to [[Hamdallah Mustawfi|Hamdullah Qazwini]], Baydu's main motivation on moving against Gaykhatu was his sexual advances against Qipchak.<ref>L. J.

While his followers Hasan and Taiju demanded their executions, [[Taghachar]] advised against it. Baydu on his side, moved to kill Muhammad Sugurchi, governor of Baghdad and arrested governor Baybuqa of [[Diyar Bakr]]. Gaykhatu sent his father-in-law Aq Buqa and Taghachar against Baydu on 17 March 1295, himself arriving at Tabriz 4 days later. Little he knew that Taghachar already shifted allegiance to Baydu who left for his encampment at night. While he wanted to flee to Anatolia, his councillors advised to fight against Baydu. Nevertheless, Gaykhatu fled to Mughan. Arriving in Tabriz, Taghachar set Qoncuqbal and Tuladai free, while Gaikhatu desperately begged for mercy. Despite his appeal, he was strangled by a bowstring so as to avoid bloodshed<ref>Steppes, p. 377.</ref> on 21 March 1295.

Former emirs Hasan and Taiju attempted to accuse him of embezzlement of state funds unsuccessfully. \n\nIn 1292, Gaykhatu had sent a message to the [[Egypt]]ian [[Mamluk]] [[Sultan]] [[Al-Ashraf Khalil]], threatening to conquer the whole of the [[Levant]] if he doesn't return [[Aleppo]]. Al-Ashraf replied: \"''The khan has the same ideas as me. I too hope to bring back Baghdad to the fold of [[Islam]] as previously. We will see which of us two will be quicker''\".<ref>Al-Maqrizi, p. 242, vol. 2.</ref> However, there were no major battles between Mongols and Mamlukes afterwards.\n\nDuring his reign, the princess [[K\u00f6k\u00f6chin|K\u00f6k\u00f6tchin]] had arrived from the court of his Khagan [[Kublai]] in 1293, escorted by none other than [[Marco Polo]]. The new Ilkhan decreed that the princess be married to his nephew [[Ghazan Khan|Ghazan]], who had fully supported his right to rule. Ghazan on the other hand sent a tiger to Gaykhatu as an answer. Marco Polo and his entourage stayed with Gaykhatu with 9 months.\n\n[[Golden Horde]] khan [[Toqta]] who ascended the throne at same time as Gaykhatu sent Prince Qalintay and Pulad as envoys to Ilkhanate on 28 March 1294 to make truce and possibly ask for help against Toqta's rivals. They were returned to Golden Horde 3 days later.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Introduction of paper money ==\nIn 1294, Gaykhatu wanted to replenish his treasury emptied by a great cattle plague. In response, his [[vizier]] Sad al-Din Zanjani<ref name=\":3\" /> proposed the introduction of a recent Chinese invention called ''[[Jiaochao]]'' ([[banknote|paper money]]). Gaykhatu agreed and called for [[Kublai Khan]]'s ambassador [[Bolad]] in [[Tabriz]]. After the ambassador showed how the system worked, Gaykhatu printed banknotes which imitated the Chinese ones so closely that they even had Chinese words printed on them. The [[Muslim]] confession of faith was printed on the banknotes to placate local sentiment. Gaykhatu's Buddhist name Rinchindorj was also present on money. Shiktur Noyan objected to introduction, calling this a foul attempt. First circulation started on 12 September 1294 in [[Tabriz]]. Gaykhatu ordered anyone who is going to refuse to use money to be executed on the spot. Poets, including [[Wassaf]] started to praise chao in order to appease Gaykhatu.<ref name=\":0\" />Paper moneys circulated were worth from half [[dirham]] to 10 [[dinar]]<nowiki/>s.\n\nThe plan was to get his subjects to use only paper money, and allow Gaykhatu to control the treasury. The experiment was a complete failure, as the people and merchants refused to accept the banknotes. Soon, [[bazaar]] riots broke out, economic activities came to a standstill, and the Persian historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid ud-din]] speaks even of \"'the ruin of [[Basra]]' which ensued upon the emission of the new money\".<ref>Ashtor 1976, p.&nbsp;257.</ref> Gaykhatu had no choice but to withdraw the use of paper money.\n[[File:Assassinat de Geikhatu.jpeg|thumb|365x365px|Assassination of Gaykhatu. [[Hayton of Corycus]], ''Fleur des histoires d'orient''.]]\n\n== Revolt of Baydu ==\nGaykhatu insulted [[Baydu]] telling one of his servants to hit Baydu while being drunk. This grew a resentment in Baydu towards him. Baydu left hastily towards to his appanage near [[Baghdad]] leaving his son Qipchak as a hostage in Gaykhatu's court. He was supported by [[Oirats|Oirat]] emir Chichak (son of Sulaimish b. Tengiz G\u00fcregen), Lagzi K\u00fcregen (son of [[Arghun Aqa]]), El-Temur (son of Hinduqur Noyan) and Todachu Yarquchi, who followed him to Baghdad. He was also aided by his vizier Jamal ud-Din Dastgerdani. According to [[Hamdallah Mustawfi|Hamdullah Qazwini]], Baydu's main motivation on moving against Gaykhatu was his sexual advances against Qipchak.<ref>L. J.

While his followers Hasan and Taiju demanded their executions, [[Taghachar]] advised against it. Baydu on his side, moved to kill Muhammad Sugurchi, governor of Baghdad and arrested governor Baybuqa of [[Diyar Bakr]]. Gaykhatu sent his father-in-law Aq Buqa and Taghachar against Baydu on 17 March 1295, himself arriving at Tabriz 4 days later. Little he knew that Taghachar already shifted allegiance to Baydu who left for his encampment at night. While he wanted to flee to Anatolia, his councillors advised to fight against Baydu. Nevertheless, Gaykhatu fled to Mughan. Arriving in Tabriz, Taghachar set Qoncuqbal and Tuladai free, while Gaikhatu desperately begged for mercy. Despite his appeal, he was strangled by a bowstring so as to avoid bloodshed<ref>Steppes, p. 377.</ref> on 21 March 1295. However, some sources put this event on 5 March or 25 April.<ref name=\":1\" /> An alternative story of Gaykhatu's death claims [[Baydu]] made war on him because of his introduction of paper money and subsequently killed him in battle.<ref name=\"Stevens\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/05006174/|title=The history of Persia.

Australia and Canada's federal governments are represented by [[high commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissions]], as are all [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] national governments today.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, a growing number of British colonies appointed agents in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] (and occasionally elsewhere in Europe) to promote immigration to the colonies. Eventually, agents-general were appointed by some colonies to represent their commercial, legal, and diplomatic interests in Britain and to the British government and [[Whitehall]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5T5waG0z7VIC&lpg=PT35&dq=%22edward%20jenkins%22%20agent-general&pg=PT21#v=onepage&q&f=true |title=Commissions High: Canada in London, 1870\u20131971 |first=Roy |last=MacLaren |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |accessdate=26 September 2016 |via=Google Books|isbn=9780773560123 }}</ref> They were appointed, and their expenses and salaries provided, by the governments of the colonies they represented.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Agent-General|volume=1|page=374}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 1886, Quebec and the federal Canadian government also appointed agents-general to Paris. The first, [[Hector Fabre]], was dispatched by the province of [[Quebec]] but was asked by the federal government to represent all of Canada. He and his successor, [[Philippe Roy]], continued to represent both Quebec City and Ottawa in France until 1912 when the federal government asked Roy to resign his Quebec position to avoid conflicts of interest. Canadian provinces have also appointed agent-generals (called delegates-general in Quebec beginning in the 1970s) to other countries and major cities.\n\nFollowing a military coup in Nigeria in 1966, the federal system was abolished, and the posts of the agents-general of Nigerian regions in [[London]] were subsumed in the [[High Commission of Nigeria, London|Nigerian High Commission]].\n\nBy the 1990s, some Australian state governments regarded the office of their agent-general in London as a costly anachronism, even for promoting tourism and investment, and have since been closed and subsumed into the Australian High Commission. The majority of Australian states continue to have agents-general in London, but operate from [[Australia House]] rather than maintain separate premises.\n\nMany Canadian provinces similarly are no longer represented by an agent-general, although Quebec continues to have a [[Quebec Government Offices|Government Office]] in London (''{{lang|fr|D\u00e9l\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Londres}}'') and in several other cities around the world.

When Duplessis returned to power in 1944, his government retained the New York City office and its agent-general but opened no others. In the early 1960s, the government of [[Jean L\u00e9sage]] began to open additional offices abroad appointing in Paris (1961), London (1962), Rome and Milan (1965) and subsequent governments opened offices in Chicago (1969), Boston, Lafayette, Dallas and Los Angeles (1970), Munich and Berlin (1971), Brussels (1972), Atlanta (1977), Washington (1978), Mexico City and Tokyo (1980), Beijing and Santiago (1998), Shanghai and Barcelona (1999), Mumbai (2007), S\u00e3o Paulo (2008) and Moscow (2012).<ref name=\"Reuchamps\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-nPfBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=quebec%20agent-general%20duplessis%20new%20york#v=onepage&q=quebec%20agent-general%20duplessis%20new%20york&f=false |title=Minority Nations in Multinational Federations: A Comparative Study of Quebec and Wallonia |first=Min |last=Reuchamps |page=168 |date=17 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |accessdate=26 September 2016 |via=Google Books|isbn=9781317634720 }}</ref> In 1971, the title of agent-general was officially changed to delegate-general although previous title is still often used, particularly for the government's representative to London.\n\nAs of 2016, the government of Quebec has delegates-general (agents-general) in London, Brussels, Mexico City, New York, Paris, and Tokyo; delegates to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Rome, and offices headed by directors offering more limited services in Barcelona, Beijing, Dakar, Hong Kong, Mumbai, S\u00e3o Paulo, Shanghai, Stockholm, and Washington.

Australia and Canada's federal governments are represented by [[high commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissions]], as are all [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] national governments today.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, a growing number of British colonies appointed agents in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] (and occasionally elsewhere in Europe) to promote immigration to the colonies. Eventually, agents-general were appointed by some colonies to represent their commercial, legal, and diplomatic interests in Britain and to the British government and [[Whitehall]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5T5waG0z7VIC&lpg=PT35&dq=%22edward%20jenkins%22%20agent-general&pg=PT21#v=onepage&q&f=true |title=Commissions High: Canada in London, 1870\u20131971 |first=Roy |last=MacLaren |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |accessdate=26 September 2016 |via=Google Books|isbn=9780773560123 }}</ref> They were appointed, and their expenses and salaries provided, by the governments of the colonies they represented.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Agent-General|volume=1|page=374}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 1886, Quebec and the federal Canadian government also appointed agents-general to Paris. The first, [[Hector Fabre]], was dispatched by the province of [[Quebec]] but was asked by the federal government to represent all of Canada. He and his successor, [[Philippe Roy]], continued to represent both Quebec City and Ottawa in France until 1912 when the federal government asked Roy to resign his Quebec position to avoid conflicts of interest. Canadian provinces have also appointed agent-generals (called delegates-general in Quebec beginning in the 1970s) to other countries and major cities.\n\nFollowing a military coup in Nigeria in 1966, the federal system was abolished, and the posts of the agents-general of Nigerian regions in [[London]] were subsumed in the [[High Commission of Nigeria, London|Nigerian High Commission]].\n\nBy the 1990s, some Australian state governments regarded the office of their agent-general in London as a costly anachronism, even for promoting tourism and investment, and have since been closed and subsumed into the Australian High Commission. The majority of Australian states continue to have agents-general in London, but operate from [[Australia House]] rather than maintain separate premises.\n\nMany Canadian provinces similarly are no longer represented by an agent-general, although Quebec continues to have a [[Quebec Government Offices|Government Office]] in London (''{{lang|fr|D\u00e9l\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Londres}}'') and in several other cities around the world. [[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]] have representatives who work out of the [[Embassy of Canada, Washington, D.C.|Canadian Embassy in Washington, DC]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2013/08/ontario-appoints-new-representative-in-washington.html |title=Ontario Appoints New Representative in Washington |website=[[Premier of Ontario|Office of the Premier]] |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Australia==\n===Agents-general for New South Wales===\nThe [[New South Wales]] Office in London was one of several overseas offices established by the colonies of Australia to represent their interests. The London Office was established after the appointment of the first Agent-General on 1 May 1864. In June 1932, the Agent-General's Office was abolished as a cost-cutting measure and was replaced by the New South Wales Government Offices, London, to be headed by an \"Official Representative\".<ref name=ab/> The title was renamed Agent-General in 1937, but was left vacant from 1939 to 1946 due to the war. From 1972 to 1993, the Agent-General's Office was located in separate premises from [[Australia House]], at the nearby address of 66 The Strand, which was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in May 1972.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51941575 |title=People and Fashion |work=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |location=Australia, Australia |date=14 June 1972 |accessdate=16 February 2018 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author1=New South Wales | title=A House in the Strand : a history of the site of New South Wales House | date=1972 | publisher=New South Wales Govt | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11472728 | accessdate=16 February 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 1992, the position of NSW Agent-General in London was abolished by the [[John Fahey (politician)|Fahey]] government.

The episode was written by [[George R. R. Martin]], the author of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels of which the series is an adaptation, and directed by [[Alex Graves]].<ref name=\"4directors\">{{Cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/16/game-of-thrones-season-4-director-list/|title='Game of Thrones' season 4 directors chosen|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}</ref> It aired on April 13, 2014.\n\nThe episode focuses principally on the long-awaited royal wedding between Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell, which ends tragically as Joffrey dies after drinking poisoned wine at the reception, a plot development that despite being in the books came as a shock to viewers since it abruptly killed the show's principal villain just a few episodes after the [[The Rains of Castamere|Red Wedding]] had violently killed off several of the show's protagonists. Other storylines include House Bolton's quest to retake the North, and Bran's continued journey north of The Wall. The title refers to the sigils of the wedding couple's respective houses \u2013 a lion for Joffrey Baratheon, who is in truth an illegitimate bastard, and a rose for Margaery Tyrell.\n\nUnlike Martin's previous three episodes, his draft of the screenplay has some major differences from the episode as produced, with more minor characters and detail at the wedding feast. Most significantly, it sets up some plotlines from the books that the series would ultimately not use, such as Ramsay marrying an impostor woman posing as Arya instead of Sansa. It would have also resolved the unanswered question from the show's first season of who had been behind the attempted assassination of Bran Stark by implying more strongly than the books did that it was Joffrey, rather than Littlefinger as the series would suggest several seasons later.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===At the Dreadfort===\nRamsay hunts a woman with the assistance of his servant, Reek (formerly\u00a0Theon) and his bedwarmer Myranda.\u00a0Roose and his wife Walda arrive at the Dreadfort. Roose intended to trade Theon to the Ironborn for Moat Cailin, but now is unable to do so because Ramsay castrated Theon. Ramsay demonstrates his brainwashing of Reek by having Reek shave him while Ramsay tells him of Robb Stark's death and coaxes out the true story about what happened to Bran and Rickon Stark. Roose orders Locke to kill the Stark boys,\u00a0who pose a threat to his new position as Warden of the North. Ramsay suggests that they also kill Jon. Roose dispatches Locke to Castle Black, and orders Ramsay to occupy Moat Cailin, hinting Ramsay may be legitimized if successful.\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\nAfter stopping at a weirwood, Bran has strange visions, including of a ruined and snowbound Red Keep, a dragon above King's Landing, and a large weirwood further North. He declares that he knows where his group must go.\n\n===At Dragonstone===\nMelisandre orders several men burned at the stake, including Selyse's brother Ser Axell Florent, as a tribute to the Lord of Light. Melisandre speaks with Shireen about her faith.\n\n===In King's Landing===\nTyrion encourages Jaime to train his left hand with Bronn.\n\nVarys tells Tyrion that Cersei knows about Shae. After overhearing Cersei and Tywin discussing Shae, Tyrion orders Bronn to escort Shae to the boat to sail for Essos, but she refuses to leave until Tyrion calls her a whore.\n\nJoffrey and Margaery are married at the Sept of Baelor, and the court returns to the Red Keep for the wedding feast. Jaime tells Loras that if he weds Cersei she would kill him in his sleep; Loras retorts with a remark about their incest. Cersei accuses Brienne of being in love with Jaime. Oberyn and his paramour Ellaria Sand tell Cersei and Tywin that Myrcella is in Dorne.\n\nJoffrey presents a crude play with dwarves depicting the War of the Five Kings and suggests that Tyrion participate. Embarrassed by Tyrion's witty response, Joffrey orders Tyrion to be his cupbearer. Margaery defuses the tension, but then Joffrey begins choking. During the commotion, Dontos tells Sansa to flee with him. As he dies, Joffrey points accusingly at Tyrion. A grief-stricken Cersei orders Tyrion arrested on charges of poisoning the king.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n[[File:George R. R. Martin by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|\"The Lion and the Rose\" was scripted by the author of the original saga, [[George R. R. Martin]].]]\n\nThe episode was written by [[George R. R. Martin]], author of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels. Chapters adapted from ''A Storm of Swords'' to the episode were part of chapter 9 (Bran I), and chapters 59 and 60 (Sansa IV and Tyrion VIII).{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n====Original draft====\nIn 2018, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' writer Joanna Robinson compared the episode as aired with an early draft by Martin archived at the [[Writers Guild of America]] library in [[Los Angeles]]. Unlike the two previous episodes he had written, this draft had significant differences from the produced version. Martin considers it the moment the show began to diverge considerably from the books, whose plotlines it had begun to outpace, and believes this may be why Martin wrote no more for the series.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\">{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Joanna|title=Game of Thrones: The Secrets of George R.R. Martin's Final Script|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/game-of-thrones-george-rr-martin-last-script-the-lion-and-the-rose|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe most significant difference was an earlier, and different, resolution of the Catspaw plot arc, involving who had masterminded the attempted assassination of [[Bran Stark]] in [[Game of Thrones (season 1)|season 1]], precipitating the [[War of the Five Kings]] that dominated the next two seasons, than that ultimately filmed. In Martin's script, after Joffrey is presented with the [[Valyrian steel]] sword, reforged from that of the executed [[Ned Stark]]'s Ice, as a wedding gift by [[Jaime Lannister|his father]], he says \"I am no stranger to Valyrian steel.\" This remark prompts [[Tyrion Lannister]], who was framed for the assassination attempt, to realize that Joffrey was actually behind it (as the books heavily imply); Tyrion then makes remarks to Joffrey, and later [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], insinuating that he knows this.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nScenes that built on this disclosure remained in the final script. If this has made it to the \nscreen, it would explain why Joffrey is so antagonistic towards his uncle, and it would have also set up Tyrion as a bigger suspect in Joffrey's poisoning. Tyrion in Martin's draft is also more violent to [[Shae (character)|Shae]] when he warns her (honestly, as opposed to the series) that since [[Tywin Lannister|his father]] knows why she is in King's Landing, he will have her killed.\n\nIn Martin's draft, Bran's first vision is more extensive. While it does not include the [[Night King]]'s first appearance onscreen as it does in the series, it would have been an extensive [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of scenes from the past, present and possible future in the series. [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] would have included scenes of Ned cleaning Ice beneath a weirwood tree from the show's original pilot, Bran's uncle Benjen and Lyanna Stark as children (later shown in a more extensive flashback in season 6), [[Aerys II Targaryen|King Aerys]] watching and laughing as Ned's father and brother are burned and Jaime and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] embracing in the old keep at Winterfell just before Bran discovered them. Scenes reflecting the show's present included [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon]] with Ghost, a bloodied [[Robb Stark|Robb]] surrounded by the [[The Rains of Castamere|Red Wedding]] dead, and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] holding her sword Needle as her face blurs and changes. Possible future images include a dragon's shadow passing over King's Landing, \"hints of strange small children with very dark eyes\" and a group of four distinctive northern hills behind a very large weirwood.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nThe episode would also have set up some of the plotlines from the books that were not used in the later seasons of the series. Roose Bolton tells Ramsay that he has arranged for him to marry Arya as a way of consolidating the family's hold on the North; a role assigned to Sansa instead in [[Game of Thrones (season 5)|the next season]]. Several lines were also intended to set up Jaime's trip to the Riverlands, which in the books immediately follows Joffrey's wedding but in the series was largely replaced by Jamie and Bronn's expedition to Dorne to bring Myrcella back to King's Landing. The two characters who take that trip instead in the books, along with many other minor characters from the wedding scenes, were in Martin's draft but eliminated from the produced version as [[showrunner]]s [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]] were beginning to focus on the more established characters in the later seasons.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nRobinson believes a note by Martin in the script suggests a different resolution to Ramsay's plot arc in [[A Song of Ice and Fire|the books]], where he is still alive and in power at Winterfell at the end of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', in contrast to his death at the end of [[Game of Thrones (season 6)|the sixth season]] of ''Game of Thrones''. Martin's note told the showrunners that Ramsay's dogs would eventually battle the Stark children's direwolves, so the show should emphasize the former as much as possible to build audience anticipation. However, that never happened onscreen, where all but two of the wolves are dead as of the end of [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|season 7]], and seems unlikely in the books. Robinson believes this indicates that Ramsay will have a very different plot arc in the series' two final books.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nLesser differences include a more protracted, bloodier death scene for Joffrey as the poison drives him to slash his own face, a more lavish feast, and Theon's appearance as Reek following Ramsay's extensive torture more closely resembling that described in the books, complete with whitened hair and missing fingers, something that would have required more extensive special effects for the remainder of the series, as well as speaking in rhyme. Similarly, the burning of the heretics on the beach at Dragonstone would have demonstrated the power of the Lord of Light, with the bonfires suddenly changing to different colors and apparitions of the now-forgiven dead seen briefly above; the scene would have also foreshadowed [[The Dance of Dragons|Shireen's sacrifice by the same method the next season]]. The scene where Varys warns Tyrion that Cersei has told Tywin about Shae, a short conversation on a garden path in the finished episode, instead takes place at more length in the Red Keep's dungeons, with Varys dressed as \"a denizen of the dungeons\" in armor, carrying a whip and wearing a false beard.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nMartin also wrote that some of the scenes should be [[Point-of-view shot|shot from an individual character's point of view]], much as most of his book chapters are written from the point of view of the character they take their name from. While he admitted that it had been difficult to bring that aspect of his story to the screen, he nevertheless attempted it here, calling for the scene where Ramsay and Myranda chase the woman to her death at the hands of his hounds to be seen from the woman's point of view as she runs and then falls to the ground, then from Theon's as he looks on defeated.

The episode was written by [[George R. R. Martin]], the author of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels of which the series is an adaptation, and directed by [[Alex Graves]].<ref name=\"4directors\">{{Cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/16/game-of-thrones-season-4-director-list/|title='Game of Thrones' season 4 directors chosen|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}</ref> It aired on April 13, 2014.\n\nThe episode focuses principally on the long-awaited royal wedding between Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell, which ends tragically as Joffrey dies after drinking poisoned wine at the reception, a plot development that despite being in the books came as a shock to viewers since it abruptly killed the show's principal villain just a few episodes after the [[The Rains of Castamere|Red Wedding]] had violently killed off several of the show's protagonists. Other storylines include House Bolton's quest to retake the North, and Bran's continued journey north of The Wall. The title refers to the sigils of the wedding couple's respective houses \u2013 a lion for Joffrey Baratheon, who is in truth an illegitimate bastard, and a rose for Margaery Tyrell.\n\nUnlike Martin's previous three episodes, his draft of the screenplay has some major differences from the episode as produced, with more minor characters and detail at the wedding feast. Most significantly, it sets up some plotlines from the books that the series would ultimately not use, such as Ramsay marrying an impostor woman posing as Arya instead of Sansa. It would have also resolved the unanswered question from the show's first season of who had been behind the attempted assassination of Bran Stark by implying more strongly than the books did that it was Joffrey, rather than Littlefinger as the series would suggest several seasons later.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===At the Dreadfort===\nRamsay hunts a woman with the assistance of his servant, Reek (formerly\u00a0Theon) and his bedwarmer Myranda.\u00a0Roose and his wife Walda arrive at the Dreadfort. Roose intended to trade Theon to the Ironborn for Moat Cailin, but now is unable to do so because Ramsay castrated Theon. Ramsay demonstrates his brainwashing of Reek by having Reek shave him while Ramsay tells him of Robb Stark's death and coaxes out the true story about what happened to Bran and Rickon Stark. Roose orders Locke to kill the Stark boys,\u00a0who pose a threat to his new position as Warden of the North. Ramsay suggests that they also kill Jon. Roose dispatches Locke to Castle Black, and orders Ramsay to occupy Moat Cailin, hinting Ramsay may be legitimized if successful.\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\nAfter stopping at a weirwood, Bran has strange visions, including of a ruined and snowbound Red Keep, a dragon above King's Landing, and a large weirwood further North. He declares that he knows where his group must go.\n\n===At Dragonstone===\nMelisandre orders several men burned at the stake, including Selyse's brother Ser Axell Florent, as a tribute to the Lord of Light. Melisandre speaks with Shireen about her faith.\n\n===In King's Landing===\nTyrion encourages Jaime to train his left hand with Bronn.\n\nVarys tells Tyrion that Cersei knows about Shae. After overhearing Cersei and Tywin discussing Shae, Tyrion orders Bronn to escort Shae to the boat to sail for Essos, but she refuses to leave until Tyrion calls her a whore.\n\nJoffrey and Margaery are married at the Sept of Baelor, and the court returns to the Red Keep for the wedding feast. Jaime tells Loras that if he weds Cersei she would kill him in his sleep; Loras retorts with a remark about their incest. Cersei accuses Brienne of being in love with Jaime. Oberyn and his paramour Ellaria Sand tell Cersei and Tywin that Myrcella is in Dorne.\n\nJoffrey presents a crude play with dwarves depicting the War of the Five Kings and suggests that Tyrion participate. Embarrassed by Tyrion's witty response, Joffrey orders Tyrion to be his cupbearer. Margaery defuses the tension, but then Joffrey begins choking. During the commotion, Dontos tells Sansa to flee with him. As he dies, Joffrey points accussingly at Tyrion. A grief-stricken Cersei orders Tyrion arrested on charges of poisoning the king.\n\n==Production==\n===Writing===\n[[File:George R. R. Martin by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|\"The Lion and the Rose\" was scripted by the author of the original saga, [[George R. R. Martin]].]]\n\nThe episode was written by [[George R. R. Martin]], author of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels. Chapters adapted from ''A Storm of Swords'' to the episode were part of chapter 9 (Bran I), and chapters 59 and 60 (Sansa IV and Tyrion VIII).{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n====Original draft====\nIn 2018, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' writer Joanna Robinson compared the episode as aired with an early draft by Martin archived at the [[Writers Guild of America]] library in [[Los Angeles]]. Unlike the two previous episodes he had written, this draft had significant differences from the produced version. Martin considers it the moment the show began to diverge considerably from the books, whose plotlines it had begun to outpace, and believes this may be why Martin wrote no more for the series.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\">{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Joanna|title=Game of Thrones: The Secrets of George R.R. Martin's Final Script|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/game-of-thrones-george-rr-martin-last-script-the-lion-and-the-rose|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=December 7, 2018|accessdate=December 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe most significant difference was an earlier, and different, resolution of the Catspaw plot arc, involving who had masterminded the attempted assassination of [[Bran Stark]] in [[Game of Thrones (season 1)|season 1]], precipitating the [[War of the Five Kings]] that dominated the next two seasons, than that ultimately filmed. In Martin's script, after Joffrey is presented with the [[Valyrian steel]] sword, reforged from that of the executed [[Ned Stark]]'s Ice, as a wedding gift by [[Jaime Lannister|his father]], he says \"I am no stranger to Valyrian steel.\" This remark prompts [[Tyrion Lannister]], who was framed for the assassination attempt, to realize that Joffrey was actually behind it (as the books heavily imply); Tyrion then makes remarks to Joffrey, and later [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], insinuating that he knows this.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nScenes that built on this disclosure remained in the final script. If this has made it to the \nscreen, it would explain why Joffrey is so antagonistic towards his uncle, and it would have also set up Tyrion as a bigger suspect in Joffrey's poisoning. Tyrion in Martin's draft is also more violent to [[Shae (character)|Shae]] when he warns her (honestly, as opposed to the series) that since [[Tywin Lannister|his father]] knows why she is in King's Landing, he will have her killed.\n\nIn Martin's draft, Bran's first vision is more extensive. While it does not include the [[Night King]]'s first appearance onscreen as it does in the series, it would have been an extensive [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of scenes from the past, present and possible future in the series. [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] would have included scenes of Ned cleaning Ice beneath a weirwood tree from the show's original pilot, Bran's uncle Benjen and Lyanna Stark as children (later shown in a more extensive flashback in season 6), [[Aerys II Targaryen|King Aerys]] watching and laughing as Ned's father and brother are burned and Jaime and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] embracing in the old keep at Winterfell just before Bran discovered them. Scenes reflecting the show's present included [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon]] with Ghost, a bloodied [[Robb Stark|Robb]] surrounded by the [[The Rains of Castamere|Red Wedding]] dead, and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] holding her sword Needle as her face blurs and changes. Possible future images include a dragon's shadow passing over King's Landing, \"hints of strange small children with very dark eyes\" and a group of four distinctive northern hills behind a very large weirwood.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nThe episode would also have set up some of the plotlines from the books that were not used in the later seasons of the series. Roose Bolton tells Ramsay that he has arranged for him to marry Arya as a way of consolidating the family's hold on the North; a role assigned to Sansa instead in [[Game of Thrones (season 5)|the next season]]. Several lines were also intended to set up Jaime's trip to the Riverlands, which in the books immediately follows Joffrey's wedding but in the series was largely replaced by Jamie and Bronn's expedition to Dorne to bring Myrcella back to King's Landing. The two characters who take that trip instead in the books, along with many other minor characters from the wedding scenes, were in Martin's draft but eliminated from the produced version as [[showrunner]]s [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]] were beginning to focus on the more established characters in the later seasons.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nRobinson believes a note by Martin in the script suggests a different resolution to Ramsay's plot arc in [[A Song of Ice and Fire|the books]], where he is still alive and in power at Winterfell at the end of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', in contrast to his death at the end of [[Game of Thrones (season 6)|the sixth season]] of ''Game of Thrones''. Martin's note told the showrunners that Ramsay's dogs would eventually battle the Stark children's direwolves, so the show should emphasize the former as much as possible to build audience anticipation. However, that never happened onscreen, where all but two of the wolves are dead as of the end of [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|season 7]], and seems unlikely in the books. Robinson believes this indicates that Ramsay will have a very different plot arc in the series' two final books.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nLesser differences include a more protracted, bloodier death scene for Joffrey as the poison drives him to slash his own face, a more lavish feast, and Theon's appearance as Reek following Ramsay's extensive torture more closely resembling that described in the books, complete with whitened hair and missing fingers, something that would have required more extensive special effects for the remainder of the series, as well as speaking in rhyme. Similarly, the burning of the heretics on the beach at Dragonstone would have demonstrated the power of the Lord of Light, with the bonfires suddenly changing to different colors and apparitions of the now-forgiven dead seen briefly above; the scene would have also foreshadowed [[The Dance of Dragons|Shireen's sacrifice by the same method the next season]]. The scene where Varys warns Tyrion that Cersei has told Tywin about Shae, a short conversation on a garden path in the finished episode, instead takes place at more length in the Red Keep's dungeons, with Varys dressed as \"a denizen of the dungeons\" in armor, carrying a whip and wearing a false beard.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\nMartin also wrote that some of the scenes should be [[Point-of-view shot|shot from an individual character's point of view]], much as most of his book chapters are written from the point of view of the character they take their name from. While he admitted that it had been difficult to bring that aspect of his story to the screen, he nevertheless attempted it here, calling for the scene where Ramsay and Myranda chase the woman to her death at the hands of his hounds to be seen from the woman's point of view as she runs and then falls to the ground, then from Theon's as he looks on defeated. The producers did, however, shoot scenes from the point of view of Bran's direwolf Summer, which Robinson notes saved them money since the animals have been expensive to shoot scenes with.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair article\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Sigur R\u00f3s band.jpg|thumb|right|Members of [[Sigur R\u00f3s]] appeared in the episode.]]\nThe episode has the introduction of new recurring cast members [[Roger Ashton-Griffiths]] as Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden, and Elisabeth Webster as Walda Frey, Roose Bolton's new bride.

His father worked as an [[:de:Glasbl\u00e4ser|artisanal glass blower]].<ref name=GRlautCCM/> As he matured, he showed a particular interest in [[Philosophy]], [[History]] and [[Art history]].<ref name=GRlautMW/> He left school at fourteen and trained for work as a postman.<ref name=GRvolgensDR/> Shortly after this, the telephone connections were cut and the trainee postman was given a telegram to take through to the forest. His orders were to deliver it by hand to a satellite concentration camp of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald complex]]. While visiting the camp, he met a group of half-starved camp detainees, closely guarded by armed, smartly uniformed officers. He would later recall the encounter as a formative element of his later life. He became the \"most-determined anti-fascist imaginable\".<ref name=GRlautCCM/> \n\nRoughly one year after his recruitment into the postal service, the [[Aftermath of World War II|war ended]]. After May 1945, the entire central portion of Germany was [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|administered]] as the [[Soviet occupation zone]] (to be relaunched in October 1949 as the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany |Soviet-sponsored]] [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]]. Under the egalitarian precepts of the military administrators he was chosen to return to school in order to complete the [[Abitur]], the schools' final exam leading to university-level education.<ref name=GRvolgensDR/> He graduated from his [[Aufbaugymnasium|\"Aufbaugymnasium\" (secondary school)]] at nearby [[Neudietendorf]] in 1949 and moved to the [[University of Jena]], where he studied for a degree not in Philosophy or History, but in [[Jurisprudence]].<ref name=GRlautMW/><ref name= GRlautRLS>{{cite web|title=5.7 Prof. Dr. Gerhard Riege   ....

The [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' / SED)]] was formed in April 1946 through the [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|contentious merger]] of the former [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]]. Although there are indications that the engineers of the merger intended that it should be implemented in [[Allied occupation of Germany|all four occupied zones]], it was only effected in the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. Driven by passionate anti-fascism and a determination that divisions on the political left should never again permit the emergence of a nationalist-populist government, Gerhard Riege was one of hundreds of thousands of Communists and others who promptly enrolled in the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], which over the next few years emerged as the ruling party in the [[National Front of the German Democratic Republic]]'s single-party [[Constitution of East Germany|dictatorship]], closely modelled on the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Leninist model]] which the [[Ulbricht Group|Ulbricht leadership team]] had studied in depth during their political exile in [[Moscow]] before 1945. Although a committed anti-fascist socialist, and therefore part of the political mainstream, there is no reason to believe that Gerhard Riege was a political activist during his student years, nor indeed during his time as a university teacher during the four decades following the founding of the state in October 1949. Sources indicate that at least by the standards of those times he was apolitical. For supporters and sympathisers, it is simply preposterous to believe that his academic success was in any way connected with [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Riege's party membership]]. Within academia, he was respected on account of his personal ability and integrity. He was able to present objectively based arguments through the power of his intellect. Those who agreed and those who disagreed with his point of view could join together in admiring the consistency of his intellectual positions, which were always philosophically aligned with the party's intellectual underpinnings, but which could ''never'' have been perceived as partisan or (even) intolerant.<ref name=GRlautMW/><ref name=GRlautCCM/> Admirers would recall not just his integrity and openness, but also his scrupulous politeness. Guido Henke, a former law student of Riege's who subsequently worked for him in a political capacity during the early 1990s, described him as \"a fine person, one of those who would apologise three times to an interlocutor before lifting the receiver if the telephone rang [during a one-on-one meeting]\".<ref name=GRlautCCM/><!---presumably in an age before answering machines, and in a totalitarian state it was unwise to leave the telephone unanswered if it rang, in case the caller was someone important--->\n\n===Ministry for State Security===\nDocuments that surfaced after [[German reunification|1990]] disclosed that in 1954 Gerhard Riege signed the a \"declaration of obligation\" statement in favour of the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security (Stasi)]]. This triggered the (already increasingly standardised) process whereby East German citizens enrolled as [[Unofficial collaborator|\"Informeller Mitarbeiter\" (\"IM\" / ''Stasi informers'')]]. Riege's senior position in a prestigious university gave him an unusual level of access to university teachers and other people of influence over current and future generations of opinion formers. For the security services, with their traditional mistrust of \"intellectuals\", he would have been a prime target, and his unswerving support of anti-fascist Socialism would have encouraged handlers to think him \"reliable\", even if there is no indication that he was much of a [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party activist]] - at least before 1990. The [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] were  meticulous and complete in their record keeping. In October 1990, directly after [[German reunification|reunification]], the government set up the [[Stasi Records Agency]] to organise and administer the surviving Stasi archives. The agency is generally identified in archives from the period as the Gauck Commission:  [[Joachim Gauck]] was the Federal Commissioner who headed it up between 1991 and 2000. It is unsurprising that Gerhard Riege was among the first of those on whom Stasi records were identified, sorted and consulted.<ref name= GRlautGH/><ref name=GRlautCCM/>   \n\nGerhard Riege was an active [[Unofficial collaborator|\"IM\"]] between 1954 and 1960. When invited to comment more than thirty years later, Riege pleaded forgetfulness.<ref name=\"Grashoff2006\"/> Given that professorial absent-mindedness was an aspect of Riege's personality that colleagues would have completely recognised, this was not a totally implausible explanation.<ref name=GRlautMW/> However, when presented with more evidence, he recalled that he had agreed to help the [[Stasi|Ministry officials]] as requested in 1954 because he had been trying to obtain an exit visa in order to undertake a research visit to [[West Germany|the west]]:  it had been explained to him that without helping the security services as requested, the privilege of foreign travel would never be his.<ref name=GRlautCCM/> After the [[Stasi Records Agency|Gauck commission]] had reviewed the relevant Stasi files, they concluded that the reports Riege furnished on colleagues were few in number and insubstantial in content. From the six years that he was an active \"IM\", there were only four surviving reports. Given that some Stasi files were hastily burned when [[Peaceful Revolution|East Germany collapsed]], it is impossible to be sure that he only submitted four reports on \"persons of interest to the authorities\" over the six years between 1954 and 1960, but there is no evidence of Stasi efforts to retain his service or re-recruit him after 1960. According to at least one source, subsequently researched Stasi files disclosed that it was indeed on 3 March 1960 that Riege \"refused further [Stasi] contact\".<ref name= 15021992lautHESL>{{cite web |title=Fake-Vorw\u00fcrfe |work=Leserbrief zum Artikel \"PDS-Bundestagsabgeordneter: 'Sie werden den Sieg \u00fcber uns voll auskosten' \" |date=15 February 2019|url=https://www.jungewelt.de/aktuell/rubrik/leserbriefe.php?letterId=42778 |author=Hans E.

In the context of the dismal personal chemistry between [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Erich Honecker]], and confronted by the winds of [[Glasnost]] blowing from, of all places, [[Moscow Kremlin|Moscow]], the East German leadership experienced a rapid collapse in self-confidence which was reflected in the dissolution from within of the repressive apparatus that had been constructed over forty years by the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]]. The ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (SED)]] hastily rebranded itself for a more democratic future as the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS)]]. (Re-engineering the party's inner soul would take a little longer.) SED loyalists, including Gerhard Riege, unhesitatingly signed their party membership over to the PDS. A [[1990 East German general election|general election]] was arranged for 18 March 1990. It would be the first (and last) East German general election in which the outcome had not been predetermined by the leaders of the  [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|ruling SED]] long before a single vote had been cast. For the \"new\" party there was an urgent need to field candidates who were competent and politically reliable, but who would not turn out to have been implicated in inhuman forms of political repression since 1949. The academic world was an obvious place to search for candidates, but most of the politically reliable were plainly unfamiliar with notions of multi-party democracy and had little credibility internationally. Gerhard Riege already had political experience as a former member of the [[Gera]] [[:de:Bezirkstag (DDR)|district Council]]<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/> and he enjoyed a certain level of academic recognition outside East Germany.<ref name=\"Quint2012\">{{cite book|author=Peter E.

Under the western-style proportional representation system introduced for the election, his name was included on the party list for an electoral district corresponding approximately with the former (and after 1990 re-established) [[Thuringia|state of Thuringia]]. To the surprise of commentators, when the votes were counted, it became apparent that his name had been high enough up on the party list to secure his election as a member of the [[Volkskammer]], East Germany's national parliament (which had hitherto been widely viewed by \"voters\" as a \"rubber stamp\" for decisions already taken elsewhere, within the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#Central Committee|Party Central Committee]]).<ref name=GRlautMW/><ref name=GRlautCCM/><ref name=\"Ploenus2007\">{{cite book|author=Michael Ploenus|title=\"Universit\u00e4re Wende: Sektion Soziale- und Politikwissenschaften\" |work=\"... so wichtig wie das t\u00e4gliche Brot\": das Jenaer Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus 1945 - 1990 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WqS17sDVam8C&pg=PA305 |year=2007 |publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag K\u00f6ln Weimar |isbn= 978-3-412-20010-7|pages=301\u2013305}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Bundestag]] Gerhard Riege tried to contribute to the creation of a new constitution for a newly united Germany. As a leading professor of constitutional law from the eastern half of the new state he was well qualified for the task. There had certainly been positive reactions from western constitutional experts in response to early drafts drawn up under his direction during 1989/90.<ref name=\"Quint2012\"/> However, the political power, backed by the economic muscle and the simple demographic differences between east and west meant that reunited Germany ended up with the constitutional arrangements of former West Germany. In the west there were certainly compromises made that involved adopting elements of the East German constitutional arrangements, notably in respect of abortion law, but from the perspective of the [[New states of Germany|\"new federal states\"]], the state that emerged from [[German reunification]] was in most respects and enlarged version of what had been [[West Germany]], with constitutional arrangements essentially those promulgated on 8 May 1949 in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]].<ref name=GrundgesetzlautEEJ>{{cite web|title=International law aspects of the German reunification:  Alternative answers to the German Question|author= Edward Elwyn Johnson|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009043103/http://www.eej-esq.com/PDFs/German_Reunification.pdf|date=9 October 2007 |pages=11 - 19 |language=English| accessdate=21 March 2020}}</ref> Surviving sources focus less on Riege's contribution to the German constitutional settlement after 1990, and more on the circumstances under which his Bundestag career came to an end in 1992.<ref name= GRlautGH/><ref name=GRlautCCM/>\n\n===A scapegoat?===\nAfter 1990 many East German politicians who were serious about building or sustaining a post-[[German reunification |reunification]] political career hastened to condemn the dictatorship and the party they had previously served. That was not Gerhard Riege's approach. As an East German professor of constitutional law he had never eulogised the achievements of the former [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] r\u00e9gime without qualification, and as a post-unification member of the Bundestag, he sustained a scholarly and essentially nuanced approach, generally avoiding gratuitous judgmentalism. Meanwhile, among the Bundestag members representing the (formerly western) centre-right [[CDU/CSU]] coalition, there were those who found themselves reluctant or unable to avoid a certain triumphalism. It is not entirely clear from sources precisely when suspicions on the political right that Gerhard Riege's disinclination unambiguously to condemn his (East German) socialist past meant that he \"must have been\" working for the hated [[Stasi]] were complemented and then supported up by emerging rumours, followed by initially imprecise reports, that the [[Stasi Records Agency|\"Gauck Commission\"]] had indeed found evidence in the Stasi archives that Riege had been an [[Unofficial collaborator|\"IM\"  (''Stasi informer'')]].<ref name=\"Ploenus2007\"/><ref name=GRlautCCM/> Throughout his relatively brief Bundestag career Gerhard Riege did, in any event, attract more criticism and gratuitous taunts than other [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS members]] from the more triumphalist (formerly western) assembly members.<ref name=GRlautMW/><ref name=GRlautUJH/>\n{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFDEAD|align=right|width=38%|\n* \"Mir fehlt die Kraft zum Leben und zum K\u00e4mpfen.

For Riege, education and scholarship were the priority. \"East Germany is a country where people read\" {{efn |\"Die DDR ist ein Leseland!.\"}} was the proud boast of this [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]-loving professor on behalf of his countrymen, apparently without quite acknowledging the price paid by some of those East German citizens less privileged than he. He was a sensitive legal scholar and not mentally equipped either to lock horns with parliamentary street-fighters or to find himself on the receiving end of the media hate-campaign to which he was already being subjected. In 1990, as a result of [[German reunification|reunification]], he had also, like others, undergone the rapid and permanent upending of basic socialist certainties. In that respect, as later became clear, Riege's ongoing state of shock and depression during his final two years of life reflected the experiences of millions of East Germans at the time.<ref name=GRlautCCM/> On Monday 10 February 1992, five days before his suicide, Riege confided to his parliamentary assistant, \"I hope I'll get through this week!\"{{efn |\"Hoffentlich \u00fcberstehe ich die Woche!\"}}. It was the start of a week during which the [[Stasi Records Agency|\"Gauck Commission\"]] findings into his work for the [[Stasi|Ministry For State Security (Stasi)]] during the 1950s were to be made available. If his memory of the Stasi relationship was truly as hazy as he had recently intimated to Bundestag comrades, he can have had little idea what the Gauck Commission findings would be. But he was terrified of the press reaction, of the unthinking \"small-town\" reactions of the people he came across in his daily life in and around [[University of Jena|the university]], and indeed of the reactions of his own party colleagues who were in many cases, he sensed, already instinctively distancing themselves from him.<ref name= GRlautGH/><ref name=GRlautCCM/>\n\nOn the evening of 14 February 1992 Gerhard Riege drove to [[Erfurt]] to take part in a meeting with his [[Thuringia|regional]] [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|party]] leadership. There was but a single item on the agenda:  [[Stasi|the Stasi]]. While comrades discussed Riege's \"Stasi past\" with him, across town the newspaper presses started running. In a piece of slightly more than thirty lines they reported that three of the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]] Bundestag members had been [[Unofficial collaborator|\"IMs\" (''Stasi informers'')]]. The reports added that other PDS Bundestag members had not seen that as any reason to demonstrate suspicion of the three parliamentary comrades in question. Afterwards, media defenders were keen to stress the strictly factual nature of the press reports. There had been no malice, no hounding; merely execution of the duty of the press to report the facts. Nevertheless, when Riege left the party meeting later that Thursday evening, he was, in words repeated by more than one commentator, \"a broken man\".<ref name=GRlautCCM/><ref name= 14021992lautSF>{{cite web|title=Leserbrief zum Artikel \"PDS-Bundestagsabgeordneter: 'Sie werden den Sieg \u00fcber uns voll auskosten' \" |date=15 February 2019|url=https://www.jungewelt.de/aktuell/rubrik/leserbriefe.php?letterId=42793|author=Sabine Fache |publisher=Linke Presse Verlags- F\u00f6rderungs- und Beteiligungsgenossenschaft junge Welt e.G., Berlin|accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nKarin Keschuba, the regional party chairwoman and leader of the Erfurt meeting, later agreed that participants had \"discussed between themselves\",{{efn |\"Wir haben auf dieser Sitzung miteinander geredet wie fr\u00fcher bei der SED.\"}} as they had at so many meetings before the rebranding and relaunch of the old [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]]. Neither Keschuba nor her fellow participants were keen to discuss the Erfurt meeting in much detail partly, according to one of them, out of respect for Riege's widow. But Keschuba did accept that, perhaps, the \"human dimension of the problem\" had, with the benefit of hindsight, been to some extent overlooked. Professor [Riege] had three times stressed that he had simply forgotten \"the matter\" [of his Stasi contacts]. [[:de:Dieter Str\u00fctzel|Dieter Str\u00fctzel]], the regional party deputy chair, who was also present, later shared his impression that \"Riege sometimes seemed not to know what else to do. He seemed to me helpless .... completely changed\". Several sources indicate that by the end of the meeting, rightly or wrongly, Riege had simply concluded that, after backing and belonging to the party for more than forty years, he was now being \"dumped\" by party comrades.<ref name=GRlautCCM/>\n\nShortly before leaving home on the morning of Friday 15 February 1992, Gerhard Riege asked his wife, \"What will Mangoldt think of me now?\" ([[:de:Hans von Mangoldt (Jurist)|Hans von Mangoldt]] was a law professor at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] and a long-standing friend.)

The [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' / SED)]] was formed in April 1946 through the [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|contentious merger]] of the former [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]]. Although there are indications that the engineers of the merger intended that it should be implemented in [[Allied occupation of Germany|all four occupied zones]], it was only effected in the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. Driven by passionate anti-fascism and a determination that divisions on the political left should never again permit the emergence of a nationalist-populist government, Gerhard Riege was one of hundreds of thousands of Communists and others who promptly enrolled in the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], which over the next few years emerged as the ruling party in the [[National Front of the German Democratic Republic]]'s single-party [[Constitution of East Germany|dictatorship]], closely modelled on the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Leninist model]] which the [[Ulbricht Group|Ulbricht leadership team]] had studied in depth during their political exile in [[Moscow]] before 1945. Although a committed anti-fascist socialist, and therefore part of the political mainstream, there is no reason to believe that Gerhard Riege was a political activist during his student years, nor indeed during his time as a university teacher during the four decades following the founding of the state in October 1949. Sources indicate that at least by the standards of those times he was apolitical. For supporters and sympathisers, it is simply preposterous to believe that his academic success was in any way connected with [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Riege's party membership]]. Within academia, he was respected on account of his personal ability and integrity. He was able to present objectively based arguments through the power of his intellect. Those who agreed and those who disagreed with his point of view could join together in admiring the consistency of his intellectual positions, which were always philosophically aligned with the party's intellectual underpinnings, but which could ''never'' have been perceived as partisan or (even) intolerant.<ref name=GRlautMW/><ref name=GRlautCCM/> Admirers would recall not just his integrity and openness, but also his scrupulous politeness. Guido Henke, a former law student of Riege's who subsequently worked for him in a political capacity during the early 1990s, described him as \"a fine person, one of those who would apologise three times to an interlocutor before lifting the receiver if the telephone rang [during a one-on-one meeting]\".<ref name=GRlautCCM/><!---presumably in an age before answering machines, and in a totalitarian state it was unwise to leave the telephone unanswered if it rang, in case the caller was someone important--->\n\n===Ministry for State Security===\nDocuments that surfaced after [[German reunification|1990]] disclosed that in 1954 Gerhard Riege signed the a \"declaration of obligation\" statement in favour of the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security (Stasi)]]. This triggered the (already increasingly standardised) process whereby East German citizens enrolled as [[Unofficial collaborator|\"Informeller Mitarbeiter\" (\"IM\" / ''Stasi informers'')]]. Riege's senior position in a prestigious university gave him an unusual level of access to university teachers and other people of influence over current and future generations of opinion formers. For the security services, with their traditional mistrust of \"intellectuals\", he would have been a prime target, and his unswerving support of anti-fascist Socialism would have encouraged handlers to think him \"reliable\", even if there is no indication that he was much of a [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|party activist]] - at least before 1990. The [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] were  meticulous and complete in their record keeping. In October 1990, directly after [[German reunification|reunification]], the government set up the [[Stasi Records Agency]] to organise and administer the surviving Stasi archives. The agency is generally identified in archives from the period as the Gauck Commission:  [[Joachim Gauck]] was the Federal Commissioner who headed it up between 1991 and 2000. It is unsurprising that Gerhard Riege was among the first of those on whom Stasi records were identified, sorted and consulted.<ref name= GRlautGH/><ref name=GRlautCCM/>   \n\nGerhard Riege was an active [[Unofficial collaborator|\"IM\"]] between 1954 and 1960. When invited to comment more than thirty years later, Riege pleaded forgetfulness.<ref name=\"Grashoff2006\"/> Given that professorial absent-mindedness was an aspect of Riege's personality that colleagues would have completely recognised, this was not a totally implausible explanation.<ref name=GRlautMW/> However, when presented with more evidence, he recalled that he had agreed to help the [[Stasi|Ministry officials]] as requested in 1954 because he had been trying to obtain an exit visa in order to undertake a research visit to [[West Germany|the west]]:  it had been explained to him that without helping the security services as requested, the privilege of foreign travel would never be his.<ref name=GRlautCCM/> After the [[Stasi Records Agency|Gauck commission]] had reviewed the relevant Stasi files, they concluded that the reports Riege furnished on colleagues were few in number and insubstantial in content. From the six years that he was an active \"IM\", there were only four surviving reports. Given that some Stasi files were hastily burned when [[Peaceful Revolution|East Germany collapsed]], it is impossible to be sure that he only submitted four reports on \"persons of interest to the authorities\" over the six years between 1954 and 1960, but there is no evidence of Stasi efforts to retain his service or re-recruit him after 1960. According to at least one source, subsequently researched Stasi files disclosed that it was indeed on 3 March 1960 that Riege \"refused further [Stasi] contact\".<ref name= 15021992lautHESL>{{cite web |title=Fake-Vorw\u00fcrfe |work=Leserbrief zum Artikel \"PDS-Bundestagsabgeordneter: 'Sie werden den Sieg \u00fcber uns voll auskosten' \" |date=15 February 2019|url=https://www.jungewelt.de/aktuell/rubrik/leserbriefe.php?letterId=42778 |author=Hans E.

As far as the availability of evidence allows, it is accordingly reasonable to endorse the conclusions of the [[Stasi Records Agency|Gauck commission]] that Riege's activity and impact as a [[Unofficial collaborator|registered Stasi informer]] were insubstantial (''unerheblich'') and insignificance (''eher bedeutungslos'').<ref name= GRlautGH/><ref name=GRlautCCM/><ref name=\"Grashoff2006\">{{cite book|author=Udo Grashoff|title=Selbstt\u00f6tungen aus \"Enttauschchung \u00fcber die politische Entwicklungen?\"   ....   \"Hunderte Opfer der Stasi-Hysterie?\"|work=\"In einem Anfall von Depression--\": Selbstt\u00f6tungen in der DDR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWNLF1EiXM0C&pg=PA255|date=September 2006|publisher=Ch.

In the context of the dismal personal chemistry between [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Erich Honecker]], and confronted by the winds of [[Glasnost]] blowing from, of all places, [[Moscow Kremlin|Moscow]], the East German leadership experienced a rapid collapse in self-confidence which was reflected in the dissolution from within of the repressive apparatus that had been constructed over forty years by the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]]. The ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party (SED)]] hastily rebranded itself for a more democratic future as the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS)]]. (Re-engineering the party's inner soul would take a little longer.) SED loyalists, including Gerhard Riege, unhesitatingly signed their party membership over to the PDS. A [[1990 East German general election|general election]] was arranged for 18 March 1990. It would be the first (and last) East German general election in which the outcome had not been predetermined by the leaders of the  [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|ruling SED]] long before a single vote had been cast. For the \"new\" party there was an urgent need to field candidates who were competent and politically reliable, but who would not turn out to have been implicated in inhuman forms of political repression since 1949. The academic world was an obvious place to search for candidates, but most of the politically reliable were plainly unfamiliar with notions of multi-party democracy and had little credibility internationally. Gerhard Riege already had political experience as a former member of the [[Gera]] [[:de:Bezirkstag (DDR)|district Council]]<ref name=\"EikBehling2017\"/> and he enjoyed a certain level of academic recognition outside East Germany.<ref name=\"Quint2012\">{{cite book|author=Peter E.

Under the western-style proportional representation system introduced for the election, his name was included on the party list for an electoral district corresponding approximately with the former (and after 1990 re-established) [[Thuringia|state of Thuringia]]. To the surprise of commentators, when the votes were counted, it became apparent that his name had been high enough up on the party list to secure his election as a member of the [[Volkskammer]], East Germany's national parliament (which had hitherto been widely viewed by \"voters\" as a \"rubber stamp\" for decisions already taken elsewhere, within the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany#Central Committee|Party Central Committee]]).<ref name=GRlautMW/><ref name=GRlautCCM/><ref name=\"Ploenus2007\">{{cite book|author=Michael Ploenus|title=\"Universit\u00e4re Wende: Sektion Soziale- und Politikwissenschaften\" |work=\"... so wichtig wie das t\u00e4gliche Brot\": das Jenaer Institut f\u00fcr Marxismus-Leninismus 1945 - 1990 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WqS17sDVam8C&pg=PA305 |year=2007 |publisher=B\u00f6hlau Verlag K\u00f6ln Weimar |isbn= 978-3-412-20010-7|pages=301\u2013305}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Bundestag]] Gerhard Riege tried to contribute to the creation of a new constitution for a newly united Germany. As a leading professor of constitutional law from the eastern half of the new state he was well qualified for the task. There had certainly been positive reactions from western constitutional experts in response to early drafts drawn up under his direction during 1989/90.<ref name=\"Quint2012\"/> However, the political power, backed by the economic muscle and the simple demographic differences between east and west meant that reunited Germany ended up with the constitutional arrangements of former West Germany. In the west there were certainly compromises made that involved adopting elements of the East German constitutional arrangements, notably in respect of abortion law, but from the perspective of the [[New states of Germany|\"new federal states\"]], the state that emerged from [[German reunification]] was in most respects and enlarged version of what had been [[West Germany]], with constitutional arrangements essentially those promulgated on 8 May 1949 in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]].<ref name=GrundgesetzlautEEJ>{{cite web|title=International law aspects of the German reunification:  Alternative answers to the German Question|author= Edward Elwyn Johnson|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009043103/http://www.eej-esq.com/PDFs/German_Reunification.pdf|date=9 October 2007 |pages=11 - 19 |language=English| accessdate=21 March 2020}}</ref> Surviving sources focus less on Riege's contribution to the German constitutional settlement after 1990, and more on the circumstances under which his Bundestag career came to an end in 1992.<ref name= GRlautGH/><ref name=GRlautCCM/>\n\n===A scapegoat?===\nAfter 1990 many East German politicians who were serious about building or sustaining a post-[[German reunification |reunification]] political career hastened to condemn the dictatorship and the party they had previously served. That was not Gerhard Riege's approach. As an East German professor of constitutional law he had never eulogised the achievements of the former [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] r\u00e9gime without qualification, and as a post-unification member of the Bundestag, he sustained a scholarly and essentially nuanced approach, generally avoiding gratuitous judgmentalism. Meanwhile, among the Bundestag members representing the (formerly western) centre-right [[CDU/CSU]] coalition, there were those who found themselves reluctant or unable to avoid a certain triumphalism. It is not entirely clear from sources precisely when suspicions on the political right that Gerhard Riege's disinclination unambiguously to condemn his (East German) socialist past meant that he \"must have been\" working for the hated [[Stasi]] were complemented and then supported up by emerging rumours, followed by initially imprecise reports, that the [[Stasi Records Agency|\"Gauck Commission\"]] had indeed found evidence in the Stasi archives that Riege had been an [[Unofficial collaborator|\"IM\"  (''Stasi informer'')]].<ref name=\"Ploenus2007\"/><ref name=GRlautCCM/> Throughout his relatively brief Bundestag career Gerhard Riege did, in any event, attract more criticism and gratuitous taunts than other [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS members]] from the more triumphalist (formerly western) assembly members.<ref name=GRlautMW/><ref name=GRlautUJH/>\n{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFDEAD|align=right|width=38%|\n* \"Mir fehlt die Kraft zum Leben und zum K\u00e4mpfen.

Examples included the following:\n* \"But now you're defending the old r\u00e9gime!

For Riege, education and scholarship were the priority. \"East Germany is a country where people read\" {{efn |\"Die DDR ist ein Leseland!.\"}} was the proud boast of this [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]-loving professor on behalf of his countrymen, apparently without quite acknowledging the price paid by some of those East German citizens less privileged than he. He was a sensitive legal scholar and not mentally equipped either to lock horns with parliamentary street-fighters or to find himself on the receiving end of the media hate-campaign to which he was already being subjected. In 1990, as a result of [[German reunification|reunification]], he had also, like others, undergone the rapid and permanent upending of basic socialist certainties. In that respect, as later became clear, Riege's ongoing state of shock and depression during his final two years of life reflected the experiences of millions of East Germans at the time.<ref name=GRlautCCM/> On Monday 10 February 1992, five days before his suicide, Riege confided to his parliamentary assistant, \"I hope I'll get through this week!\"{{efn |\"Hoffentlich \u00fcberstehe ich die Woche!\"}}. It was the start of a week during which the [[Stasi Records Agency|\"Gauck Commission\"]] findings into his work for the [[Stasi|Ministry For State Security (Stasi)]] during the 1950s were to be made available. If his memory of the Stasi relationship was truly as hazy as he had recently intimated to Bundestag comrades, he can have had little idea what the Gauck Commission findings would be. But he was terrified of the press reaction, of the unthinking \"small-town\" reactions of the people he came across in his daily life in and around [[University of Jena|the university]], and indeed of the reactions of his own party colleagues who were in many cases, he sensed, already instinctively distancing themselves from him.<ref name= GRlautGH/><ref name=GRlautCCM/>\n\nOn the evening of 14 February 1992 Gerhard Riege drove to [[Erfurt]] to take part in a meeting with his [[Thuringia|regional]] [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|party]] leadership. There was but a single item on the agenda:  [[Stasi|the Stasi]]. While comrades discussed Riege's \"Stasi past\" with him, across town the newspaper presses started running. In a piece of slightly more than thirty lines they reported that three of the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]] Bundestag members had been [[Unofficial collaborator|\"IMs\" (''Stasi informers'')]]. The reports added that other PDS Bundestag members had not seen that as any reason to demonstrate suspicion of the three parliamentary comrades in question. Afterwards, media defenders were keen to stress the strictly factual nature of the press reports. There had been no malice, no hounding; merely execution of the duty of the press to report the facts. Nevertheless, when Riege left the party meeting later that Thursday evening, he was, in words repeated by more than one commentator, \"a broken man\".<ref name=GRlautCCM/><ref name= 14021992lautSF>{{cite web|title=Leserbrief zum Artikel \"PDS-Bundestagsabgeordneter: 'Sie werden den Sieg \u00fcber uns voll auskosten' \" |date=15 February 2019|url=https://www.jungewelt.de/aktuell/rubrik/leserbriefe.php?letterId=42793|author=Sabine Fache |publisher=Linke Presse Verlags- F\u00f6rderungs- und Beteiligungsgenossenschaft junge Welt e.G., Berlin|accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nKarin Keschuba, the regional party chairwoman and leader of the Erfurt meeting, later agreed that participants had \"discussed between themselves\",{{efn |\"Wir haben auf dieser Sitzung miteinander geredet wie fr\u00fcher bei der SED.\"}} as they had at so many meetings before the rebranding and relaunch of the old [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]]. Neither Keschuba nor her fellow participants were keen to discuss the Erfurt meeting in much detail partly, according to one of them, out of respect for Riege's widow. But Keschuba did accept that, perhaps, the \"human dimension of the problem\" had, with the benefit of hindsight, been to some extent overlooked. Professor [Riege] had three times stressed that he had simply forgotten \"the matter\" [of his Stasi contacts]. [[:de:Dieter Str\u00fctzel|Dieter Str\u00fctzel]], the regional party deputy chair, who was also present, later shared his impression that \"Riege sometimes seemed not to know what else to do. He seemed to me helpless .... completely changed\". Several sources indicate that by the end of the meeting, rightly or wrongly, Riege had simply concluded that, after backing and belonging to the party for more than forty years, he was now being \"dumped\" by party comrades.<ref name=GRlautCCM/>\n\nShortly before leaving home on the morning of Friday 15 February 1992, Gerhard Riege asked his wife, \"What will Mangoldt think of me now?\" ([[:de:Hans von Mangoldt (Jurist)|Hans von Mangoldt]] was a law professor at the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] and a long-standing friend.) He then drove to his vegetable allotment on the edge of [[Jena |town]] where a few hours later a neighbour found his body hanging by the neck from a tree.

A sequel, titled ''[[Tanu Weds Manu: Returns]]'' was released on May 22, 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nManoj \"Manu\" Sharma ([[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]]) is an NRI doctor living in London. He comes to India to [[Arranged marriage|find an Indian bride]] and get married. His parents have already short-listed some girls for him to meet, and they, along with his friend Pappi ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) take him to [[Kanpur]] to meet Tanuja \"Tanu\" Trivedi ([[Kangana Ranaut]]). After they land in Kanpur, a bunch of goons grab Manu from the rail station and give him a few slaps, but when Pappi finds Manu he tells him to let it go. At Tanu's house, the two sets of parents find that they get on extremely well with each other, and decide that if Manu likes Tanu, they can finalize the matter immediately. There is one minor hitch: Tanu's mother tells her guests that Tanu has been ill since yesterday and is unable to rise from bed. She asks Manu to go up to Tanu's bedroom and meet her there. She shows Manu to Tanu's room and goes away to the kitchen. Tanu is very unresponsive, and Manu initially thinks that she is shy and bashful. He soon realizes that Tanu is in fact fast asleep. He gazes upon her beautiful sleeping figure, and promptly becomes enamored. He comes downstairs and tells both the families that he is willing to marry her.\n\nBefore making the engagement public, the families decide to go on a pilgrimage and seek the blessings of God. During the train journey, Tanu finds an opportunity to speak privately with Manu, and tells him that she had intentionally taken sleeping pills to fall asleep, to avoid meeting him. She tells him rudely that she loves someone else, and that she has her lover's name tattooed on her chest; she also tells him that the thugs who had roughed him up when he initially landed in Kanpur had been sent by her boyfriend. She demands that Manu should now reject her. Manu is extremely disappointed because he likes her immensely, but he dutifully does the decent thing. Taking the blame upon himself, and not revealing to anyone the fact that the girl is having a love affair with another man, he tells his father to convey to Tanu's parents that he has decided not to marry her. Tanu's parents are more than a little miffed at this turn of events, but since the forthcoming engagement was known only to them, there is no public loss of face.\n\nWeeks pass, and Manu's parents bring out other proposals from their shortlist for him to meet. He meets several prospective girls from suitable families, but cannot forget Tanu. One of the girls he meets is Ayushi (Neha Kaul), whose hand has become crooked due to some problem. While the two families are sitting together, Ayushi's brother Raja ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) comes home, bloodied and disheveled. His father expresses frustration that Raja keeps getting in fights. Later on the roof, Raja and Manu have a conversation where Raja advises Manu to marry his sister despite the condition of her hand as it does not stop her from doing her works properly, and it will heal with proper treatment anyway. Manu agrees that Ayushi is very nice but says he is 'helpless' and cannot marry her. Raja understands something is amiss and respects Manu for being honest.\n\nLater at home Manu declares he would rather not get married now, and expresses his wish to leave for London. But Pappi informs him about the wedding of another school friend Jassi ([[Eijaz Khan]]) and they travel to Punjab to attend it. Upon arriving, Manu finds out that Tanu is also attending the wedding, and that she is a friend of Payal ([[Swara Bhaskar]]), Jassi's bride-to-be. Jassi and Pappi advise Manu to try and win her over. Over the next few days, Manu and Tanu strike up a friendship. Tanu still has the boyfriend but enjoys Manu's attention, and when Manu inquires about her boyfriend she jokes that for her any guy (or even girl) would do as long as it is not her father's choice. Manu is encouraged. But someone else at the wedding is also crushing on Tanu, and seeing her and Manu spending time together he calls Tanu's parents with the intention of worrying them about a scandal. Jassi called and invited Manu's parents and incidentally both sets of parents arrive at the same time. Tanu thinks that Manu has called them up and is trying to reestablish their cancelled wedding connection. She is upset. This causes tension among her, Manu, Jassi and Payal; feeling guilty, Manu decides to leave. But Tanu comes to the rail station to stop him and tells him she is on the verge of eloping, that she and her lover are going to get secretly married in a registry office, and then present her parents with a ''fait accompli''. She asks him to be stay till the wedding.\n\nManu is heartbroken. As Pappi and he leave on a train back to Chandigarh, they meet Raja again, and after explaining to Raja how Manu is in love with someone, Raja states they will all go back to Kanpur and promises Manu he will marry him to any girl he falls in love with. Jassi also calls and tells Manu that he will not marry without him being present. As Manu and Pappi reach Jassi's \"baraat\", Manu receives a call from Raja, revealing that Raja is Tanu's boyfriend. Despite Pappi chiding him for it, Manu goes to the registrar's office to be a witness to Raja and Tanu's marriage. The man who is supposed to marry them is busy on the phone and when they are not able to find a pen to sign the papers the man says it is late anyway and they should come back tomorrow for their marriage. While going back, Raja tells Manu that he does not want to be married in this stealthy way, but Tanu's family would never accept him as nobody would recommend him to them properly. Hearing this, Manu later talks to Tanu's father, and convinces him to accept Raja. Tanu's father accepts somewhat unwillingly, and wonders out loud why Manu is doing this. He and Tanu's mother would prefer Manu as their son in law and had been delighted when they got the call about Manu and Tanu being together.\n\nTanu is scolded by Payal. She accuses Tanu for not being entirely happy with not having to elope- there is no novelty in a proper arranged marriage- not being grateful enough to Manu and not being able to see his love for her. Preparations for Tanu's wedding with Raja begin.  The wedding gift from Manu is a large poster, a collage of numerous photographs of Tanu in her various moods and poses, which Manu had snapped on various occasions, including the one of the first time Manu saw her. Tanu is touched. Later, Raja does not have the time to buy Tanu a wedding [[lehenga]] as he has to be somewhere else urgently, so he asks Manu to help him out. It is painful for Manu, but he goes with Tanu to shop for her bridal outfit. While coming back, Tanu asks him whether he actually had a pen with him at the registrar's office. Manu confesses that he did, and lied about not having one like an idiot because he didn't want her to marry Raja. He also talks about his lonely life in London, how he fell in love with Tanu at first sight and how however much he tried to stay away from her it didn't work. Meanwhile, one of the goons who beat Manu up on behalf of Raja has noticed them together in the jeep, recognized him and called Raja. Raja appears, and it is unclear how much of the conversation he has heard, but he takes Tanu away.\n\nRaja and Tanu have a fight. Tanu confesses she has feelings for Manu. Raja is angry, and demands Tanu still gets married to him as, a few months of fulfilling her wifely duties will make her forget everything.\n\nRaja drops Tanu home. She is torn and emotional, and pulling Manu aside she demands to clearly know whether he loves her or not. She will only believe it if Manu puts his palm on her cheek and professes his love. Manu does so. Tanu, relieved and elated, decides to marry Manu, not Raja.\n\nTanu's parents rejoice at this turn of events. Manu's parents are also on board with this alliance. But when everyone goes to Raja's place to cancel Tanu's wedding with him, a furious Raja threaten them with a gun and warns of dire consequences if Tanu is married to anyone other than him. He promises he will come to marry Tanu at due time. Everyone comes back worried but Manu is adamant on  his wedding with Tanu taking place. Tanu's father bribes an Inspector of Police as per the instruction of Pappi and Jassi, and gets Raja arrested on false charges. The plan is that Raja will remain in jail for a few days, during which time Tanu will be married and safely sent away. However, everyone is shocked to see that Raja is arriving with a wedding procession as promised, at the wedding venue at the same time as Manu, the bridegroom. Raja brandishes a gun and creates a scene. Manu however refuses to be scared and begins reasoning with Raja. Meanwhile, Tanu appears at the door, dressed as a bride, and tells Raja she would only be scared for Manu and as he is not scared, she is not either. The two of them begin to walk away together. Raja aims the gun and almost pulls the trigger, but thinks better of it in the end. He says no one wants him to marry Tanu, not even his mother has given him her blessings for it. He then reminds Manu of the promise he had made to him, and he decides to honor his promise, and tells Tanu he might be many things, but he is not a betrayer. Thus Raja decides to do the right thing, and congratulates the couple with quiet pain evident on his face. He leaves as the proceedings for Tanu and Manu's wedding start once more.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[R.

It wasn't long before you saw Shahid Kapoor playing a similar sacrificial lover to Kareena Kapoor in ''Jab We Met''. But the deja vu doesn't last long. For despite the predictable \u2013 and paper thin \u2013 storyline, the film manages to hook you with its sheer atmospherics. Fun while it lasts, Tanu Weds Manu throws up Bollywood's newest obsession \u2013 small town girls and their gunas (values) \u2013 once again. A meatier storyline and a less messed up climax would have worked wonders for the film.\"\n\nAnupama Chopra from ''[[NDTV]]'' gave 2.5/5 and noted \"Though the director picked up an interesting subject, he has not succeeded in executing his story effectively on screen \u2013 there are not enough laughs in the film. But there is something missing to make it a perfect romantic comedy. If you are looking for a great romantic comedy, this is not the one, but watch it for Madhavan and his chemistry with Deepak\".\n\nNoyon Jyoti Parasara of ''NowRunning.com'' too gave 2.5/5 and wrote \"''TWM'' turns out to be an average film because of the weak second half.

Sharma fails to maintain the zing till the very end though. A disappointing, lengthy and gabby third-act makes Tanu Weds Manu's running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes longer than it is.

A sequel, titled ''[[Tanu Weds Manu: Returns]]'' was released on May 22, 2015.\n\n==Plot==\nManoj \"Manu\" Sharma ([[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]]) is an NRI doctor living in London. He comes to India to [[Arranged marriage|find an Indian bride]] and get married. His parents have already short-listed some girls for him to meet, and they, along with his friend Pappi ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) take him to [[Kanpur]] to meet Tanuja \"Tanu\" Trivedi ([[Kangana Ranaut]]). After they land in Kanpur, a bunch of goons grab Manu from the rail station and give him a few slaps, but when Pappi finds Manu he tells him to let it go. At Tanu's house, the two sets of parents find that they get on extremely well with each other, and decide that if Manu likes Tanu, they can finalize the matter immediately. There is one minor hitch: Tanu's mother tells her guests that Tanu has been ill since yesterday and is unable to rise from bed. She asks Manu to go up to Tanu's bedroom and meet her there. She shows Manu to Tanu's room and goes away to the kitchen. Tanu is very unresponsive, and Manu initially thinks that she is shy and bashful. He soon realizes that Tanu is in fact fast asleep. He gazes upon her beautiful sleeping figure, and promptly becomes enamored. He comes downstairs and tells both the families that he is willing to marry her.\n\nBefore making the engagement public, the families decide to go on a pilgrimage and seek the blessings of God. During the train journey, Tanu finds an opportunity to speak privately with Manu, and tells him that she had intentionally taken sleeping pills to fall asleep, to avoid meeting him. She tells him rudely that she loves someone else, and that she has her lover's name tattooed on her chest; she also tells him that the thugs who had roughed him up when he initially landed in Kanpur had been sent by her boyfriend. She demands that Manu should now reject her. Manu is extremely disappointed because he likes her immensely, but he dutifully does the decent thing. Taking the blame upon himself, and not revealing to anyone the fact that the girl is having a love affair with another man, he tells his father to convey to Tanu's parents that he has decided not to marry her. Tanu's parents are more than a little miffed at this turn of events, but since the forthcoming engagement was known only to them, there is no public loss of face.\n\nWeeks pass, and Manu's parents bring out other proposals from their shortlist for him to meet. He meets several prospective girls from suitable families, but cannot forget Tanu. One of the girls he meets is Ayushi (Neha Kaul), whose hand has become crooked due to some problem. While the two families are sitting together, Ayushi's brother Raja ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) comes home, bloodied and disheveled. His father expresses frustration that Raja keeps getting in fights. Later on the roof, Raja and Manu have a conversation where Raja advises Manu to marry his sister despite the condition of her hand as it does not stop her from doing her works properly, and it will heal with proper treatment anyway. Manu agrees that Ayushi is very nice but says he is 'helpless' and cannot marry her. Raja understands something is amiss and respects Manu for being honest.\n\nLater at home Manu declares he would rather not get married now, and expresses his wish to leave for London. But Pappi informs him about the wedding of another school friend Jassi ([[Eijaz Khan]]) and they travel to Punjab to attend it. Upon arriving, Manu finds out that Tanu is also attending the wedding, and that she is a friend of Payal ([[Swara Bhaskar]]), Jassi's bride-to-be. Jassi and Pappi advise Manu to try and win her over. Over the next few days, Manu and Tanu strike up a friendship. Tanu still has the boyfriend but enjoys Manu's attention, and when Manu inquires about her boyfriend she jokes that for her any guy (or even girl) would do as long as it is not her father's choice. Manu is encouraged. But someone else at the wedding is also crushing on Tanu, and seeing her and Manu spending time together he calls Tanu's parents with the intention of worrying them about a scandal. Jassi called and invited Manu's parents and incidentally both sets of parents arrive at the same time. Tanu thinks that Manu has called them up and is trying to reestablish their cancelled wedding connection. She is upset. This causes tension among her, Manu, Jassi and Payal; feeling guilty, Manu decides to leave. But Tanu comes to the rail station to stop him and tells him she is on the verge of eloping, that she and her lover are going to get secretly married in a registry office, and then present her parents with a ''fait accompli.'' She asks him to be stay till the wedding.\n\nManu is heartbroken. As Pappi and he leave on a train back to Chandigarh, they meet Raja again, and after explaining to Raja how Manu is in love with someone, Raja states they will all go back to Kanpur and promises Manu he will marry him to any girl he falls in love with. Jassi also calls and tells Manu that he will not get married without him being present. As Manu and Pappi reach Jassi's \"baraat\", Manu receives a call from Raja, revealing that Raja is Tanu's boyfriend. Despite Pappi chiding him for it, Manu goes to the registrar's office to be a witness to Raja and Tanu's marriage. The man who is supposed to marry them is busy on the phone and when they are not able to find a pen to sign the papers the man says it is late anyway and they should come back tomorrow for their marriage. While going back, Raja tells Manu that he does not want to be married in this stealthy way, but Tanu's family would never accept him as nobody would recommend him to them properly. Hearing this, Manu later talks to Tanu's father, and convinces him to accept Raja. Tanu's father accepts somewhat unwillingly, and wonders out loud why Manu is doing this. He and Tanu's mother would prefer Manu as their son in law and had been delighted when they got the call about Manu and Tanu being together.\n\nTanu is scolded by Payal. She accuses Tanu for not being entirely happy with not having to elope- there is no novelty in a proper arranged marriage- not being grateful enough to Manu and not being able to see his love for her. Preparations for Tanu's wedding with Raja begin.  The wedding gift from Manu is a large poster, a collage of numerous photographs of Tanu in her various moods and poses, which Manu had snapped on various occasions, including the one of the first time Manu saw her. Tanu is touched. Later, Raja does not have the time to buy Tanu a wedding [[lehenga]] as he has to be somewhere else urgently, so he asks Manu to help him out. It is painful for Manu, but he goes with Tanu to shop for her bridal outfit. While coming back, Tanu asks him whether he actually had a pen with him at the registrar's office. Manu confesses that he did, and lied about not having one like an idiot because he didn't want her to get married to Raja. He also talks about his lonely life in London, how he fell in love with Tanu at first sight and how however much he tried to stay away from her it didn't work. Meanwhile, one of the goons who beat Manu up on behalf of Raja has noticed them together in the jeep, recognized him and called Raja. Raja appears, and it is unclear how much of the conversation he has heard, but he takes Tanu away.\n\nRaja and Tanu have a fight. Tanu confesses she has feelings for Manu. Raja is angry, and demands Tanu still gets married to him as, a few months of fulfilling her wifely duties will make her forget everything.\n\nRaja drops Tanu home. She is torn and emotional, and pulling Manu aside she demands to clearly know whether he loves her or not. She will only believe it if Manu puts his palm on her cheek and professes his love. Manu does so. Tanu, relieved and elated, decides to marry Manu, not Raja.\n\nTanu's parents rejoice at this turn of events. Manu's parents are also on board with this alliance. But when everyone goes to Raja's place to cancel Tanu's wedding with him, a furious Raja threaten them with a gun and warns of dire consequences if Tanu is married to anyone other than him. He promises he will come to marry Tanu at due time. Everyone comes back worried but Manu is adamant on  his wedding with Tanu taking place. Tanu's father bribes an Inspector of Police as per the instruction of Pappi and Jassi, and gets Raja arrested on false charges. The plan is that Raja will remain in jail for a few days, during which time Tanu will be married and safely sent away. However, everyone is shocked to see that Raja is arriving with a wedding procession as promised, at the wedding venue at the same time as Manu, the bridegroom. Raja brandishes a gun and creates a scene. Manu however refuses to be scared and begins reasoning with Raja. Meanwhile, Tanu appears at the door, dressed as a bride, and tells Raja she would only be scared for Manu and as he is not scared, she is not either. The two of them begin to walk away together. Raja aims the gun and almost pulls the trigger, but thinks better of it in the end. He says no one wants him to marry Tanu, not even his mother has given him her blessings for it. He then reminds Manu of the promise he had made to him, and he decides to honor his promise, and tells Tanu he might be many things, but he is not a betrayer. Thus Raja decides to do the right thing, and congratulates the couple with quiet pain evident on his face. He leaves as the proceedings for Tanu and Manu's wedding start once more.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[R.

According to critics, ''Tanu Weds Manu'' has a cliched storyline, but has some unconventional and unpredictable situations.

It wasn't long before you saw Shahid Kapoor playing a similar sacrificial lover to Kareena Kapoor in ''Jab We Met''. But the deja vu doesn't last long. For despite the predictable \u2013 and paper thin \u2013 storyline, the film manages to hook you with its sheer atmospherics. Fun while it lasts, Tanu Weds Manu throws up Bollywood's newest obsession \u2013 small town girls and their gunas (values) \u2013 once again. A meatier storyline and a less messed up climax would have worked wonders for the film.\"\n\nAnupama Chopra from ''[[NDTV]]'' gave 2.5/5 and noted \"Though the director picked up an interesting subject, he has not succeeded in executing his story effectively on screen \u2013 there are not enough laughs in the film. But there is something missing to make it a perfect romantic comedy. If you are looking for a great romantic comedy, this is not the one, but watch it for Madhavan and his chemistry with Deepak\".\n\nNoyon Jyoti Parasara of ''NowRunning.com'' too gave 2.5/5 and wrote \"''TWM'' turns out to be an average film because of the weak second half.

Sharma fails to maintain the zing till the very end though. A disappointing, lengthy and gabby third-act makes Tanu Weds Manu's running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes longer than it is.

{"title_page": "Dependency grammar", "text_new": "{{Linguistics|Grammar}}\n'''Dependency grammar''' ('''DG''') is a class of modern [[Grammar|grammatical]] theories that are all based on the dependency relation (as opposed to the relation of [[Phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]) and that can be traced back primarily to the work of [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]. Dependency is the notion that linguistic units, e.g. words, are connected to each other by directed links. The (finite) verb is taken to be the structural center of clause structure. All other syntactic units (words) are either directly or indirectly connected to the verb in terms of the directed links, which are called ''dependencies''. DGs are distinct from [[phrase structure grammar]]s, since DGs lack phrasal nodes, although they acknowledge phrases. Structure is determined by the relation between a word (a [[Head (linguistics)|head]]) and its dependents. Dependency structures are flatter than phrase structures in part because they lack a [[finite verb|finite]] [[verb phrase]] [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], and they are thus well suited for the analysis of languages with free word order, such as [[Czech language|Czech]] or [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]].\n\n==History==\nThe notion of dependencies between grammatical units has existed since the earliest recorded grammars, e.g. [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], and the dependency concept therefore arguably predates that of phrase structure by many centuries.<ref>Concerning the history of the dependency concept, see Percival (1990).</ref> [[Ibn Ma\u1e0d\u0101\u02be]], a 12th-century [[linguist]] from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], may have been the first grammarian to use the term ''dependency'' in the grammatical sense that we use it today. In early modern times, the dependency concept seems to have coexisted side by side with that of phrase structure, the latter having entered Latin, French, English and other grammars from the widespread study of [[term logic]] of antiquity.<ref>Concerning the influence of term logic on the theory of grammar, see Percival (1976).</ref> Dependency is also concretely present in the works of [[S\u00e1muel Brassai]] (1800\u20131897), a Hungarian linguist, [[:de:Franz Kern (Philologe)|Franz Kern]] (1830-1894), a German philologist, and of [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] (1850\u20131936), a Romanian linguist.<ref>Concerning dependency in the works of Brassai, see Imr\u00e9nyi (2013). Concerning dependency in the works of Kern, see Kern's essays (e.g. Kern 1883, 1884). Concerning dependency in the works of Tiktin, see Coseriu (1980).</ref>\n\nModern dependency grammars, however, begin primarily with the work of [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]. Tesni\u00e8re was a Frenchman, a [[polyglot]], and a professor of linguistics at the universities in Strasbourg and Montpellier. His major work ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de syntaxe structurale'' was published posthumously in 1959 \u2013 he died in 1954. The basic approach to syntax he developed seems to have been seized upon independently by others in the 1960s<ref>Concerning early dependency grammars that may have developed independently of Tesni\u00e8re's work, see for instance Hays (1960), Gaifman (1965), and Robinson (1970).</ref> and a number of other dependency-based grammars have gained prominence since those early works.<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars that were well established by the 1980s are from Hudson (1984), Sgall, Haji\u010dov\u00e1 et Panevova (1986), Mel\u2019\u010duk (1988), and Starosta (1988).</ref> DG has generated a lot of interest in Germany<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars from the German schools are from Heringer (1996), Engel (1994), Eroms (2000), and \u00c1gel et al. (2003/6) is a massive two volume collection of essays on dependency grammar and valency theory from more than 100 authors.</ref> in both theoretical syntax and language pedagogy. In recent years, the great development surrounding dependency-based theories has come from [[computational linguistics]] and is due, in part, to the influential work that [[David G. Hays|David Hays]] did in machine translation at the [[RAND Corporation]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Dependency-based systems are increasingly being used to parse natural language and generate [[Treebank|tree banks]]. Interest in dependency grammar is growing at present, international conferences on dependency linguistics being a relatively recent development ([http://depling.org Depling 2011], [http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/depling13/ Depling 2013], [http://depling.org/depling2015/ Depling 2015], [http://www.depling.org/depling2017/call.html Depling 2017], [http://www.depling.org/depling2019/ Depling 2019]).\n\n==Dependency vs. phrase structure==\nDependency is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element (e.g. word or morph) in the sentence, there is exactly one node in the structure of that sentence that corresponds to that element. The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency grammars are word (or morph) grammars. All that exist are the elements and the dependencies that connect the elements into a structure. This situation should be compared with [[Phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]. Phrase structure is a one-to-one-or-more correspondence, which means that, for every element in a sentence, there is one or more nodes in the structure that correspond to that element. The result of this difference is that dependency structures are minimal<ref>The minimality of dependency structures is emphasized, for instance, by Ninio (2006), Hudson 2007: 117, and by Osborne et al. (2011).</ref> compared to their phrase structure counterparts, since they tend to contain many fewer nodes.\n\n::::[[File:Wearetryingtounderstandthedifference (2).jpg|Dependency vs. phrase structure]]\n\nThese trees illustrate two possible ways to render the dependency and phrase structure relations (see below). This dependency tree is an \"ordered\" tree, i.e. it reflects actual word order. Many dependency trees abstract away from linear order and focus just on hierarchical order, which means they do not show actual word order. This constituency (= phrase structure) tree follows the conventions of [[Minimalist program|bare phrase structure]] (BPS), whereby the words themselves are employed as the node labels.\n\nThe distinction between dependency and phrase structure grammars derives in large part from the initial division of the clause. The phrase structure relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject [[noun phrase]] (NP) and a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] [[verb phrase]] (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and [[Noam Chomsky]]. Tesni\u00e8re, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as the root of all clause structure. Tesni\u00e8re's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from [[term logic]] and has no place in linguistics.<ref>Concerning Tesni\u00e8re's rejection of the subject-predicate division of the clause, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:103\u2013105), and for discussion of empirical considerations that support Tesni\u00e8re's point, see Matthews (2007:17ff.), Miller (2011:54ff.), and Osborne et al. (2011:323f.).</ref> The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax is real, then one is likely to go down the path of phrase structure grammar, while if one rejects this division, then one must consider the verb as the root of all structure, and so go down the path of dependency grammar.\n\n==Dependency grammars==\nThe following frameworks are dependency-based:\n[[File:Quranic-arabic-corpus.png|right|250px|thumb|Hybrid constituency/dependency tree from the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus]]]]\n\n::* [[Algebraic syntax]]\n::* [[Operator grammar]]\n::* [[Link grammar]]\n::* [[Functional generative description]]\n::* [[Lexicase]]\n::* [[Meaning\u2013text theory]]\n::* [[Word grammar]]\n::* [http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~rade/xdg.html Extensible dependency grammar]\n::* [[Universal Dependencies]]\n\n[[Link grammar]] is similar to dependency grammar, but link grammar does not include directionality between the linked words, and thus does not describe head-dependent relationships. Hybrid dependency/phrase structure grammar uses dependencies between words, but also includes dependencies between phrasal nodes \u2013 see for example the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus|Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank]]. The derivation trees of [[tree-adjoining grammar]] are dependency structures, although the full trees of TAG rendered in terms of phrase structure, so in this regard, it is not clear whether TAG should be viewed more as a dependency or phrase structure grammar.\n\nThere are major differences between the grammars just listed. In this regard, the dependency relation is compatible with other major tenets of theories of grammar. Thus like phrase structure grammars, dependency grammars can be mono- or multistratal, representational or derivational, construction- or rule-based.\n\n==Representing dependencies==\nThere are various conventions that DGs employ to represent dependencies. The following schemata (in addition to the tree above and the trees further below) illustrate some of these conventions:\n\n::[[File:Conventions.jpg|Conventions for illustrating dependencies]]\n\nThe representations in (a\u2013d) are trees, whereby the specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are ''dependency edges'' and lightly dotted lines are ''projection lines''. The only difference between tree (a) and tree (b) is that tree (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels.<ref>The conventions illustrated with trees (a) and (b) are preferred by Osborne et al. (2011, 2013).</ref> Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from linear order and reflects just hierarchical order.<ref>Unordered trees like (d) are associated above all with Tesni\u00e8re's stemmas and with the syntactic strata of Mel\u2019\u010duk's Meaning-Text Theory.</ref> The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by [[Word grammar|Word Grammar]].<ref>Three major works on Word Grammar are Hudson (1984, 1990, 2007).</ref> The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words.<ref>Lobin (2003) makes heavy use of these indentations.</ref> Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from linear order.\n\nThe point to these conventions is that they are just that, namely conventions. They do not influence the basic commitment to dependency as the relation that is grouping syntactic units.\n\n==Types of dependencies==\nThe dependency representations above (and further below) show syntactic dependencies. Indeed, most work in dependency grammar focuses on syntactic dependencies. Syntactic dependencies are, however, just one of three or four types of dependencies. [[Meaning\u2013text theory]], for instance, emphasizes the role of semantic and morphological dependencies in addition to syntactic dependencies.<ref>For a discussion of semantic, morphological, and syntactic dependencies in Meaning-Text Theory, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:191ff.) and Osborne 2019: Ch. 5).</ref> A fourth type, prosodic dependencies, can also be acknowledged. Distinguishing between these types of dependencies can be important, in part because if one fails to do so, the likelihood that semantic, morphological, and/or prosodic dependencies will be mistaken for syntactic dependencies is great. The following four subsections briefly sketch each of these dependency types. During the discussion, the existence of syntactic dependencies is taken for granted and used as an orientation point for establishing the nature of the other three dependency types.\n\n===Semantic dependencies===\nSemantic dependencies are understood in terms of [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s and their [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]]s.<ref>Concerning semantic dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:192f.).</ref> The arguments of a predicate are semantically dependent on that predicate. Often, semantic dependencies overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies. At times, however, semantic dependencies can point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or they can be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The hierarchy of words in the following examples show standard syntactic dependencies, whereas the arrows indicate semantic dependencies:\n\n::[[File:Semantic dependencies.png|Semantic dependencies]]\n\nThe two arguments ''Sam'' and ''Sally'' in tree (a) are dependent on the predicate ''likes'', whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on ''likes''. What this means is that the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point in the same direction (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence ''big'' is a predicate in tree (b) that takes ''bones'' as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate ''on'' takes the two arguments ''the picture'' and ''the wall''; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate ''to help'' in (d) takes the one argument ''Jim'' but is not directly connected to ''Jim'' in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.\n\n===Morphological dependencies===\nMorphological dependencies obtain between words or parts of words.<ref>Concerning morphological dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:193ff.).</ref> When a given word or part of a word influences the form of another word, then the latter is morphologically dependent on the former. Agreement and concord are therefore manifestations of morphological dependencies. Like semantic dependencies, morphological dependencies can overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies, overlap with and point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The arrows are now used to indicate morphological dependencies.\n\n:[[File:Mophological dependencies 1.png|Morphological dependencies 1]]\n\nThe plural ''houses'' in (a) demands the plural of the demonstrative determiner, hence ''these'' appears, not ''this'', which means there is a morphological dependency that points down the hierarchy from ''houses'' to ''these''. The situation is reversed in (b), where the singular subject ''Sam'' demands the appearance of the agreement suffix ''-s'' on the finite verb ''works'', which means there is a morphological dependency pointing up the hierarchy from ''Sam'' to ''works''. The type of determiner in the German examples (c) and (d) influences the inflectional suffix that appears on the adjective ''alt''. When the indefinite article ''ein'' is used, the strong masculine ending ''-er'' appears on the adjective. When the definite article ''der'' is used, in contrast, the weak ending ''-e'' appears on the adjective. Thus since the choice of determiner impacts the morphological form of the adjective, there is a morphological dependency pointing from the determiner to the adjective, whereby this morphological dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies. Consider further the following French sentences:\n\n::[[File:Morphological dependencies 2'.png|Morphological dependencies 2']]\n\nThe masculine subject ''le chien'' in (a) demands the masculine form of the predicative adjective ''blanc'', whereas the feminine subject ''la maison'' demands the feminine form of this adjective. A morphological dependency that is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies therefore points again across the syntactic hierarchy.\n\nMorphological dependencies play an important role in [[Linguistic typology|typological studies]]. Languages are classified as mostly [[Head-marking language|head-marking]] (''Sam work-s'') or mostly [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] (''these houses''), whereby most if not all languages contain at least some minor measure of both head and dependent marking.<ref>The distinction between head- and dependent-marking was established by Nichols (1986). Nichols was using a dependency-based understanding of these distinctions.</ref>\n\n===Prosodic dependencies===\nProsodic dependencies are acknowledged in order to accommodate the behavior of [[clitic]]s.<ref>Concerning prosodic dependencies and the analysis of clitics, see Gro\u00df (2011).</ref> A clitic is a syntactically autonomous element that is prosodically dependent on a host. A clitic is therefore integrated into the prosody of its host, meaning that it forms a single word with its host. Prosodic dependencies exist entirely in the linear dimension (horizontal dimension), whereas standard syntactic dependencies exist in the hierarchical dimension (vertical dimension). Classic examples of clitics in English are reduced auxiliaries (e.g. ''-ll'', ''-s'', ''-ve'') and the possessive marker ''-s''. The prosodic dependencies in the following examples are indicated with the hyphen and the lack of a vertical projection line:\n\n[[File:Prosodic dependencies'.png|Prosodic dependencies']]\n\nThe hyphens and lack of projection lines indicate prosodic dependencies. A hyphen that appears on the left of the clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word immediately to its left (''He'll'', ''There's''), whereas a hyphen that appears on the right side of the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word that appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (''He'll'', ''There's'') or on its head (''would've''). At other times, it can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (''Florida's'').\n\n===Syntactic dependencies===\nSyntactic dependencies are the focus of most work in DG, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many DGs can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. The basic question about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of DGs is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of phrase structure grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic [[constituent (linguistics)|tests for constituents]] being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis tests for constituents. [[Etymology|Etymological]] considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution.<ref>Distribution is primary principle used by Owens (1984:36), Schubert (1988:40), and Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:200) for discerning syntactic dependencies.</ref> When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.\n\n==Linear order and discontinuities==\nTraditionally, DGs have had a different approach to linear order (word order) than phrase structure grammars. Dependency structures are minimal compared to their phrase structure counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions.<ref>Concerning the importance of the two ordering dimensions, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:16ff).</ref> Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency structures has allowed DGs, starting with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re|Tesni\u00e8re]] (1959), to focus on hierarchical order in a manner that is hardly possible for phrase structure grammars. For Tesni\u00e8re, linear order was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesni\u00e8re produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesni\u00e8re adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-1.jpg|Two unordered trees]]\n\nThe traditional focus on hierarchical order generated the impression that DGs have little to say about linear order, and it has contributed to the view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, is that there is a dearth of DG explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard [[Discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]]. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of [[topicalization]], [[wh-movement|''wh''-fronting]], [[Scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]], and [[extraposition]] are mostly absent from many established DG frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with phrase structure grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.\n\nThe nature of the dependency relation does not, however, prevent one from focusing on linear order. Dependency structures are as capable of exploring word order phenomena as phrase structures. The following trees illustrate this point; they represent one way of exploring discontinuities using dependency structures. The trees suggest the manner in which common discontinuities can be addressed. An example from German is used to illustrate a scrambling discontinuity:\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-2.jpg|8 ordered trees]]\n\nThe a-trees on the left show [[discontinuity (linguistics)|projectivity]] violations (= crossing lines), and the b-trees on the right demonstrate one means of addressing these violations. The displaced constituent takes on a word as its [[head (linguistics)|head]] that is not its [[government (linguistics)|governor]]. The words in red mark the [[Catena (linguistics)|catena]] (=chain) of words that extends from the root of the displaced constituent to the [[government (linguistics)|governor]] of that constituent.<ref>See Osborne et al. (2012) concerning catenae.</ref> Discontinuities are then explored in terms of these catenae. The limitations on topicalization, ''wh''-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition can be explored and identified by examining the nature of the catenae involved.\n\n==Syntactic functions==\nTraditionally, DGs have treated the syntactic functions (= grammatical functions, [[grammatical relation]]s) as primitive. They posit an inventory of functions (e.g. subject, object, oblique, determiner, attribute, predicative, etc.). These functions can appear as labels on the dependencies in the tree structures, e.g.<ref>For discussion and examples of the labels for syntactic functions that are attached to dependency edges and arcs, see for instance Mel'cuk (1988:22, 69) and van Valin (2001:102ff.).</ref>\n\n::[[File:Syntactic functions 1.png|Syntactic functions 1]]\n\nThe syntactic functions in this tree are shown in green: ATTR (attribute), COMP-P (complement of preposition), COMP-TO (complement of to), DET (determiner), P-ATTR (prepositional attribute), PRED (predicative), SUBJ (subject), TO-COMP (to complement). The functions chosen and abbreviations used in the tree here are merely representative of the general stance of DGs toward the syntactic functions. The actual inventory of functions and designations employed vary from DG to DG.\n\nAs a primitive of the theory, the status of these functions is much different than in some phrase structure grammars. Traditionally, phrase structure grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject the existence of a finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue is a question of what comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas phrase structure grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.\n\nThis question about what comes first (the functions or the constellation) is not an inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (dependency and phrase structure) are not narrowly limited to the traditional views. Dependency and phrase structure are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, that are solely based on dependency or phrase structure, will likely reject the notion that the functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. They will take both to be primitive, which means neither can be derived from the other.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Catena (linguistics)|Catena]]\n*[[Constituent (linguistics)|Constituent]]\n*[[Dependency relation]] (in mathematics)\n*[[Discontinuity (linguistics)|Discontinuity]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Head-directionality parameter]]\n*[[Igor Mel'\u010duk]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]\n*[[Verb phrase]]\n*[[Universal Dependencies]]\n*[[Parse tree]]\n*[[Tree (data structure)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book|editor1-last=\u00c1gel |editor1-first=Vilmos |editor2-last=Eichinger |editor2-first=Ludwig M. |editor3-last=Eroms |editor3-first=Hans Werner |editor4-last=Hellwig |editor4-first=Peter |editor5-last=Heringer |editor5-first=Hans J\u00fcrgen |editor6-last=Lobin |editor6-first=Henning |title=Dependenz und Valenz:Ein internationales Handbuch der zeitgen\u00f6ssischen Forschung |trans-title=Dependency and Valency:An International Handbook of Contemporary Research |year=2003 |publisher=de Gruyter |location=Berlin |language=German |isbn=978-3110141900 |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/serial/18595 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}\n*Coseriu, E. 1980.

Dependency is the notion that linguistic units, e.g. words, are connected to each other by directed links. The (finite) verb is taken to be the structural center of clause structure. All other syntactic units (words) are either directly or indirectly connected to the verb in terms of the directed links, which are called ''dependencies''. DGs are distinct from [[phrase structure grammar]]s, since DGs lack phrasal nodes, although they acknowledge phrases. Structure is determined by the relation between a word (a [[Head (linguistics)|head]]) and its dependents. Dependency structures are flatter than phrase structures in part because they lack a [[finite verb|finite]] [[verb phrase]] [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], and they are thus well suited for the analysis of languages with free word order, such as [[Czech language|Czech]] or [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]].\n\n==History==\nThe notion of dependencies between grammatical units has existed since the earliest recorded grammars, e.g. [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], and the dependency concept therefore arguably predates that of phrase structure by many centuries.<ref>Concerning the history of the dependency concept, see Percival (1990).</ref> [[Ibn Ma\u1e0d\u0101\u02be]], a 12th-century [[linguist]] from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], may have been the first grammarian to use the term ''dependency'' in the grammatical sense that we use it today. In early modern times, the dependency concept seems to have coexisted side by side with that of phrase structure, the latter having entered Latin, French, English and other grammars from the widespread study of [[term logic]] of antiquity.<ref>Concerning the influence of term logic on the theory of grammar, see Percival (1976).</ref> Dependency is also concretely present in the works of [[S\u00e1muel Brassai]] (1800\u20131897), a Hungarian linguist, [[:de:Franz Kern (Philologe)|Franz Kern]] (1830-1894), a German philologist, and of [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] (1850\u20131936), a Romanian linguist.<ref>Concerning dependency in the works of Brassai, see Imr\u00e9nyi (2013). Concerning dependency in the works of Kern, see Kern's essays (e.g. Kern 1883, 1884). Concerning dependency in the works of Tiktin, see Coseriu (1980).</ref>\n\nModern dependency grammars, however, begin primarily with the work of [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]. Tesni\u00e8re was a Frenchman, a [[polyglot]], and a professor of linguistics at the universities in Strasbourg and Montpellier. His major work ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de syntaxe structurale'' was published posthumously in 1959 \u2013 he died in 1954. The basic approach to syntax he developed seems to have been seized upon independently by others in the 1960s<ref>Concerning early dependency grammars that may have developed independently of Tesni\u00e8re's work, see for instance Hays (1960), Gaifman (1965), and Robinson (1970).</ref> and a number of other dependency-based grammars have gained prominence since those early works.<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars that were well established by the 1980s are from Hudson (1984), Sgall, Haji\u010dov\u00e1 et Panevova (1986), Mel\u2019\u010duk (1988), and Starosta (1988).</ref> DG has generated a lot of interest in Germany<ref>Some prominent dependency grammars from the German schools are from Heringer (1996), Engel (1994), Eroms (2000), and \u00c1gel et al. (2003/6) is a massive two volume collection of essays on dependency grammar and valency theory from more than 100 authors.</ref> in both theoretical syntax and language pedagogy. In recent years, the great development surrounding dependency-based theories has come from [[computational linguistics]] and is due, in part, to the influential work that [[David G. Hays|David Hays]] did in machine translation at the [[RAND Corporation]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Dependency-based systems are increasingly being used to parse natural language and generate [[Treebank|tree banks]]. Interest in dependency grammar is growing at present, international conferences on dependency linguistics being a relatively recent development ([http://depling.org Depling 2011], [http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/depling13/ Depling 2013], [http://depling.org/depling2015/ Depling 2015], [http://www.depling.org/depling2017/call.html Depling 2017], [http://www.depling.org/depling2019/ Depling 2019]).\n\n==Dependency vs. phrase structure==\nDependency is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element (e.g. word or morph) in the sentence, there is exactly one node in the structure of that sentence that corresponds to that element. The result of this one-to-one correspondence is that dependency grammars are word (or morph) grammars. All that exist are the elements and the dependencies that connect the elements into a structure. This situation should be compared with [[Phrase structure grammar|phrase structure]]. Phrase structure is a one-to-one-or-more correspondence, which means that, for every element in a sentence, there is one or more nodes in the structure that correspond to that element. The result of this difference is that dependency structures are minimal<ref>The minimality of dependency structures is emphasized, for instance, by Ninio (2006), Hudson 2007: 117, and by Osborne et al. (2011).</ref> compared to their phrase structure counterparts, since they tend to contain many fewer nodes.\n\n::::[[File:Wearetryingtounderstandthedifference (2).jpg|Dependency vs. phrase structure]]\n\nThese trees illustrate two possible ways to render the dependency and phrase structure relations (see below). This dependency tree is an \"ordered\" tree, i.e. it reflects actual word order. Many dependency trees abstract away from linear order and focus just on hierarchical order, which means they do not show actual word order. This constituency (= phrase structure) tree follows the conventions of [[Minimalist program|bare phrase structure]] (BPS), whereby the words themselves are employed as the node labels.\n\nThe distinction between dependency and phrase structure grammars derives in large part from the initial division of the clause. The phrase structure relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject [[noun phrase]] (NP) and a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] [[verb phrase]] (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and [[Noam Chomsky]]. Tesni\u00e8re, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead to position the verb as the root of all clause structure. Tesni\u00e8re's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from [[term logic]] and has no place in linguistics.<ref>Concerning Tesni\u00e8re's rejection of the subject-predicate division of the clause, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:103\u2013105), and for discussion of empirical considerations that support Tesni\u00e8re's point, see Matthews (2007:17ff.), Miller (2011:54ff.), and Osborne et al. (2011:323f.).</ref> The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax is real, then one is likely to go down the path of phrase structure grammar, while if one rejects this division, then one must consider the verb as the root of all structure, and so go down the path of dependency grammar.\n\n==Dependency grammars==\nThe following frameworks are dependency-based:\n[[File:Quranic-arabic-corpus.png|right|250px|thumb|Hybrid constituency/dependency tree from the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus]]]]\n\n::* [[Algebraic syntax]]\n::* [[Operator grammar]]\n::* [[Link grammar]]\n::* [[Functional generative description]]\n::* [[Lexicase]]\n::* [[Meaning\u2013text theory]]\n::* [[Word grammar]]\n::* [http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~rade/xdg.html Extensible dependency grammar]\n::* [[Universal Dependencies]]\n\n[[Link grammar]] is similar to dependency grammar, but link grammar does not include directionality between the linked words, and thus does not describe head-dependent relationships. Hybrid dependency/phrase structure grammar uses dependencies between words, but also includes dependencies between phrasal nodes \u2013 see for example the [[Quranic Arabic Corpus|Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank]]. The derivation trees of [[tree-adjoining grammar]] are dependency structures, although the full trees of TAG rendered in terms of phrase structure, so in this regard, it is not clear whether TAG should be viewed more as a dependency or phrase structure grammar.\n\nThere are major differences between the grammars just listed. In this regard, the dependency relation is compatible with other major tenets of theories of grammar. Thus like phrase structure grammars, dependency grammars can be mono- or multistratal, representational or derivational, construction- or rule-based.\n\n==Representing dependencies==\nThere are various conventions that DGs employ to represent dependencies. The following schemata (in addition to the tree above and the trees further below) illustrate some of these conventions:\n\n::[[File:Conventions.jpg|Conventions for illustrating dependencies]]\n\nThe representations in (a\u2013d) are trees, whereby the specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are ''dependency edges'' and lightly dotted lines are ''projection lines''. The only difference between tree (a) and tree (b) is that tree (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels.<ref>The conventions illustrated with trees (a) and (b) are preferred by Osborne et al. (2011, 2013).</ref> Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from linear order and reflects just hierarchical order.<ref>Unordered trees like (d) are associated above all with Tesni\u00e8re's stemmas and with the syntactic strata of Mel\u2019\u010duk's Meaning-Text Theory.</ref> The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by [[Word grammar|Word Grammar]].<ref>Three major works on Word Grammar are Hudson (1984, 1990, 2007).</ref> The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words.<ref>Lobin (2003) makes heavy use of these indentations.</ref> Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from linear order.\n\nThe point to these conventions is that they are just that, namely conventions. They do not influence the basic commitment to dependency as the relation that is grouping syntactic units.\n\n==Types of dependencies==\nThe dependency representations above (and further below) show syntactic dependencies. Indeed, most work in dependency grammar focuses on syntactic dependencies. Syntactic dependencies are, however, just one of three or four types of dependencies. [[Meaning\u2013text theory]], for instance, emphasizes the role of semantic and morphological dependencies in addition to syntactic dependencies.<ref>For a discussion of semantic, morphological, and syntactic dependencies in Meaning-Text Theory, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:191ff.) and Osborne 2019: Ch. 5).</ref> A fourth type, prosodic dependencies, can also be acknowledged. Distinguishing between these types of dependencies can be important, in part because if one fails to do so, the likelihood that semantic, morphological, and/or prosodic dependencies will be mistaken for syntactic dependencies is great. The following four subsections briefly sketch each of these dependency types. During the discussion, the existence of syntactic dependencies is taken for granted and used as an orientation point for establishing the nature of the other three dependency types.\n\n===Semantic dependencies===\nSemantic dependencies are understood in terms of [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]s and their [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]]s.<ref>Concerning semantic dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:192f.).</ref> The arguments of a predicate are semantically dependent on that predicate. Often, semantic dependencies overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies. At times, however, semantic dependencies can point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or they can be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The hierarchy of words in the following examples show standard syntactic dependencies, whereas the arrows indicate semantic dependencies:\n\n::[[File:Semantic dependencies.png|Semantic dependencies]]\n\nThe two arguments ''Sam'' and ''Sally'' in tree (a) are dependent on the predicate ''likes'', whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on ''likes''. What this means is that the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point in the same direction (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence ''big'' is a predicate in tree (b) that takes ''bones'' as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate ''on'' takes the two arguments ''the picture'' and ''the wall''; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate ''to help'' in (d) takes the one argument ''Jim'' but is not directly connected to ''Jim'' in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.\n\n===Morphological dependencies===\nMorphological dependencies obtain between words or parts of words.<ref>Concerning morphological dependencies, see Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:193ff.).</ref> When a given word or part of a word influences the form of another word, then the latter is morphologically dependent on the former. Agreement and concord are therefore manifestations of morphological dependencies. Like semantic dependencies, morphological dependencies can overlap with and point in the same direction as syntactic dependencies, overlap with and point in the opposite direction of syntactic dependencies, or be entirely independent of syntactic dependencies. The arrows are now used to indicate morphological dependencies.\n\n:[[File:Mophological dependencies 1.png|Morphological dependencies 1]]\n\nThe plural ''houses'' in (a) demands the plural of the demonstrative determiner, hence ''these'' appears, not ''this'', which means there is a morphological dependency that points down the hierarchy from ''houses'' to ''these''. The situation is reversed in (b), where the singular subject ''Sam'' demands the appearance of the agreement suffix ''-s'' on the finite verb ''works'', which means there is a morphological dependency pointing up the hierarchy from ''Sam'' to ''works''. The type of determiner in the German examples (c) and (d) influences the inflectional suffix that appears on the adjective ''alt''. When the indefinite article ''ein'' is used, the strong masculine ending ''-er'' appears on the adjective. When the definite article ''der'' is used, in contrast, the weak ending ''-e'' appears on the adjective. Thus since the choice of determiner impacts the morphological form of the adjective, there is a morphological dependency pointing from the determiner to the adjective, whereby this morphological dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies. Consider further the following French sentences:\n\n::[[File:Morphological dependencies 2'.png|Morphological dependencies 2']]\n\nThe masculine subject ''le chien'' in (a) demands the masculine form of the predicative adjective ''blanc'', whereas the feminine subject ''la maison'' demands the feminine form of this adjective. A morphological dependency that is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies therefore points again across the syntactic hierarchy.\n\nMorphological dependencies play an important role in [[Linguistic typology|typological studies]]. Languages are classified as mostly [[Head-marking language|head-marking]] (''Sam work-s'') or mostly [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]] (''these houses''), whereby most if not all languages contain at least some minor measure of both head and dependent marking.<ref>The distinction between head- and dependent-marking was established by Nichols (1986). Nichols was using a dependency-based understanding of these distinctions.</ref>\n\n===Prosodic dependencies===\nProsodic dependencies are acknowledged in order to accommodate the behavior of [[clitic]]s.<ref>Concerning prosodic dependencies and the analysis of clitics, see Gro\u00df (2011).</ref> A clitic is a syntactically autonomous element that is prosodically dependent on a host. A clitic is therefore integrated into the prosody of its host, meaning that it forms a single word with its host. Prosodic dependencies exist entirely in the linear dimension (horizontal dimension), whereas standard syntactic dependencies exist in the hierarchical dimension (vertical dimension). Classic examples of clitics in English are reduced auxiliaries (e.g. ''-ll'', ''-s'', ''-ve'') and the possessive marker ''-s''. The prosodic dependencies in the following examples are indicated with the hyphen and the lack of a vertical projection line:\n\n[[File:Prosodic dependencies'.png|Prosodic dependencies']]\n\nThe hyphens and lack of projection lines indicate prosodic dependencies. A hyphen that appears on the left of the clitic indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word immediately to its left (''He'll'', ''There's''), whereas a hyphen that appears on the right side of the clitic (not shown here) indicates that the clitic is prosodically dependent on the word that appears immediately to its right. A given clitic is often prosodically dependent on its syntactic dependent (''He'll'', ''There's'') or on its head (''would've''). At other times, it can depend prosodically on a word that is neither its head nor its immediate dependent (''Florida's'').\n\n===Syntactic dependencies===\nSyntactic dependencies are the focus of most work in DG, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many DGs can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. The basic question about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of DGs is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of phrase structure grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic [[constituent (linguistics)|tests for constituents]] being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis tests for constituents. [[Etymology|Etymological]] considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution.<ref>Distribution is primary principle used by Owens (1984:36), Schubert (1988:40), and Mel\u02b9c\u0306uk (2003:200) for discerning syntactic dependencies.</ref> When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.\n\n==Linear order and discontinuities==\nTraditionally, DGs have had a different approach to linear order (word order) than phrase structure grammars. Dependency structures are minimal compared to their phrase structure counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions.<ref>Concerning the importance of the two ordering dimensions, see Tesni\u00e8re (1959:16ff).</ref> Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency structures has allowed DGs, starting with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re|Tesni\u00e8re]] (1959), to focus on hierarchical order in a manner that is hardly possible for phrase structure grammars. For Tesni\u00e8re, linear order was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesni\u00e8re produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesni\u00e8re adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-1.jpg|Two unordered trees]]\n\nThe traditional focus on hierarchical order generated the impression that DGs have little to say about linear order, and it has contributed to the view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on hierarchical order, however, is that there is a dearth of DG explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard [[Discontinuity (linguistics)|discontinuities]]. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of [[topicalization]], [[wh-movement|''wh''-fronting]], [[Scrambling (linguistics)|scrambling]], and [[extraposition]] are mostly absent from many established DG frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with phrase structure grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.\n\nThe nature of the dependency relation does not, however, prevent one from focusing on linear order. Dependency structures are as capable of exploring word order phenomena as phrase structures. The following trees illustrate this point; they represent one way of exploring discontinuities using dependency structures. The trees suggest the manner in which common discontinuities can be addressed. An example from German is used to illustrate a scrambling discontinuity:\n\n::[[File:Dg-new-2.jpg|8 ordered trees]]\n\nThe a-trees on the left show [[discontinuity (linguistics)|projectivity]] violations (= crossing lines), and the b-trees on the right demonstrate one means of addressing these violations. The displaced constituent takes on a word as its [[head (linguistics)|head]] that is not its [[government (linguistics)|governor]]. The words in red mark the [[Catena (linguistics)|catena]] (=chain) of words that extends from the root of the displaced constituent to the [[government (linguistics)|governor]] of that constituent.<ref>See Osborne et al. (2012) concerning catenae.</ref> Discontinuities are then explored in terms of these catenae. The limitations on topicalization, ''wh''-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition can be explored and identified by examining the nature of the catenae involved.\n\n==Syntactic functions==\nTraditionally, DGs have treated the syntactic functions (= grammatical functions, [[grammatical relation]]s) as primitive. They posit an inventory of functions (e.g. subject, object, oblique, determiner, attribute, predicative, etc.). These functions can appear as labels on the dependencies in the tree structures, e.g.<ref>For discussion and examples of the labels for syntactic functions that are attached to dependency edges and arcs, see for instance Mel'cuk (1988:22, 69) and van Valin (2001:102ff.).</ref>\n\n::[[File:Syntactic functions 1.png|Syntactic functions 1]]\n\nThe syntactic functions in this tree are shown in green: ATTR (attribute), COMP-P (complement of preposition), COMP-TO (complement of to), DET (determiner), P-ATTR (prepositional attribute), PRED (predicative), SUBJ (subject), TO-COMP (to complement). The functions chosen and abbreviations used in the tree here are merely representative of the general stance of DGs toward the syntactic functions. The actual inventory of functions and designations employed vary from DG to DG.\n\nAs a primitive of the theory, the status of these functions is much different than in some phrase structure grammars. Traditionally, phrase structure grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject the existence of a finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue is a question of what comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas phrase structure grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.\n\nThis question about what comes first (the functions or the constellation) is not an inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (dependency and phrase structure) are not narrowly limited to the traditional views. Dependency and phrase structure are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, be they based dependency or phrase structure, will likely reject the notion that the functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. They will take both to be primitive, which means neither can be derived from the other.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Catena (linguistics)|Catena]]\n*[[Constituent (linguistics)|Constituent]]\n*[[Dependency relation]] (in mathematics)\n*[[Discontinuity (linguistics)|Discontinuity]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Head-directionality parameter]]\n*[[Igor Mel'\u010duk]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]\n*[[Verb phrase]]\n*[[Universal Dependencies]]\n*[[Parse tree]]\n*[[Tree (data structure)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite book|editor1-last=\u00c1gel |editor1-first=Vilmos |editor2-last=Eichinger |editor2-first=Ludwig M. |editor3-last=Eroms |editor3-first=Hans Werner |editor4-last=Hellwig |editor4-first=Peter |editor5-last=Heringer |editor5-first=Hans J\u00fcrgen |editor6-last=Lobin |editor6-first=Henning |title=Dependenz und Valenz:Ein internationales Handbuch der zeitgen\u00f6ssischen Forschung |trans-title=Dependency and Valency:An International Handbook of Contemporary Research |year=2003 |publisher=de Gruyter |location=Berlin |language=German |isbn=978-3110141900 |url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/serial/18595 |accessdate=24 August 2012}}\n*Coseriu, E. 1980.

The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged [[#Standard library|standard library]].  Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] at [[Bell Labs]] since 1979 as an extension of the [[C (programming language)|C language]]; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided [[High-level programming language|high-level features]] for program organization.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bjarne Stroustrup's Homepage |url=http://www.stroustrup.com |website=www.stroustrup.com}}</ref> [[C++20]] is the next planned standard, keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years.<ref>{{cite web |title = C++; Where it's heading |url=https://dzone.com/articles/c-where-is-it-heading-and-what-are-the-new-feature}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:BjarneStroustrup.jpg|thumb|Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, in his AT&T New Jersey office c. 2000]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Bjarne Stroustrup]], a Danish [[computer scientist]], began work on \"{{visible anchor|C with [[Class (computer programming)|Classes]]}}\", the predecessor to C++.<ref name=\"invention3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#invention|title = Bjarne Stroustrup's FAQ: When was C++ invented?|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|website = stroustrup.com|date = 7 March 2010|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}\n</ref> The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that [[Simula]] had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while [[BCPL]] was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in [[AT&T Bell Labs]], he had the problem of analyzing the [[Unix|UNIX]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] with respect to [[distributed computing]]. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the [[C (programming language)|C]] language with [[Simula]]-like features.<ref name=\"evolving\">{{cite web |url = http://stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf|title = Evolving a language in and for the real world: C++ 1991-2006|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup}}\n</ref> C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including [[ALGOL 68]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]].\n\nInitially, Stroustrup's \"C with Classes\" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including [[class (computer programming)|classes]], [[derived class]]es, [[strong typing]], [[inlining]] and [[default argument]]s.<ref name=\"hopl2\">{{cite web|last1=Stroustrup|first1=Bjarne|title=A History of C ++ : 1979\u2212 1991|url=http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named \"C++\" (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>++</syntaxhighlight> being the [[increment operator]] in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including [[virtual function]]s, function name and [[operator overloading]], references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>//</syntaxhighlight>). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, [[Cfront]].\n\nIn 1985, the first edition of ''[[The C++ Programming Language]]'' was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.<ref name=\"1st-edition3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/1st.html|title = The C++ Programming Language|edition = First|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}\n</ref> The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.<ref name=\"invention3\"/>\n\nIn 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of ''The C++ Programming Language'' in 1991.<ref name=\"2nd-edition3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/2nd.html|title = The C++ Programming Language|edition = Second|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}</ref> New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, [[const correctness|const member functions]], and protected members. In 1990, ''The Annotated C++ Reference Manual'' was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included [[template (programming)|template]]s, [[exception handling|exceptions]], [[namespaces]], new [[cast (computer science)|cast]]s, and a [[Boolean datatype|Boolean type]].\n\n[[Image:20160121 CppFRUG Joel Falcou CppQuiz 3.jpg|thumb|left|A quiz on C++11 features being given in Paris in 2015]]\n\nIn 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update ([[C++03]]) was released in 2003.\n\nAfter C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the [[C++11]] standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers.

Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call (unless the function is marked with <code>constexpr</code>, in C++11). The dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the compilation unit (i.e. the same file). No guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.\n\n==== Thread storage duration objects ====\nVariables of this type are very similar to static storage duration objects. The main difference is the creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruction is done after the thread has been joined.<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.2\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration (see below for details) and destroyed in the ''reverse'' order of creation when the scope is left. This is implemented by allocation on the [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack]].\n\nLocal variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C++ destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed [[Resource Acquisition Is Initialization|RAII]], which is widely used in C++.\n\nMember variables are created when the parent object is created. Array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order. Member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation. i.e. If the parent is an \"automatic object\" then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members.\n\nTemporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated (usually at the <code>;</code> at the end of a statement).\n\n==== Dynamic storage duration objects ====\n{{Main|new and delete (C++)}}\n\nThese objects have a dynamic lifespan and can be created directly with a call to {{cpp|new}} and destroyed explicitly with a call to {{cpp|delete}}.<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.4\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

C++ supports function, class, alias, and variable templates. Templates may be parameterized by types, compile-time constants, and other templates. Templates are implemented by ''instantiation'' at compile-time. To instantiate a template, compilers substitute specific arguments for a template's parameters to generate a concrete function or class instance. Some substitutions are not possible; these are eliminated by an overload resolution policy described by the phrase \"[[Substitution failure is not an error]]\" (SFINAE). Templates are a powerful tool that can be used for [[generic programming]], [[template metaprogramming]], and code optimization, but this power implies a cost. Template use may increase code size, because each template instantiation produces a copy of the template code: one for each set of template arguments, however, this is the same or smaller amount of code that would be generated if the code was written by hand.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is in contrast to run-time generics seen in other languages (e.g., [[Generics in Java|Java]]) where at compile-time the type is erased and a single template body is preserved.\n\nTemplates are different from [[Macro (computer science)|macro]]s: while both of these compile-time language features enable conditional compilation, templates are not restricted to lexical substitution. Templates are aware of the semantics and type system of their companion language, as well as all compile-time type definitions, and can perform high-level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation of strictly type-checked parameters. Macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria, but cannot instantiate new types, recurse, or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre-compilation text-substitution and text-inclusion/exclusion. In other words, macros can control compilation flow based on pre-defined symbols but cannot, unlike templates, independently instantiate new symbols. Templates are a tool for static [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]] (see below) and [[generic programming]].\n\nIn addition, templates are a compile time mechanism in C++ that is [[Turing-complete]], meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, by a [[template metaprogramming|template metaprogram]] prior to runtime.\n\nIn summary, a template is a compile-time parameterized function or class written without knowledge of the specific arguments used to instantiate it. After instantiation, the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes (encoded in templates) from specific aspects (encoded in template parameters) without sacrificing performance due to abstraction.\n\n=== Objects ===\n{{Main|C++ classes}}\n\nC++ introduces [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) features to C. It offers [[class (computer science)|class]]es, which provide the four features commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages: [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[Information hiding|encapsulation]], [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. One distinguishing feature of C++ classes compared to classes in other programming languages is support for deterministic [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], which in turn provide support for the [[Resource Acquisition is Initialization]] (RAII) concept.\n\n==== Encapsulation ====\n[[Information hiding|Encapsulation]] is the hiding of information to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended and to make the usage model more obvious to the developer. C++ provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation. A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class (\"friends\"). A protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends.\n\nThe object-oriented principle ensures the encapsulation of all and only the functions that access the internal representation of a type. C++ supports this principle via member functions and friend functions, but it does not enforce it. Programmers can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and they are allowed to make public entities not part of the representation of a type. Therefore, C++ supports not just object-oriented programming, but other decomposition paradigms such as [[Modularity (programming)|modular programming]].\n\nIt is generally considered good practice to make all [[data]] private or protected, and to make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class. This can hide the details of data implementation, allowing the designer to later fundamentally change the implementation without changing the interface in any way.<ref name=\"cppcs\">{{Cite book |first1=Herb |last1=Sutter |first2=Andrei |last2=Alexandrescu |authorlink1=Herb Sutter |authorlink2=Andrei Alexandrescu |year=2004 |title=C++ Coding Standards: 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices |publisher = Addison-Wesley }}</ref><ref name=\"industrialcpp\">{{Cite book |last1=Henricson |first1=Mats |last2=Nyquist |first2=Erik |title=Industrial Strength C++ |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1997 |isbn=0-13-120965-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/industrialstreng0000henr }}</ref>\n\n==== Inheritance ====\n[[Inheritance (computer science)|Inheritance]] allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types. Inheritance from a [[base class]] may be declared as public, protected, or private. This access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public and protected members of the base class. Only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by \"inheritance\". The other two forms are much less frequently used. If the access specifier is omitted, a \"class\" inherits privately, while a \"struct\" inherits publicly. Base classes may be declared as virtual; this is called [[virtual inheritance]]. Virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph, avoiding some of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance.\n\n[[Multiple inheritance]] is a C++ feature not found in most other languages, allowing a class to be derived from more than one base class; this allows for more elaborate inheritance relationships. For example, a \"Flying Cat\" class can inherit from both \"Cat\" and \"Flying Mammal\". Some other languages, such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], accomplish something similar (although more limited) by allowing inheritance of multiple [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] while restricting the number of base classes to one (interfaces, unlike classes, provide only declarations of member functions, no implementation or member data). An interface as in C# and Java can be defined in C++ as a class containing only pure virtual functions, often known as an [[abstract base class]] or \"ABC\". The member functions of such an abstract base class are normally explicitly defined in the derived class, not inherited implicitly. C++ virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called [[Dominance (C++)|dominance]].\n\n=== Operators and operator overloading ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0.5em 0 1em 2em;\"\n|+ Operators that cannot be overloaded\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Operator\n! style=\"width: 9em\" | Symbol\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Scope resolution operator\n| {{C-lang| ::}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Conditional operator\n| {{C-lang| ?:}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | dot operator\n| {{C-lang| .}}\n|-\n\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Member selection operator\n| {{C-lang| .*}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | \"sizeof\" operator\n| {{C-lang| sizeof}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | \"typeid\" operator\n| {{C-lang| typeid}}\n|}\n{{Main|Operators in C and C++}}\nC++ provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be [[Operator overloading|overloaded]] for user-defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access (<code>.</code> and <code>.*</code>) as well as the conditional operator. The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user-defined types in C++ seem like built-in types.\n\nOverloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C++ programming techniques, such as [[smart pointer]]s. Overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands that the operator uses (any operand may however be ignored by the operator, though it will be evaluated prior to execution). Overloaded \"<code>&&</code>\" and \"<code>||</code>\" operators lose their [[short-circuit evaluation]] property.\n\n=== Polymorphism ===\n{{See also|Polymorphism (computer science)}}\n\n[[Type polymorphism|Polymorphism]] enables one common interface for many implementations, and for objects to act differently under different circumstances.\n\nC++ supports several kinds of ''static'' (resolved at [[compile-time]]) and ''dynamic'' (resolved at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]]) [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]s, supported by the language features described above. [[Compile-time polymorphism]] does not allow for certain run-time decisions, while [[runtime polymorphism]] typically incurs a performance penalty.\n\n==== Static polymorphism ====\n{{See also|Parametric polymorphism|ad hoc polymorphism}}\n\n[[Function overloading]] allows programs to declare multiple functions having the same name but with different arguments (i.e. [[ad hoc polymorphism|''ad hoc'' polymorphism]]). The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their [[Parameter (computer science)|formal parameter]]s. Thus, the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context in which it is used. The type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions and would result in a compile-time error message.\n\nWhen declaring a function, a programmer can specify for one or more parameters a [[default arguments|default value]]. Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, in which case the default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters at the end of the parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.\n\n[[Generic programming#Templates|Templates]] in C++ provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic, polymorphic code (i.e. [[parametric polymorphism]]). In particular, through the [[curiously recurring template pattern]], it's possible to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual functions. Because C++ templates are type-aware and [[Turing-complete]], they can also be used to let the compiler resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through [[template metaprogramming]]. Contrary to some opinion, template code will not generate a bulk code after compilation with the proper compiler settings.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |accessdate=8 March 2010 |publisher=EmptyCrate Software.

This allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing types (references cannot be directly held in containers). This enables dynamic (run-time) polymorphism, where the referred objects can behave differently, depending on their (actual, derived) types.\n\nC++ also provides the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> operator, which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object, via a base reference/pointer, to a more derived type: ''downcasting''. The ''attempt'' is necessary as often one does not know which derived type is referenced. (''Upcasting'', conversion to a more general type, can always be checked/performed at compile-time via <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>static_cast</syntaxhighlight>, as ancestral classes are specified in the derived class's interface, visible to all callers.) <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> relies on [[run-time type information]] (RTTI), metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships. If a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> to a pointer fails, the result is the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>nullptr</syntaxhighlight> constant, whereas if the destination is a reference (which cannot be null), the cast throws an exception. Objects ''known'' to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>static_cast</syntaxhighlight>, bypassing RTTI and the safe runtime type-checking of <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight>, so this should be used only if the programmer is very confident the cast is, and will always be, valid.\n\n===== Virtual member functions =====\nOrdinarily, when a function in a derived class [[Method overriding (programming)|overrides]] a function in a base class, the function to call is determined by the type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called [[dynamic dispatch]]. [[virtual functions|Virtual member functions]] or ''methods''<ref>{{Cite book |quote=A virtual member function is sometimes called a ''method''. |first=Bjarne |last=Stroustrup |year=2000 |page=310 |title=The C++ Programming Language |edition=Special |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn = 0-201-70073-5 }}</ref> allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run-time type of the object. In C++ implementations, this is commonly done using [[virtual function table]]s. If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by prepending a [[fully qualified name|fully qualified class name]] before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time.\n\nIn addition to standard member functions, operator overloads and destructors can be virtual. As a rule of thumb, if any function in the class is virtual, the destructor should be as well. As the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time, constructors, and by extension copy constructors, cannot be virtual. Nonetheless a situation may arise where a copy of an object needs to be created when a pointer to a derived object is passed as a pointer to a base object. In such a case, a common solution is to create a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>clone()</syntaxhighlight> (or similar) virtual function that creates and returns a copy of the derived class when called.\n\nA member function can also be made \"pure virtual\" by appending it with <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>= 0</syntaxhighlight> after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon. A class containing a pure virtual function is called an ''abstract class''. Objects cannot be created from an abstract class; they can only be derived from. Any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a non-pure definition of it (and all other pure virtual functions) before objects of the derived class can be created. A program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is ill-formed.\n\n=== Lambda expressions ===\nC++ provides support for [[anonymous function]]s, also known as lambda expressions, with the following form:\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n[capture](parameters) -> return_type { function_body }\n</source>\n\nThe return type of a lambda expression can also be automatically inferred, if possible, e.g.:\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n[](int x, int y) { return x - y; } // inferred\n[](int x, int y) -> int { return x + y; } // explicit\n</source>\n\nThe <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>[capture]</syntaxhighlight> list supports the definition of [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]].

C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes aggregate types ([[sequence container (C++)#Vector|vectors]], lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), [[algorithm]]s (find, [[Foreach loop|for_each]], [[Binary search algorithm|binary_search]], random_shuffle, etc.), input/output facilities ([[iostream]], for reading from and writing to the console and files), filesystem library, localisation support, [[smart pointers]] for automatic memory management, [[regular expression]] support, [[multithreading (software)|multi-threading]] library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that doesn't use C++ [[exception handling|exceptions]] into C++ exceptions, a [[random number generator]] and a slightly modified version of the [[C standard library]] (to make it comply with the C++ type system).\n\nA large part of the C++ library is based on the [[Standard Template Library]] (STL). Useful tools provided by the STL include [[container (data structure)|container]]s as the collections of objects (such as [[array data structure|vector]]s and [[linked list|lists]]), [[iterator]]s that provide array-like access to containers, and [[algorithm]]s that perform operations such as searching and sorting.\n\nFurthermore, (multi)maps ([[associative array]]s) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the [[feature (software design)|feature]]s of the [[library (computing)|library]] are accessed by using the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>#include</syntaxhighlight> [[directive (programming)|directive]] to include a [[standard header]]. The [[C++ Standard Library]] provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated.\n\nThe standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by [[Alexander Stepanov]], who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as \"STL\", as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html |author=Graziano Lo Russo |title=An Interview with A.

There were, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or [[operating system]]s (for example C++ ABI),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mentorembedded.github.io/cxx-abi/ |title=C++ ABI Summary |date=20 March 2001 |accessdate=30 May 2006 }}</ref> though they seem to be largely abandoned now.\n\n=== With C ===\n[[Image:C slash cpp.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|The relationship of C++ to C has always been a bit problematic]]\n{{Details|Compatibility of C and C++}}\n\nC++ is often considered to be a superset of [[C (programming language)|C]] but this is not strictly true.<ref name=\"superset\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#C-is-subset |title=Bjarne Stroustrup's FAQ&nbsp;\u2013 Is C a subset of C++? |accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly in C++ but there are a few differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example, C allows implicit conversion from <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>void*</syntaxhighlight> to other pointer types but C++ does not (for type safety reasons). Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>new</syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>class</syntaxhighlight>, which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program.\n\nSome incompatibilities have been removed by the 1999 revision of the C standard ([[C99]]), which now supports C++ features such as line comments (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>//</syntaxhighlight>) and declarations mixed with code. On the other hand, C99 introduced a number of new features that C++ did not support that were incompatible or redundant in C++, such as [[variable-length array]]s, native complex-number types (however, the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>std::complex</syntaxhighlight> class in the C++ standard library provides similar functionality, although not code-compatible), designated initializers, [[C syntax#Compound literals|compound literals]], and the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>restrict</syntaxhighlight> keyword.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.datacomm.ch/t_wolf/tw/c/c9x_changes.html |title=C9X \u2013 The New C Standard |accessdate=27 December 2008 }}</ref> Some of the C99-introduced features were included in the subsequent version of the C++ standard, [[C++11#Improved C compatibility|C++11]] (out of those which were not redundant).<ref>{{cite web |title=C++0x Support in GCC |url=https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html |accessdate=12 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=C++0x Core Language Features In VC10: The Table |url=https://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2010/04/06/c-0x-core-language-features-in-vc10-the-table.aspx |accessdate=12 October 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html |title=Clang - C++98, C++11, and C++14 Status |publisher=Clang.llvm.org |date=12 May 2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref> However, the C++11 standard introduces new incompatibilities, such as disallowing assignment of a string literal to a character pointer, which remains valid C.\n\nTo intermix C and C++ code, any function declaration or definition that is to be called from/used both in C and C++ must be declared with C linkage by placing it within an <syntaxhighlight style=white-space:nowrap lang=\"C++\" inline>extern \"C\" {/*...*/}</syntaxhighlight> block.

As expressed by [[Joshua Bloch]]: <blockquote> I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold, and yet there are a lot of people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, \u201cYes, we\u2019re using C++ but we\u2019re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we\u2019re not using operator overloading.\u201d There are just a bunch of features that you\u2019re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else\u2019s code, which I think is such a good thing. </blockquote>\n\n[[Donald Knuth]] (1993, commenting on pre-standardized C++), who said of [[Edsger Dijkstra]] that \"to think of programming in C++\" \"would make him physically ill\":<ref name=\"dobbsKnuth\" /><ref name=\"knuth1993\" /> <blockquote> The problem that I have with them today is that... C++ is too complicated. At the moment, it's impossible for me to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem, they said \"OK, we'll do them both\". So the language is too baroque for my taste. </blockquote>\n\n[[Ken Thompson]], who was a colleague of Stroustrup at Bell Labs, gives his assessment:<ref name=\"Seibel2009\" /><ref name=\"gigamonkeysWordpress\" /> <blockquote> It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it\u2019s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it\u2019s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it\u2019s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it\u2019s not a good language to transport an algorithm\u2014to say, \u201cI wrote it; here, take it.\u201d It\u2019s way too big, way too complex. And it\u2019s obviously [[Design by committee|built by a committee]]. \nStroustrup campaigned for years and years and years, way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair. And he said \u201cno\u201d to no one. He put every feature in that language that ever existed. It wasn\u2019t cleanly designed\u2014it was just the union of everything that came along. And I think it suffered drastically from that. </blockquote>\n\nHowever [[Brian Kernighan]], also a colleague at Bell Labs, disputes this assessment:<ref>{{cite video|people=Brian Kernighan|date=July 18, 2018|title=Brian Kernighan Q&A - Computerphile|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhR8cUX90&t=5m17s}}</ref> <blockquote>C++ has been enormously influential. ... Lots of people say C++ is too big and too complicated etc. etc. but in fact it is a very powerful language and pretty much everything that is in there is there for a really sound reason: it is not somebody doing random invention, it is actually people trying to solve real world problems. Now a lot of the programs that we take for granted today, that we just use, are C++ programs. </blockquote>\n\nStroustrup himself comments that C++ semantics are much cleaner than its syntax: \"within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out\".<ref>http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#really-say-that</ref>\n\nOther complaints may include a lack of [[reflection (computer programming)|reflection]] or [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], long compilation times, perceived [[feature creep]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://commandcenter.blogspot.mx/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html |title=Less is exponentially more |year=2012 |last=Pike |first=Rob}}</ref> and verbose error messages, particularly from template metaprogramming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yosefk.com/c++fqa/defective.html|title=Defective C++|first=Yossi|last=Kreinin|date=13 October 2009|accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[Comparison of programming languages]]\n* [[List of C++ compilers]]\n* [[Outline of C++]]\n* [[:Category:C++ libraries|C++ Libraries (category)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |first=David |last=Abrahams |authorlink=David Abrahams (computer programmer) |first2=Aleksey |last2=Gurtovoy  |title=C++ Template Metaprogramming: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques from Boost and Beyond |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-22725-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Andrei |last=Alexandrescu |authorlink=Andrei Alexandrescu |year=2001 |title=Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-70431-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Andrei |last=Alexandrescu |authorlink=Andrei Alexandrescu |first2=Herb |last2=Sutter |authorlink2=Herb Sutter|year=2004 |title=C++ Design and Coding Standards: Rules and Guidelines for Writing Programs |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-11358-6 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Pete |last=Becker |authorlink=Pete Becker |year=2006 |title=The C++ Standard Library Extensions : A Tutorial and Reference |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-41299-0 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Frank |last=Brokken |year=2010 |title=C++ Annotations |publisher=University of Groningen |isbn=90-367-0470-7 |url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/documents/cplusplus/ }}\n* {{Cite book |first=James O. |last=Coplien |authorlink=James O.

The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged [[#Standard library|standard library]].  Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] at [[Bell Labs]] since 1979 as an extension of the [[C (programming language)|C language]]; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided [[High-level programming language|high-level features]] for program organization.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bjarne Stroustrup's Homepage |url=http://www.stroustrup.com |website=www.stroustrup.com}}</ref> [[C++20]] is the next planned standard, keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years.<ref>{{cite web |title = C++; Where it's heading |url=https://dzone.com/articles/c-where-is-it-heading-and-what-are-the-new-feature}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:BjarneStroustrup.jpg|thumb|Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, in his AT&T New Jersey office c. 2000]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Bjarne Stroustrup]], a Danish [[computer scientist]], began work on \"{{visible anchor|C with [[Class (computer programming)|Classes]]}}\", the predecessor to C++.<ref name=\"invention3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#invention|title = Bjarne Stroustrup's FAQ: When was C++ invented?|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|website = stroustrup.com|date = 7 March 2010|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}\n</ref> The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that [[Simula]] had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while [[BCPL]] was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in [[AT&T Bell Labs]], he had the problem of analyzing the [[Unix|UNIX]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] with respect to [[distributed computing]]. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the [[C (programming language)|C]] language with [[Simula]]-like features.<ref name=\"evolving\">{{cite web |url = http://stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf|title = Evolving a language in and for the real world: C++ 1991-2006|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup}}\n</ref> C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including [[ALGOL 68]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]].\n\nInitially, Stroustrup's \"C with Classes\" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including [[class (computer programming)|classes]], [[derived class]]es, [[strong typing]], [[inlining]] and [[default argument]]s.<ref name=\"hopl2\">{{cite web|last1=Stroustrup|first1=Bjarne|title=A History of C ++ : 1979\u2212 1991|url=http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named \"C++\" (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>++</syntaxhighlight> being the [[increment operator]] in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including [[virtual function]]s, function name and [[operator overloading]], references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>//</syntaxhighlight>). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, [[Cfront]].\n\nIn 1985, the first edition of ''[[The C++ Programming Language]]'' was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.<ref name=\"1st-edition3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/1st.html|title = The C++ Programming Language|edition = First|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}\n</ref> The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.<ref name=\"invention3\"/>\n\nIn 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of ''The C++ Programming Language'' in 1991.<ref name=\"2nd-edition3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/2nd.html|title = The C++ Programming Language|edition = Second|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}</ref> New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, [[const correctness|const member functions]], and protected members. In 1990, ''The Annotated C++ Reference Manual'' was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included [[template (programming)|template]]s, [[exception handling|exceptions]], [[namespaces]], new [[cast (computer science)|cast]]s, and a [[Boolean datatype|Boolean type]].\n\n[[Image:20160121 CppFRUG Joel Falcou CppQuiz 3.jpg|thumb|left|A quiz on C++11 features being given in Paris in 2015]]\n\nIn 1998, C++98 was released, standardizing the language, and a minor update ([[C++03]]) was released in 2003.\n\nAfter C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the [[C++11]] standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers.

More formally, objects of this type have a lifespan that \"shall last for the duration of the program\".<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.1\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

First, \"static initialization\" is performed, and only ''after'' all static initialization is performed, \"dynamic initialization\" is performed.  In static initialization, all objects are first initialized with zeros; after that, all objects that have a constant initialization phase are initialized with the constant expression (i.e. variables initialized with a literal or <code>constexpr</code>). Though it is not specified in the standard, the static initialization phase can be completed at compile time and saved in the data partition of the executable.  Dynamic initialization involves all object initialization done via a constructor or function call (unless the function is marked with <code>constexpr</code>, in C++11). The dynamic initialization order is defined as the order of declaration within the compilation unit (i.e. the same file). No guarantees are provided about the order of initialization between compilation units.\n\n==== Thread storage duration objects ====\nVariables of this type are very similar to static storage duration objects. The main difference is the creation time is just prior to thread creation and destruction is done after the thread has been joined.<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.2\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

''[https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3797.pdf Programming Languages \u2013 C++11 Draft (n3797)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002093659/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3797.pdf |date=2 October 2018 }} \u00a73.7.3 Automatic Storage duration [basic.stc.auto]''</ref> The common feature about automatic variables is that they have a lifetime that is limited to the scope of the variable. They are created and potentially initialized at the point of declaration (see below for details) and destroyed in the ''reverse'' order of creation when the scope is left. This is implemented by allocation on the [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack]].\n\nLocal variables are created as the point of execution passes the declaration point. If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object. Local variables are destroyed when the local block or function that they are declared in is closed. C++ destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed [[Resource Acquisition Is Initialization|RAII]], which is widely used in C++.\n\nMember variables are created when the parent object is created. Array members are initialized from 0 to the last member of the array in order. Member variables are destroyed when the parent object is destroyed in the reverse order of creation. i.e. If the parent is an \"automatic object\" then it will be destroyed when it goes out of scope which triggers the destruction of all its members.\n\nTemporary variables are created as the result of expression evaluation and are destroyed when the statement containing the expression has been fully evaluated (usually at the <code>;</code> at the end of a statement).\n\n==== Dynamic storage duration objects ====\n{{Main|new and delete (C++)}}\n\nThese objects have a dynamic lifespan and can be created directly with a call to {{cpp|new}} and destroyed explicitly with a call to {{cpp|delete}}.<ref name=\"C++11 3.7.4\">[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

Use of {{cpp|new}} returns an address to the allocated memory.

C++ supports function, class, alias, and variable templates. Templates may be parameterized by types, compile-time constants, and other templates. Templates are implemented by ''instantiation'' at compile-time. To instantiate a template, compilers substitute specific arguments for a template's parameters to generate a concrete function or class instance. Some substitutions are not possible; these are eliminated by an overload resolution policy described by the phrase \"[[Substitution failure is not an error]]\" (SFINAE). Templates are a powerful tool that can be used for [[generic programming]], [[template metaprogramming]], and code optimization, but this power implies a cost. Template use may increase code size, because each template instantiation produces a copy of the template code: one for each set of template arguments, however, this is the same or smaller amount of code that would be generated if the code was written by hand.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is in contrast to run-time generics seen in other languages (e.g., [[Generics in Java|Java]]) where at compile-time the type is erased and a single template body is preserved.\n\nTemplates are different from [[Macro (computer science)|macro]]s: while both of these compile-time language features enable conditional compilation, templates are not restricted to lexical substitution. Templates are aware of the semantics and type system of their companion language, as well as all compile-time type definitions, and can perform high-level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation of strictly type-checked parameters. Macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria, but cannot instantiate new types, recurse, or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre-compilation text-substitution and text-inclusion/exclusion. In other words, macros can control compilation flow based on pre-defined symbols but cannot, unlike templates, independently instantiate new symbols. Templates are a tool for static [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]] (see below) and [[generic programming]].\n\nIn addition, templates are a compile time mechanism in C++ that is [[Turing-complete]], meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, by a [[template metaprogramming|template metaprogram]] prior to runtime.\n\nIn summary, a template is a compile-time parameterized function or class written without knowledge of the specific arguments used to instantiate it. After instantiation, the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes (encoded in templates) from specific aspects (encoded in template parameters) without sacrificing performance due to abstraction.\n\n=== Objects ===\n{{Main|C++ classes}}\n\nC++ introduces [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) features to C. It offers [[class (computer science)|class]]es, which provide the four features commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages: [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[Information hiding|encapsulation]], [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. One distinguishing feature of C++ classes compared to classes in other programming languages is support for deterministic [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], which in turn provide support for the [[Resource Acquisition is Initialization]] (RAII) concept.\n\n==== Encapsulation ====\n[[Information hiding|Encapsulation]] is the hiding of information to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended and to make the usage model more obvious to the developer. C++ provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation. A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class (\"friends\"). A protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends.\n\nThe object-oriented principle ensures the encapsulation of all and only the functions that access the internal representation of a type. C++ supports this principle via member functions and friend functions, but it does not enforce it. Programmers can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and they are allowed to make public entities not part of the representation of a type. Therefore, C++ supports not just object-oriented programming, but other decomposition paradigms such as [[Modularity (programming)|modular programming]].\n\nIt is generally considered good practice to make all [[data]] private or protected, and to make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class. This can hide the details of data implementation, allowing the designer to later fundamentally change the implementation without changing the interface in any way.<ref name=\"cppcs\">{{Cite book |first1=Herb |last1=Sutter |first2=Andrei |last2=Alexandrescu |authorlink1=Herb Sutter |authorlink2=Andrei Alexandrescu |year=2004 |title=C++ Coding Standards: 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices |publisher = Addison-Wesley }}</ref><ref name=\"industrialcpp\">{{Cite book |last1=Henricson |first1=Mats |last2=Nyquist |first2=Erik |title=Industrial Strength C++ |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1997 |isbn=0-13-120965-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/industrialstreng0000henr }}</ref>\n\n==== Inheritance ====\n[[Inheritance (computer science)|Inheritance]] allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types. Inheritance from a [[base class]] may be declared as public, protected, or private. This access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public and protected members of the base class. Only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by \"inheritance\". The other two forms are much less frequently used. If the access specifier is omitted, a \"class\" inherits privately, while a \"struct\" inherits publicly. Base classes may be declared as virtual; this is called [[virtual inheritance]]. Virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph, avoiding some of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance.\n\n[[Multiple inheritance]] is a C++ feature not found in most other languages, allowing a class to be derived from more than one base class; this allows for more elaborate inheritance relationships. For example, a \"Flying Cat\" class can inherit from both \"Cat\" and \"Flying Mammal\". Some other languages, such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], accomplish something similar (although more limited) by allowing inheritance of multiple [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] while restricting the number of base classes to one (interfaces, unlike classes, provide only declarations of member functions, no implementation or member data). An interface as in C# and Java can be defined in C++ as a class containing only pure virtual functions, often known as an [[abstract base class]] or \"ABC\". The member functions of such an abstract base class are normally explicitly defined in the derived class, not inherited implicitly. C++ virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called [[Dominance (C++)|dominance]].\n\n=== Operators and operator overloading ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0.5em 0 1em 2em;\"\n|+ Operators that cannot be overloaded\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Operator\n! style=\"width: 9em\" | Symbol\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Scope resolution operator\n| {{C-lang| ::}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Conditional operator\n| {{C-lang| ?:}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | dot operator\n| {{C-lang| .}}\n|-\n\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Member selection operator\n| {{C-lang| .*}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | \"sizeof\" operator\n| {{C-lang| sizeof}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | \"typeid\" operator\n| {{C-lang| typeid}}\n|}\n{{Main|Operators in C and C++}}\nC++ provides more than 35 operators, covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be [[Operator overloading|overloaded]] for user-defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access (<code>.</code> and <code>.*</code>) as well as the conditional operator. The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user-defined types in C++ seem like built-in types.\n\nOverloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C++ programming techniques, such as [[smart pointer]]s. Overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands that the operator uses (any operand may however be ignored by the operator, though it will be evaluated prior to execution). Overloaded \"<code>&&</code>\" and \"<code>||</code>\" operators lose their [[short-circuit evaluation]] property.\n\n=== Polymorphism ===\n{{See also|Polymorphism (computer science)}}\n\n[[Type polymorphism|Polymorphism]] enables one common interface for many implementations, and for objects to act differently under different circumstances.\n\nC++ supports several kinds of ''static'' (resolved at [[compile-time]]) and ''dynamic'' (resolved at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]]) [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]s, supported by the language features described above. [[Compile-time polymorphism]] does not allow for certain run-time decisions, while [[runtime polymorphism]] typically incurs a performance penalty.\n\n==== Static polymorphism ====\n{{See also|Parametric polymorphism|ad hoc polymorphism}}\n\n[[Function overloading]] allows programs to declare multiple functions having the same name but with different arguments (i.e. [[ad hoc polymorphism|''ad hoc'' polymorphism]]). The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their [[Parameter (computer science)|formal parameter]]s. Thus, the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context in which it is used. The type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions and would result in a compile-time error message.\n\nWhen declaring a function, a programmer can specify for one or more parameters a [[default arguments|default value]]. Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, in which case the default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters at the end of the parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.\n\n[[Generic programming#Templates|Templates]] in C++ provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic, polymorphic code (i.e. [[parametric polymorphism]]). In particular, through the [[curiously recurring template pattern]], it's possible to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual functions. Because C++ templates are type-aware and [[Turing-complete]], they can also be used to let the compiler resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through [[template metaprogramming]]. Contrary to some opinion, template code will not generate a bulk code after compilation with the proper compiler settings.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |accessdate=8 March 2010 |publisher=EmptyCrate Software.

This allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing types (references cannot be directly held in containers). This enables dynamic (run-time) polymorphism, where the referred objects can behave differently, depending on their (actual, derived) types.\n\nC++ also provides the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> operator, which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object, via a base reference/pointer, to a more derived type: ''downcasting''. The ''attempt'' is necessary as often one does not know which derived type is referenced. (''Upcasting'', conversion to a more general type, can always be checked/performed at compile-time via <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>static_cast</syntaxhighlight>, as ancestral classes are specified in the derived class's interface, visible to all callers.) <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> relies on [[run-time type information]] (RTTI), metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships. If a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight> to a pointer fails, the result is the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>nullptr</syntaxhighlight> constant, whereas if the destination is a reference (which cannot be null), the cast throws an exception. Objects ''known'' to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>static_cast</syntaxhighlight>, bypassing RTTI and the safe runtime type-checking of <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>dynamic_cast</syntaxhighlight>, so this should be used only if the programmer is very confident the cast is, and will always be, valid.\n\n===== Virtual member functions =====\nOrdinarily, when a function in a derived class [[Method overriding (programming)|overrides]] a function in a base class, the function to call is determined by the type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called [[dynamic dispatch]]. [[virtual functions|Virtual member functions]] or ''methods''<ref>{{Cite book |quote=A virtual member function is sometimes called a ''method''. |first=Bjarne |last=Stroustrup |year=2000 |page=310 |title=The C++ Programming Language |edition=Special |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn = 0-201-70073-5 }}</ref> allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run-time type of the object. In C++ implementations, this is commonly done using [[virtual function table]]s. If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by prepending a [[fully qualified name|fully qualified class name]] before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time.\n\nIn addition to standard member functions, operator overloads and destructors can be virtual. As a rule of thumb, if any function in the class is virtual, the destructor should be as well. As the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time, constructors, and by extension copy constructors, cannot be virtual. Nonetheless a situation may arise where a copy of an object needs to be created when a pointer to a derived object is passed as a pointer to a base object. In such a case, a common solution is to create a <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>clone()</syntaxhighlight> (or similar) virtual function that creates and returns a copy of the derived class when called.\n\nA member function can also be made \"pure virtual\" by appending it with <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>= 0</syntaxhighlight> after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon. A class containing a pure virtual function is called an ''abstract class''. Objects cannot be created from an abstract class; they can only be derived from. Any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a non-pure definition of it (and all other pure virtual functions) before objects of the derived class can be created. A program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is ill-formed.\n\n=== Lambda expressions ===\nC++ provides support for [[anonymous function]]s, also known as lambda expressions, with the following form:\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n[capture](parameters) -> return_type { function_body }\n</source>\n\nThe return type of a lambda expression can also be automatically inferred, if possible, e.g.:\n\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\n[](int x, int y) { return x - y; } // inferred\n[](int x, int y) -> int { return x + y; } // explicit\n</source>\n\nThe <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>[capture]</syntaxhighlight> list supports the definition of [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]]. Such lambda expressions are defined in the standard as [[syntactic sugar]] for an unnamed [[function object]].\n\n=== Exception handling ===\nException handling is used to communicate the existence of a runtime problem or error from where it was detected to where the issue can be handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/CandC++/lecture7.pdf|title = <nowiki>C and C++ Exceptions | Templates</nowiki>|date = 2013|accessdate = 30 August 2016|website = Cambridge Computer Laboratory - Course Materials 2013-14|publisher = |last = Mycroft|first = Alan}}</ref> It permits this to be done in a uniform manner and separately from the main code, while detecting all errors.<ref name=\"exception_summary\">{{Cite book|title = The C++ Programming Language|last = Stroustrup|first = Bjarne|publisher = Addison Wesley|year = 2013|isbn = 9780321563842|location = |pages = 345}}</ref> Should an error occur, an exception is thrown (raised), which is then caught by the nearest suitable exception handler.

This cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the maximum time required for an exception to be handled.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The C++ Programming Language|last = Stroustrup|first = Bjarne|publisher = Addison Wesley|year = 2013|isbn = 9780321563842|location = |pages = 349}}</ref>\n\nUnlike [[Signal handler|signal handling]], in which the handling function is called from the point of failure, exception handling exits the current scope before the catch block is entered, which may be located in the current function or any of the previous function calls currently on the stack.\n\n== Standard library ==\n[[Image:ANSI ISO C++ WP.jpg|thumb|right|The draft \"Working Paper\" standard that became approved as C++98; half of its size was devoted to the C++ Standard Library]]\n{{Main|C++ Standard Library}}\nThe C++ [[standardization|standard]] consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes aggregate types ([[sequence container (C++)#Vector|vectors]], lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), [[algorithm]]s (find, [[Foreach loop|for_each]], [[Binary search algorithm|binary_search]], random_shuffle, etc.), input/output facilities ([[iostream]], for reading from and writing to the console and files), filesystem library, localisation support, [[smart pointers]] for automatic memory management, [[regular expression]] support, [[multithreading (software)|multi-threading]] library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that doesn't use C++ [[exception handling|exceptions]] into C++ exceptions, a [[random number generator]] and a slightly modified version of the [[C standard library]] (to make it comply with the C++ type system).\n\nA large part of the C++ library is based on the [[Standard Template Library]] (STL). Useful tools provided by the STL include [[container (data structure)|container]]s as the collections of objects (such as [[array data structure|vector]]s and [[linked list|lists]]), [[iterator]]s that provide array-like access to containers, and [[algorithm]]s that perform operations such as searching and sorting.\n\nFurthermore, (multi)maps ([[associative array]]s) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the [[feature (software design)|feature]]s of the [[library (computing)|library]] are accessed by using the <syntaxhighlight lang=\"C++\" inline>#include</syntaxhighlight> [[directive (programming)|directive]] to include a [[standard header]]. The [[C++ Standard Library]] provides 105 standard headers, of which 27 are deprecated.\n\nThe standard incorporates the STL that was originally designed by [[Alexander Stepanov]], who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as \"STL\", as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html |author=Graziano Lo Russo |title=An Interview with A.

So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, \u201cYes, we\u2019re using C++ but we\u2019re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we\u2019re not using operator overloading.\u201d There are just a bunch of features that you\u2019re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else\u2019s code, which I think is such a good thing. </blockquote>\n\n[[Donald Knuth]] (1993, commenting on pre-standardized C++), who said of [[Edsger Dijkstra]] that \"to think of programming in C++\" \"would make him physically ill\":<ref name=\"dobbsKnuth\" /><ref name=\"knuth1993\" /> <blockquote> The problem that I have with them today is that... C++ is too complicated. At the moment, it's impossible for me to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem, they said \"OK, we'll do them both\". So the language is too baroque for my taste. </blockquote>\n\n[[Ken Thompson]], who was a colleague of Stroustrup at Bell Labs, gives his assessment:<ref name=\"Seibel2009\" /><ref name=\"gigamonkeysWordpress\" /> <blockquote> It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it\u2019s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it\u2019s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it\u2019s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it\u2019s not a good language to transport an algorithm\u2014to say, \u201cI wrote it; here, take it.\u201d It\u2019s way too big, way too complex. And it\u2019s obviously [[Design by committee|built by a committee]]. \nStroustrup campaigned for years and years and years, way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair. And he said \u201cno\u201d to no one. He put every feature in that language that ever existed. It wasn\u2019t cleanly designed\u2014it was just the union of everything that came along. And I think it suffered drastically from that. </blockquote>\n\nHowever [[Brian Kernighan]], also a colleague at Bell Labs, disputes this assessment:<ref>{{cite video|people=Brian Kernighan|date=July 18, 2018|title=Brian Kernighan Q&A - Computerphile|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhR8cUX90&t=5m17s}}</ref> <blockquote>C++ has been enormously influential. ... Lots of people say C++ is too big and too complicated etc. etc. but in fact it is a very powerful language and pretty much everything that is in there is there for a really sound reason: it is not somebody doing random invention, it is actually people trying to solve real world problems. Now a lot of the programs that we take for granted today, that we just use, are C++ programs. </blockquote>\n\nStroustrup himself comments that C++ semantics are much cleaner than its syntax: \"within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out\".<ref>http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#really-say-that</ref>\n\nOther complaints may include a lack of [[reflection (computer programming)|reflection]] or [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], long compilation times, perceived [[feature creep]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://commandcenter.blogspot.mx/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html |title=Less is exponentially more |year=2012 |last=Pike |first=Rob}}</ref> and verbose error messages, particularly from template metaprogramming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yosefk.com/c++fqa/defective.html|title=Defective C++|first=Yossi|last=Kreinin|date=13 October 2009|accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[Comparison of programming languages]]\n* [[List of C++ compilers]]\n* [[Outline of C++]]\n* [[:Category:C++ libraries|C++ Libraries (category)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |first=David |last=Abrahams |authorlink=David Abrahams (computer programmer) |first2=Aleksey |last2=Gurtovoy  |title=C++ Template Metaprogramming: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques from Boost and Beyond |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-22725-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Andrei |last=Alexandrescu |authorlink=Andrei Alexandrescu |year=2001 |title=Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-70431-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Andrei |last=Alexandrescu |authorlink=Andrei Alexandrescu |first2=Herb |last2=Sutter |authorlink2=Herb Sutter|year=2004 |title=C++ Design and Coding Standards: Rules and Guidelines for Writing Programs |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-11358-6 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Pete |last=Becker |authorlink=Pete Becker |year=2006 |title=The C++ Standard Library Extensions : A Tutorial and Reference |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-41299-0 }}\n* {{Cite book |first=Frank |last=Brokken |year=2010 |title=C++ Annotations |publisher=University of Groningen |isbn=90-367-0470-7 |url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/documents/cplusplus/ }}\n* {{Cite book |first=James O. |last=Coplien |authorlink=James O.

On December 26, 2004, Bel\u00f3n was at the poolside while her husband and three sons, Lucas, 10, Tom\u00e1s, 8, and Sim\u00f3n, 5, were splashing in the pool, before the family was swept apart by the tsunami.\n\nAfter the wave hit and swept her away from her family, she was able to grab hold of a tree with the aim of waiting for the tsunami to subside. While hanging on, however, she noticed her son Lucas in the distance being dragged by the current, screaming for help. She swam after him, but a second large wave occurred and she was dragged through a lot of rubble and hard sharp objects, and was critically wounded. After the tsunami calmed down, Bel\u00f3n was able to swim to land with Lucas, only to notice her many injuries. Her right leg was the most damaged, having been  completely ripped open, but she was able to dress her leg wound with palm tree leaves.\n\nBel\u00f3n and Lucas continued walking and looking for safety, but she was losing too much blood and her son had to help her walk. Lucas found a tree that the two could climb so that they would be safe from further waves. Maria was in too much pain to climb up the tree alone so Lucas, who had already climbed up, jumped down and helped her climb up the tree. After waiting on the tree for some time, the two were saved by locals from a nearby village who were coming to check the wreckage. Bel\u00f3n was then taken to a hospital, accompanied by her son.\n\nDuring his mother's recovery, Lucas was able to reunite with his father and two brothers, who happened to be in the hospital as well. Once she was stable enough to be moved, Bel\u00f3n and her family were transferred to a hospital in [[Singapore]], where she received more treatment and was finally able to return home.\n\n==Aftermath==\nBel\u00f3n is credited in the cast of the 2012 film ''[[The Impossible (2012 film)|The Impossible]]'' for providing her story and working on the set in [[Thailand]] in the same locations as the original tsunami.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jan/03/reel-history-the-impossible |title=The Impossible submerges the true impact of the tsunami |first=Alex |last=von Tunzelmann |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 January 2013 |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref> She spent time with Naomi Watts and helped her prepare for the role.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2214869/Naomi-Watts-shares-spotlight-tsunami-survivor-Maria-Madrid-premiere-The-Impossible.html |title=Naomi Watts shares the spotlight with tsunami survivor Maria at Madrid premiere of The Impossible |first=Emily |last=Sheridan |work=Mail Online |date=9 October 2012  |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref> Bel\u00f3n chose Naomi Watts to play her in the film, stating that Watts was her favorite actress after seeing the film ''[[21 Grams]]''.

On December 26, 2004, Bel\u00f3n was at the poolside while her husband and three sons, Lucas, 10, Tom\u00e1s, 8, and Sim\u00f3n, 5, were splashing in the pool, before the family was swept apart by the tsunami.\n\nAfter the wave hit and swept her away from her family, she was able to grab hold of a tree with the aim of waiting for the tsunami to subside. While hanging on, however, she noticed her son Lucas in the distance being dragged by the current, screaming for help. She swam after him, but a second large wave occurred and she was dragged through a lot of rubble and hard sharp objects, and was critically wounded. After the tsunami calmed down, Bel\u00f3n was able to swim to land with Lucas, only to notice her many injuries. Her right leg was the most damaged, having been  completely ripped open, but she was able to dress her leg wound with palm tree leaves.\n\nBel\u00f3n and Lucas continued walking and looking for safety, but she was losing too much blood and her son had to help her walk. Lucas found a tree that the two could climb so that they would be safe from further waves. Maria was in too much pain to climb up the tree alone so Lucas, who had already climbed up, jumped down and helped her climb up the tree. After waiting on the tree for some time, the two were saved by locals from a nearby village who were coming to check the wreckage. Bel\u00f3n was then taken to a hospital, accompanied by her son.\n\nDuring his mother's recovery, Lucas was able to reunite with his father and two brothers, who happened to be in the hospital as well. Once she was stable enough to be moved, Bel\u00f3n and her family were transferred to a hospital in [[Singapore]], where she received more treatment and was finally able to return home.\n\n==Aftermath==\nBel\u00f3n is credited in the cast of the 2012 film ''[[The Impossible (2012 film)|The Impossible]]'' for providing her story and working on the set in [[Thailand]] in the same locations as the original tsunami.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jan/03/reel-history-the-impossible |title=The Impossible submerges the true impact of the tsunami |first=Alex |last=von Tunzelmann |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 January 2013 |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref> She spent time with Naomi Watts and helped her prepare for the role.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2214869/Naomi-Watts-shares-spotlight-tsunami-survivor-Maria-Madrid-premiere-The-Impossible.html |title=Naomi Watts shares the spotlight with tsunami survivor Maria at Madrid premiere of The Impossible |first=Emily |last=Sheridan |work=Mail Online |date=9 October 2012  |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref> Bel\u00f3n chose Naomi Watts to play her in the film, stating that Watts was her favorite actress after seeing the film ''[[21 Grams]]''.
