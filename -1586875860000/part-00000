Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity.

During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls--earlier strong, but now falling apart--were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S. Richards''', ed. Chase F. Robinson, (Brill, 2003), 46.</ref>\n\nRight when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensued between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji [[mountain people]], but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764\u2013766}}\n[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century.]]\n[[Alp Tigin]], nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty.<ref>He dispossessed an indigenous family who had ruled in [[Ghazni]], the Lawiks (?), and following him a series of slave commanders, ruled there as nominal vassals of the Samanids; they struck coins but placed the names of the Samanids on them</ref><ref>Gard\u012bz\u012b, ed. \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, pp. 161\u201362; J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, I, pp. 226\u201327; Ne\u1e93\u0101m-al-Molk, pp. 142\u201358; \u0160ab\u0101nk\u0101ra\u02be\u012b, pp. 29\u201334; Bosworth, 1965, pp. 16\u201321</ref> The fifth of these commanders was Seb\u00fcktigin, who governed \u1e20azna for twenty years till 387 AH/997 CE with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription<ref>Flury, pp. 62\u201363</ref>) of al-\u1e25\u0101jeb al-ajall (most noble commander).

The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally.

The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was initially given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), but was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the ''[[sipah-salar]]'' (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\nLike in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could rise to high office in the Samanid state, which would sometimes give them enough power to nearly make the ruler their puppet.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\n====The nature of political authority under the Samanids====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Cultural and religious efforts===\n\n\nThe Samanids revived [[Persian culture]] by patronizing [[Rudaki]],<ref>\"Mihragan\", J.

Daniel pg. 74\"/> Islamic architecture and Islamo-Persian culture was spread deep into the heart of Central Asia by the Samanids. Following the first complete translation of the [[Qur'an]] into Persian, during the 9th century, populations under the Samanid empire began accepting Islam in significant numbers.<ref>Michael Dillon, ''Xinjiang: China's Muslim far Northwest'', (RoutledgeCurzon, 2004), 11.</ref>\n\nThrough zealous missionary work as many as 30,000 tents of [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] came to profess Islam and later under the Ghaznavids more than 55,000 under the [[Hanafi]] school of thought. The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the [[Ghaznavids]], who would later rule the region.\n\nAgriculture and trading were the economic bases of the Samanid State. The Samanids were heavily involved in trading&nbsp;\u2013 even with Europe, as thousands of Samanid coins that have been found in the Baltic and Scandinavian countries testify.<ref>History of Bukhara, By Narshakhi trans. Richard N. Frye, pg. 143</ref>\n\nAnother lasting contribution of the Samanids to the history of Islamic art is the pottery known as Samanid Epigraphic Ware: plates, bowls, and pitchers fired in a white slip and decorated only with calligraphy, often elegantly and rhythmically written.  The Arabic phrases used in this calligraphy are generally more or less generic well wishes, or Islamic admonitions to good table manners.\n\n===Scholarship===\n\n====Avicenna and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni====\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:The Sasanian King Khusraw and Courtiers in a Garden, Page from a manuscript of the Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdawsi, late 15th-early 16th century.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] and his courtiers in a garden'', page from a manuscript of the [[Shahnameh]], late 15th-early 16th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, there was a large amount of growth in literature, mostly in poetry. It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxiana and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most-favored language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Fewer than 2,000 lines of his poetry have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse form of medieval Persian poetry: mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, a special interest arose in ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age was Ferdowsi, born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud. However, his work was not as appreciated by the Ghaznavids as it had been by the Samanids.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Population===\nUnder the Samanid Empire, the [[Zarafshan]] valley, [[Qashqadaryo Region|Kashka Darya]] and [[Usrushana]] were populated by [[Sogdia]]ns; [[Tukharistan]] by the Bactrians; [[Khwarezm]] by the Khwarazmians; the [[Fergana Valley|Ferghana valley]] by the Ferghanans; southern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by Khorasanians; and the [[Pamir mountains]] and environs by the [[Saka]] and other early Iranian peoples.

Scholars, poets, artists and other men of education from many Muslim countries assembled in the Samanid capital of Bukhara, where a rich soil was created for the prosper of creative thought, thus making it one of the most distinguished cultural centres of the Eastern world. An outstanding library known as ''Siw\u0101n al-hikma'' (\"Storehouse of Wisdom\") was put together in Bukhara, known for its various types of books.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=94}}\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Two Bowls with Figures and a Footed Plate with Birds MET DP258911.jpg|thumb|Example of figural earthenware ceramics from Samanid period.]]\n\n==== Crafts ====\n[[File:Bowl with Arabic Inscription.jpg|thumb|Bowl with Arabic Inscription]]\nDue to extensive excavations at [[Nishapur]], Iran in the mid-twentieth century, Samanid pottery is well-represented in Islamic art collections around the world.

It has a white slip with black slip decoration under a transparent glaze. There is calligraphic decoration all around the bowl. It is elongated at some points and compressed in other areas of the letter to the point where it almost looks abstract. Right in the center of the bowl is a black dot. If the bowl is looked at closely there are cracks and marks that have occurred over time. What would once have been a white bowl is now stained yellow in some areas. The calligraphy looks well thought out and planned. Each letter is well spaced, and the whole saying fits perfectly around the bowl.

The original home of the Samanids is unclear, for some [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts claim that the name was derived from a village near [[Samarkand]], while others assert it was a village near [[Balkh]] or [[Termez|Tirmidh]]. The latter is more probable since the earliest appearance of the Samanid family appears to be in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] rather than [[Transoxiana]].<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\">{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Richard N.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=136}}</ref> In some sources the Samanids claimed to be descended from the noble [[House of Mihran|Mihran family]] of [[Bahram Chobin]], whereas one author claimed that they belonged to the Turkish Oghuz tribe, although this is most unlikely.<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\"/> Originally a [[Zoroastrian]], Saman Khuda converted to [[Islam]] during the governorship of [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]],{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} and named his oldest son as [[Asad ibn Saman|Asad]] in the governor's honour.{{sfn|Gibb|1986|p=685}} In 819, the governor of Khorasan, [[Ghassan ibn Abbad]], rewarded the four sons of Asad for their aid against the rebel [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]; [[Nuh ibn Asad|Nuh]] received [[Samarkand]]; [[Ahmad ibn Asad|Ahmad]] received [[Farghana]]; [[Yahya ibn Asad|Yahya]] received [[Tashkent|Shash]]; and [[Ilyas ibn Asad|Ilyas]] received [[Herat]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} This marked the beginning of the Samanid dynasty.\n\n===Rise===\n\n====The Samanid branch in Herat (819\u2013857)====\n\nIlyas died in 856, and was succeeded by his son [[Ibrahim ibn Ilyas]]\u2014the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirid]] governor of Khorasan, [[Muhammad ibn Tahir]], thereafter appointed him as the commander of his army, and sent him on an expedition against the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] ruler [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar]] in [[Sistan]]. He was defeated at a battle near [[Pushang]] in 857, and fled to [[Nishapur]], where he was captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} The Tahirids thereafter assumed direct control over Herat.\n\n====The Samanid branches in Transoxiana (819\u2013892)====\n{{See Also|Samanid Civil War of 888}}\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]].]]\nIn 839/40, Nuh seized [[Isfijab]] from the nomadic [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] living in the [[steppe]]. He thereafter had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2\u2014his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} After Yahya's death in 855, Ahmad took control over Ch\u00e2ch, thus becoming the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]]. He died in 864/5; his son [[Nasr I]] received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son [[Ya'qub ibn Ahmad|Ya'qub]] received Ch\u00e2ch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Meanwhile, the Tahirids' authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats by the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar, thus losing their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him Baghdad, where he was executed.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Furthermore, he also received the investiture over [[Tabaristan]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}}\n\nBefore his major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the [[Principality of Ushrusana]] by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids. However, Muhammad ibn Harun shortly revolted, forcing Ismail himself to invade the region the following year.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls--earlier strong, but now falling apart--were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S. Richards''', ed. Chase F. Robinson, (Brill, 2003), 46.</ref>\n\nRight when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensued between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji [[mountain people]], but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764\u2013766}}\n[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century.]]\n[[Alp Tigin]], nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty.<ref>He dispossessed an indigenous family who had ruled in [[Ghazni]], the Lawiks (?), and following him a series of slave commanders, ruled there as nominal vassals of the Samanids; they struck coins but placed the names of the Samanids on them</ref><ref>Gard\u012bz\u012b, ed. \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, pp. 161\u201362; J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, I, pp. 226\u201327; Ne\u1e93\u0101m-al-Molk, pp. 142\u201358; \u0160ab\u0101nk\u0101ra\u02be\u012b, pp. 29\u201334; Bosworth, 1965, pp. 16\u201321</ref> The fifth of these commanders was Seb\u00fcktigin, who governed \u1e20azna for twenty years till 387 AH/997 CE with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription<ref>Flury, pp. 62\u201363</ref>) of al-\u1e25\u0101jeb al-ajall (most noble commander).

In 999, Nasr b. Ali, a nephew of Harun, returned and took possession of Bukhara, meeting little resistance. The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeiKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=Medieval+Central+Asia+and+the+Persianate+World,+A.C.S.+Peacock,+D.G.+Tor,+Iranian+Intermezzo#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20Central%20Asia%20and%20the%20Persianate%20World,%20A.C.S.%20Peacock,%20D.G.%20Tor,%20Iranian%20Intermezzo&f=true|title=Medieval Central Asia and the Persianate World: Iranian Tradition and Islamic Civilisation|last=Peacock|first=A.

The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was initially given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), but was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the ''[[sipah-salar]]'' (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\nLike in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could rise to high office in the Samanid state, which would sometimes give them enough power to nearly make the ruler their puppet.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\n====The nature of political authority under the Samanids====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Cultural and religious efforts===\n\n\nThe Samanids revived [[Persian culture]] by patronizing [[Rudaki]],<ref>\"Mihragan\", J.

Following the first complete translation of the [[Qur'an]] into Persian, during the 9th century, populations under the Samanid empire began accepting Islam in significant numbers.<ref>Michael Dillon, ''Xinjiang: China's Muslim far Northwest'', (RoutledgeCurzon, 2004), 11.</ref>\n\nThrough zealous missionary work as many as 30,000 tents of [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] came to profess Islam and later under the Ghaznavids more than 55,000 under the [[Hanafi]] school of thought. The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the [[Ghaznavids]], who would later rule the region.\n\nAgriculture and trading were the economic bases of the Samanid State. The Samanids were heavily involved in trading&nbsp;\u2013 even with Europe, as thousands of Samanid coins that have been found in the Baltic and Scandinavian countries testify.<ref>History of Bukhara, By Narshakhi trans. Richard N. Frye, pg. 143</ref>\n\nAnother lasting contribution of the Samanids to the history of Islamic art is the pottery known as Samanid Epigraphic Ware: plates, bowls, and pitchers fired in a white slip and decorated only with calligraphy, often elegantly and rhythmically written.  The Arabic phrases used in this calligraphy are generally more or less generic well wishes, or Islamic admonitions to good table manners.\n\n===Scholarship===\n\n====Avicenna and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni====\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:The Sasanian King Khusraw and Courtiers in a Garden, Page from a manuscript of the Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdawsi, late 15th-early 16th century.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] and his courtiers in a garden'', page from a manuscript of the [[Shahnameh]], late 15th-early 16th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, there was a large amount of growth in literature, mostly in poetry. It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxiana and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most-favored language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Fewer than 2,000 lines of his poetry have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse form of medieval Persian poetry: mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, a special interest arose in ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age was Ferdowsi, born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud. However, his work was not as appreciated by the Ghaznavids as it had been by the Samanids.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Population===\nUnder the Samanid Empire, the [[Zarafshan]] valley, [[Qashqadaryo Region|Kashka Darya]] and [[Usrushana]] were populated by [[Sogdia]]ns; [[Tukharistan]] by the Bactrians; [[Khwarezm]] by the Khwarazmians; the [[Fergana Valley|Ferghana valley]] by the Ferghanans; southern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by Khorasanians; and the [[Pamir mountains]] and environs by the [[Saka]] and other early Iranian peoples.

These units form covalent \u03b2-(1\u21924)-linkages (like the linkages between [[glucose]] units forming [[cellulose]]). Therefore, chitin may be described as [[cellulose]] with one [[hydroxyl]] group on each [[monomer]] replaced with an [[acetyl]] [[amine]] group. This allows for increased [[hydrogen bonding]] between adjacent [[polymers]], giving the chitin-polymer matrix increased strength.\n\n[[Image:Lyristes plebejus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[cicada]] emerges from its chitinous larval exoskeleton.]]\nIn its pure, unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient, and quite tough. In most [[arthropod]]s, however, it is often modified, occurring largely as a component of [[composite material]]s, such as in [[sclerotin]], a tanned [[protein]]aceous matrix, which forms much of the [[exoskeleton]] of [[insect]]s.

These units form covalent \u03b2-(1\u21924)-linkages (like the linkages between [[glucose]] units forming [[cellulose]]). Therefore, chitin may be described as [[cellulose]] with one [[hydroxyl]] group on each [[monomer]] replaced with an [[acetyl]] [[amine]] group. This allows for increased [[hydrogen bonding]] between adjacent [[polymers]], giving the chitin-polymer matrix increased strength.\n\n[[Image:Lyristes plebejus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[cicada]] emerges from its chitinous larval exoskeleton.]]\nIn its pure, unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient, and quite tough. In most [[arthropod]]s, however, it is often modified, occurring largely as a component of [[composite material]]s, such as in [[sclerotin]], a tanned [[protein]]aceous matrix, which forms much of the [[exoskeleton]] of [[insect]]s. Combined with [[calcium carbonate]], as in the shells of [[crustacean]]s and [[mollusc]]s, chitin produces a much stronger composite. This composite material is much harder and stiffer than pure chitin, and is tougher and less brittle than pure [[calcium carbonate]].<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, N. A.

In the winter months, the population would rise from 200 to almost 2,000 people. Up until about 1911, access to Rockledge was via boat and rail. Steamboats in the Indian River connected with [[Henry Flagler]]'s trains to bring people to the North. Small boats, sailboats, and small launches frequently stopped to unload freight and passengers. Most of the tourists in this time were wealthy and would use the boats to connect to the rail system at that time. After World War I, the automobile allowed the average person to travel to the area and their encampments dotted the area. The Dixie Highway was completed in 1915 and spanned most of Florida. In the 1920s, US1 was paved and replaced the Dixie Highway.<ref>http://ww3.brevardcounty.us/history/documents/02fall.pdf</ref>\n\nIn 1939\u20131940, a winter visitor donated the money to construct a hospital.

Several hundred families from all over the United States settled in the city with the advent of the Apollo missions and the space shuttle program.\n\nBarton Boulevard replaced US 1 as the town's economic center as new subdivisions spread south along Fiske Boulevard. By the 1970s, the bulk of Rockledge's population lived between US 1 and I-95.\n\nDevelopments stretched north to south from the late 1950s to the 1990s. Virginia Park, Marlin Manor, Fairway Estates, Rockledge Country Club Estates, Golfview Estates, Kings Grant, Georgetown, Levitt Park and Woodsmere had all been established by the 1960s-1980s\n\nLevitt Park and Woodsmere were built atop a gladiola farm and an orange grove. The huge Australian Pine trees at the southernmost points of Fiske Boulevard are all that remain of the grove's windbreaks.

In the winter months, the population would rise from 200 to almost 2,000 people. Up until about 1911, access to Rockledge was via boat and rail. Steamboats in the Indian River connected with [[Henry Flagler]]'s trains to bring people to the North. Small boats, sailboats, and small launches frequently stopped to unload freight and passengers. Most of the tourists in this time were wealthy and would use the boats to connect to the rail system at that time.
