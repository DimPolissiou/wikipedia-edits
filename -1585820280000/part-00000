Zona pointed out, however, that the name ''R.&nbsp;regia'' (or ''Oreodoxa regia'') has a history of use in horticulture that dated from at least 1838, and that the species had been propagated around the world under that name.

A large and attractive palm, it has been planted throughout the tropics and subtropics as an ornamental tree. Although it is sometimes called ''R. elata'', the [[conserved name]] ''R. regia'' is now the correct name for the species.

Zona's revision of the genus concluded that they both belonged to the same species.  According to the rules of botanical nomenclature, the correct name of the species should have been ''Roystonea elata''.  Zona pointed out, however, that the name ''R.&nbsp;regia'' (or ''Oreodoxa regia'') has a history of use in horticulture that dated from at least 1838, and that the species had been propagated around the world under that name.  ''Roystonea elata'', on the other hand, had only been used since 1949, and was used much less widely.

Bricks can be joined together using [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], adhesives or by interlocking them.<ref>[https://www.buildupnepal.com/interlocking-bricks/ Interlocking bricks used in Nepal]</ref><ref>[https://vlaanderen-circulair.be/en/cases-in-flanders/detail/facadeclick Bricks that interlock]</ref> Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are ''fired'' and ''non-fired'' bricks.\n\n[[Concrete masonry unit|''Block'']] is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick. Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from [[expanded clay aggregate]].\n\nFired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest [[building material]]s, sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 4000 BC. Air-dried bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.\n\nBricks are laid in ''courses'' and numerous patterns known as ''bonds'', collectively known as [[brickwork]], and may be laid in various kinds of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Historic brick street in Natchitoches, LA IMG 1943.JPG|thumb|left|Bricked Front Street along the [[Cane River]] in historic [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Louisiana]]]]\n\n=== Middle East and South Asia ===\n[[File:Subrahmanya Temple, Saluvanakuppam front view.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of 3rd century BC [[Murugan Temple, Saluvankuppam|Hindu brick temple]], Tamil Nadu, India]]\n[[File:Shebli2.jpg|thumb|upright|The brickwork of [[Shebeli Tower]] in [[Iran]] displays 12th-century craftsmanship]]\n[[File:JetawanaStupa1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The ancient [[Jetavanaramaya]] [[stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]] is one of the largest brick structures in the world.]]\nThe earliest bricks were ''dried brick'', meaning that they were formed from clay-bearing earth or mud and dried (usually in the sun) until they were strong enough for use.

An independent style of brick architecture, known as [[brick Gothic]] (similar to [[Gothic architecture]]) flourished in places that lacked indigenous sources of rocks. Examples of this architectural style can be found in modern-day [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]].\n\nThis style evolved into [[List of Brick Renaissance buildings|Brick Renaissance]] as the stylistic changes associated with the [[Italian Renaissance]] spread to northern Europe, leading to the adoption of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] elements into brick building. A clear distinction between the two styles only developed at the transition to [[Baroque architecture]]. In [[L\u00fcbeck]], for example, Brick Renaissance is clearly recognisable in buildings equipped with terracotta reliefs by the artist Statius von D\u00fcren, who was also active at [[Schwerin]] ([[Schwerin Castle]]) and [[Wismar]] (F\u00fcrstenhof).\n\nLong-distance [[bulk transport]] of bricks and other construction equipment remained prohibitively expensive until the development of modern transportation infrastructure, with the construction of [[canal]], [[road]]s, and [[railway]]s.\n\n=== Industrial era ===\nProduction of bricks increased massively with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise in factory building in England. For reasons of speed and economy, bricks were increasingly preferred as building material to stone, even in areas where the stone was readily available. It was at this time in [[London]] that bright red brick was chosen for construction to make the buildings more visible in the heavy fog and to help prevent traffic accidents.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZQl3C5BAHsC|title=London the Biography|author=Peter Ackroyd|page=435|publisher=Random House|year=2001|isbn=978-0-09-942258-7}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from the traditional method of production known as hand-moulding to a mechanised form of mass-production slowly took place during the first half of the nineteenth century. Possibly the first successful brick-making machine was [[patent]]ed by Henry Clayton, employed at the Atlas Works in [[Middlesex]], England, in 1855, and was capable of producing up to 25,000 bricks daily with minimal supervision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US13123|title=Henry Clayton|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> His mechanical apparatus soon achieved widespread attention after it was adopted for use by the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway Company]] for brick-making at their factory near [[Folkestone]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S54AAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA361|title=The Mechanics Magazine and Journal of Engineering, Agricultural Machinery, Manufactures and Shipbuilding|year=1859|page=361}}</ref> The [[Bradley & Craven Ltd]] 'Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking Machine' was patented in 1853, apparently predating Clayton.

The use of brick for [[skyscraper]] construction severely limited the size of the building \u2013 the [[Monadnock Building]], built in 1896 in Chicago, required exceptionally thick walls to maintain the structural integrity of its 17 storeys.\n\nFollowing pioneering work in the 1950s at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] and the [[Building Research Establishment]] in [[Watford]], UK, the use of improved masonry for the construction of tall structures up to 18 storeys high was made viable. However, the use of brick has largely remained restricted to small to medium-sized buildings, as steel and concrete remain superior materials for high-rise construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dehoopsteenwerwe.co.za/information03.html|title=The History of Bricks|publisher=De Hoop:Steenwerve Brickfields}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:2008 BeaconHill Boston 2302897829.jpg|thumb|This wall in [[Beacon Hill, Boston]] shows different types of brickwork and stone foundations]]\nThere are thousands of types of bricks that are named for their use, size, forming method, origin, quality, texture, and/or materials.\n\nCategorized by manufacture method:\n* Extruded \u2013 made by being forced through an opening in a steel die, with a very consistent size and shape.\n** Wire-cut \u2013 cut to size after extrusion with a tensioned wire which may leave drag marks\n* Moulded \u2013 shaped in moulds rather than being extruded\n** Machine-moulded \u2013 clay is forced into moulds using pressure\n** Handmade \u2013 clay is forced into moulds by a person\n* Dry-pressed \u2013 similar to soft mud method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix and is compressed with great force.\n\nCategorized by use:\n* Common or building \u2013 A brick not intended to be visible, used for internal structure\n* Face \u2013 A brick used on exterior surfaces to present a clean appearance\n* Hollow \u2013 not solid, the holes are less than 25% of the brick volume\n** Perforated \u2013 holes greater than 25% of the brick volume\n* Keyed \u2013 indentations in at least one face and end to be used with rendering and plastering\n* Paving \u2013 brick intended to be in ground contact as a walkway or roadway\n* Thin \u2013 brick with normal height and length but thin width to be used as a veneer\n\nSpecialized use bricks:\n* Chemically resistant \u2013 bricks made with resistance to chemicals\n** [[Acid brick]] \u2013 acid resistant bricks\n* [[Engineering brick|Engineering]] \u2013 a type of hard, dense, brick used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.

Each type is manufactured differently.\n\n=== Mudbrick ===\n{{Main|Mudbrick}}\nUnfired bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, are made from a wet, clay-containing soil mixed with straw or similar binders. They are air-dried until ready for use.\n\n=== Fired brick ===\n[[File:Brick making in Java.jpg|thumb|upright|Raw bricks sun-drying before being fired|alt=]]\nFired bricks are burned in a kiln which makes them durable. Modern, fired, clay bricks are formed in one of three processes \u2013 soft mud, dry press, or extruded. Depending on the country, either the extruded or soft mud method is the most common, since they are the most economical.\n\nNormally, bricks contain the following ingredients:<ref name=\"punmia\">{{Citation|author1=Punmia, B.C. |author2=Jain, Ashok Kumar |title=Basic Civil Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWZxu_muxyIC&pg=PA33 |year= 2003  |isbn=978-81-7008-403-7 |page=33}}</ref>\n\n# Silica (sand) \u2013 50% to 60% by weight\n# Alumina (clay) \u2013 20% to 30% by weight\n# Lime \u2013 2 to 5% by weight\n# Iron oxide \u2013 \u2264 7% by weight\n# Magnesia \u2013 less than 1% by weight\n\n====Shaping methods====\nThree main methods are used for shaping the raw materials into bricks to be fired:\n\n* Molded bricks \u2013 These bricks start with raw clay, preferably in a mix with 25\u201330% sand to reduce shrinkage. The clay is first ground and mixed with water to the desired consistency. The clay is then pressed into steel moulds with a [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] press. The shaped clay is then fired (\"burned\") at 900\u20131000&nbsp;\u00b0C to achieve strength.\n* Dry-pressed bricks \u2013 The dry-press method is similar to the soft-mud moulded method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix, so it forms more accurate, sharper-edged bricks. The greater force in pressing and the longer burn make this method more expensive.\n* Extruded bricks \u2013 For extruded bricks the clay is mixed with 10\u201315% [[water]] (stiff extrusion) or 20\u201325% water (soft extrusion) in a [[pugmill]]. This mixture is forced through a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] to create a long cable of material of the desired width and depth. This mass is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by this method as it produces hard, dense bricks, and suitable dies can produce perforations as well. The introduction of such holes reduces the volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle, and have different thermal properties from solid bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150&nbsp;\u00b0C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from the kiln.\n\n==== Kilns ====\n[[File:Raw Indian brick.jpg|thumb|Raw (green) Indian brick]]\n[[File:Xhosa brickmaker at kiln near Ngcobo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] brickmaker at kiln near [[Ngcobo]] in 2007]]\n[[File:A brickmaker - Tashrih al-aqvam (1825), f.253v - BL Add. 27255.jpg|thumb|A brickmaker in India \u2013 ''Tashrih al-aqvam'' (1825)]]\nIn many modern [[brickworks]], bricks are usually fired in a continuously fired tunnel kiln, in which the bricks are fired as they move slowly through the kiln on [[conveyors]], rails, or kiln cars, which achieves a more consistent brick product. The bricks often have [[Lime (material)|lime]], ash, and organic matter added, which accelerates the burning process.\n\nThe other major kiln type is the Bull's Trench Kiln (BTK), based on a design developed by British engineer W. Bull in the late 19th century.\n\nAn oval or circular trench is dug, 6\u20139 metres wide, 2-2.5 metres deep, and 100\u2013150 metres in circumference. A tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the centre. Half or more of the trench is filled with \"green\" (unfired) bricks which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow. The lattice is capped with a roofing layer of finished brick.\n\nIn operation, new green bricks, along with roofing bricks, are stacked at one end of the brick pile. Historically, a stack of unfired bricks covered for protection from the weather was called a \"hack\".<ref>Connolly, Andrew. ''Life in the Victorian Brickyards of Flintshire and Denbigshire'', p34. 2003, Gwasg Carreg Gwalch.</ref> Cooled finished bricks are removed from the other end for transport to their destinations. In the middle, the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel (coal, wood, oil, debris, and so on) through access holes in the roof above the trench.\n\nThe advantage of the BTK design is a much greater energy efficiency compared with [[clamp kiln|clamp]] or [[scove kiln]]s. Sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently burned bricks, heating the air, then through the active burning zone. The air continues through the green brick zone (pre-heating and drying the bricks), and finally out the chimney, where the rising gases create suction that pulls air through the system. The reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost.\n\nAs with the rail process, the BTK process is continuous. A half-dozen labourers working around the clock can fire approximately 15,000\u201325,000 bricks a day. Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead, the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench.<ref>Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.environment.gov.pk/EA-GLines/I1B-Brick%20Kilns.pdf Brick Kiln Units (PDF file)]</ref>\n\n==== Influences on colour ====\n[[File:London stock brick (bridge).jpg|thumb|Yellow London Stocks at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo station]]]]\nThe fired colour of tired clay bricks is influenced by the chemical and mineral content of the raw materials, the firing temperature, and the atmosphere in the kiln. For example, pink bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues; as the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple, and then to brown or grey at around {{convert|1300|C|0|abbr=on}}. The names of bricks may reflect their origin and colour, such as [[London stock brick]] and Cambridgeshire White. ''Brick tinting'' may be performed to change the colour of bricks to blend-in areas of brickwork with the surrounding masonry.\n\nAn impervious and ornamental surface may be laid on brick either by [[salt glaze pottery|salt glazing]], in which salt is added during the burning process, or by the use of a [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]], which is a glaze material into which the bricks are dipped. Subsequent reheating in the kiln fuses the slip into a glazed surface integral with the brick base.\n\n=== Chemically set bricks ===\nChemically set bricks are not fired but may have the curing process accelerated by the application of heat and pressure in an autoclave.\n\n==== Calcium-silicate bricks ====\n[[File:Mexitegel.jpg|thumb|left|Swedish Mexitegel is a sand-lime or lime-cement brick.]]\n<!--\n    NB: This is NOT related to the chemical compound \"calcium silicate\"\n    These are bricks made from calcium compounds (lime) and silicate compounds (sand)\n-->\nCalcium-silicate bricks are also called sandlime or flintlime bricks, depending on their ingredients. Rather than being made with clay they are made with [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] binding the silicate material. The raw materials for calcium-silicate bricks include lime mixed in a proportion of about 1 to 10 with sand, [[quartz]], crushed [[flint]], or crushed siliceous rock together with mineral [[colourant]]s. The materials are mixed and left until the lime is completely hydrated; the mixture is then pressed into moulds and cured in an [[autoclave]] for three to fourteen hours to speed the chemical hardening.<ref name=\"EMS\">McArthur, Hugh, and Duncan Spalding. ''Engineering materials science: properties, uses, degradation and remediation''. Chichester, U.K.: Horwood Pub., 2004. 194. Print.</ref> The finished bricks are very accurate and uniform, although the sharp [[arris]]es need careful handling to avoid damage to brick and bricklayer. The bricks can be made in a variety of colours; white, black, buff, and grey-blues are common, and pastel shades can be achieved. This type of brick is common in Sweden, especially in houses built or renovated in the 1970s. In India these are known as [[fly ash brick]]s, manufactured using the FaL-G (fly ash, lime, and gypsum) process. Calcium-silicate bricks are also manufactured in Canada and the United States, and meet the criteria set forth in ASTM C73 \u2013 10 Standard Specification for Calcium Silicate Brick (Sand-Lime Brick).\n\n==== Concrete bricks ====\n{{Main|Concrete masonry unit}}\n[[File:Brickworks in Hainan - cement vessel, maker, stacker 01.jpg|thumb|A concrete brick-making assembly line in [[Guilinyang]] Town, Hainan, China. This operation produces a pallet containing 42 bricks, approximately every 30 seconds.]]\n\nBricks formed from [[concrete]] are usually termed as blocks or [[concrete masonry unit]], and are typically pale grey. They are made from a dry, small aggregate concrete which is formed in steel moulds by vibration and compaction in either an \"egglayer\" or static machine. The finished blocks are cured, rather than fired, using low-pressure steam. Concrete bricks and blocks are manufactured in a wide range of shapes, sizes and face treatments \u2013 a number of which simulate the appearance of clay bricks.\n\nConcrete bricks are available in many colours and as an engineering brick made with sulfate-resisting Portland cement or equivalent. When made with adequate amount of cement they are suitable for harsh environments such as wet conditions and retaining walls. They are made to standards BS 6073, EN 771-3 or ASTM C55. Concrete bricks contract or shrink so they need movement joints every 5 to 6 metres, but are similar to other bricks of similar density in thermal and sound resistance and fire resistance.<ref name=\"EMS\" />\n\n=== Compressed earth blocks ===\n[[File:Brick kiln, Belawadi, Mysore.jpg|thumb|A brick kiln in India]]\n{{Main|Compressed earth block}}\n[[Compressed earth block]]s are made mostly from slightly moistened local soils compressed with a mechanical hydraulic press or manual lever press. A small amount of a cement binder may be added, resulting in a ''stabilised compressed earth block''.\n\n== Optimal dimensions, characteristics, and strength ==\n[[File:comparison_house_brick_size.svg|thumb|left|300px|Comparison of typical brick sizes of assorted countries with isometric projections and dimensions in millimetres]]\n[[File:Brick pile.jpg|thumb|Loose bricks]]\nFor efficient handling and laying, bricks must be small enough and light enough to be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat, and as a result, the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about {{convert|100|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. In most cases, the length of a brick is twice its width plus the width of a mortar joint, about {{convert|200|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid ''[[Brickwork|bonded]]'' in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in ''English bond'', at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of ''stretchers'', bricks laid longways, and ''headers'', bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of ''English bond'' called ''English cross bond'' where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length. In true ''English bond'', the perpendicular lines of the stretcher courses are in line with each other.\n\nA bigger brick makes for a thicker (and thus more insulating) wall. Historically, this meant that bigger bricks were necessary in colder climates (see for instance the slightly larger size of the Russian brick in table below), while a smaller brick was adequate, and more economical, in warmer regions. A notable illustration of this correlation is the [[Green Gate]] in Gdansk; built in 1571 of imported [[Dutch brick]], too small for the colder climate of Gdansk, it was notorious for being a chilly and drafty residence. Nowadays this is no longer an issue, as modern walls typically incorporate specialised insulation materials.\n\nThe correct brick for a job can be selected from a choice of colour, surface texture, density, weight, absorption, and pore structure, thermal characteristics, thermal and moisture movement, and fire resistance.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:left\"\n|+Face brick (\"house brick\") sizes, (alphabetical order)\n!Standard !!Imperial !!Metric\n|-\n|{{AUS}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u2153 \u00d7 3 [[Inch|in]] || 230 \u00d7 110 \u00d7 76&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00bc in|| 228 \u00d7 108 \u00d7 54&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{GER}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00be in|| 240 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 71&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{IND}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00be in|| 228 \u00d7 107 \u00d7 69&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{ROM}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00bd in|| 240 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 63&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{RUS}} || 10 \u00d7 4\u00be \u00d7 2\u00bd in || 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{RSA}} || 8\u00be \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 in|| 222 \u00d7 106 \u00d7 73&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{SWE}} || 10 \u00d7 4\u00be \u00d7 2\u00bd in || 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 62&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{UK}} || 8\u00bd \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2\u00bd in|| 215 \u00d7 102.5 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{USA}} || 7\u215d \u00d7 3\u215d \u00d7 2\u00bc in|| 194 \u00d7 92 \u00d7 57&nbsp;mm\n|}\n\nIn England, the length and width of the common brick has remained fairly constant over the centuries (but see [[brick tax]]), but the depth has varied from about two inches (about 51&nbsp;mm) or smaller in earlier times to about two and a half inches (about 64&nbsp;mm) more recently.

Standard co-ordinating sizes in length and height (in mm) include 400\u00d7200, 450\u00d7150, 450\u00d7200, 450\u00d7225, 450\u00d7300, 600\u00d7150, 600\u00d7200, and 600\u00d7225; depths (work size, mm) include 60, 75, 90, 100, 115, 140, 150, 190, 200, 225, and 250. They are usable across this range as they are lighter than clay bricks. The density of solid clay bricks is around 2000&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3: this is reduced by frogging, hollow bricks, and so on, but aerated autoclaved concrete, even as a solid brick, can have densities in the range of 450\u2013850&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3.\n\nBricks may also be classified as ''solid'' (less than 25% perforations by volume, although the brick may be \"frogged,\" having indentations on one of the longer faces), ''perforated'' (containing a pattern of small holes through the brick, removing no more than 25% of the volume), ''cellular'' (containing a pattern of holes removing more than 20% of the volume, but closed on one face), or ''hollow'' (containing a pattern of large holes removing more than 25% of the brick's volume). Blocks may be solid, cellular or hollow\n\nThe term \"frog\" can refer to the indentation or the implement used to make it. Modern brickmakers usually use plastic frogs but in the past they were made of wood.\n\n[[File:Vault of Roman Bath in Bath - England.jpg|thumb|upright|Brick arch from a vault in [[Aquae Sulis|Roman Bath]] \u2013 England]]\n[[File:Dixie Highway Maitland.jpg|thumb|left|A brick section of the old [[Dixie Highway]], United States]]\n\nThe compressive strength of bricks produced in the United States ranges from about {{convert|1000|to|15,000|lbf/in2|MPa|0|lk=on|abbr=on|order=flip}}, varying according to the use to which the brick are to be put. In England clay bricks can have strengths of up to 100 MPa, although a common house brick is likely to show a range of 20\u201340 MPa.\n\n== Use ==\nIn the United States, bricks have been used for both buildings and pavements. Examples of brick use in buildings can be seen in colonial era buildings and other notable structures around the country.  Bricks have been used in pavements especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The introduction of asphalt and concrete reduced the use of brick pavements, but they are still sometimes installed as a method of [[traffic calming]] or as a decorative surface in [[Pedestrianized zone|pedestrian precincts]]. For example, in the early 1900s, most of the streets in the city of [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]], were paved with bricks. Today, there are only about 20 blocks of brick-paved streets remaining (totalling less than 0.5 percent of all the streets in the city limits).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090704104107/http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/preserveamerica/stories/michigan/index.cfm Michigan | Success Stories | Preserve America | Office of the Secretary of Transportation | U.S. Department of Transportation].</ref> Much like in Grand Rapids, municipalities across the United States began replacing brick streets with inexpensive [[asphalt concrete]] by the mid-20th century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-07-31-brick-roads_x.htm|title=Bricks come back to city streets|last=Schwartz|first=Emma|date=31 July 2003|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\nBricks in the [[metallurgy]] and [[glass]] industries are often used for lining [[furnace]]s, in particular [[refractory]] bricks such as [[silica]], [[Periclase|magnesia]], [[Grog (clay)|chamotte]] and neutral ([[chromomagnesite]]) [[fire brick|refractory bricks]]. This type of brick must have good [[thermal shock]] resistance, refractoriness under load, high melting point, and satisfactory [[porosity]]. There is a large refractory [[brick industry]], especially in the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nIn Northwest Europe, bricks have been used in construction for centuries. Until recently, almost all houses were built almost entirely from bricks. Although many houses are now built using a mixture of [[concrete block]]s and other materials, many houses are skinned with a layer of bricks on the outside for aesthetic appeal.\n\n[[Engineering brick]]s are used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.\n\nIn the UK a [[red brick university]] is one founded in the late 19th or early 20th century. The term is used to refer to such institutions collectively to distinguish them from the older [[Oxbridge]] institutions, and refers to the use of bricks, as opposed to stone, in their buildings.\n\nColombian architect [[Rogelio Salmona]] was noted for his extensive use of red bricks in his buildings and for using natural shapes like spirals, radial geometry and curves in his designs.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/arts/06salmona.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | first=Simon | last=Romero | title=Rogelio Salmona, Colombian Architect Who Transformed Cities, Is Dead at 78 | date=6 October 2007}}</ref> Most buildings in [[Colombia]] are made of brick, given the abundance of clay in equatorial countries like this one.\n\n== Limitations ==\nStarting in the 20th century, the use of brickwork declined in some areas due to concerns with earthquakes. Earthquakes such as the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco earthquake of 1906]] and the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed the weaknesses of unreinforced brick masonry in earthquake-prone areas. During seismic events, the mortar cracks and crumbles, and the bricks are no longer held together. Brick masonry with steel reinforcement, which helps hold the masonry together during earthquakes, was used to replace many of the unreinforced masonry buildings. Retrofitting older unreinforced masonry structures has been mandated in many jurisdictions.\n{{wide image|San Francisco earthquake.jpg|1600px|A panorama after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].|100%|center}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pergamonmuseum Babylon Ischtar-Tor.jpg|[[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] in the [[Pergamon Museum]], [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]\nFile:Opus reticulatum 2.JPG|Roman [[opus reticulatum]] on Hadrian's Villa in [[Tivoli, Italy]] (2nd century)\nFile:Munich Frauenkirche.jpg|[[Frauenkirche (Munich)|Frauenkirche]], [[Munich]], [[Germany]], erected 1468\u20131488, looking up at the towers\nFile:Torun sw Jakub szczyt zach.JPG|Eastern gable of church of St. James in [[Toru\u0144]] (14th century)\nFile:Radzyn Chelm zamek zendrowka.jpg|Decorative pattern made of strongly fired bricks in [[Radzy\u0144 Che\u0142mi\u0144ski|Radzy\u0144]] Castle (14th century)\nFile:Teruel - Torre de San Mart\u00edn.jpg|[[Mud\u00e9jar]] brick church tower in [[Teruel]], [[Spain]], (14th century)\nFile:thornbury.twochimneys.arp.750pix.jpg|Brick sculpting on [[Thornbury Castle]], Thornbury, near [[Bristol]], England.

Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of [[clay]], but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-bearing soil, sand, and [[Lime (material)|lime]], or [[concrete]] materials. Bricks can be joined together using [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], adhesives or by interlocking them.<ref>[https://www.buildupnepal.com/interlocking-bricks/ Interlocking bricks used in Nepal]</ref><ref>[https://vlaanderen-circulair.be/en/cases-in-flanders/detail/facadeclick Bricks that interlock]</ref> Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are ''fired'' and ''non-fired'' bricks.\n\n[[Concrete masonry unit|''Block'']] is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick. Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from [[expanded clay aggregate]].\n\nFired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest [[building material]]s, sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 4000 BC. Air-dried bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.\n\nBricks are laid in ''courses'' and numerous patterns known as ''bonds'', collectively known as [[brickwork]], and may be laid in various kinds of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Historic brick street in Natchitoches, LA IMG 1943.JPG|thumb|left|Bricked Front Street along the [[Cane River]] in historic [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Louisiana]]]]\n\n=== Middle East and South Asia ===\n[[File:Subrahmanya Temple, Saluvanakuppam front view.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of 3rd century BC [[Murugan Temple, Saluvankuppam|Hindu brick temple]], Tamil Nadu, India]]\n[[File:Shebli2.jpg|thumb|upright|The brickwork of [[Shebeli Tower]] in [[Iran]] displays 12th-century craftsmanship]]\n[[File:JetawanaStupa1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The ancient [[Jetavanaramaya]] [[stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]] is one of the largest brick structures in the world.]]\nThe earliest bricks were ''dried brick'', meaning that they were formed from clay-bearing earth or mud and dried (usually in the sun) until they were strong enough for use.

An independent style of brick architecture, known as [[brick Gothic]] (similar to [[Gothic architecture]]) flourished in places that lacked indigenous sources of rocks. Examples of this architectural style can be found in modern-day [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]].\n\nThis style evolved into [[List of Brick Renaissance buildings|Brick Renaissance]] as the stylistic changes associated with the [[Italian Renaissance]] spread to northern Europe, leading to the adoption of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] elements into brick building. A clear distinction between the two styles only developed at the transition to [[Baroque architecture]]. In [[L\u00fcbeck]], for example, Brick Renaissance is clearly recognisable in buildings equipped with terracotta reliefs by the artist Statius von D\u00fcren, who was also active at [[Schwerin]] ([[Schwerin Castle]]) and [[Wismar]] (F\u00fcrstenhof).\n\nLong-distance [[bulk transport]] of bricks and other construction equipment remained prohibitively expensive until the development of modern transportation infrastructure, with the construction of [[canal]], [[road]]s, and [[railway]]s.\n\n=== Industrial era ===\nProduction of bricks increased massively with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise in factory building in England. For reasons of speed and economy, bricks were increasingly preferred as building material to stone, even in areas where the stone was readily available. It was at this time in [[London]] that bright red brick was chosen for construction to make the buildings more visible in the heavy fog and to help prevent traffic accidents.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZQl3C5BAHsC|title=London the Biography|author=Peter Ackroyd|page=435|publisher=Random House|year=2001|isbn=978-0-09-942258-7}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from the traditional method of production known as hand-moulding to a mechanised form of mass-production slowly took place during the first half of the nineteenth century. Possibly the first successful brick-making machine was [[patent]]ed by Henry Clayton, employed at the Atlas Works in [[Middlesex]], England, in 1855, and was capable of producing up to 25,000 bricks daily with minimal supervision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US13123|title=Henry Clayton|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> His mechanical apparatus soon achieved widespread attention after it was adopted for use by the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway Company]] for brick-making at their factory near [[Folkestone]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S54AAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA361|title=The Mechanics Magazine and Journal of Engineering, Agricultural Machinery, Manufactures and Shipbuilding|year=1859|page=361}}</ref> The [[Bradley & Craven Ltd]] 'Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking Machine' was patented in 1853, apparently predating Clayton.

The use of brick for [[skyscraper]] construction severely limited the size of the building \u2013 the [[Monadnock Building]], built in 1896 in Chicago, required exceptionally thick walls to maintain the structural integrity of its 17 storeys.\n\nFollowing pioneering work in the 1950s at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] and the [[Building Research Establishment]] in [[Watford]], UK, the use of improved masonry for the construction of tall structures up to 18 storeys high was made viable. However, the use of brick has largely remained restricted to small to medium-sized buildings, as steel and concrete remain superior materials for high-rise construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dehoopsteenwerwe.co.za/information03.html|title=The History of Bricks|publisher=De Hoop:Steenwerve Brickfields}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:2008 BeaconHill Boston 2302897829.jpg|thumb|This wall in [[Beacon Hill, Boston]] shows different types of brickwork and stone foundations]]\nThere are thousands of types of bricks that are named for their use, size, forming method, origin, quality, texture, and/or materials.\n\nCategorized by manufacture method:\n* Extruded \u2013 made by being forced through an opening in a steel die, with a very consistent size and shape.\n** Wire-cut \u2013 cut to size after extrusion with a tensioned wire which may leave drag marks\n* Moulded \u2013 shaped in moulds rather than being extruded\n** Machine-moulded \u2013 clay is forced into moulds using pressure\n** Handmade \u2013 clay is forced into moulds by a person\n* Dry-pressed \u2013 similar to soft mud method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix and is compressed with great force.\n\nCategorized by use:\n* Common or building \u2013 A brick not intended to be visible, used for internal structure\n* Face \u2013 A brick used on exterior surfaces to present a clean appearance\n* Hollow \u2013 not solid, the holes are less than 25% of the brick volume\n** Perforated \u2013 holes greater than 25% of the brick volume\n* Keyed \u2013 indentations in at least one face and end to be used with rendering and plastering\n* Paving \u2013 brick intended to be in ground contact as a walkway or roadway\n* Thin \u2013 brick with normal height and length but thin width to be used as a veneer\n\nSpecialized use bricks:\n* Chemically resistant \u2013 bricks made with resistance to chemicals\n** [[Acid brick]] \u2013 acid resistant bricks\n* [[Engineering brick|Engineering]] \u2013 a type of hard, dense, brick used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.

Each type is manufactured differently.\n\n=== Mudbrick ===\n{{Main|Mudbrick}}\nUnfired bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, are made from a wet, clay-containing soil mixed with straw or similar binders. They are air-dried until ready for use.\n\n=== Fired brick ===\n[[File:Brick making in Java.jpg|thumb|upright|Raw bricks sun-drying before being fired|alt=]]\nFired bricks are burned in a kiln which makes them durable. Modern, fired, clay bricks are formed in one of three processes \u2013 soft mud, dry press, or extruded. Depending on the country, either the extruded or soft mud method is the most common, since they are the most economical.\n\nNormally, bricks contain the following ingredients:<ref name=\"punmia\">{{Citation|author1=Punmia, B.C. |author2=Jain, Ashok Kumar |title=Basic Civil Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWZxu_muxyIC&pg=PA33 |year= 2003  |isbn=978-81-7008-403-7 |page=33}}</ref>\n\n# Silica (sand) \u2013 50% to 60% by weight\n# Alumina (clay) \u2013 20% to 30% by weight\n# Lime \u2013 2 to 5% by weight\n# Iron oxide \u2013 \u2264 7% by weight\n# Magnesia \u2013 less than 1% by weight\n\n====Shaping methods====\nThree main methods are used for shaping the raw materials into bricks to be fired:\n\n* Molded bricks \u2013 These bricks start with raw clay, preferably in a mix with 25\u201330% sand to reduce shrinkage. The clay is first ground and mixed with water to the desired consistency. The clay is then pressed into steel moulds with a [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] press. The shaped clay is then fired (\"burned\") at 900\u20131000&nbsp;\u00b0C to achieve strength.\n* Dry-pressed bricks \u2013 The dry-press method is similar to the soft-mud moulded method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix, so it forms more accurate, sharper-edged bricks. The greater force in pressing and the longer burn make this method more expensive.\n* Extruded bricks \u2013 For extruded bricks the clay is mixed with 10\u201315% [[water]] (stiff extrusion) or 20\u201325% water (soft extrusion) in a [[pugmill]]. This mixture is forced through a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] to create a long cable of material of the desired width and depth. This mass is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by this method as it produces hard, dense bricks, and suitable dies can produce perforations as well. The introduction of such holes reduces the volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle, and have different thermal properties from solid bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150&nbsp;\u00b0C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from the kiln.\n\n==== Kilns ====\n[[File:Raw Indian brick.jpg|thumb|Raw (green) Indian brick]]\n[[File:Xhosa brickmaker at kiln near Ngcobo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] brickmaker at kiln near [[Ngcobo]] in 2007]]\n[[File:A brickmaker - Tashrih al-aqvam (1825), f.253v - BL Add. 27255.jpg|thumb|A brickmaker in India \u2013 ''Tashrih al-aqvam'' (1825)]]\nIn many modern [[brickworks]], bricks are usually fired in a continuously fired tunnel kiln, in which the bricks are fired as they move slowly through the kiln on [[conveyors]], rails, or kiln cars, which achieves a more consistent brick product. The bricks often have [[Lime (material)|lime]], ash, and organic matter added, which accelerates the burning process.\n\nThe other major kiln type is the Bull's Trench Kiln (BTK), based on a design developed by British engineer W. Bull in the late 19th century.\n\nAn oval or circular trench is dug, 6\u20139 metres wide, 2-2.5 metres deep, and 100\u2013150 metres in circumference. A tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the centre. Half or more of the trench is filled with \"green\" (unfired) bricks which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow. The lattice is capped with a roofing layer of finished brick.\n\nIn operation, new green bricks, along with roofing bricks, are stacked at one end of the brick pile. Historically, a stack of unfired bricks covered for protection from the weather was called a \"hack\".<ref>Connolly, Andrew. ''Life in the Victorian Brickyards of Flintshire and Denbigshire'', p34. 2003, Gwasg Carreg Gwalch.</ref> Cooled finished bricks are removed from the other end for transport to their destinations. In the middle, the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel (coal, wood, oil, debris, and so on) through access holes in the roof above the trench.\n\nThe advantage of the BTK design is a much greater energy efficiency compared with [[clamp kiln|clamp]] or [[scove kiln]]s. Sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently burned bricks, heating the air, then through the active burning zone. The air continues through the green brick zone (pre-heating and drying the bricks), and finally out the chimney, where the rising gases create suction that pulls air through the system. The reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost.\n\nAs with the rail process, the BTK process is continuous. A half-dozen labourers working around the clock can fire approximately 15,000\u201325,000 bricks a day. Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead, the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench.<ref>Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.environment.gov.pk/EA-GLines/I1B-Brick%20Kilns.pdf Brick Kiln Units (PDF file)]</ref>\n\n==== Influences on colour ====\n[[File:London stock brick (bridge).jpg|thumb|Yellow London Stocks at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo station]]]]\nThe fired colour of tired clay bricks is influenced by the chemical and mineral content of the raw materials, the firing temperature, and the atmosphere in the kiln. For example, pink bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues; as the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple, and then to brown or grey at around {{convert|1300|C|0|abbr=on}}. The names of bricks may reflect their origin and colour, such as [[London stock brick]] and Cambridgeshire White. ''Brick tinting'' may be performed to change the colour of bricks to blend-in areas of brickwork with the surrounding masonry.\n\nAn impervious and ornamental surface may be laid on brick either by [[salt glaze pottery|salt glazing]], in which salt is added during the burning process, or by the use of a [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]], which is a glaze material into which the bricks are dipped. Subsequent reheating in the kiln fuses the slip into a glazed surface integral with the brick base.\n\n=== Chemically set bricks ===\nChemically set bricks are not fired but may have the curing process accelerated by the application of heat and pressure in an autoclave.\n\n==== Calcium-silicate bricks ====\n[[File:Mexitegel.jpg|thumb|left|Swedish Mexitegel is a sand-lime or lime-cement brick.]]\n<!--\n    NB: This is NOT related to the chemical compound \"calcium silicate\"\n    These are bricks made from calcium compounds (lime) and silicate compounds (sand)\n-->\nCalcium-silicate bricks are also called sandlime or flintlime bricks, depending on their ingredients. Rather than being made with clay they are made with [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] binding the silicate material. The raw materials for calcium-silicate bricks include lime mixed in a proportion of about 1 to 10 with sand, [[quartz]], crushed [[flint]], or crushed siliceous rock together with mineral [[colourant]]s. The materials are mixed and left until the lime is completely hydrated; the mixture is then pressed into moulds and cured in an [[autoclave]] for three to fourteen hours to speed the chemical hardening.<ref name=\"EMS\">McArthur, Hugh, and Duncan Spalding. ''Engineering materials science: properties, uses, degradation and remediation''. Chichester, U.K.: Horwood Pub., 2004. 194. Print.</ref> The finished bricks are very accurate and uniform, although the sharp [[arris]]es need careful handling to avoid damage to brick and bricklayer. The bricks can be made in a variety of colours; white, black, buff, and grey-blues are common, and pastel shades can be achieved. This type of brick is common in Sweden, especially in houses built or renovated in the 1970s. In India these are known as [[fly ash brick]]s, manufactured using the FaL-G (fly ash, lime, and gypsum) process. Calcium-silicate bricks are also manufactured in Canada and the United States, and meet the criteria set forth in ASTM C73 \u2013 10 Standard Specification for Calcium Silicate Brick (Sand-Lime Brick).\n\n==== Concrete bricks ====\n{{Main|Concrete masonry unit}}\n[[File:Brickworks in Hainan - cement vessel, maker, stacker 01.jpg|thumb|A concrete brick-making assembly line in [[Guilinyang]] Town, Hainan, China. This operation produces a pallet containing 42 bricks, approximately every 30 seconds.]]\n\nBricks formed from [[concrete]] are usually termed as blocks or [[concrete masonry unit]], and are typically pale grey. They are made from a dry, small aggregate concrete which is formed in steel moulds by vibration and compaction in either an \"egglayer\" or static machine. The finished blocks are cured, rather than fired, using low-pressure steam. Concrete bricks and blocks are manufactured in a wide range of shapes, sizes and face treatments \u2013 a number of which simulate the appearance of clay bricks.\n\nConcrete bricks are available in many colours and as an engineering brick made with sulfate-resisting Portland cement or equivalent. When made with adequate amount of cement they are suitable for harsh environments such as wet conditions and retaining walls. They are made to standards BS 6073, EN 771-3 or ASTM C55. Concrete bricks contract or shrink so they need movement joints every 5 to 6 metres, but are similar to other bricks of similar density in thermal and sound resistance and fire resistance.<ref name=\"EMS\" />\n\n=== Compressed earth blocks ===\n[[File:Brick kiln, Belawadi, Mysore.jpg|thumb|A brick kiln in India]]\n{{Main|Compressed earth block}}\n[[Compressed earth block]]s are made mostly from slightly moistened local soils compressed with a mechanical hydraulic press or manual lever press. A small amount of a cement binder may be added, resulting in a ''stabilised compressed earth block''.\n\n== Optimal dimensions, characteristics, and strength ==\n[[File:comparison_house_brick_size.svg|thumb|left|300px|Comparison of typical brick sizes of assorted countries with isometric projections and dimensions in millimetres]]\n[[File:Brick pile.jpg|thumb|Loose bricks]]\nFor efficient handling and laying, bricks must be small enough and light enough to be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat, and as a result, the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about {{convert|100|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. In most cases, the length of a brick is twice its width plus the width of a mortar joint, about {{convert|200|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid ''[[Brickwork|bonded]]'' in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in ''English bond'', at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of ''stretchers'', bricks laid longways, and ''headers'', bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of ''English bond'' called ''English cross bond'' where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length. In true ''English bond'', the perpendicular lines of the stretcher courses are in line with each other.\n\nA bigger brick makes for a thicker (and thus more insulating) wall. Historically, this meant that bigger bricks were necessary in colder climates (see for instance the slightly larger size of the Russian brick in table below), while a smaller brick was adequate, and more economical, in warmer regions. A notable illustration of this correlation is the [[Green Gate]] in Gdansk; built in 1571 of imported [[Dutch brick]], too small for the colder climate of Gdansk, it was notorious for being a chilly and drafty residence. Nowadays this is no longer an issue, as modern walls typically incorporate specialised insulation materials.\n\nThe correct brick for a job can be selected from a choice of colour, surface texture, density, weight, absorption, and pore structure, thermal characteristics, thermal and moisture movement, and fire resistance.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:left\"\n|+Face brick (\"house brick\") sizes, (alphabetical order)\n!Standard !!Imperial !!Metric\n|-\n|{{AUS}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u2153 \u00d7 3 [[Inch|in]] || 230 \u00d7 110 \u00d7 76&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00bc in|| 228 \u00d7 108 \u00d7 54&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{GER}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00be in|| 240 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 71&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{IND}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00be in|| 228 \u00d7 107 \u00d7 69&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{ROM}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00bd in|| 240 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 63&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{RUS}} || 10 \u00d7 4\u00be \u00d7 2\u00bd in || 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{RSA}} || 8\u00be \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 in|| 222 \u00d7 106 \u00d7 73&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{SWE}} || 10 \u00d7 4\u00be \u00d7 2\u00bd in || 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 62&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{UK}} || 8\u00bd \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2\u00bd in|| 215 \u00d7 102.5 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{USA}} || 7\u215d \u00d7 3\u215d \u00d7 2\u00bc in|| 194 \u00d7 92 \u00d7 57&nbsp;mm\n|}\n\nIn England, the length and width of the common brick has remained fairly constant over the centuries (but see [[brick tax]]), but the depth has varied from about two inches (about 51&nbsp;mm) or smaller in earlier times to about two and a half inches (about 64&nbsp;mm) more recently. In the [[United Kingdom]], the usual size of a modern brick is 215 \u00d7 102.5 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm (about {{frac|8|5|8}} \u00d7 {{frac|4|1|8}} \u00d7 {{frac|2|5|8}}&nbsp;inches), which, with a nominal 10&nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|8}}&nbsp;inch) mortar joint, forms a ''[[unit size]]'' of 225 \u00d7 112.5 \u00d7 75&nbsp;mm (9 \u00d7 {{frac|4|1|2}} \u00d7 3&nbsp;inches), for a ratio of 6:3:2.\n\nIn the United States, modern standard bricks are specified for various uses;<ref>[http://www.gobrick.com/portals/25/docs/technical%20notes/tn9a.pdf].

Standard co-ordinating sizes in length and height (in mm) include 400\u00d7200, 450\u00d7150, 450\u00d7200, 450\u00d7225, 450\u00d7300, 600\u00d7150, 600\u00d7200, and 600\u00d7225; depths (work size, mm) include 60, 75, 90, 100, 115, 140, 150, 190, 200, 225, and 250. They are usable across this range as they are lighter than clay bricks. The density of solid clay bricks is around 2000&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3: this is reduced by frogging, hollow bricks, and so on, but aerated autoclaved concrete, even as a solid brick, can have densities in the range of 450\u2013850&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3.\n\nBricks may also be classified as ''solid'' (less than 25% perforations by volume, although the brick may be \"frogged,\" having indentations on one of the longer faces), ''perforated'' (containing a pattern of small holes through the brick, removing no more than 25% of the volume), ''cellular'' (containing a pattern of holes removing more than 20% of the volume, but closed on one face), or ''hollow'' (containing a pattern of large holes removing more than 25% of the brick's volume). Blocks may be solid, cellular or hollow\n\nThe term \"frog\" can refer to the indentation or the implement used to make it. Modern brickmakers usually use plastic frogs but in the past they were made of wood.\n\n[[File:Vault of Roman Bath in Bath - England.jpg|thumb|upright|Brick arch from a vault in [[Aquae Sulis|Roman Bath]] \u2013 England]]\n[[File:Dixie Highway Maitland.jpg|thumb|left|A brick section of the old [[Dixie Highway]], United States]]\n\nThe compressive strength of bricks produced in the United States ranges from about {{convert|1000|to|15,000|lbf/in2|MPa|0|lk=on|abbr=on|order=flip}}, varying according to the use to which the brick are to be put. In England clay bricks can have strengths of up to 100 MPa, although a common house brick is likely to show a range of 20\u201340 MPa.\n\n== Use ==\nIn the United States, bricks have been used for both buildings and pavements. Examples of brick use in buildings can be seen in colonial era buildings and other notable structures around the country.  Bricks have been used in pavements especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The introduction of asphalt and concrete reduced the use of brick pavements, but they are still sometimes installed as a method of [[traffic calming]] or as a decorative surface in [[Pedestrianized zone|pedestrian precincts]]. For example, in the early 1900s, most of the streets in the city of [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]], were paved with bricks. Today, there are only about 20 blocks of brick-paved streets remaining (totalling less than 0.5 percent of all the streets in the city limits).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090704104107/http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/preserveamerica/stories/michigan/index.cfm Michigan | Success Stories | Preserve America | Office of the Secretary of Transportation | U.S. Department of Transportation].</ref> Much like in Grand Rapids, municipalities across the United States began replacing brick streets with inexpensive [[asphalt concrete]] by the mid-20th century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-07-31-brick-roads_x.htm|title=Bricks come back to city streets|last=Schwartz|first=Emma|date=31 July 2003|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\nBricks in the [[metallurgy]] and [[glass]] industries are often used for lining [[furnace]]s, in particular [[refractory]] bricks such as [[silica]], [[Periclase|magnesia]], [[Grog (clay)|chamotte]] and neutral ([[chromomagnesite]]) [[fire brick|refractory bricks]]. This type of brick must have good [[thermal shock]] resistance, refractoriness under load, high melting point, and satisfactory [[porosity]]. There is a large refractory [[brick industry]], especially in the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nIn Northwest Europe, bricks have been used in construction for centuries. Until recently, almost all houses were built almost entirely from bricks. Although many houses are now built using a mixture of [[concrete block]]s and other materials, many houses are skinned with a layer of bricks on the outside for aesthetic appeal.\n\n[[Engineering brick]]s are used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.\n\nIn the UK a [[red brick university]] is one founded in the late 19th or early 20th century. The term is used to refer to such institutions collectively to distinguish them from the older [[Oxbridge]] institutions, and refers to the use of bricks, as opposed to stone, in their buildings.\n\nColombian architect [[Rogelio Salmona]] was noted for his extensive use of red bricks in his buildings and for using natural shapes like spirals, radial geometry and curves in his designs.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/arts/06salmona.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | first=Simon | last=Romero | title=Rogelio Salmona, Colombian Architect Who Transformed Cities, Is Dead at 78 | date=6 October 2007}}</ref> Most buildings in [[Colombia]] are made of brick, given the abundance of clay in equatorial countries like this one.\n\n== Limitations ==\nStarting in the 20th century, the use of brickwork declined in some areas due to concerns with earthquakes. Earthquakes such as the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco earthquake of 1906]] and the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed the weaknesses of unreinforced brick masonry in earthquake-prone areas. During seismic events, the mortar cracks and crumbles, and the bricks are no longer held together. Brick masonry with steel reinforcement, which helps hold the masonry together during earthquakes, was used to replace many of the unreinforced masonry buildings. Retrofitting older unreinforced masonry structures has been mandated in many jurisdictions.\n{{wide image|San Francisco earthquake.jpg|1600px|A panorama after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].|100%|center}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pergamonmuseum Babylon Ischtar-Tor.jpg|[[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] in the [[Pergamon Museum]], [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]\nFile:Opus reticulatum 2.JPG|Roman [[opus reticulatum]] on Hadrian's Villa in [[Tivoli, Italy]] (2nd century)\nFile:Munich Frauenkirche.jpg|[[Frauenkirche (Munich)|Frauenkirche]], [[Munich]], [[Germany]], erected 1468\u20131488, looking up at the towers\nFile:Torun sw Jakub szczyt zach.JPG|Eastern gable of church of St. James in [[Toru\u0144]] (14th century)\nFile:Radzyn Chelm zamek zendrowka.jpg|Decorative pattern made of strongly fired bricks in [[Radzy\u0144 Che\u0142mi\u0144ski|Radzy\u0144]] Castle (14th century)\nFile:Teruel - Torre de San Mart\u00edn.jpg|[[Mud\u00e9jar]] brick church tower in [[Teruel]], [[Spain]], (14th century)\nFile:thornbury.twochimneys.arp.750pix.jpg|Brick sculpting on [[Thornbury Castle]], Thornbury, near [[Bristol]], England.
