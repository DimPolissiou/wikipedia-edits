The road runs east\u2013west in the northern section of the state, with the western end at the [[Indiana]]\u2013Ohio border near [[Bryan, Ohio|Bryan]] where it meets the [[Indiana Toll Road]], and the eastern end at the Ohio\u2013[[Pennsylvania]] border near [[Petersburg, Mahoning County, Ohio|Petersburg]], where it meets the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]. The road is owned and maintained by the Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission (OTIC), headquartered in [[Berea, Ohio|Berea]].{{#tag:ref|The name of the agency was the Ohio Turnpike Commission until July 1, 2013, when the name was changed to its current form by the [[Ohio General Assembly]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/5537.02v2 |title = 5537.02 Ohio turnpike and infrastructure commission |date = July 1, 2013 |author = [[Ohio General Assembly]] |work = [[Ohio Revised Code]] |access-date = September 2, 2013 }}</ref>|name=name|group=lower-alpha}}\n\nBuilt from 1949 to 1955, construction for the roadway was completed a year prior to the [[Interstate Highway System]]. The modern Ohio Turnpike is signed as three Interstate numbers: [[Interstate 76 in Ohio|I-76]], [[Interstate 80 in Ohio|I-80]], and [[Interstate 90 in Ohio|I-90]].\n\n== Route description == \nThe entire length of the Ohio Turnpike is {{convert|241.3|mi|km}}, from the western terminus in [[Northwest Township, Williams County, Ohio|Northwest Township]] near [[Edon, Ohio|Edon]], where it meets the [[Indiana Toll Road]] at the Ohio\u2013Indiana border, to the eastern terminus in [[Springfield Township, Mahoning County, Ohio|Springfield Township]] near [[Petersburg, Mahoning County, Ohio|Petersburg]] where it meets the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] at the Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania border. Most of the turnpike, {{Convert|218.7|mi|km}} between the Indiana border and an interchange with [[Interstate 76 in Ohio|Interstate 76]] (I-76) near [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], is signed as part of [[Interstate 80 in Ohio|I-80]], while the eastern {{convert|22.6|mi|km}}, between the I-80/I-76 interchange and the Pennsylvania border, is signed as part of I-76. For {{convert|142.8|mi|km}}, between the Indiana border and [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]], [[Interstate 90 in Ohio|I-90]] is [[concurrency (road)|cosigned]] with I-80 as part of the turnpike.\n\nThe Ohio Turnpike does not pass directly into any major city, but does provide access to the four major metro areas in northern Ohio through connected routes. Two auxiliary Interstate highways, [[Interstate 271|I-271]] near [[Cleveland]] and [[Interstate 475 (Ohio)|I-475]] near [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], cross the turnpike, but do not have direct connections. In [[Northwest Ohio]], the turnpike passes through the southern part of the [[Toledo, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area|Toledo metropolitan area]], with direct access to Toledo through [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|I-75]] and [[Interstate 280 (Ohio)|I-280]].\n\nIn [[Northeast Ohio]], the turnpike passes through the southern suburbs of [[Greater Cleveland]] and the northern edge of the [[Akron, Ohio, metropolitan statistical area|Akron metro area]], with direct access to [[Cleveland]] via [[Interstate 71|I-71]], [[Interstate 77 in Ohio|I-77]], and [[Interstate 480 (Ohio)|I-480]]. [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] is connected to the turnpike via I-77 and [[Ohio State Route 8|State Route 8]] (SR&nbsp;8) in the north and I-76 on the east. The turnpike is located on the western and southern edges of the [[Youngstown\u2013Warren\u2013Boardman metropolitan statistical area|Mahoning Valley]], with direct access to [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]] through the remaining portion of I-80 east of the Turnpike, and [[Interstate 680 (Ohio)|I-680]].\n\nIn [[North Jackson, Ohio|North Jackson]], I-80 and I-76 swap each other's [[right-of-way]]; I-76 continues east as I-80 and I-80 continues southeast as I-76, carrying the turnpike with it.\nIn [[Petersburg, Mahoning County, Ohio|Petersburg]], the concurrent routes cross the state lines into Pennsylvania, automatically becoming the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Update-section|date=July 2014}}\n[[File:Ohio Turnpike westbound.jpg|thumb|left|Westbound Ohio Turnpike]]\n\nIn 1947 a bill was introduced in the [[Ohio General Assembly]] authorizing a privately financed roadway.

The modern Ohio Turnpike is signed as three Interstate numbers: [[Interstate 76 in Ohio|I-76]], [[Interstate 80 in Ohio|I-80]], and [[Interstate 90 in Ohio|I-90]].\n\n== Route description == \nThe entire length of the Ohio Turnpike is {{convert|241.3|mi|km}}, from the western terminus in [[Northwest Township, Williams County, Ohio|Northwest Township]] near [[Edon, Ohio|Edon]], where it meets the [[Indiana Toll Road]] at the Ohio\u2013Indiana border, to the eastern terminus in [[Springfield Township, Mahoning County, Ohio|Springfield Township]] near [[Petersburg, Mahoning County, Ohio|Petersburg]] where it meets the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] at the Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania border. Most of the turnpike, {{Convert|218.7|mi|km}} between the Indiana border and an interchange with [[Interstate 76 in Ohio|Interstate 76]] (I-76) near [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], is signed as part of [[Interstate 80 in Ohio|I-80]], while the eastern {{convert|22.6|mi|km}}, between the I-80/I-76 interchange and the Pennsylvania border, is signed as part of I-76. For {{convert|142.8|mi|km}}, between the Indiana border and [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]], [[Interstate 90 in Ohio|I-90]] is [[concurrency (road)|cosigned]] with I-80 as part of the turnpike.\n\nThe Ohio Turnpike does not pass directly into any major city, but does provide access to the four major metro areas in northern Ohio through connected routes. Two auxiliary Interstate highways, [[Interstate 271|I-271]] near [[Cleveland]] and [[Interstate 475 (Ohio)|I-475]] near [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], cross the turnpike, but do not have direct connections. In [[Northwest Ohio]], the turnpike passes through the southern part of the [[Toledo, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area|Toledo metropolitan area]], with direct access to Toledo through [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|I-75]] and [[Interstate 280 (Ohio)|I-280]].\n\nIn [[Northeast Ohio]], the turnpike passes through the southern suburbs of [[Greater Cleveland]] and the northern edge of the [[Akron, Ohio, metropolitan statistical area|Akron metro area]], with direct access to [[Cleveland]] via [[Interstate 71|I-71]], [[Interstate 77 in Ohio|I-77]], and [[Interstate 480 (Ohio)|I-480]]. [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] is connected to the turnpike via I-77 and [[Ohio State Route 8|State Route 8]] (SR&nbsp;8) in the north and I-76 on the east. The turnpike is located on the western and southern edges of the [[Youngstown\u2013Warren\u2013Boardman metropolitan statistical area|Mahoning Valley]], with direct access to [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]] through the remaining portion of I-80 east of the Turnpike, and [[Interstate 680 (Ohio)|I-680]].\n\nIn [[North Jackson, Ohio|North Jackson]], I-80 and I-76 swap each other's [[right-of-way]]; I-76 continues east as I-80 and I-80 continues southeast as I-76, carrying the turnpike with it.\nIn [[Petersburg, Mahoning County, Ohio|Petersburg]], the concurrent routes cross the state lines into Pennsylvania, automatically becoming the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Update-section|date=July 2014}}\n[[File:Ohio Turnpike westbound.jpg|thumb|left|Westbound Ohio Turnpike]]\n\nIn 1947 a bill was introduced in the [[Ohio General Assembly]] authorizing a privately financed roadway.
