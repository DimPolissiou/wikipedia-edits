The second large wave of immigration occurred in the 1960s and 70s, mainly from northern Iraq due to conflicts and persecution by the [[Baathist]] government of Iraq. Many Assyrians arrived during this period and took advantage of the ongoing [[White flight]] in Detroit.\n\nAs a result of the situation, Assyrians gained a monopoly over grocery stores and other small businesses, and in many cases used their finances and newfound wealth to benefit the Assyrian community there and take in Assyrian refugees from Iraq. More Assyrians arrived throughout the 80s and 90s for similar reasons, with newer residents moving out of Detroit into suburbs such as Royal Oak and Sterling Heights due to the [[Crack epidemic]] in Detroit, while others began to move to [[San Diego]], establishing a new Assyrian community there.\n\nIn 2005, the first Assyrian school in the United States, the Assyrian American Christian School, opened in [[Tarzana, California|Tarzana]], [[Los Angeles]].\n\n===In Michigan===\n{{see also|History of the Middle Eastern people in Metro Detroit#Chaldo-Assyrian Americans}}\n[[File:Chaldeanchurch.jpg|thumb|[[Chaldean Catholic Church]] in Detroit.  [[Chaldean Christian|Assyrian Catholic]] immigration, mainly to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], began in the early 20th century.]]\n\n[[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] immigration to the cities in [[Michigan]] began in the early 20th century. The cities in the state include, but are not limited to, [[Detroit]], [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]], [[Sterling Heights, Michigan|Sterling Heights]], [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]], [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], [[West Bloomfield, Michigan|West Bloomfield]], Commerce, Walled Lake, Rochester Hills, [[Farmington Hills, Michigan|Farmington Hills]], [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Warren, Michigan|Warren]], Bloomfield Hills and [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. More and more Assyrians, as they establish themselves financially, quickly move out of Detroit and into the other locations, including [[San Diego]] and cities in [[Arizona]].\n\nBefore the 1970s, Assyrians came to the United States in search of greater economic opportunities. After the 1970s, many Assyrians fled for political freedom, especially after the rise of [[Saddam Hussein]] and, after the [[Persian Gulf War]]. Some were drawn by the economic opportunities they had seen successfully affect their family members who had already immigrated.\n\nLess stringent immigration laws during the 1960s and 1970s facilitated increasing numbers, with the 1970s seeing the highest number of Assyrians coming to the United States. In 1962, the number of Assyrian owned grocery stores was 120, but grew to 278 in 1972. The main cause of this were the [[1967 Detroit riots]], after which [[Jew]]ish grocery store owners left the area and left the opportunity open for Assyrians to take over.  Often these Jews sold their old stores to Assyrians.<ref>Chafets, Ze'ev. ''Devils Night: and Other True Tales of Detroit''.

The second large wave of immigration occurred in the 1960s and 70s, mainly from northern Iraq due to conflicts and persecution by the [[Baathist]] government of Iraq. Many Assyrians arrived during this period and took advantage of the ongoing [[White flight]] in Detroit.\n\nAs a result of the situation, Assyrians gained a monopoly over grocery stores and other small businesses, and in many cases used their finances and newfound wealth to benefit the Assyrian community there and take in Assyrian refugees from Iraq. More Assyrians arrived throughout the 80s and 90s for similar reasons, with newer residents moving out of Detroit into suburbs such as Royal Oak and Sterling Heights due to the [[Crack epidemic]] in Detroit, while others began to move to [[San Diego]], establishing a new Assyrian community there.\n\nIn 2005, the first Assyrian school in the United States, the Assyrian American Christian School, opened in [[Tarzana, California|Tarzana]], [[Los Angeles]].\n\n===In Michigan===\n{{see also|History of the Middle Eastern people in Metro Detroit#Chaldo-Assyrian Americans}}\n[[File:Chaldeanchurch.jpg|thumb|[[Chaldean Catholic Church]] in Detroit.  [[Chaldean Christian|Assyrian Catholic]] immigration, mainly to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], began in the early 20th century.]]\n\n[[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] immigration to the cities in [[Michigan]] began in the early 20th century. The cities in the state include, but are not limited to, [[Detroit]], [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]], [[Sterling Heights, Michigan|Sterling Heights]], [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]], [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], [[West Bloomfield, Michigan|West Bloomfield]], Commerce, Walled Lake, Rochester Hills, [[Farmington Hills, Michigan|Farmington Hills]], [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Warren, Michigan|Warren]], Bloomfield Hills and [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. More and more Assyrians, as they establish themselves financially, quickly move out of Detroit and into the other locations, including [[San Diego]] and cities in [[Arizona]].\n\nBefore the 1970s, Assyrians came to the United States in search of greater economic opportunities. After the 1970s, many Assyrians fled for political freedom, especially after the rise of [[Saddam Hussein]] and, after the [[Persian Gulf War]]. Some were drawn by the economic opportunities they had seen successfully affect their family members who had already immigrated.\n\nLess stringent immigration laws during the 1960s and 1970s facilitated increasing numbers, with the 1970s seeing the highest number of Assyrians coming to the United States. In 1962, the number of Assyrian owned grocery stores was 120, but grew to 278 in 1972. The main cause of this were the [[1967 Detroit riots]], after which [[Jew]]ish grocery store owners left the area and left the opportunity open for Assyrians to take over.  Often these Jews sold their old stores to Assyrians.<ref>Chafets, Ze'ev. ''Devils Night: and Other True Tales of Detroit''.

He is the brother of actress [[Alicia Alonzo]], who herself is still appearing in Filipino films and soaps.\n\n==Education==\nAntonio V. Hernandez received his elementary and secondary education at the Marulas Elementary School and Espiritu Santo High School, respectively. He took up Commerce at the Mapua Institute of Technology.\n\n==Movie career==\nBesides the so-called bold and sexy films that pervaded the movie industry in the '70s and early '80s, the period also saw the emergence and proliferation of true-to-life movies. Producers then banked on the colorful and controversial lives of known notorious criminals to come up with profitable movie projects, i.e. Nardong Putik, Kapitan Eddie Set, Baby Ama, Ronquillo, Salonga, and Waway, to name a few. Popular actors [[Ramon Revilla]] and [[Rudy Fernandez (actor)|Rudy Fernandez]] topped the list of action stars who appeared in one movie after another, portraying infamous and villainous characters.

Stardom came late for Alonzo. He was already 30 when he was given an important role in Hindi sa Iyo ang Mundo Baby Porcuna in 1978, for which he was nominated for the URIAN Best Supporting Actor award. He was nominated in the FAMAS the following year for Dakpin si Junior Bombay (1979). In 1982, he won the FAMAS Best Actor award for his role in Bambang. He also won the Best Actor awards in the 3 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) for his work in: ''Bago Kumalat Ang Kamandag'' (1983), ''The Moises Padilla Story: The Missing Chapter'' (1985) and ''Anak Badjao'' (1987).\n\n==Political life==\nHe ran for councilor in the 1992 Metro Manila elections and won.
