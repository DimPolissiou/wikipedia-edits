Originally owned by two iron companies, the railroad later became part of the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railway|Reading system]], and parts of it remain in operation today.\n\n==Origins==\nFrom its founding in 1839 until the 1890s under the auspices of the [[Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company]], the [[Lehigh Crane Iron Company]] &mdash; the first enterprise in North America to successfully achieve [[anthracite]] charged [[iron]] [[smelting]] using the newly patented Scottish [[hot blast]] technology to produce a new, plentiful and inexpensive (even revolutionary) product [[anthracite iron]] &mdash; obtained much of its ore supply from [[limonite]] deposits in southern Lehigh County. The ore had to be hauled over rural roads and across Biery's Bridge to reach the company's budding furnace and casting complex at [[Biery's Port Historic District|Biery's Port]] (renamed [[Catasauqua, Pennsylvania|Catasauqua]] in 1854), which early on, would have eight of the first ten successful blast furnaces producing anthracite iron in the Lehigh Valley. The wagons used to carry the heavy ore did great damage to the roads, and as the furnaces expanded, the deficiencies of this method of transportation became clear.{{sfn|Bartholomew|Metz|1988|p=100}}\n \nThe first successful anthracite blow and cast of iron occurred there on July, 4th 1840 about which Bartholomew & Metz note:\n{{quote|\nFrom that moment on, anthracite and the canals were of pivotal importance in the industrial development of the United States.\n\nUsing anthracite as fuel in its production, iron for the first time became plentiful and inexpensive.  For a period of thirty years, three decades that shaped the future of the valley, anthracite fueled furnaces throughout the Lehigh Valley produced greater quantities of iron than any other part of the nation.|author=Ann Bartholomew & Lance E. Metz, page 5\n|publication= ''DELAWARE and LEHIGH CANALS''\n}}\n \nThe initial application to the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] for a railroad charter, around 1853, was met with fierce resistance by local farmers, who feared that trains would frighten livestock, set fires, and destroy the local farming districts.{{sfn|Bartholomew|Metz|1988|p=100}} The iron company was forced to compromise and charter the '''Catasauqua and Fogelsville Plank Road''' on July 2, 1853.{{sfn|Kulp|1962|p=69}} While [[plank road]]s were a popular improvement in transportation at the time, the short stretch that was constructed was found wholly inadequate for the haulage of ore. The heavily-loaded wagons rapidly damaged the road and rendered it dangerous for travel.{{sfn|Bartholomew|Metz|1988|p=100}} The Crane Iron Company persevered, and on April 20, 1854, the plank road was issued a modified charter to operate as the '''Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad'''.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=456}} The newly chartered [[Thomas Iron Company]] partnered with Crane in support of the railroad in March 1856, and construction began shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Bartholomew|Metz|1988|p=100}} Crane Iron owned 60% of the railroad stock, and Thomas Iron 40%.\n\n==Route==\nThe eastern terminus of the line was in [[West Catasauqua, Pennsylvania|West Catasauqua]]. Here, it connected with the private railroad of the Thomas Iron Company, which ran a short distance north to its furnaces at [[Hokendauqua, Pennsylvania|Hokendauqua]], and that of Crane Iron, which crossed the Lehigh River to that company's furnaces at Catasauqua.{{sfn|Kulp|1962|p=69}} It also connected with the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], newly completed through the area. It ran westward through [[Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|Whitehall Township]], with stations at Mickley's and [[Seiple, Pennsylvania|Seiple]]. It then turned southwestward to enter [[South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania|South Whitehall Township]]. The line crossed a high bridge over [[Jordan Creek (Pennsylvania)|Jordan Creek]] to reach Guth's Station (later [[Guth, Pennsylvania|Guth]]), where there was a short spur to a local [[limestone]] quarry and ore pits.  Leaving Guth, the railroad turned west, then south to climb across the shoulder of Huckleberry Ridge and reach Wulbert's Station (later [[Walbert, Pennsylvania|Walbert]]), then ran southwestward into [[Upper Macungie Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Macungie Township]]. At [[Chapman, Pennsylvania|Chapman's Station]] (named for Charles W. Chapman, superintendent of the railroad), it turned south again to reach Rupp's Station, a short distance southward. This was the extent of the first stage of the line, opened on July 14, 1857.{{sfn|Kulp|1962|p=69}} [[Fogelsville, Pennsylvania|Fogelsville]] was never directly reached by the line, but lay about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} west of Rupp's Station.\n\nThe desire of the Thomas Iron Company to build a furnace in the southern part of the county resulted in a further extension in 1864.{{sfn|Bartholomew|Metz|1988|p=56}} Construction continued southward from Rupp's Station, through [[Crane, Pennsylvania|Crane Station]] (named for the iron company) and [[Trexlertown, Pennsylvania|Trexlertown]]. Entering [[Lower Macungie Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Macungie Township]], the Catasauqua & Foglesville made a connection with the [[East Pennsylvania Railroad]], completed 1859, at [[Alburtis, Pennsylvania|Alburtis]]. It crossed over the East Penn and passed alongside the proposed furnace site, just south of Alburtis at Lock Ridge. In 1865, the line was extended south, across [[Swabia Creek]] and into the mountains.{{sfn|Kulp|1962|p=70}} Climbing southeast and then running southwest along the side of the ridge, the line entered [[Longswamp Township, Pennsylvania|Longswamp Township, Berks County]]. It entered [[Red Lion, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Red Lion]] from the northeast and passed on to [[Rittenhouse Gap, Pennsylvania|Rittenhouse Gap]] and the Thomas Iron Company's [[magnetite]] mines there. A turntable was built at the end of the line. In 1868, the furnaces at Lock Ridge went into operation,{{sfn|Bartholomew|Metz|1988|p=56}} shipping and receiving over both the Catasauqua & Fogelsville and the East Penn.\n\nIn addition to coal, ore and lime traffic, the railroad also operated passenger service from Alburtis to West Catasauqua, which would continue until September 29, 1935.{{sfn|Kulp|1962|p=70}}\n\n==Ore spurs and wharves==\nThe railroad could not run a spur to every mine site, and a number of \"ore wharves\" were constructed along the [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]]. At the wharves, ore could be dumped from wagons into piles, and later transferred to railcars to be shipped to the furnaces.\n\nImportant mines did, however, warrant the expense of constructing branch lines, authorized by a charter supplement of April 8, 1861.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=456}} The longest of these left the main line at Trexlertown, and ran as far as [[Breinigsville, Pennsylvania|Breinigsville]] on the unfinished [[Allentown Railroad]] right-of-way. There it diverged, and continued to [[Farmington, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Farmington]], the site of a large ore wharf, and ended at the ore pits in the vicinity of [[Klines Corner, Pennsylvania|Klines Corner]].{{sfn|Bartholomew|Metz|1988|p=101}} A shorter branch, originating at Crane, ran west and then turned sharply north to end at the Wallner iron mine near [[Haafsville, Pennsylvania|Haafsville]]. Finally, a switchback was built from the main line between Red Lion and Rittenhouse Gap in the late 1880s, which served the [[hematite]] mines near [[Seisholtzville, Pennsylvania|Seisholtzville]]. Another charter amendment of May 26, 1863, allowing the railroad to extend to [[Bath, Pennsylvania|Bath]] (northeast of Catasauqua and terminus of the [[Bangor and Portland Railroad]]) was never utilized.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=456}}\n\n==Reading control==\nMost of the stock of the Catasauqua & Fogelsville was bought by the Reading in 1890, as iron ore from the [[Mesabi Range]] began to put pressure on local iron mining operations. It was leased to the Reading on December 8, 1893. Between 1916 and 1919, furnace slag was dumped under the Jordan Creek high bridge so that it could be replaced by a fill and culvert.{{sfn|Kulp|1962|p=70}} Iron ore traffic continued to decline, and the local mines had all been shut down by the end of [[World War I]]. The mine branches remained in place, derelict, until the 1940s, when the three spurs and the main line south of Lock Ridge were abandoned.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=456}} The Catasauqua and Fogelsville was formally merged{{sfn|Kulp|1962|p=70}}<ref>''New York Times'', \"Rail Merger Authorized\"</ref> into the Reading on August 10, 1944, probably to simplify the corporate structure of that railroad and to save on taxes, as with a series of other mergers the next year.<ref>''New York Times'', \"Reading Mergers Voted\"</ref>\n\n==Post-merger==\nThe line from Alburtis to the now-derelict furnaces at Lock Ridge remained in place to haul furnace [[slag]] until 1959, when it was abandoned.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=456}} Otherwise, the line remained largely intact until after passing to [[Conrail]]. The connection in West Catasauqua with the [[Lehigh and New England Railroad]] (formerly the Crane Iron Company tracks) had been abandoned in 1961. Anticipating the abandonment of the former Lehigh Valley main line in February 1982, leaving only the moribund Ironton Railroad connection, the line east of Seiple was abandoned on December 21, 1981.{{sfn|Taber|1987|p=456}} The remainder survived the breakup of Conrail to become the [[Norfolk Southern]] C&F Secondary. It is operated as a [[branch line]] from Alburtis, serving a number of industrial customers in the Chapman area.\n\nField Survey from March 2010 shows almost all of the line from Alburtis to Rittenhouse Gap and Seisholtsville still easy to follow.

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Females are not social and have minimal interaction with other individuals, barring the interaction with males during the mating season. Some females, generally mother and offspring or siblings, may rest beside one another during the day.

Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning of concealed or lost cubs by the mother, as a form of greeting or courtship between adults.<ref name=sh2003/> The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. <ref name=volodina/> A similar but louder call ('yelp') that can be heard from up to {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=\"kingdon\">{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=J. |authorlink=Jonathan Kingdon |title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals |chapter = Cheetah ''Acinonyx jubatus''|year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=978-1-4729-1236-7 |pages=403\u2013404 |edition=2nd |chapterurl = {{Google Books|id=gcrBDwAAQBAJ|pg=PT975|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to 2 seconds.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though [[nyala]], whose males weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve.

A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though [[nyala]], whose males weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve.

Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran).

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

His oeuvre can be broadly divided into four periods: an early \"[[neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]]\" period of the 1950s, exhibiting close ties to tradition; an avant-garde and [[constructivism (art)|constructivist]] stage of the 1960s, when he experimented with [[serialism|serial]] techniques, but abandoned them later in the decade; a \"[[Neoromanticism (music)|neo-romantic]]\" period of the late 1960s and the 1970s; and an eclectic, \"[[postmodern music|post-modern]]\" compositional style in which he blended a wide spectrum of stylistic techniques and genres.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book|first1=John David |last1=White|first2=Jean |last2=Christensen|title=New Music of the Nordic Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyUOv6EQrWcC&pg=PA199|year=2002|publisher=Pendragon Press|isbn=978-1-57647-019-0|pages=197\u2013203}}</ref><ref name=FG/> A recurring label given to his opus is \"mysticism\", for his fascination with metaphysical and religious subjects and texts.<ref name=WP/><ref name=White/><ref name=FG/> (Several of his works have titles which allude to [[angel]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=St\u0119pie\u0144 |first=Wojciech |year=2010 |title=Signifying Angels: Analyses and Interpretations of Rautavaara's Instrumental Compositions | type=Ph.D. thesis |series=Studia musicologica Universitatis Helsingiensis |volume=20 |location=Helsinki |isbn=978-952-10-6399-2 |issn=0787-4294 |lay-url=http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:0788-952-10-6399-2 }}</ref>)\n\nHis compositions include eight [[Symphony|symphonies]], 14 [[concerto]]s, choral works (several for unaccompanied choir, including ''Vigilia'' (1971\u20131972)), [[sonata (music)|sonatas]] for various instruments, [[string quartet]]s and other [[chamber music]], and a number of biographical [[opera]]s including ''[[Vincent (opera)|Vincent]]'' (1986\u20131987, based on the life of [[Vincent van Gogh]]), ''[[Aleksis Kivi (opera)|Aleksis Kivi]]'' (1995\u20131996) and ''[[Rasputin (opera)|Rasputin]]'' (2001\u20132003).<ref name=Guardian/>\n\n===1960s===\nAlong with [[Erik Bergman]], Rautavaara was one of the pioneers of serial composing in Finland in the early 1950s, although in the end he completed only several serial works.<ref name=HS/> His most important works from the period are the [[Symphony No. 3 (Rautavaara)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 4 (Rautavaara)|Fourth]] Symphony, and the opera ''[[Kaivos]]'' (The Mine), which saw only a television production in 1963,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/rautavaara-kaivos-the-mine |title=Rautavaara Kaivos, 'The Mine' |publisher=Gramophone |first=David |last=Fanning |date=}}</ref> but was a source of material for the string orchestra pieces ''Canto I'' (1960) and ''Canto II'' (1961), and for the Third String Quartet (1965).<ref name=White/> Even his serial works from the period carry obvious romantic and post-expressionist notes stylistically closer to [[Alban Berg]] and [[Anton Bruckner]] than more straightforward serialists such as [[Pierre Boulez]]. Rautavaara himself referred to the Third as the \"Bruckner's symphony\".<ref name=HS/><ref name=White/>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Rautavaara fell into a creative crisis with serialism, noticing that the composition method was immensely laborious and its distance from the outcome too large. He found a resolution towards the end of the decade, when he began to explore different styles as he had earlier done in the Third Symphony. The Bach-influenced Cello Concerto No. 1 and Debussy-influenced ''[[Anadyomene (Rautavaara)|Anadyomene]]'' opened his creative deadlock. More eclectic works started to emerge, whose style loans and compositional techniques over time became characteristic of his style. Its hallmarks included three-chord-based, often modal harmonies, ringing softly romantic orchestrals, modernism springing from the new play modes, and finally the return of the twelve-tone passages embedded into the musical texture.<ref name=HS/>\n\n===1970s===\nThe 1970s were Rautavaara's most productive period. In a short time he composed an extensive body of music, most of which has withstood the test of time. The softly-sounding new style was noticed by choirs, who commissioned a number of choral songs from the composer. His major choral works ''Vigilia'' and ''True and False Unicorn'' were made during 1971. ''Cantus Arcticus'' followed immediately after, in the beginning of 1972, and in the summer he composed an extensive score for male choir, ''A Book of Life''.<ref name=HS/>\n\nIn the 1970s Rautavaara started working more extensively on operas. The comical opera-musical ''Apollo contra Marsyas'', made in 1970 in cooperation with librettist [[Bengt V. Wall]] turned out to be a disappointment. After that, based on motifs from the [[Kalevala]], he composed ''The Myth of Sampo'' (1974/1983) and ''Marjatta, lowly maiden'' (1975). His mature style in operas was exhibited later, in ''Thomas'' (1985); subsequently ''Vincent'' (1987) and ''The House of the Sun'' (1991) earned him notable international success.<ref name=FG>{{cite web|url=http://www.fennicagehrman.fi/composers/rautavaara-einojuhani/ |title=Einojuhani Rautavaara |publisher=Fennica Gehrman}}</ref> His later operas include ''The Gift of the Magi'' (1994), [[Aleksis Kivi (opera)|''Aleksis Kivi'']] (1997) and [[Rasputin (opera)|''Rasputin'']] (2003).<ref name=HS/>\n\nA number of his works have parts for [[magnetic tape]], including ''[[Cantus Arcticus]]'' (1972, also known as ''Concerto for Birds & Orchestra'') for taped [[bird song]] and orchestra,<ref name=Guardian/> and ''True and False Unicorn'' (1971, second version 1974, revised 2001\u201302), the final version of which is for three reciters, choir, orchestra and tape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicstoday.com/review/review-10496/ |title=Rautavaara: True & False Unicorn |first=David |last=Vernier |publisher=Classics Today |date=14 June 2004}}</ref>\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nIn the second part of the 1970s, Rautavaara gradually turned toward stylistic synthesis, evident in the Organ Concerto \"Annunciations\" (1977) and the Violin Concerto (1977), and especially in ''Angels and Visitations'' (1978) for orchestra, one of his most fascinating works. It is the first in the \"Angel\" series, which also includes the [[Symphony No. 5 (Rautavaara)|Fifth Symphony]], whose working title was \"Monologue with Angels\", the double-bass concerto ''Angel of Dusk'' from 1980, and the [[Symphony No. 7 (Rautavaara)|Seventh Symphony \"Angel of Light\"]].<ref name=Guardian/><ref name=White/>\n\nHis opera ''[[Thomas (opera)|Thomas]]'' (1985) marked the beginning of his mature operatic style, combining neo-romantic harmonies with [[aleatoric]] counterpoint, twelve-tone rows and different modal systems.<ref name=White/> The libretto, written by Rautavaara himself, tells the story of a 13th-century Bishop of Finland as experienced by the protagonist himself, again using Kalevala motifs. A similar [[first-person narrative]] is used in the next opera ''Vincent'' (1987) devoted to [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Along with ''The House of the Sun'' (1991), the operas earned him notable international success.<ref name=\"FG\"/>\n\nHis most widely acclaimed work, the Seventh Symphony, earned a [[Cannes Classical Award]] and a [[Grammy]] nomination for the recording by the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by [[Leif Segerstam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ondine.net/?lid=en&cid=2.2&oid=ODE%20869-2 |title=Einojuhani Rautavaara Angel of Light (Symphony No. 7) |publisher=Ondine}}</ref>\n\nApart from the ''Angel of Light'', his notable instrumental works from the period include the [[Symphony No. 6 (Rautavaara)|Sixth Symphony \"Vincentiana\"]] (1992), based on ''Vincent''; the Third Piano Concerto \"Gift of Dreams\" (1998), commissioned by [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]; the orchestral work ''Autumn Gardens'' (1998), commissioned by the [[Scottish Chamber Orchestra]]; and the [[Symphony No. 8 (Rautavaara)|Eighth Symphony \"The Journey\"]], commissioned by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].<ref name=White/>\n\n===2000s===\nRautavaara's later works include the orchestral works ''Book of Visions'' (2003\u20132005), ''Manhattan Trilogy'' (2003\u20132005) and ''Before the Icons'' (2005), which is an expanded version of his early piano work ''Icons''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ondine.net/index.php?lid=en&cid=4.2&oid=622 |title=Einojuhani Rautavaara (1928\u2013) |publisher=Ondine Records}}</ref> In 2005 he finished a work for violin and piano called ''Lost Landscapes'', commissioned by the violinist [[Midori Goto]].

He graduated from the Sibelius Academy in 1957.<ref name=Guardian/>\n\nRautavaara served as a non-tenured teacher at the Sibelius Academy from 1957 to 1959, music archivist of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from 1959 to 1961, rector of the K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 Music Institute in Helsinki from 1965 to 1966, tenured teacher at the Sibelius Academy from 1966 to 1976, artist professor (appointed by the [[Arts Council of Finland]]) from 1971 to 1976, and professor of composition at the Sibelius Academy from 1976 to 1990.\n\nHe married Heidi Maria Suovanen, an actress, in 1959. They had two sons and a daughter. They separated in 1982 and divorced in 1984, after he fell in love with Sinikka Koivisto, who was 29 years his junior.

His oeuvre can be broadly divided into four periods: an early \"[[neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]]\" period of the 1950s, exhibiting close ties to tradition; an avant-garde and [[constructivism (art)|constructivist]] stage of the 1960s, when he experimented with [[serialism|serial]] techniques, but abandoned them later in the decade; a \"[[Neoromanticism (music)|neo-romantic]]\" period of the late 1960s and the 1970s; and an eclectic, \"[[postmodern music|post-modern]]\" compositional style in which he blended a wide spectrum of stylistic techniques and genres.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book|first1=John David |last1=White|first2=Jean |last2=Christensen|title=New Music of the Nordic Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyUOv6EQrWcC&pg=PA199|year=2002|publisher=Pendragon Press|isbn=978-1-57647-019-0|pages=197\u2013203}}</ref><ref name=FG/> A recurring label given to his opus is \"mysticism\", for his fascination with metaphysical and religious subjects and texts.<ref name=WP/><ref name=White/><ref name=FG/> (Several of his works have titles which allude to [[angel]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=St\u0119pie\u0144 |first=Wojciech |year=2010 |title=Signifying Angels: Analyses and Interpretations of Rautavaara's Instrumental Compositions | type=Ph.D. thesis |series=Studia musicologica Universitatis Helsingiensis |volume=20 |location=Helsinki |isbn=978-952-10-6399-2 |issn=0787-4294 |lay-url=http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:0788-952-10-6399-2 }}</ref>)\n\nHis compositions include eight [[Symphony|symphonies]], 14 [[concerto]]s, choral works (several for unaccompanied choir, including ''Vigilia'' (1971\u20131972)), [[sonata (music)|sonatas]] for various instruments, [[string quartet]]s and other [[chamber music]], and a number of biographical [[opera]]s including ''[[Vincent (opera)|Vincent]]'' (1986\u20131987, based on the life of [[Vincent van Gogh]]), ''[[Aleksis Kivi (opera)|Aleksis Kivi]]'' (1995\u20131996) and ''[[Rasputin (opera)|Rasputin]]'' (2001\u20132003).<ref name=Guardian/>\n\n===1960s===\nAlong with [[Erik Bergman]], Rautavaara was one of the pioneers of serial composing in Finland in the early 1950s, although in the end he completed only several serial works.<ref name=HS/> His most important works from the period are the [[Symphony No. 3 (Rautavaara)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 4 (Rautavaara)|Fourth]] Symphony, and the opera ''[[Kaivos]]'' (The Mine), which saw only a television production in 1963,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/rautavaara-kaivos-the-mine |title=Rautavaara Kaivos, 'The Mine' |publisher=Gramophone |first=David |last=Fanning |date=}}</ref> but was a source of material for the string orchestra pieces ''Canto I'' (1960) and ''Canto II'' (1961), and for the Third String Quartet (1965).<ref name=White/> Even his serial works from the period carry obvious romantic and post-expressionist notes stylistically closer to [[Alban Berg]] and [[Anton Bruckner]] than more straightforward serialists such as [[Pierre Boulez]]. Rautavaara himself referred to the Third as the \"Bruckner's symphony\".<ref name=HS/><ref name=White/>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Rautavaara fell into a creative crisis with serialism, noticing that the composition method was immensely laborious and its distance from the outcome too large. He found a resolution towards the end of the decade, when he began to explore different styles as he had earlier done in the Third Symphony. The Bach-influenced Cello Concerto No. 1 and Debussy-influenced ''[[Anadyomene (Rautavaara)|Anadyomene]]'' opened his creative deadlock. More eclectic works started to emerge, whose style loans and compositional techniques over time became characteristic of his style. Its hallmarks included three-chord-based, often modal harmonies, ringing softly romantic orchestrals, modernism springing from the new play modes, and finally the return of the twelve-tone passages embedded into the musical texture.<ref name=HS/>\n\n===1970s===\nThe 1970s were Rautavaara's most productive period. In a short time he composed an extensive body of music, most of which has withstood the test of time. The softly-sounding new style was noticed by choirs, who commissioned a number of choral songs from the composer. His major choral works ''Vigilia'' and ''True and False Unicorn'' were made during 1971. ''Cantus Arcticus'' followed immediately after, in the beginning of 1972, and in the summer he composed an extensive score for male choir, ''A Book of Life''.<ref name=HS/>\n\nIn the 1970s Rautavaara started working more extensively on operas. The comical opera-musical ''Apollo contra Marsyas'', made in 1970 in cooperation with librettist [[Bengt V. Wall]] turned out to be a disappointment. After that, based on motifs from the [[Kalevala]], he composed ''The Myth of Sampo'' (1974/1983) and ''Marjatta, lowly maiden'' (1975). His mature style in operas was exhibited later, in ''Thomas'' (1985); subsequently ''Vincent'' (1987) and ''The House of the Sun'' (1991) earned him notable international success.<ref name=FG>{{cite web|url=http://www.fennicagehrman.fi/composers/rautavaara-einojuhani/ |title=Einojuhani Rautavaara |publisher=Fennica Gehrman}}</ref> His later operas include ''The Gift of the Magi'' (1994), [[Aleksis Kivi (opera)|''Aleksis Kivi'']] (1997) and [[Rasputin (opera)|''Rasputin'']] (2003).<ref name=HS/>\n\nA number of his works have parts for [[magnetic tape]], including ''[[Cantus Arcticus]]'' (1972, also known as ''Concerto for Birds & Orchestra'') for taped [[bird song]] and orchestra,<ref name=Guardian/> and ''True and False Unicorn'' (1971, second version 1974, revised 2001\u201302), the final version of which is for three reciters, choir, orchestra and tape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicstoday.com/review/review-10496/ |title=Rautavaara: True & False Unicorn |first=David |last=Vernier |publisher=Classics Today |date=14 June 2004}}</ref>\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nIn the second part of the 1970s, Rautavaara gradually turned toward stylistic synthesis, evident in the Organ Concerto \"Annunciations\" (1977) and the Violin Concerto (1977), and especially in ''Angels and Visitations'' (1978) for orchestra, one of his most fascinating works. It is the first in the \"Angel\" series, which also includes the [[Symphony No. 5 (Rautavaara)|Fifth Symphony]], whose working title was \"Monologue with Angels\", the double-bass concerto ''Angel of Dusk'' from 1980, and the [[Symphony No. 7 (Rautavaara)|Seventh Symphony \"Angel of Light\"]].<ref name=Guardian/><ref name=White/>\n\nHis opera ''[[Thomas (opera)|Thomas]]'' (1985) marked the beginning of his mature operatic style, combining neo-romantic harmonies with [[aleatoric]] counterpoint, twelve-tone rows and different modal systems.<ref name=White/> The libretto, written by Rautavaara himself, tells the story of a 13th-century Bishop of Finland as experienced by the protagonist himself, again using Kalevala motifs. A similar [[first-person narrative]] is used in the next opera ''Vincent'' (1987) devoted to [[Vincent van Gogh]]. Along with ''The House of the Sun'' (1991), the operas earned him notable international success.<ref name=\"FG\"/>\n\nHis most widely acclaimed work, the Seventh Symphony, earned a [[Cannes Classical Award]] and a [[Grammy]] nomination for the recording by the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by [[Leif Segerstam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ondine.net/?lid=en&cid=2.2&oid=ODE%20869-2 |title=Einojuhani Rautavaara Angel of Light (Symphony No. 7) |publisher=Ondine}}</ref>\n\nApart from the ''Angel of Light'', his notable instrumental works from the period include the [[Symphony No. 6 (Rautavaara)|Sixth Symphony \"Vincentiana\"]] (1992), based on ''Vincent''; the Third Piano Concerto \"Gift of Dreams\" (1998), commissioned by [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]; the orchestral work ''Autumn Gardens'' (1998), commissioned by the [[Scottish Chamber Orchestra]]; and the [[Symphony No. 8 (Rautavaara)|Eighth Symphony \"The Journey\"]], commissioned by the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].<ref name=White/>\n\n===2000s===\nRautavaara's later works include the orchestral works ''Book of Visions'' (2003\u20132005), ''Manhattan Trilogy'' (2003\u20132005) and ''Before the Icons'' (2005), which is an expanded version of his early piano work ''Icons''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ondine.net/index.php?lid=en&cid=4.2&oid=622 |title=Einojuhani Rautavaara (1928\u2013) |publisher=Ondine Records}}</ref> In 2005 he finished a work for violin and piano called ''Lost Landscapes'', commissioned by the violinist [[Midori Goto]].

In a file browser, it serves the same purpose of navigation, but through the file-system hierarchy.\n\nMany address bars offer features like autocomplete and a list of suggestions while the address is being typed in.
