The screenplay by [[David Zelag Goodman]] is based on the book ''[[Logan's Run]]'' by [[William F. Nolan]] and [[George Clayton Johnson]]. It depicts a [[utopia]]n future society on the surface, revealed as a [[dystopia]] where the population and the consumption of resources are maintained in equilibrium by killing everyone who reaches the age of thirty. The story follows the actions of Logan 5, a \"Sandman\" who has terminated others who have attempted to escape death and is now faced with termination himself.\n\nProduced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], the film uses only the novel's two basic premises: that everyone must die at a set age, and that Logan and companion Jessica attempt to escape while being chased by another Sandman named Francis. After aborted attempts to adapt the novel, story changes were made including raising the age of \"last day\" from 21 to 30 and introducing the idea of {{sic|\"Carrousel\"}} for eliminating 30-year-olds.<!--please do not change \"Carrousel\" to \"Carousel\"; it is misspelled on screen in the preamble as \"Carrousel\" and this article should reflect the spelling used there--> Its filming was marked by special-effects challenges in depicting Carrousel and innovative use of [[Holography#Laser|holograms]] and wide-angle lenses.\n\nThe film won a [[Special Achievement Academy Award|Special Academy Award]] for its visual effects and six [[Saturn Award]]s, including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]]. In 1977, a [[Logan's Run (TV series)|TV series]] aired, though only 14 episodes were produced.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 2274, the remnants of human civilization live in a sealed city contained beneath a cluster of [[geodesic dome]]s, a utopia run by a computer that takes care of all aspects of life, including reproduction. The citizens live a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] life but, to prevent overpopulation, everyone must undergo the rite of \"Carrousel\"<!--please do not change \"Carrousel\" to \"Carousel\"; it is misspelled on screen in this preamble as \"Carrousel\" and this article should reflect the spelling used there--> when they reach the age of 30. There, they are killed under the guise of being  \"renewed.\u201d To track this, each person is implanted at birth with a \"life-clock\" crystal in the palm of the hand that changes color as they get older and begins blinking as they approach their \"Last Day.\u201d Most residents accept this chance for rebirth, but those who do not and attempt to flee the city are known as \"Runners.\u201d  An elite team of policemen known as \"Sandmen,\u201d outfitted in predominantly black uniforms and serving in an agency of the city called \"Deep Sleep,\u201d  are assigned to pursue and terminate Runners as they try to escape.\n\nLogan 5 and Francis 7 are both Sandmen. After terminating a Runner, to whose presence they were alerted during a Carrousel rite, Logan finds an [[ankh]] among his possessions. Later that evening, he meets Jessica 6, a young woman also wearing an ankh pendant. Logan takes the ankh to the computer, which tells him that it is a symbol for a secret group whose members help the Runners find \"Sanctuary,\u201d a mythic place where they will be safe to live out the rest of their lives. Logan learns that the Sandmen have lost 1,056 Runners this way. The computer instructs Logan to find Sanctuary and destroy it, a mission which it code names \"Procedure 033-03,\u201d which he must keep secret from the other Sandmen of Deep Sleep. Then, by a procedure it calls \"retrogram\", the computer changes the color of his life clock to flashing red, suddenly making him four years closer to Carrousel. In order to escape this, Logan is now forced to become a Runner. Logan meets Jessica and explains his situation. They meet with the underground group that leads them to the periphery of the city. Logan learns that the ankh symbol is actually a key that unlocks an exit from the city. They come out into a frozen cave, with Francis following closely behind. In the cave, they meet Box, a [[robot]] designed to capture food for the city from the outside. Logan discovers, to his horror, that Box also captures escaped Runners and freezes them for food. Before Box can freeze Logan and Jessica, they escape, causing the cave to collapse on the robot.\n\nOnce outside, Logan and Jessica notice that their life clocks are no longer operational. They see the Sun for the first time and discover that the remains of human civilization have become a wilderness. They explore an old, seemingly abandoned city which was once [[Washington, D.C.]]  In the ruins of the [[United States Senate chamber]], they discover an elderly man living with many cats. His appearance is a shock to them, since neither has ever seen anyone over the age of thirty. The old man recounts what he remembers about what happened to humanity outside the city, and Logan realizes that Sanctuary has always been a myth. However, Francis has followed them and he and Logan fight. Logan fatally wounds Francis; as he dies, Francis sees that Logan's life clock is now clear and assumes Logan has renewed. Logan and Jessica persuade the old man to return to the city with them as proof that life exists outside the domed city. Leaving the man outside, the two enter and try to convince everyone that Carrousel is a lie and unnecessary. The two are captured by other Sandmen and taken to the computer. The computer interrogates Logan about Procedure 033-03 and asks if he completed his mission, but Logan insists, \"There is no Sanctuary.\" What he had found was \"old ruins, exposed,\u201d \"an old man,\u201d and that the missing Runners were \"all frozen.\u201d These answers are not accepted by the computer, even after scanning Logan's mind, and the computer overloads, causing the city's systems to fail violently and release the exterior seals. Logan, Jessica, and the other citizens flee the ruined city. Once outside, the citizens see the old man, the first human they have met who is older than thirty, proving that they can, indeed, live their lives much longer.\n\n[[File:Logan's Run in Dallas.jpg|thumb|237px|right|[[Michael York]] and [[Jenny Agutter]] in character in Dallas]]\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Michael York]] as Logan 5\n* [[Richard Jordan]] as Francis 7\n* [[Jenny Agutter]] as Jessica 6\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as Box ''(voice)''\n* [[Farrah Fawcett|Farrah Fawcett-Majors]] as Holly 13\n* [[Michael Anderson Jr.]] as Doc\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as the Old Man\n* [[Randolph Roberts]] as the 2nd Sanctuary Man\n* [[Ashley Cox]] as the timid girl\n* Lara Lindsay as the woman runner and voice of the City computer ''(uncredited)''<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[Michael Anderson (director)|Anderson, Michael]] |date=2009 |title=Logan's Run commentary |medium=Blu-ray |publisher=Turner Entertainment Company}}</ref>\n* [[Gary Morgan (actor)|Gary Morgan]] as Billy\n* Michelle Stacy as Mary 2\n* Laura Hippe as the woman customer\n* David Westberg as a Sandman\n* Camilla Carr as the Sanctuary Woman\n* Gregg Lewis as a cub\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:George Pal (1979).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Producer [[George Pal]]'s attempts to start the film led to \"[[development hell]]\"]]\n\n===Development===\n\nMGM's early attempts to adapt the book led to [[development hell]].{{sfn|Chapman|Cull|2013|p=154}} Producer [[George Pal]]'s attempt was troubled in 1969 by competing views of what the film's story should be, including the possibility of incorporating symbolism of real life issues, in comparison to screenwriter [[Richard Maibaum]]'s vision.{{sfn|Chapman|Cull|2013|p=153}} Rewriting Maibaum's screenplay would have taken between two and three months, and the budget would have had to have been reassessed.

The screenplay by [[David Zelag Goodman]] is based on the book ''[[Logan's Run]]'' by [[William F. Nolan]] and [[George Clayton Johnson]]. It depicts a [[utopia]]n future society on the surface, revealed as a [[dystopia]] where the population and the consumption of resources are maintained in equilibrium by killing everyone who reaches the age of thirty. The story follows the actions of Logan 5, a \"Sandman\" who has terminated others who have attempted to escape death and is now faced with termination himself.\n\nProduced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], the film uses only the novel's two basic premises: that everyone must die at a set age, and that Logan and companion Jessica attempt to escape while being chased by another Sandman named Francis. After aborted attempts to adapt the novel, story changes were made including raising the age of \"last day\" from 21 to 30 and introducing the idea of {{sic|\"Carrousel\"}} for eliminating 30-year-olds.<!--please do not change \"Carrousel\" to \"Carousel\"; it is misspelled on screen in the preamble as \"Carrousel\" and this article should reflect the spelling used there--> Its filming was marked by special-effects challenges in depicting Carrousel and innovative use of [[Holography#Laser|holograms]] and wide-angle lenses.\n\nThe film won a [[Special Achievement Academy Award|Special Academy Award]] for its visual effects and six [[Saturn Award]]s, including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]]. In 1977, a [[Logan's Run (TV series)|TV series]] aired, though only 14 episodes were produced.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the year 2274, the remnants of human civilization live in a sealed city contained beneath a cluster of [[geodesic dome]]s, a utopia run by a computer that takes care of all aspects of life, including reproduction. The citizens live a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] life but, to prevent overpopulation, everyone must undergo the rite of \"Carrousel\"<!--please do not change \"Carrousel\" to \"Carousel\"; it is misspelled on screen in this preamble as \"Carrousel\" and this article should reflect the spelling used there--> when they reach the age of 30. There, they are killed under the guise of being  \"renewed.\u201d To track this, each person is implanted at birth with a \"life-clock\" crystal in the palm of the hand that changes color as they get older and begins blinking as they approach their \"Last Day.\u201d Most residents accept this chance for rebirth, but those who do not and attempt to flee the city are known as \"Runners.\u201d  An elite team of policemen known as \"Sandmen,\u201d outfitted in predominantly black uniforms and serving in an agency of the city called \"Deep Sleep,\u201d  are assigned to pursue and terminate Runners as they try to escape.\n\nLogan 5 and Francis 7 are both Sandmen. After terminating a Runner, to whose presence they were alerted during a Carrousel rite, Logan finds an [[ankh]] among his possessions. Later that evening, he meets Jessica 6, a young woman also wearing an ankh pendant. Logan takes the ankh to the computer, which tells him that it is a symbol for a secret group whose members help the Runners find \"Sanctuary,\u201d a mythic place where they will be safe to live out the rest of their lives. Logan learns that the Sandmen have lost 1,056 Runners this way. The computer instructs Logan to find Sanctuary and destroy it, a mission which it code names \"Procedure 033-03,\u201d which he must keep secret from the other Sandmen of Deep Sleep. Then, by a procedure it calls \"retrogram\", the computer changes the color of his life clock to flashing red, suddenly making him four years closer to Carrousel. In order to escape this, Logan is now forced to become a Runner. Logan meets Jessica and explains his situation. They meet with the underground group that leads them to the periphery of the city. Logan learns that the ankh symbol is actually a key that unlocks an exit from the city. They come out into a frozen cave, with Francis following closely behind. In the cave, they meet Box, a [[robot]] designed to capture food for the city from the outside. Logan discovers, to his horror, that Box also captures escaped Runners and freezes them for food. Before Box can freeze Logan and Jessica, they escape, causing the cave to collapse on the robot.\n\nOnce outside, Logan and Jessica notice that their life clocks are no longer operational. They see the Sun for the first time and discover that the remains of human civilization have become a wilderness. They explore an old, seemingly abandoned city which was once [[Washington, D.C.]]  In the ruins of the [[United States Senate chamber]], they discover an elderly man living with many cats. His appearance is a shock to them, since neither has ever seen anyone over the age of thirty. The old man recounts what he remembers about what happened to humanity outside the city, and Logan realizes that Sanctuary has always been a myth. However, Francis has followed them and he and Logan fight. Logan fatally wounds Francis; as he dies, Francis sees that Logan's life clock is now clear and assumes Logan has renewed. Logan and Jessica persuade the old man to return to the city with them as proof that life exists outside the domed city. Leaving the man outside, the two enter and try to convince everyone that Carrousel is a lie and unnecessary. The two are captured by other Sandmen and taken to the computer. The computer interrogates Logan about Procedure 033-03 and asks if he completed his mission, but Logan insists, \"There is no Sanctuary.\" What he had found was \"old ruins, exposed,\u201d \"an old man,\u201d and that the missing Runners were \"all frozen.\u201d These answers are not accepted by the computer, even after scanning Logan's mind, and the computer overloads, causing the city's systems to fail violently and release the exterior seals. Logan, Jessica, and the other citizens flee the ruined city. Once outside, the citizens see the old man, the first human they have met who is older than thirty, proving that they can, indeed, live their lives much longer.\n\n[[File:Logan's Run in Dallas.jpg|thumb|237px|right|[[Michael York]] and [[Jenny Agutter]] in character in Dallas]]\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin|width=70%}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Michael York]] as Logan 5\n* [[Richard Jordan]] as Francis 7\n* [[Jenny Agutter]] as Jessica 6\n* [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] as Box ''(voice)''\n* [[Farrah Fawcett|Farrah Fawcett-Majors]] as Holly 13\n* [[Michael Anderson Jr.]] as Doc\n* [[Peter Ustinov]] as the Old Man\n* [[Randolph Roberts]] as the 2nd Sanctuary Man\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Ashley Cox]] as the timid girl\n* Lara Lindsay as the woman runner and voice of the City computer ''(uncredited)''<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[Michael Anderson (director)|Anderson, Michael]] |date=2009 |title=Logan's Run commentary |medium=Blu-ray |publisher=Turner Entertainment Company}}</ref>\n* [[Gary Morgan (actor)|Gary Morgan]] as Billy\n* Michelle Stacy as Mary 2\n* Laura Hippe as the woman customer\n* David Westberg as a Sandman\n* Camilla Carr as the Sanctuary Woman\n* Gregg Lewis as a cub\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:George Pal (1979).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Producer [[George Pal]]'s attempts to start the film led to \"[[development hell]]\"]]\n\n===Development===\n\nMGM's early attempts to adapt the book led to [[development hell]].{{sfn|Chapman|Cull|2013|p=154}} Producer [[George Pal]]'s attempt was troubled in 1969 by competing views of what the film's story should be, including the possibility of incorporating symbolism of real life issues, in comparison to screenwriter [[Richard Maibaum]]'s vision.{{sfn|Chapman|Cull|2013|p=153}} Rewriting Maibaum's screenplay would have taken between two and three months, and the budget would have had to have been reassessed.

The generic function of a circuit breaker, or [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]], as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as OCPD (Over Current Protection Device).\n\nSome of the manufacturers of Circuit breakers around the world include [[Siemens|Siemens AG]], [[Schneider Electric]], [[General Electric]] (GE), [[Mitsubishi Electric]], and [[Toshiba Corporation]] among many others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.curiousdesk.com/circuit-breaker-fuses-to-witness-widespread-expansion-during-2019-2025/|title=Circuit Breaker & Fuses to Witness Widespread Expansion During 2019-2025 \u2013 Curious Desk|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAn early form of circuit breaker was described by [[Thomas Edison]] in an 1879 patent application, although his commercial power distribution system used [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]].<ref>Robert Friedel and Paul Israel, ''Edison's Electric Light: Biography of an Invention'', Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick New Jersey USA,1986 {{ISBN|0-8135-1118-6}} pp.65-66</ref> Its purpose was to protect lighting circuit wiring from accidental short circuits and overloads. A modern miniature circuit breaker similar to the ones now in use was patented by [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] in 1924. Hugo Stotz, an engineer who had sold his company to [[ABB|BBC]], was credited as the inventor on DRP (''Deutsches Reichspatent'') 458392.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.abb.de/cawp/deabb201/061462650496e146c12570880035eede.aspx|title = \"1920-1929 Stotz miniature circuit breaker and domestic appliances\", ABB, 2006-01-09, accessed 4 July 2011}}</ref> Stotz's invention was the forerunner of the modern thermal-magnetic breaker commonly used in household load centers to this day.\n\nInterconnection of multiple generator sources into an electrical grid required the development of circuit breakers with increasing voltage ratings and increased ability to safely interrupt the increasing short-circuit currents produced by networks. Simple air-break manual switches produced hazardous arcs when interrupting high voltages; these gave way to oil-enclosed contacts, and various forms using the directed flow of pressurized air, or of pressurized oil, to cool and interrupt the arc. By 1935, the specially constructed circuit breakers used at the [[Boulder Dam]] project use eight series breaks and pressurized oil flow to interrupt faults of up to 2,500 MVA, in three cycles of the AC power frequency.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Charles H. |editor-last=Flurscheim |title=Power Circuit Breaker Theory and Design |edition=Second |publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology (professional society)|IET]] |year=1982 |isbn=0-906048-70-2 |chapter=Chapter 1}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\nAll circuit breaker systems have common features in their operation, but details vary substantially depending on the voltage class, current rating and type of the circuit breaker.\n\nThe circuit breaker must first detect a fault condition. In small mains and [[low voltage]] circuit breakers, this is usually done within the device itself. Typically, the heating or magnetic effects of electric current are employed. Circuit breakers for large currents or high voltages are usually arranged with [[protective relay]] pilot devices to sense a fault condition and to operate the opening mechanism. These typically require a separate power source, such as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], although some high-voltage circuit breakers are self-contained with [[current transformer]]s, [[protective relay]]s, and an internal control power source.\n\nOnce a fault is detected, the circuit breaker contacts must open to interrupt the circuit; this is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. Circuit breakers may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small circuit breakers typically have a manual control lever to switch off the load or reset a tripped breaker, while larger units use [[solenoid]]s to trip the mechanism, and [[electric motor]]s to restore energy to the springs.\n\nThe circuit breaker contacts must carry the load current without excessive heating, and must also withstand the heat of the arc produced when interrupting (opening) the circuit. Contacts are made of copper or copper alloys, silver alloys and other highly conductive materials. Service life of the contacts is limited by the erosion of contact material due to arcing while interrupting the current. Miniature and molded-case circuit breakers are usually discarded when the contacts have worn, but power circuit breakers and high-voltage circuit breakers have replaceable contacts.\n\nWhen a high current or voltage is interrupted, an [[electric arc|arc]] is generated. The length of the arc is generally proportional to the voltage while the intensity (or heat) is proportional to the current. This arc must be contained, cooled and extinguished in a controlled way, so that the gap between the contacts can again withstand the voltage in the circuit. Different circuit breakers use [[Vacuum interrupter|vacuum]], air, [[insulating gas]], or [[transformer oil|oil]] as the medium the arc forms in. Different techniques are used to extinguish the arc including:\n*Lengthening or deflecting the arc\n*Intensive cooling (in jet chambers)\n*Division into partial arcs\n*Zero point quenching (contacts open at the zero current time crossing of the [[alternating current|AC]] waveform, effectively breaking no load current at the time of opening. The zero-crossing occurs at twice the line frequency; i.e., 100 times per second for 50&nbsp;Hz and 120 times per second for 60&nbsp;Hz AC.)\n*Connecting [[capacitor]]s in parallel with contacts in [[direct current|DC]] circuits.\n\nFinally, once the fault condition has been cleared, the contacts must again be closed to restore power to the interrupted circuit.\n\n==Arc interruption==\nLow-voltage miniature circuit breakers (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates that divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional [[electrical impedance|impedance]] that limits the current through the circuit breaker. The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although [[magnetic blowout]] coils or [[permanent magnets]] could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings). The number of plates in the arc chute is dependent on the short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.\n\nIn larger ratings, oil circuit breakers rely upon vaporization of some of the oil to blast a jet of oil through the arc.<ref>{{Cite book |first=B. M. |last=Weedy |title=Electric Power Systems |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=London |year=1972 |isbn=0-471-92445-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/electricpowersys0000weed/page/428 428&ndash;430] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/electricpowersys0000weed/page/428 }}</ref>\n\nGas (usually [[sulfur hexafluoride]]) circuit breakers sometimes stretch the arc using a magnetic field, and then rely upon the [[dielectric strength]] of the sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) to quench the stretched arc.\n\n[[Vacuum]] circuit breakers have minimal arcing (as there is nothing to ionize other than the contact material). The arc quenches when it is stretched a very small amount (less than {{convert|2|-|3|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}). Vacuum circuit breakers are frequently used in modern medium-voltage switchgear to 38,000 volts.\n\nAir circuit breakers may use [[compressed air]] to blow out the arc, or alternatively, the contacts are rapidly swung into a small sealed chamber, the escaping of the displaced air thus blowing out the arc.\n\nCircuit breakers are usually able to terminate all current very quickly: typically the arc is extinguished between 30 ms and 150 ms after the mechanism has been tripped, depending upon age and construction of the device. The maximum current value and let-through energy determine the quality of the circuit breakers.\n\n==Short-circuit==\nCircuit breakers are rated both by the normal current that they are expected to carry, and the maximum short-circuit current that they can safely interrupt. This latter figure is the '''ampere interrupting capacity''' ('''AIC''') of the breaker.\n\nUnder short-circuit, conditions, the calculated or measured maximum [[prospective short-circuit current]] may be many times the normal, rated current of the circuit. When electrical contacts open to interrupt a large current, there is a tendency for an [[electric arc|arc]] to form between the opened contacts, which would allow the current to continue. This condition can create conductive ionized gases and molten or vaporized metal, which can cause the further continuation of the arc, or creation of additional short circuits, potentially resulting in the explosion of the circuit breaker and the equipment that it is installed in. Therefore, circuit breakers must incorporate various features to divide and extinguish the arc.\n\nThe maximum short-circuit current that a breaker can interrupt is determined by testing. Application of a breaker in a circuit with a prospective short-circuits current higher than the breaker's interrupting capacity rating may result in failure of the breaker to safely interrupt a fault. In a worst-case scenario, the breaker may successfully interrupt the fault, only to explode when reset.\n\nTypical domestic panel circuit breakers are rated to interrupt {{val|10|ul=kA}} ({{val|10000|u=A}}) short-circuit current.<!-- Other common values are 6 kA and 25 kA-->\n\nMiniature circuit breakers used to protect control circuits or small appliances may not have sufficient interrupting capacity to use at a panel board; these circuit breakers are called \"supplemental circuit protectors\" to distinguish them from distribution-type circuit breakers.\n\n==Standard current ratings==\n[[File:Standard_Trip_Characteristic_of_a_Thermomagnetic_Circuit_Breaker.svg|thumb|Time till trip versus current as multiple of nominal current]]\nCircuit breakers are manufactured in standard sizes, using a system of [[preferred numbers]] to cover a range of ratings. Miniature circuit breakers have a fixed trip setting; changing the operating current value requires changing the whole circuit breaker. Larger circuit breakers can have adjustable trip settings, allowing standardized elements to be applied but with a setting intended to improve protection. For example, a circuit breaker with a 400 ampere \"frame size\" might have its overcurrent detection set to operate at only 300 amperes, to protect a feeder cable.\n\n[[International Standard]]s, IEC 60898-1 and [[European Standard]] EN 60898-1, define the ''rated current'' ''I''<sub>n</sub> of a circuit breaker for low voltage distribution applications as the maximum current that the breaker is designed to carry continuously (at an ambient air temperature of 30&nbsp;\u00b0C). The commonly available preferred values for the rated current are 1{{nbsp}}A, 2{{nbsp}}A, 4{{nbsp}}A, 6&nbsp;A, 10&nbsp;A, 13&nbsp;A, 16&nbsp;A, 20&nbsp;A, 25&nbsp;A, 32&nbsp;A, 40&nbsp;A, 50&nbsp;A, 63&nbsp;A, 80&nbsp;A, 100&nbsp;A,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerunitworld.co.uk/what-is-an-mcb-and-how-does-it-work-328-c.asp|title=What is an MCB and how does it work?|date=16 September 2016|website=Consumer Unit World}}</ref> and 125&nbsp;A (similar to the R10 [[Renard series]], but using 6, 13, and 32 instead of 6.3, 12.5, and 31.5 \u2013 it includes the 13&nbsp;A current limit of British [[BS 1363]] sockets). The circuit breaker is labeled with the rated current in [[ampere]]s, but excluding the unit symbol, A. Instead, the ampere figure is preceded by a letter, ''B'', ''C'', or ''D'', which indicates the ''instantaneous tripping current'' &mdash; that is, the minimum value of current that causes the circuit breaker to trip without intentional time delay (i.e., in less than 100&nbsp;ms), expressed in terms of ''I''<sub>n</sub>:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Power circuit breakers and medium- and high-voltage circuit breakers used for industrial or electric power systems are designed and tested to [[ANSI]] or [[IEEE]] standards in the C37 series.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:LargeCircuitBreaker.jpg|thumb|Front panel of a 1250 A air circuit breaker manufactured by ABB. This low-voltage power circuit breaker can be withdrawn from its housing for servicing. Trip characteristics are configurable via [[DIP switch]]es on the front panel.]]\n\nMany classifications of circuit breakers can be made, based on their features such as voltage class, construction type, interrupting type, and structural features.\n\n===Low-voltage===\nLow-voltage (less than 1,000 V<sub>AC</sub>) types are common in domestic, commercial and industrial application, and include:\n*Miniature circuit breaker (MCB)&mdash;rated current up to 125 A. Trip characteristics normally not adjustable. Thermal or thermal-magnetic operation. Breakers illustrated above are in this category.\n*Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB)&mdash;rated current up to 1,600 A. Thermal or thermal-magnetic operation. Trip current may be adjustable in larger ratings.\n*Low-voltage power circuit breakers can be mounted in multi-tiers in low-voltage switchboards or [[switchgear]] cabinets.\n\nThe characteristics of low-voltage circuit breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 947. These circuit breakers are often installed in draw-out enclosures that allow removal and interchange without dismantling the switchgear.\n\nLarge low-voltage molded case and power circuit breakers may have electric motor operators so they can open and close under remote control. These may form part of an [[automatic transfer switch]] system for standby power.\n\nLow-voltage circuit breakers are also made for direct-current (DC) applications, such as DC for subway lines. Direct current requires special breakers because the arc is continuous\u2014unlike an AC arc, which tends to go out on each half cycle. A direct current circuit breaker has blow-out coils that generate a magnetic field that rapidly stretches the arc. Small circuit breakers are either installed directly in equipment, or are arranged in a [[distribution board|breaker panel]].\n\n[[File:Circuitbreaker.jpg|thumb|Inside of a circuit breaker]]The [[DIN rail]]-mounted thermal-magnetic miniature circuit breaker is the most common style in modern domestic [[consumer unit]]s and commercial electrical [[distribution board]]s throughout [[Europe]]. The design includes the following components:\n\n#Actuator [[lever]] - used to manually trip and reset the circuit breaker. Also indicates the status of the circuit breaker (On or Off/tripped). Most breakers are designed so they can still trip even if the lever is held or locked in the \"on\" position. This is sometimes referred to as \"free trip\" or \"positive trip\" operation.\n#Actuator mechanism - forces the contacts together or apart.\n#Contacts - allow current when touching and break the current when moved apart.\n#Terminals\n#Bimetallic strip - separates contacts in response to smaller, longer-term overcurrents\n#Calibration [[screw]] - allows the [[manufacturer]] to precisely adjust the trip current of the device after assembly.\n#Solenoid - separates contacts rapidly in response to high overcurrents\n#Arc divider/extinguisher\n\n===Solid state===\n''Solid-state circuit breakers'', also known as ''digital circuit breakers'' are a technological innovation which promises advance circuit breaker technology out of the mechanical level, into the electrical. This promises several advantages, such as cutting the circuit in fractions of microseconds, better monitoring of circuit loads and longer lifetimes.<ref name=\"eeweb\">https://www.eeweb.com/app-notes/solid-state-circuit-breaker</ref>\n\n===Magnetic===\n''Magnetic circuit breakers'' use a [[solenoid]] ([[electromagnet]]) whose pulling force increases with the [[electric current|current]]. Certain designs utilize electromagnetic forces in addition to those of the solenoid. The circuit breaker contacts are held closed by a latch. As the current in the solenoid increases beyond the rating of the circuit breaker, the solenoid's pull releases the latch, which lets the contacts open by spring action. They are the most commonly used circuit breakers in the USA.\n\n===Thermal-magnetic===\n[[File:SHT-06.jpg|thumb|Shihlin Electric MCCB with SHT]]\n''Thermal magnetic circuit breakers'', which are the type found in most [[distribution board]]s in Europe and countries with a similar wiring arrangements, incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding to less extreme but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a time response feature, that trips the circuit breaker sooner for larger over currents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents during a short-circuit, the magnetic element trips the circuit breaker with no intentional additional delay.<ref>John Matthews ''Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Building Electrical Systems'' Springer 1993 0442008740 page 86</ref>\n\n===Magnetic-hydraulic===\nA ''magnetic-hydraulic'' circuit breaker uses a solenoid coil to provide operating force to open the contacts. Magnetic-hydraulic  breakers incorporate a hydraulic time delay feature using a viscous fluid. A spring restrains the core until the current exceeds the breaker rating. During an overload, the speed of the solenoid motion is restricted by the fluid. The delay permits brief current surges beyond normal running current for motor starting, energizing equipment, etc. Short-circuit currents provide sufficient solenoid force to release the latch regardless of core position thus bypassing the delay feature. Ambient temperature affects the time delay but does not affect the current rating of a magnetic breaker.<ref>Hwaiyu Geng, ''Data Center Handbook'', John Wiley & Sons,2014 page 542</ref>\n\nLarge power circuit breakers, applied in circuits of more than 1000 volts, may incorporate hydraulic elements in the contact operating mechanism. Hydraulic energy may be supplied by a pump, or stored in accumulators.  These form a distinct type from oil-filled circuit breakers where oil is the arc extinguishing medium.<ref>G R Jones (ed), ''Electrical Engineer's Reference Book'', Butterworth - Heinemann Ltd, 1993, page 25/14</ref>\n\n===Common trip (ganged) breakers===\n[[File:Breaker3phase2a proc.jpg|thumb|Three-pole common trip breaker for supplying a three-phase device. This breaker has a 2&nbsp;A rating.]]\n\nTo provide simultaneous breaking on multiple circuits from a fault on any one, circuit breakers may be made as a ganged assembly. This is a very common requirement for 3 phase systems, where breaking may be either 3 or 4 pole (solid or switched neutral). Some makers make ganging kits to allow groups of single phase breakers to be interlinked as required.\n\nIn the US, where split phase supplies are common, in branch circuits with more than one live conductor, each live conductor must be protected by a breaker pole. To ensure that all live conductors are interrupted when any pole trips, a \"common trip\" breaker must be used. These may either contain two or three tripping mechanisms within one case, or for small breakers, may externally tie the poles together via their operating handles. Two-pole common trip breakers are common on 120/240-volt systems where 240 volt loads (including [[major appliance]]s or further distribution boards) span the two live wires. Three-pole common trip breakers are typically used to supply [[three-phase electric power]] to large motors or further distribution boards.\n\nSeparate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral is disconnected while the live conductor stays connected, a very dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don't work), but wires remain live and some [[residual-current device]]s (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common trip breakers must be used when neutral wire switching is needed.\n\n===Shunt-trip units===\nA shunt-trip unit appears similar to a normal breaker and the moving actuators are 'ganged' to a normal breaker mechanism to operate together in a similar way, but the shunt trip is a solenoid intended to be operated by an external constant voltage signal, rather than a current, commonly the local mains voltage or {{nbsp}} DC. These are often used to cut the power when a high risk event occurs, such as a fire or flood alarm, or another electrical condition, such as over voltage detection. Shunt trips may be a user fitted accessory to a standard breaker, or supplied as an integral part of the circuit breaker.\n\n===Medium-voltage===\n[[File:Siemens WL II 2500N air circuit breaker.jpg|thumb|An air circuit breaker of Siemens brand mounted on a motor control cubicle]]\nMedium-voltage circuit breakers rated between 1 and 72{{nbsp}}kV may be assembled into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, or may be individual components installed outdoors in a [[electrical substation|substation]]. Air-break circuit breakers replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum circuit breakers (up to about 40.5{{nbsp}}kV). Like the high voltage circuit breakers described below, these are also operated by current sensing protective [[relay]]s operated through [[current transformer]]s. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly always use separate current sensors and [[protective relay]]s, instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.\n\nMedium-voltage circuit breakers can be classified by the medium used to extinguish the arc:\n*[[Vacuum interrupter|Vacuum circuit breakers]]&mdash;With rated current up to 6,300{{nbsp}}A, and higher for generator circuit breakers application (up to 16,000{{nbsp}}A & 140{{nbsp}}kA). These breakers interrupt the current by creating and extinguishing the arc in a vacuum container - aka \"bottle\". Long life bellows are designed to travel the 6\u201310&nbsp;mm the contacts must part. These are generally applied for voltages up to about 40,500{{nbsp}}V,<ref>A few manufacturers now offer a single-bottle vacuum breaker rated up to 72.5{{nbsp}}kV and even 145{{nbsp}}kV. See https://www.edu-right.com/full-knowledge-about-integrated{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Electrical Engineering in India, vol 157 issue 4 pages 13-23</ref> which corresponds roughly to the medium-voltage range of power systems. Vacuum circuit breakers have longer life expectancy between overhaul than do other circuit breakers. In addition their [[global warming potential]] is by far lower than [[Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker|SF<sub><big>6</big></sub> circuit breaker]].\n*Air circuit breakers&mdash;Rated current up to 6,300{{nbsp}}A and higher for generator circuit breakers. Trip characteristics are often fully adjustable including configurable trip thresholds and delays. Usually electronically controlled, though some models are [[microprocessor]] controlled via an integral electronic trip unit. Often used for main power distribution in large industrial plant, where the breakers are arranged in draw-out enclosures for ease of maintenance.\n*[[Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker|SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breakers]] extinguish the arc in a chamber filled with [[sulfur hexafluoride]] gas.\n\nMedium-voltage circuit breakers may be connected into the circuit by bolted connections to bus bars or wires, especially in outdoor switchyards. Medium-voltage circuit breakers in switchgear line-ups are often built with draw-out construction, allowing breaker removal without disturbing power circuit connections, using a motor-operated or hand-cranked mechanism to separate the breaker from its enclosure.\n\n===High-voltage===\n<!-- [[Fiber optic current sensor]] links here. -->\n{{Main|High-voltage switchgear}}\n[[File:Oil circuit breaker MKP-110 Toliatti Russia.jpg|thumb|left|Three single-phase Soviet/Russian 110-kV oil circuit breakers]]\n[[File:400kv.jpg|thumb|400&nbsp;kV SF<sub>6</sub> live-tank circuit breakers]]\n\nElectrical [[power transmission]] networks are protected and controlled by high-voltage breakers. The definition of ''high voltage'' varies but in power transmission work is usually thought to be 72.5&nbsp;kV or higher, according to a recent definition by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC). High-voltage breakers are nearly always [[solenoid]]-operated, with current sensing [[protective relay]]s operated through [[current transformer]]s. In [[electrical substation|substation]]s the protective relay scheme can be complex, protecting equipment and buses from various types of overload or ground/earth fault.\n\nHigh-voltage breakers are broadly classified by the medium used to extinguish the arc:\n* Bulk oil\n* Minimum oil\n* Air blast\n* [[Vacuum interrupter|Vacuum]]\n* [[Sulfur hexafluoride|SF<sub>6</sub>]]\n* [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]\n\nDue to environmental and cost concerns over insulating oil spills, most new breakers use SF<sub>6</sub> gas to quench the arc.\n\nCircuit breakers can be classified as ''live tank'', where the enclosure that contains the breaking mechanism is at line potential, or ''dead tank'' with the enclosure at earth potential. High-voltage AC circuit breakers are routinely available with ratings up to 765&nbsp;kV. 1,200{{nbsp}}kV breakers were launched by Siemens in November 2011,<ref>{{cite web|title=Siemens launches world's first 1200kV SF6 Circuit Breaker|url=http://www.indiainfoline.com/Markets/News/Siemens-launches-worlds-first-1200-kV-SF6-Circuit-Breaker/5286275764|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> followed by ABB in April the following year.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABB to develop ultra high voltage circuit breaker|url=http://www.utilities-me.com/article-1884-abb-to-develop-ultra-high-voltage-circuit-breaker/|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nHigh-voltage circuit breakers used on transmission systems may be arranged to allow a single pole of a three-phase line to trip, instead of tripping all three poles; for some classes of faults this improves the system stability and availability.\n\n[[High-voltage direct current]] circuit breakers are still a field of research as of 2015. Such breakers would be useful to interconnect HVDC transmission systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=High Voltage DC Switch Enables Supergrids for Renewable Energy, MIT Technology Review|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/513736/supergrids/|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) high-voltage===\n{{Main|Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker}}\nA sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker uses contacts surrounded by sulfur hexafluoride gas to quench the arc. They are most often used for transmission-level voltages and may be incorporated into compact gas-insulated switchgear.

It presents a technical solution where the disconnecting function is integrated in the breaking chamber, eliminating the need for separate disconnectors. This increases the [[availability]], since open-air disconnecting switch main contacts need maintenance every 2\u20136 years, while modern circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the space requirements within the substation, and increases the [[reliability engineering|reliability]], due to the lack of separate disconnectors.<ref>{{cite web|title= HPL Disconnecting Circuit Breaker|url=http://www.abb.com/product/db0003db002618/c12573e7003302adc1256e44006c19a3.aspx|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Disconnecting Circuit Breakers, Buyer's and Application Guide, p. 10 |url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot245.nsf/veritydisplay/775535a79394e670c1257c0800202299/$file/1HSM%209543%2023-03en%20DCB%20Application%20Guide%20Ed3%20-%202013-09%20-%20English.pdf|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn order to further reduce the required space of substation, as well as simplifying the design and engineering of the substation, a [[fiber optic current sensor]] (FOCS) can be integrated with the DCB.

Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike a [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]], which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation.\n\nCircuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large [[switchgear]] designed to protect [[high voltage]] circuits feeding an entire city. The generic function of a circuit breaker, or [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]], as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as OCPD (Over Current Protection Device).\n\n==Origins==\nAn early form of circuit breaker was described by [[Thomas Edison]] in an 1879 patent application, although his commercial power distribution system used [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]].<ref>Robert Friedel and Paul Israel, ''Edison's Electric Light: Biography of an Invention'', Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick New Jersey USA,1986 {{ISBN|0-8135-1118-6}} pp.65-66</ref> Its purpose was to protect lighting circuit wiring from accidental short circuits and overloads. A modern miniature circuit breaker similar to the ones now in use was patented by [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] in 1924. Hugo Stotz, an engineer who had sold his company to [[ABB|BBC]], was credited as the inventor on DRP (''Deutsches Reichspatent'') 458392.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.abb.de/cawp/deabb201/061462650496e146c12570880035eede.aspx|title = \"1920-1929 Stotz miniature circuit breaker and domestic appliances\", ABB, 2006-01-09, accessed 4 July 2011}}</ref> Stotz's invention was the forerunner of the modern thermal-magnetic breaker commonly used in household load centers to this day.\n\nInterconnection of multiple generator sources into an electrical grid required the development of circuit breakers with increasing voltage ratings and increased ability to safely interrupt the increasing short-circuit currents produced by networks. Simple air-break manual switches produced hazardous arcs when interrupting high voltages; these gave way to oil-enclosed contacts, and various forms using the directed flow of pressurized air, or of pressurized oil, to cool and interrupt the arc. By 1935, the specially constructed circuit breakers used at the [[Boulder Dam]] project use eight series breaks and pressurized oil flow to interrupt faults of up to 2,500 MVA, in three cycles of the AC power frequency.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Charles H. |editor-last=Flurscheim |title=Power Circuit Breaker Theory and Design |edition=Second |publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology (professional society)|IET]] |year=1982 |isbn=0-906048-70-2 |chapter=Chapter 1}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\nAll circuit breaker systems have common features in their operation, but details vary substantially depending on the voltage class, current rating and type of the circuit breaker.\n\nThe circuit breaker must first detect a fault condition. In small mains and [[low voltage]] circuit breakers, this is usually done within the device itself. Typically, the heating or magnetic effects of electric current are employed. Circuit breakers for large currents or high voltages are usually arranged with [[protective relay]] pilot devices to sense a fault condition and to operate the opening mechanism. These typically require a separate power source, such as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], although some high-voltage circuit breakers are self-contained with [[current transformer]]s, [[protective relay]]s, and an internal control power source.\n\nOnce a fault is detected, the circuit breaker contacts must open to interrupt the circuit; this is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. Circuit breakers may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, such as thermal expansion or a magnetic field. Small circuit breakers typically have a manual control lever to switch off the load or reset a tripped breaker, while larger units use [[solenoid]]s to trip the mechanism, and [[electric motor]]s to restore energy to the springs.\n\nThe circuit breaker contacts must carry the load current without excessive heating, and must also withstand the heat of the arc produced when interrupting (opening) the circuit. Contacts are made of copper or copper alloys, silver alloys and other highly conductive materials. Service life of the contacts is limited by the erosion of contact material due to arcing while interrupting the current. Miniature and molded-case circuit breakers are usually discarded when the contacts have worn, but power circuit breakers and high-voltage circuit breakers have replaceable contacts.\n\nWhen a high current or voltage is interrupted, an [[electric arc|arc]] is generated. The length of the arc is generally proportional to the voltage while the intensity (or heat) is proportional to the current. This arc must be contained, cooled and extinguished in a controlled way, so that the gap between the contacts can again withstand the voltage in the circuit. Different circuit breakers use [[Vacuum interrupter|vacuum]], air, [[insulating gas]], or [[transformer oil|oil]] as the medium the arc forms in. Different techniques are used to extinguish the arc including:\n*Lengthening or deflecting the arc\n*Intensive cooling (in jet chambers)\n*Division into partial arcs\n*Zero point quenching (contacts open at the zero current time crossing of the [[alternating current|AC]] waveform, effectively breaking no load current at the time of opening. The zero-crossing occurs at twice the line frequency; i.e., 100 times per second for 50&nbsp;Hz and 120 times per second for 60&nbsp;Hz AC.)\n*Connecting [[capacitor]]s in parallel with contacts in [[direct current|DC]] circuits.\n\nFinally, once the fault condition has been cleared, the contacts must again be closed to restore power to the interrupted circuit.\n\n==Arc interruption==\nLow-voltage miniature circuit breakers (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates that divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional [[electrical impedance|impedance]] that limits the current through the circuit breaker. The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although [[magnetic blowout]] coils or [[permanent magnets]] could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings). The number of plates in the arc chute is dependent on the short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.\n\nIn larger ratings, oil circuit breakers rely upon vaporization of some of the oil to blast a jet of oil through the arc.<ref>{{Cite book |first=B. M. |last=Weedy |title=Electric Power Systems |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=London |year=1972 |isbn=0-471-92445-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/electricpowersys0000weed/page/428 428&ndash;430] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/electricpowersys0000weed/page/428 }}</ref>\n\nGas (usually [[sulfur hexafluoride]]) circuit breakers sometimes stretch the arc using a magnetic field, and then rely upon the [[dielectric strength]] of the sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) to quench the stretched arc.\n\n[[Vacuum]] circuit breakers have minimal arcing (as there is nothing to ionize other than the contact material). The arc quenches when it is stretched a very small amount (less than {{convert|2|-|3|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}). Vacuum circuit breakers are frequently used in modern medium-voltage switchgear to 38,000 volts.\n\nAir circuit breakers may use [[compressed air]] to blow out the arc, or alternatively, the contacts are rapidly swung into a small sealed chamber, the escaping of the displaced air thus blowing out the arc.\n\nCircuit breakers are usually able to terminate all current very quickly: typically the arc is extinguished between 30 ms and 150 ms after the mechanism has been tripped, depending upon age and construction of the device. The maximum current value and let-through energy determine the quality of the circuit breakers.\n\n==Short-circuit==\nCircuit breakers are rated both by the normal current that they are expected to carry, and the maximum short-circuit current that they can safely interrupt. This latter figure is the '''ampere interrupting capacity''' ('''AIC''') of the breaker.\n\nUnder short-circuit, conditions, the calculated or measured maximum [[prospective short-circuit current]] may be many times the normal, rated current of the circuit. When electrical contacts open to interrupt a large current, there is a tendency for an [[electric arc|arc]] to form between the opened contacts, which would allow the current to continue. This condition can create conductive ionized gases and molten or vaporized metal, which can cause the further continuation of the arc, or creation of additional short circuits, potentially resulting in the explosion of the circuit breaker and the equipment that it is installed in. Therefore, circuit breakers must incorporate various features to divide and extinguish the arc.\n\nThe maximum short-circuit current that a breaker can interrupt is determined by testing. Application of a breaker in a circuit with a prospective short-circuits current higher than the breaker's interrupting capacity rating may result in failure of the breaker to safely interrupt a fault. In a worst-case scenario, the breaker may successfully interrupt the fault, only to explode when reset.\n\nTypical domestic panel circuit breakers are rated to interrupt {{val|10|ul=kA}} ({{val|10000|u=A}}) short-circuit current.<!-- Other common values are 6 kA and 25 kA-->\n\nMiniature circuit breakers used to protect control circuits or small appliances may not have sufficient interrupting capacity to use at a panel board; these circuit breakers are called \"supplemental circuit protectors\" to distinguish them from distribution-type circuit breakers.\n\n==Standard current ratings==\n[[File:Standard_Trip_Characteristic_of_a_Thermomagnetic_Circuit_Breaker.svg|thumb|Time till trip versus current as multiple of nominal current]]\nCircuit breakers are manufactured in standard sizes, using a system of [[preferred numbers]] to cover a range of ratings. Miniature circuit breakers have a fixed trip setting; changing the operating current value requires changing the whole circuit breaker. Larger circuit breakers can have adjustable trip settings, allowing standardized elements to be applied but with a setting intended to improve protection. For example, a circuit breaker with a 400 ampere \"frame size\" might have its overcurrent detection set to operate at only 300 amperes, to protect a feeder cable.\n\n[[International Standard]]s, IEC 60898-1 and [[European Standard]] EN 60898-1, define the ''rated current'' ''I''<sub>n</sub> of a circuit breaker for low voltage distribution applications as the maximum current that the breaker is designed to carry continuously (at an ambient air temperature of 30&nbsp;\u00b0C). The commonly available preferred values for the rated current are 1{{nbsp}}A, 2{{nbsp}}A, 4{{nbsp}}A, 6&nbsp;A, 10&nbsp;A, 13&nbsp;A, 16&nbsp;A, 20&nbsp;A, 25&nbsp;A, 32&nbsp;A, 40&nbsp;A, 50&nbsp;A, 63&nbsp;A, 80&nbsp;A, 100&nbsp;A,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.consumerunitworld.co.uk/what-is-an-mcb-and-how-does-it-work-328-c.asp|title=What is an MCB and how does it work?|date=16 September 2016|website=Consumer Unit World}}</ref> and 125&nbsp;A (similar to the R10 [[Renard series]], but using 6, 13, and 32 instead of 6.3, 12.5, and 31.5 \u2013 it includes the 13&nbsp;A current limit of British [[BS 1363]] sockets). The circuit breaker is labeled with the rated current in [[ampere]]s, but excluding the unit symbol, A. Instead, the ampere figure is preceded by a letter, ''B'', ''C'', or ''D'', which indicates the ''instantaneous tripping current'' &mdash; that is, the minimum value of current that causes the circuit breaker to trip without intentional time delay (i.e., in less than 100&nbsp;ms), expressed in terms of ''I''<sub>n</sub>:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Power circuit breakers and medium- and high-voltage circuit breakers used for industrial or electric power systems are designed and tested to [[ANSI]] or [[IEEE]] standards in the C37 series.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:LargeCircuitBreaker.jpg|thumb|Front panel of a 1250 A air circuit breaker manufactured by ABB. This low-voltage power circuit breaker can be withdrawn from its housing for servicing. Trip characteristics are configurable via [[DIP switch]]es on the front panel.]]\n\nMany classifications of circuit breakers can be made, based on their features such as voltage class, construction type, interrupting type, and structural features.\n\n===Low-voltage===\nLow-voltage (less than 1,000 V<sub>AC</sub>) types are common in domestic, commercial and industrial application, and include:\n*Miniature circuit breaker (MCB)&mdash;rated current up to 125 A. Trip characteristics normally not adjustable. Thermal or thermal-magnetic operation. Breakers illustrated above are in this category.\n*Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB)&mdash;rated current up to 1,600 A. Thermal or thermal-magnetic operation. Trip current may be adjustable in larger ratings.\n*Low-voltage power circuit breakers can be mounted in multi-tiers in low-voltage switchboards or [[switchgear]] cabinets.\n\nThe characteristics of low-voltage circuit breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 947. These circuit breakers are often installed in draw-out enclosures that allow removal and interchange without dismantling the switchgear.\n\nLarge low-voltage molded case and power circuit breakers may have electric motor operators so they can open and close under remote control. These may form part of an [[automatic transfer switch]] system for standby power.\n\nLow-voltage circuit breakers are also made for direct-current (DC) applications, such as DC for subway lines. Direct current requires special breakers because the arc is continuous\u2014unlike an AC arc, which tends to go out on each half cycle. A direct current circuit breaker has blow-out coils that generate a magnetic field that rapidly stretches the arc. Small circuit breakers are either installed directly in equipment, or are arranged in a [[distribution board|breaker panel]].\n\n[[File:Circuitbreaker.jpg|thumb|Inside of a circuit breaker]]The [[DIN rail]]-mounted thermal-magnetic miniature circuit breaker is the most common style in modern domestic [[consumer unit]]s and commercial electrical [[distribution board]]s throughout [[Europe]]. The design includes the following components:\n\n#Actuator [[lever]] - used to manually trip and reset the circuit breaker. Also indicates the status of the circuit breaker (On or Off/tripped). Most breakers are designed so they can still trip even if the lever is held or locked in the \"on\" position. This is sometimes referred to as \"free trip\" or \"positive trip\" operation.\n#Actuator mechanism - forces the contacts together or apart.\n#Contacts - allow current when touching and break the current when moved apart.\n#Terminals\n#Bimetallic strip - separates contacts in response to smaller, longer-term overcurrents\n#Calibration [[screw]] - allows the [[manufacturer]] to precisely adjust the trip current of the device after assembly.\n#Solenoid - separates contacts rapidly in response to high overcurrents\n#Arc divider/extinguisher\n\n===Solid state===\n''Solid-state circuit breakers'', also known as ''digital circuit breakers'' are a technological innovation which promises advance circuit breaker technology out of the mechanical level, into the electrical. This promises several advantages, such as cutting the circuit in fractions of microseconds, better monitoring of circuit loads and longer lifetimes.<ref name=\"eeweb\">https://www.eeweb.com/app-notes/solid-state-circuit-breaker</ref>\n\n===Magnetic===\n''Magnetic circuit breakers'' use a [[solenoid]] ([[electromagnet]]) whose pulling force increases with the [[electric current|current]]. Certain designs utilize electromagnetic forces in addition to those of the solenoid. The circuit breaker contacts are held closed by a latch. As the current in the solenoid increases beyond the rating of the circuit breaker, the solenoid's pull releases the latch, which lets the contacts open by spring action. They are the most commonly used circuit breakers in the USA.\n\n===Thermal-magnetic===\n[[File:SHT-06.jpg|thumb|Shihlin Electric MCCB with SHT]]\n''Thermal magnetic circuit breakers'', which are the type found in most [[distribution board]]s in Europe and countries with a similar wiring arrangements, incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding to less extreme but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a time response feature, that trips the circuit breaker sooner for larger over currents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents during a short-circuit, the magnetic element trips the circuit breaker with no intentional additional delay.<ref>John Matthews ''Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Building Electrical Systems'' Springer 1993 0442008740 page 86</ref>\n\n===Magnetic-hydraulic===\nA ''magnetic-hydraulic'' circuit breaker uses a solenoid coil to provide operating force to open the contacts. Magnetic-hydraulic  breakers incorporate a hydraulic time delay feature using a viscous fluid. A spring restrains the core until the current exceeds the breaker rating. During an overload, the speed of the solenoid motion is restricted by the fluid. The delay permits brief current surges beyond normal running current for motor starting, energizing equipment, etc. Short-circuit currents provide sufficient solenoid force to release the latch regardless of core position thus bypassing the delay feature. Ambient temperature affects the time delay but does not affect the current rating of a magnetic breaker.<ref>Hwaiyu Geng, ''Data Center Handbook'', John Wiley & Sons,2014 page 542</ref>\n\nLarge power circuit breakers, applied in circuits of more than 1000 volts, may incorporate hydraulic elements in the contact operating mechanism. Hydraulic energy may be supplied by a pump, or stored in accumulators.  These form a distinct type from oil-filled circuit breakers where oil is the arc extinguishing medium.<ref>G R Jones (ed), ''Electrical Engineer's Reference Book'', Butterworth - Heinemann Ltd, 1993, page 25/14</ref>\n\n===Common trip (ganged) breakers===\n[[File:Breaker3phase2a proc.jpg|thumb|Three-pole common trip breaker for supplying a three-phase device. This breaker has a 2&nbsp;A rating.]]\n\nTo provide simultaneous breaking on multiple circuits from a fault on any one, circuit breakers may be made as a ganged assembly. This is a very common requirement for 3 phase systems, where breaking may be either 3 or 4 pole (solid or switched neutral). Some makers make ganging kits to allow groups of single phase breakers to be interlinked as required.\n\nIn the US, where split phase supplies are common, in branch circuits with more than one live conductor, each live conductor must be protected by a breaker pole. To ensure that all live conductors are interrupted when any pole trips, a \"common trip\" breaker must be used. These may either contain two or three tripping mechanisms within one case, or for small breakers, may externally tie the poles together via their operating handles. Two-pole common trip breakers are common on 120/240-volt systems where 240 volt loads (including [[major appliance]]s or further distribution boards) span the two live wires. Three-pole common trip breakers are typically used to supply [[three-phase electric power]] to large motors or further distribution boards.\n\nSeparate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral is disconnected while the live conductor stays connected, a very dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don't work), but wires remain live and some [[residual-current device]]s (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common trip breakers must be used when neutral wire switching is needed.\n\n===Shunt-trip units===\nA shunt-trip unit appears similar to a normal breaker and the moving actuators are 'ganged' to a normal breaker mechanism to operate together in a similar way, but the shunt trip is a solenoid intended to be operated by an external constant voltage signal, rather than a current, commonly the local mains voltage or {{nbsp}} DC. These are often used to cut the power when a high risk event occurs, such as a fire or flood alarm, or another electrical condition, such as over voltage detection. Shunt trips may be a user fitted accessory to a standard breaker, or supplied as an integral part of the circuit breaker.\n\n===Medium-voltage===\n[[File:Siemens WL II 2500N air circuit breaker.jpg|thumb|An air circuit breaker of Siemens brand mounted on a motor control cubicle]]\nMedium-voltage circuit breakers rated between 1 and 72{{nbsp}}kV may be assembled into metal-enclosed switchgear line ups for indoor use, or may be individual components installed outdoors in a [[electrical substation|substation]]. Air-break circuit breakers replaced oil-filled units for indoor applications, but are now themselves being replaced by vacuum circuit breakers (up to about 40.5{{nbsp}}kV). Like the high voltage circuit breakers described below, these are also operated by current sensing protective [[relay]]s operated through [[current transformer]]s. The characteristics of MV breakers are given by international standards such as IEC 62271. Medium-voltage circuit breakers nearly always use separate current sensors and [[protective relay]]s, instead of relying on built-in thermal or magnetic overcurrent sensors.\n\nMedium-voltage circuit breakers can be classified by the medium used to extinguish the arc:\n*[[Vacuum interrupter|Vacuum circuit breakers]]&mdash;With rated current up to 6,300{{nbsp}}A, and higher for generator circuit breakers application (up to 16,000{{nbsp}}A & 140{{nbsp}}kA). These breakers interrupt the current by creating and extinguishing the arc in a vacuum container - aka \"bottle\". Long life bellows are designed to travel the 6\u201310&nbsp;mm the contacts must part. These are generally applied for voltages up to about 40,500{{nbsp}}V,<ref>A few manufacturers now offer a single-bottle vacuum breaker rated up to 72.5{{nbsp}}kV and even 145{{nbsp}}kV. See https://www.edu-right.com/full-knowledge-about-integrated{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Electrical Engineering in India, vol 157 issue 4 pages 13-23</ref> which corresponds roughly to the medium-voltage range of power systems. Vacuum circuit breakers have longer life expectancy between overhaul than do other circuit breakers. In addition their [[global warming potential]] is by far lower than [[Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker|SF<sub><big>6</big></sub> circuit breaker]].\n*Air circuit breakers&mdash;Rated current up to 6,300{{nbsp}}A and higher for generator circuit breakers. Trip characteristics are often fully adjustable including configurable trip thresholds and delays. Usually electronically controlled, though some models are [[microprocessor]] controlled via an integral electronic trip unit. Often used for main power distribution in large industrial plant, where the breakers are arranged in draw-out enclosures for ease of maintenance.\n*[[Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker|SF<sub>6</sub> circuit breakers]] extinguish the arc in a chamber filled with [[sulfur hexafluoride]] gas.\n\nMedium-voltage circuit breakers may be connected into the circuit by bolted connections to bus bars or wires, especially in outdoor switchyards. Medium-voltage circuit breakers in switchgear line-ups are often built with draw-out construction, allowing breaker removal without disturbing power circuit connections, using a motor-operated or hand-cranked mechanism to separate the breaker from its enclosure.\n\n===High-voltage===\n<!-- [[Fiber optic current sensor]] links here. -->\n{{Main|High-voltage switchgear}}\n[[File:Oil circuit breaker MKP-110 Toliatti Russia.jpg|thumb|left|Three single-phase Soviet/Russian 110-kV oil circuit breakers]]\n[[File:400kv.jpg|thumb|400&nbsp;kV SF<sub>6</sub> live-tank circuit breakers]]\n\nElectrical [[power transmission]] networks are protected and controlled by high-voltage breakers. The definition of ''high voltage'' varies but in power transmission work is usually thought to be 72.5&nbsp;kV or higher, according to a recent definition by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC). High-voltage breakers are nearly always [[solenoid]]-operated, with current sensing [[protective relay]]s operated through [[current transformer]]s. In [[electrical substation|substation]]s the protective relay scheme can be complex, protecting equipment and buses from various types of overload or ground/earth fault.\n\nHigh-voltage breakers are broadly classified by the medium used to extinguish the arc:\n* Bulk oil\n* Minimum oil\n* Air blast\n* [[Vacuum interrupter|Vacuum]]\n* [[Sulfur hexafluoride|SF<sub>6</sub>]]\n* [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]\n\nDue to environmental and cost concerns over insulating oil spills, most new breakers use SF<sub>6</sub> gas to quench the arc.\n\nCircuit breakers can be classified as ''live tank'', where the enclosure that contains the breaking mechanism is at line potential, or ''dead tank'' with the enclosure at earth potential. High-voltage AC circuit breakers are routinely available with ratings up to 765&nbsp;kV. 1,200{{nbsp}}kV breakers were launched by Siemens in November 2011,<ref>{{cite web|title=Siemens launches world's first 1200kV SF6 Circuit Breaker|url=http://www.indiainfoline.com/Markets/News/Siemens-launches-worlds-first-1200-kV-SF6-Circuit-Breaker/5286275764|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> followed by ABB in April the following year.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABB to develop ultra high voltage circuit breaker|url=http://www.utilities-me.com/article-1884-abb-to-develop-ultra-high-voltage-circuit-breaker/|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nHigh-voltage circuit breakers used on transmission systems may be arranged to allow a single pole of a three-phase line to trip, instead of tripping all three poles; for some classes of faults this improves the system stability and availability.\n\n[[High-voltage direct current]] circuit breakers are still a field of research as of 2015. Such breakers would be useful to interconnect HVDC transmission systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=High Voltage DC Switch Enables Supergrids for Renewable Energy, MIT Technology Review|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/513736/supergrids/|accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) high-voltage===\n{{Main|Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker}}\nA sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker uses contacts surrounded by sulfur hexafluoride gas to quench the arc. They are most often used for transmission-level voltages and may be incorporated into compact gas-insulated switchgear. In cold climates, supplemental heating or de-rating of the circuit breakers may be required due to liquefaction of the SF6 gas.\n\n===Disconnecting circuit breaker (DCB)===\n<!-- \"Fiber optic current sensor\" links here -->\n<!-- \"Disconnector\" links here -->\n\nThe disconnecting circuit breaker (DCB) was introduced in 2000<ref>{{cite web|title=Applications of Disconnecting Circuit Breakers, Michael Fax\u00e5, p.1 |url=http://www.labplan.ufsc.br/congressos/td2006/Papers/TD06_525.pdf |accessdate=9 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516021322/http://www.labplan.ufsc.br/congressos/td2006/Papers/TD06_525.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2013 }}</ref> and is a high-voltage circuit breaker modeled after the SF<sub>6</sub>-breaker. It presents a technical solution where the disconnecting function is integrated in the breaking chamber, eliminating the need for separate disconnectors. This increases the [[availability]], since open-air disconnecting switch main contacts need maintenance every 2\u20136 years, while modern circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the space requirements within the substation, and increases the [[reliability engineering|reliability]], due to the lack of separate disconnectors.<ref>{{cite web|title= HPL Disconnecting Circuit Breaker|url=http://www.abb.com/product/db0003db002618/c12573e7003302adc1256e44006c19a3.aspx|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Disconnecting Circuit Breakers, Buyer's and Application Guide, p. 10 |url=http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot245.nsf/veritydisplay/775535a79394e670c1257c0800202299/$file/1HSM%209543%2023-03en%20DCB%20Application%20Guide%20Ed3%20-%202013-09%20-%20English.pdf|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn order to further reduce the required space of substation, as well as simplifying the design and engineering of the substation, a [[fiber optic current sensor]] (FOCS) can be integrated with the DCB.

The carbon dioxide breaker works on the same principles as an SF<sub>6</sub> breaker and can also be produced as a disconnecting circuit breaker. By switching from SF<sub>6</sub> to CO<sub>2</sub> it is possible to reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 10 tons during the product's life cycle.<ref>{{cite web|title= Switzerland: ABB breaks new ground with environment friendly high-voltage circuit breaker. |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Switzerland+%3A+ABB+breaks+new+ground+with+environment+friendly...-a0300987882|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n== \"Smart\" circuit breakers ==\nSeveral firms have looked at adding monitoring for appliances via electronics or using a digital circuit breaker to monitor the breakers remotely. Utility companies in the United States have been reviewing use of the technology to turn on and off appliances, as well as potentially turning off charging of electric cars during periods of high electrical grid load. These devices under research and testing would have wireless capability to monitor the electrical usage in a house via a smartphone app or other means.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21731610-old-fuse-box-gets-new-lease-life-smart-circuit-breakers|title=Smart circuit-breakers for energy-efficient homes|journal=The Economist|access-date=2018-01-15|date=2017-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==Other breakers==\n[[File:ABB RCBO.jpg|thumb|[[Residual current circuit breaker]] with overload protection]]\nThe following types are described in separate articles.\n*Breakers for protections against earth faults too small to trip an over-current device:\n**RCCB (Residual Current Operated Circuit-Breaker without Integral Overcurrent Protection) as a type of [[Residual-current device]] (RCD, formerly known as a ''residual current device'') \u2014 detects current imbalance, but does not provide over-current protection.

They are no longer seen in new installations as they cannot detect any dangerous condition where the current is returning to earth by another route - such as via a person on the ground or via plumbing. (also called VOELCB in the UK).\n*[[Recloser]] \u2014 A type of circuit breaker that closes automatically after a delay. These are used on overhead [[electric power distribution]] systems, to prevent short duration faults from causing sustained outages.\n*[[Polyswitch]] (polyfuse) \u2014 A small device commonly described as an automatically resetting fuse rather than a circuit breaker.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n*[[Arc-fault circuit interrupter]]\n*[https://www.gudda.tech/2020/03/what-is-circuit-breaker-and-working.html Circuit Breaker and Working Principle]\n*[[Ring Main Unit]]\n*[[Circuit total limitation]] (CTL)\n*[[Distribution board]] (Circuit breaker panel)\n*[[Earthing system]]\n*[[Hybrid switchgear module]]\n*[[Insulation monitoring device]]\n*[[Motor control center]] (MCC)\n*[[Network protector]]\n*[[Power distribution center]] (PDC)\n*[[Power system protection]]\n*[[Remote racking system]]\n*[[Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;General\n*BS [[European Standard|EN]] 60898-1.
