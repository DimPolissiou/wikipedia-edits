He is also known by his nickname, '''Gazza'''. He earned 57 [[cap (sport)|caps]] during his England career. The [[National Football Museum]] stated that he is \"widely recognised as the most naturally talented English footballer of his generation\".<ref name=\"nfm\" />\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gateshead]], Gascoigne signed schoolboy terms with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before turning professional with the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] (pre-[[Premier League]] creation) club in 1985. Three years later he was sold on to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a \u00a32.2 million fee. He won the [[FA Cup]] with Spurs in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]], before being sold to Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for \u00a35.5 million the following year. In July 1995, he was transferred to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for \u00a34.3 million, and helped the club to two league titles and two trophies. He returned to England in a \u00a33.4 million move to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in March 1998. He made his debut in the Premier League in the 1998\u201399 season, having already featured in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final]]. He switched to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in July 2000, and later had spells with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Gansu Tianma F.C.|Gansu Tianma]] (China), and [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].\n\nGascoigne was part of the England team that reached fourth place in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], where he famously [[crying|cried]] after receiving a yellow card in the [[West Germany v England (1990 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final with West Germany]] which meant he would have been suspended for the final had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], which included scoring a goal against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013 as \"one of the most iconic goals in the game's recent history\".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/13/vault-paul-gascoigne-wondergoal-scotland-euro-96 | title= From the Vault: Paul Gascoigne's wondergoal against Scotland at Euro 96| first=Paul| last=Campbell| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> He has been involved in a number of high-profile [[goal celebration]]s at both club and international level, including the \"dentist's chair\" celebration from Euro '96, and mimicking playing a flute with Rangers in 1998.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football's best and worst goal celebrations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/6250946/Football-goal-celebrations-best-and-worst.html |accessdate=10 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nIn the later parts of his career and especially following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly [[alcoholism]]. He has been jailed or [[involuntary commitment|sectioned]] on numerous occasions and his personal struggles receive regular coverage in the British press. He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief.

The lad turned around and Gascoigne megged him again...{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} For this the Newcastle youth coach Jimmy Nelson, shouted  \"Behave yourself!\"{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Gascoigne then demonstrated his composure and timing and, whilst on the ball, whilst under pressure from some pressing, with a second to spare, he smiled and winked back at the coaching staff who had just shouted at him.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Nelson then remembers, after the smile and wink, Gascoigne struck a 50-yard pass onto the feet of Joe Allon.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Nelson believes with this pass, Joe Allon then went on to score.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} It was in the second leg that Charlton also realized Newcastle had a player.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Gascoigne first goal in the match was a header, his second goal was the goal that impressed Charlton and his assistant [[Maurice Setters]].{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Charlton described the goal as a goal you'd only see once in a lifetime.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} After he scored the goal Charlton said to Setters, \"If you live to be a hundred, Maurice, you'll never see a better goal than that.\"{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nAfter the match Jack Charlton told Gascoigne he would be in the first team the next day against Norwich City.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Gascoigne did travel to Norwich, though Charlton chose not to pick him.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Gascoigne believed Charlton could see it in his eyes that he wasn't quite psychologically ready for first team football.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Charlton also offered Gascoigne professional terms to which Gascoigne accepted.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nAt the age of 18 Gascoigne signed a two-year \u00a3120 a week contract at Newcastle, with the club also having a further two-year option clause.<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=58}}</ref> Though Gascoigne has written his first contract was around \u00a3120 a week, Charlton claims Gascoigne's first contract was roughly \u00a3200 per week.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Charlton highlights that this money for a teenage footballer in the mid 1980s was very good money.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} One worry Charlton had about Gascoigne was Gascoigne's generosity.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Charlton noted Gascoigne was the type of lad who was \"liable to buy drinks all round.\"{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Joe Allon explained Gascoigne could be incredibly generous, he'd give money away to people he believed needed it more than himself, leaving himself broke.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Lee Clark described how Gascoigne's generosity was not just with money. It was also with his actions. Clark explained how he was playing in a youth international match at Wembley stadium. This match was before an England International match that Gascoigne was involved in. Prior to the kick off Clark had learned the last train was at 9:30pm. This meant his father could not make it home. He explained this to Gascoigne. Gascoigne told Clark not to worry and that he would bring him home. After Gascoigne's game, Gascoigne took Clark Snr. home to Newcastle with him.{{sfnp|Clark|2016|loc=Kindle locations 769\u2013785}} Clark explained how Gascoigne did not just do this type of thing for him, he did it for every player too.{{sfnp|Clark|2016|loc=Kindle locations 769\u2013785}} Through noting Gascoigne's generous personality, Charlton arranged that around half of Gascoigne's wage be paid into a bank account for him to collect in a lump sum at the end of his first contract.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\n[[Lee Clark (footballer)|Lee Clark]], who was once hailed to be the next Gazza,{{sfnp|Clark|2016|loc=Kindle locations 106}} and who would go on to become a member of the Kevin Keegan teams of the 1990s,{{sfnp|Clark|2016}} described how Gascoigne as a first team professional, unlike some after they had suddenly attained first team squad status, was down to earth. Gascoigne never became aloof with the youth team players.{{sfnp|Clark|2016|loc=Kindle locations 758\u2013762}} At the age of 16, Lee Clark remembers signing his first apprenticeship contract for Newcastle. Clark recalls that as he was going through the door to the office with his parents to sign his contract with the old guard, and to the laughter of Clark and his parents, Gascoigne -who was also in the reception area and conveying he was hard done by- shouted to Clark, \"Take them for fucking everything, son. Take them for every penny!\"{{sfnp|Clark|2016|loc=Kindle locations 756\u2013757}} Clark highlighted Gascoigne used to join in with the youth team training, and would have a laugh and a joke with Clark and his teammates.{{sfnp|Clark|2016|loc=Kindle locations 761\u2013766}}\n\n{{Quote box|quote=\"On the way back from Norwich after my debut Gazza told me to go over to the boss and say: 'Mister Willie, I'm fucking hungry.

He is also known by his nickname, '''Gazza'''. He earned 57 [[cap (sport)|caps]] during his England career. The [[National Football Museum]] stated that he is \"widely recognised as the most naturally talented English footballer of his generation\".<ref name=\"nfm\" />\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gateshead]], Gascoigne signed schoolboy terms with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before turning professional with the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] (pre-[[Premier League]] creation) club in 1985. Three years later he was sold on to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a \u00a32.2 million fee. He won the [[FA Cup]] with Spurs in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]], before being sold to Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for \u00a35.5 million the following year. In July 1995, he was transferred to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for \u00a34.3 million, and helped the club to two league titles and two trophies. He returned to England in a \u00a33.4 million move to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in March 1998. He made his debut in the Premier League in the 1998\u201399 season, having already featured in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final]]. He switched to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in July 2000, and later had spells with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Gansu Tianma F.C.|Gansu Tianma]] (China), and [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].\n\nGascoigne was part of the England team that reached fourth place in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], where he famously [[crying|cried]] after receiving a yellow card in the [[West Germany v England (1990 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final with West Germany]] which meant he would have been suspended for the final had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], which included scoring a goal against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013 as \"one of the most iconic goals in the game's recent history\".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/13/vault-paul-gascoigne-wondergoal-scotland-euro-96 | title= From the Vault: Paul Gascoigne's wondergoal against Scotland at Euro 96| first=Paul| last=Campbell| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> He has been involved in a number of high-profile [[goal celebration]]s at both club and international level, including the \"dentist's chair\" celebration from Euro '96, and mimicking playing a flute with Rangers in 1998.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football's best and worst goal celebrations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/6250946/Football-goal-celebrations-best-and-worst.html |accessdate=10 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nIn the later parts of his career and especially following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly [[alcoholism]]. He has been jailed or [[involuntary commitment|sectioned]] on numerous occasions and his personal struggles receive regular coverage in the British press. He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief. His personal issues ended his coaching career, and he has not worked in football since being dismissed as the manager of [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] in 2005.\n\n==Early life==\nGascoigne was born in [[Gateshead]], County Durham, on 27 May 1967.<ref>{{Hugman|7083|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"newcastle\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HeroesDetail/0,,10278~550714,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424061003/http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HeroesDetail/0,,10278~550714,00.html |archivedate=24 April 2008 |title=Heroes: Paul Gascoigne |publisher=Newcastle United F.C}}</ref> His father, John (1946\u20132018), was a [[Brick hod|hod carrier]], and his mother, Carol, worked in a factory.<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=12}}</ref> He was named Paul John Gascoigne in tribute to [[Paul McCartney]] and [[John Lennon]] of [[the Beatles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=13}}</ref>\n\nHe attended [[Breckenbeds Junior High School]], then the [[Heathfield Senior High School]], both in the [[Low Fell]] area of Gateshead.<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=23}}</ref> He was noticed by football scouts while playing for Gateshead Boys, though failed to impress in a trial at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=30}}</ref> Further trials at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] also proved unsuccessful, before the team he supported, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], signed him as a schoolboy in 1980.<ref name=\"Gascoigne 2004 31\">{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=31}}</ref> Gascoigne frequently got into trouble with his friend Jimmy \"Five Bellies\" Gardner.

The lad turned around and Gascoigne megged him again...{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} For this the Newcastle youth coach Jimmy Nelson, shouted  \"Behave yourself!\"{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Gascoigne then demonstrated his composure and timing and, whilst on the ball, whilst under pressure from some pressing, with a second to spare, he smiled and winked back at the coaching staff who had just shouted at him.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Nelson then remembers, after the smile and wink, Gascoigne struck a 50-yard pass onto the feet of Joe Allon.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Nelson believes with this pass, Joe Allon then went on to score.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} It was in the second leg that Charlton also realized Newcastle had a player.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Gascoigne first goal in the match was a header, his second goal was the goal that impressed Charlton and his assistant [[Maurice Setters]].{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Charlton described the goal as a goal you'd only see once in a lifetime.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} After he scored the goal Charlton said to Setters, \"If you live to be a hundred, Maurice, you'll never see a better goal than that.\"{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nAfter the match Jack Charlton told Gascoigne he would be in the first team the next day against Norwich City.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Gascoigne did travel to Norwich, though Charlton chose not to pick him.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Gascoigne believed Charlton could see it in his eyes that he wasn't quite psychologically ready for first team football.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Charlton also offered Gascoigne professional terms to which Gascoigne accepted.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nAt the age of 18 Gascoigne signed a two-year \u00a3120 a week contract at Newcastle, with the club also having a further two-year option clause.<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=58}}</ref> Though Gascoigne has written his first contract was around \u00a3120 a week, Charlton claims Gascoigne's first contract was roughly \u00a3200 per week.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Charlton highlights that this money for a teenage footballer in the mid 1980s was very good money.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} One worry Charlton had about Gascoigne was Gascoigne's generosity.{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Charlton noted Gascoigne was the type of lad who was \"liable to buy drinks all round.\"{{sfnp|Charlton|1996|pp=183\u2013184}} Joe Allon explained Gascoigne could be incredibly generous, he'd give money away to people he believed needed it more than himself, leaving himself broke.{{sfnp|Fourfourtwo staff|2018}} Lee Clark described how Gascoigne's generosity was not just with money. It was also with his actions. Clark explained how he was playing in a youth international match at Wembley stadium.

{"title_page": "History of Belgium", "text_new": "{{short description|Aspect of history}}\n{{History of Belgium}}\n{{Culture of Belgium}}\nThe '''history of Belgium''' extends before the founding of the modern state of that name in 1830, and is intertwined with those of its neighbors: [[History of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[History of Germany|Germany]], [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]]. For most of its history, what is now [[Belgium]] was either a part of a larger territory, such as the [[Carolingian Empire]], or divided into a number of smaller states, prominent among them being the [[Duchy of Brabant]], the [[County of Flanders]], the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] and [[County of Luxembourg]]. Due to its strategic location and the many armies fighting on its soil Belgium has often been called the \"battlefield of Europe\" or the \"[[Cockfight|cockpit]] of Europe\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Bindeshwar|last=Patak|title=Glimpses of Europe: A Crucible of Winning Ideas, Great Civilizations and Bloodiest Wars|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MPMkaHfHLRgC&pg=PA565&dq=%22battlefield+of+Europe%22+%22cockpit+of+europe%22#v=onepage&q=%22battlefield%20of%20Europe%22%20%22cockpit%20of%20europe%22&f=false|year=2010|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|page=565|isbn=9788178358314}}</ref> It is also remarkable as a European nation which contains, and is divided by, a [[language boundary]] between [[Romance languages|Latin-derived]] [[French language|French]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[Dutch language|Dutch]].\n\nBelgium's modern shape can be partly traced back at least as far as the \"[[Seventeen Provinces]]\" within the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. These lands straddled the ancient boundary of the [[Scheldt]] that had divided medieval France and Germany, but they were brought together under the [[House of Valois-Burgundy]], and unified into one autonomous territory by their heir [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], in his [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]]. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) later led to the split between a northern [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Southern Netherlands]] from which Belgium and Luxembourg developed. This southern territory continued to be ruled by the [[Habsburg]] descendants of the Burgundian house, at first as the \"Spanish Netherlands\". Invasions from France under [[Louis XIV]] led to the loss of what is now [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] to France, while the remainder finally became the \"Austrian Netherlands\". The [[French Revolutionary wars]] led to Belgium becoming part of France in 1795, bringing the end of the semi-independence of areas which had belonged to the Catholic church. After the defeat of the French in 1814, a new [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was created, which eventually split one more time during the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830\u20131839, giving three modern nations, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.\n\nThe ports and textile industry of Belgium were important back into the Middle Ages, and modern Belgium was one of the first countries to experience an [[Industrial Revolution]], which brought prosperity in the 19th century but also opened a political dichotomy between liberal businessmen and socialist workers. The king set up his own private colonial empire in the [[Belgian Congo]], which the government took over after a major scandal in 1908. Belgium was neutral but its strategic location as a pathway to France made it an invasion target for Germany in 1914 and 1940. Conditions under the occupation were severe. In the postwar period Belgium was a leader in European unification, as a founding member of what has become the [[European Union]]. [[Brussels]] is now host to the headquarters of [[NATO]] and is the ''de facto'' capital of the European Union. The colonies became independent in the early 1960s.\n\nPolitically the country was once polarized on matters of religion and, in recent decades, it has faced new divisions over [[culture of Belgium|differences of language]] and [[economy of Belgium|unequal economic development]]. This ongoing antagonism has caused [[state reform in Belgium|far-reaching reforms since the 1970s]], changing the formerly unitary Belgian state into a federal state, and repeated governmental crises. It is now divided into three regions: [[Flanders]]  (Dutch-speaking) in the north, [[Wallonia]] (French-speaking) in the south, and bilingual Brussels in the middle. There is also a German-speaking population along the border with Germany that was granted to [[Prussia]] in the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 but added to Belgium following the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] following World War I. German is the third official language of Belgium.\n\n==Names==\nBelgium was a name chosen when the modern country was created, but it has a long history. It is originally a classical name, used by Julius Caesar, which continued to be used occasionally in different ways until the creation of the modern country. However, while Caesar described the Belgian part of Gaul as a larger area, much bigger than modern Belgium, including large parts of modern France, Germany and the Netherlands, he only used the term \"Belgium\" to refer to a smaller core area now in Northern France, where the tribes ruling the Belgian military alliance lived. Under Roman rule this region was the basis of the province of ''Belgica Secunda'', which stretched into the coastal Flemish part of modern Belgium. \n\nIn late Roman and medieval times the term Belgium tended to be used to refer to Roman ''Belgica Prima'', and its successor [[Upper Lotharingia]], in the [[Moselle]] region of Germany, Luxembourg and France. Only slowly in modern times did the old term start to be used for the area to the north of the two Roman Belgica provinces, now the Netherlands and Belgium. For example, it was sometimes used as a classical name for the northern \"United Provinces\", roughly the predecessor of the modern Netherlands, after they separated from the Spanish-ruled south, roughly the predecessor of modern Belgium, in the early modern era. \n\nBelgium only began to be used exclusively for the southern part of the Netherlands when it was deliberately chosen as the new name for the new country, which broke out of the post-Waterloo kingdom of the Netherlands after a struggle which lasted from 1830 to 1839.\n\n==Before independence==\n\n===Prehistory===\n[[File:Belgian flint knives.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flint]] [[knife|knives]] discovered in Belgian caves]]\nOn Belgian territory [[Neanderthal]] fossils were discovered at [[Engis]] in 1829\u201330 and elsewhere, some dating back to at least 100,000 [[Before Common Era|BCE]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boneandstone.com/neandertal/neandertal_descriptions.html#engis |title=Descriptions of Fossil Neandertals |publisher=Bone and Stone |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest [[Neolithic]] farming technology of northern Europe, the so-called [[Linear Pottery culture|LBK culture]], reached the east of Belgium at its furthest northwesterly stretch from its origins in southeast Europe.

In the last part of the Neolithic, evidence is found for the [[Corded Ware]] and [[Bell Beaker]] cultures in the south of the Netherlands, but these cultures also do not seem to have had a big impact in all of Belgium.\n\nThe population of Belgium started to increase permanently with the late [[Bronze age]] from around 1750 BCE. Three possibly related European cultures arrived in sequence. First the [[Urnfield]] culture arrived (for example, [[tumulus|tumuli]] are found at [[Ravels]] and [[Hamont-Achel]] in the [[Campine]]). Then, coming into the [[Iron Age]], the [[Hallstatt culture]], and the [[La T\u00e8ne culture]]. All three of these are associated with [[Indo-European languages]], with specifically [[Celtic languages]] being especially associated with La T\u00e8ne material culture, and possibly Halstatt. This is because historical Greek and Roman records from areas where this culture settled show Celtic placenames and personal names.\n\nHowever it is possible in Belgium that especially in the northern areas the Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne cultures were brought by new elites, and that the main language of the population was not Celtic. From 500 BC [[Celt]]ic tribes settled in the region and traded with the [[Mediterranean]] world. From c. 150 BC, the first coins came into use, under the influence of trade with the Mediterranean.\n\n===Celtic and Roman periods===\n[[File:Belgica1.png|right|thumb|The [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Belgica]] in around 120 AD]]\n{{Main|Gallia Belgica}}\n\nWhen [[Julius Caesar]] arrived in the region, as recorded in his ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'', the inhabitants of Belgium, northwestern France, and the German Rhineland were known as the [[Belgae]] (after whom modern [[Belgium]] is named), and they were considered to be the northern part of [[Gaul]]. The region of [[Luxembourg]], including the part of the [[Luxembourg (province of Belgium)|Belgian province of Luxembourg]] around [[Arlon]], was inhabited by the [[Treveri]], who were not listed by Caesar as Belgae, although the Romans later placed them in the province of the Belgae.\n\nThe exact nature of the distinction between the Belgae to the North and the Celts to the south, and the Germani across the Rhine, is disputed.<ref name=\"Lamarcq, Danny 1996\">{{cite book|last=Lamarcq, Danny|first=Rogge, Marc|title=De Taalgrens: Van de oude tot de nieuwe Belgen|year=1996|publisher=Davidsfonds}}</ref> Caesar said that the Belgae were separated from the rest of Gaul by language, law and custom, and he also says they had Germanic ancestry, but he does not go into detail.

The Menapii and northern Germani lived among low thorny forests, islands and swamps, and the central Belgian Nervii lands were deliberately planted with thick hedges, in order to be impenetrable to cavalry. There is also less archaeological evidence of large settlements and trade in the area. According to [[Tacitus]], writing a generation later, the ''Germani cisrhenani'' (who included the [[Eburones]]) were in fact the original tribe to be called ''Germani'', and all other uses of the term extended from them, though in his time the same people were now called the [[Tungri]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tacitus|first=Gaius Claudius|title=Germania 2|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=2&highlight=tungrians}}</ref> Tacitus also reported that both the Treveri and Nervii claimed Germanic and Belgic kinship.\n\nModern linguists use the word \"germanic\" to refer to languages but it is not known for sure whether even the Belgian ''Germani'' spoke a [[Germanic language]], and their tribal and personal names are clearly Celtic. This is in fact also true of the possibly related tribes across the Rhine from them at this time. Archaeologists have also had difficulty finding evidence of the exact migrations from east of the Rhine which Caesar reports and more generally there has been skepticism about using him in this way due to the political motives of his commentaries. But the archaeological record gives the impression that the classical Belgian ''Germani'' were a relatively stable population going back to [[Urnfield]] times, with a more recently immigrated elite class who would have been of more interest to Caesar.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gallia Belgica|last=Wightman|first =Edith Mary|year=1985|publisher= University of California Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEyS54uSj88C|page=14|isbn=9780520052970}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tongeren Romeinse wallen.jpg|thumb|left|Surviving Roman city walls in [[Tongeren]], the former city of [[Atuatuca|Atuatuca Tongrorum]]]]\n\nThe Menapii and Nervii flourished within the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Belgica]], along with the southern Belgae and the [[Treveri]]. These Roman provinces were broken into ''civitates'', each with a capital city, and each representing one of the major tribal groups named by Caesar. At first, only one, [[Tongeren]] capital of the Tungri, was in modern Belgium. Later, the capital of the Menapii was moved from [[Cassel, Nord|Cassel]] in modern France to [[Tournai]] in Belgium. The Nervian capital was in the south of the territory in modern France, at [[Bavay]], and later moved to [[Cambrai]]. [[Trier]], the capital of the Treveri, is today in Germany, near Luxembourg.\n\nThe northeastern corner of this province, including Tongeren and the area of the earlier ''Germani'', was united with the militarized Rhine border to form a newer province known as [[Germania Inferior]].<ref name=\"Povinzen\">{{cite web | url =http://www.antikefan.de/kulturen/rom/provinzen.html | title =Povinzen | publisher =Antikefan}}</ref> Its cities included Ulpia Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]] in the modern Netherlands), Colonia Ulpia Trajana ([[Xanten]] in modern Germany) and the capital Colonia Agrippina ([[Cologne]] in Germany).<ref name=\"Povinzen\"/> Later, Emperor [[Diocletian]] restructured the provinces around 300, and split the remaining Belgica into two provinces: ''Belgica Prima'' and ''Belgica Secunda''. Belgica Prima was the eastern part and had Trier as its main city, and included part of the Belgian province of Luxembourg. It became one of the most important Roman cities in Western Europe in the 3rd century.\n\nChristianity was also first introduced to Belgium during the late-Roman period, and the first known bishop in the region [[Saint Servatius|Servatius]] taught in the middle of the Fourth century in [[Tongeren]].\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n[[File:StServatius-Treasury2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Servatius]], bishop of [[Tongeren]] and one of the first known Christian figures in the region. 16th century [[reliquary]].]]\nIn the Middle Ages, the old Roman ''civitates'' became the basis of Christian dioceses, and the row of dioceses which form the core of modern Belgium (Tournai, Cambrai, and Li\u00e8ge) were the most northerly continental areas to retain a Romanized culture. The modern Belgian language boundary derives from this period, as the area was a contact point of Frankish and Romanized populations.\n\nAs the [[Western Roman Empire]] lost power, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]s came to dominate the military, and then form kingdoms. Coastal Flanders, the old territory of the Menapii, became part of the \"[[Saxon Shore]]\". In inland northern Belgium, [[Franks]] from the Roman frontier in the Rhine delta were allowed to re-settle in [[Toxandria]] in the 4th century. Wallonia, dominated by bands of forests and poor farming land, remained more heavily Romanized, although eventually became subject to Franks in the 5th century. Franks remained important in the Roman military, and the Romanized Frankish [[Merovingian Dynasty]] eventually took over northern France. [[Clovis I]], the best-known king of this dynasty, first conquered Romanized northern France, later called [[Neustria]], then turned north to the Frankish lands later referred to as [[Austrasia]], which included all or most of Belgium. He converted to [[Catholicism]], followed by many followers. Christian missionaries preached to the populace and started a wave of [[Religious conversion|conversion]] ([[Saint Servatius]], [[Saint Remacle]], [[Saint Hadelin]]).\n\n[[File:Lage Landen (Frankische Tijd).svg|thumb|Southern part of the [[Low Countries]] with bishopry towns and abbeys c. 7th century.

After [[Charles Martel]] countered the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion from Spain (732 \u2014 Poitiers), King [[Charlemagne]] (born close to [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] in [[Herstal]] or [[Jupille]]{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}) brought a huge part of Europe under his rule and was [[Crown (headgear)|crowned]] the \"[[Emperor]] of the new [[Holy Roman Empire]]\" by the [[Pope Leo III]] (800 in [[Aachen]]).\n\nThe [[Vikings]] raided widely throughout this period, but a major settlement that had caused problems in the area of Belgium was defeated in 891 by [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] in the [[Battle of Leuven (891)|battle of Leuven]].\n\nThe Frankish lands were divided and reunified several times under the [[Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian]] dynasties, but eventually were firmly divided into [[France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The parts of the [[County of Flanders]] stretching out west of the river [[Scheldt]] (Schelde in Dutch, Escaut in French) became part of France during the Middle Ages, but the remainders of the County of Flanders and the [[Low Countries]] were part of the Holy Roman Empire, specifically they were in the [[stem duchy]] of [[Lower Lorraine|Lower Lotharingia]], which had a period as an independent kingdom.\n\nThrough the early Middle Ages, the northern part of present-day Belgium (now commonly referred to as [[Flanders]]) was a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]]-speaking area, whereas in the southern part people had continued to be Romanized and spoke derivatives of [[Vulgar Latin]].\n\nAs the Holy Roman Emperors and French Kings lost effective control of their domains in the 11th and 12th centuries, the territory more or less corresponding to the present Belgium was divided into relatively independent feudal states, including:\n*The [[County of Flanders]]\n*The [[Marquis of Namur|Marquisate of Namur]]\n*The [[Duchy of Brabant]] (see also [[Duke of Brabant]])\n*The [[County of Hainaut]]\n*The [[Duchy of Limburg]]\n*The [[County of Luxembourg]]\n*The [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] (the territory over which the bishop ruled as a lord, which was smaller than the diocese)\n\nThe coastal county of Flanders was one of the wealthiest parts of Europe in the late Middle Ages, from trading with England, France and Germany, and it became culturally important. During the 11th and 12th centuries, the [[Rheno-Mosan art|Rheno-Mosan]] or [[Mosan art]] movement flourished in the region moving its centre from [[Cologne]] and [[Trier]] to [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], [[Maastricht]] and [[Aachen]]. Some masterpieces of this [[Romanesque art]] are the [[shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral]]; the [[baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge]] by [[Renier de Huy]]; the [[Stavelot Triptych]]; the shrine of [[Saint Remacle]] in [[Stavelot]]; the shrine of [[Saint Servatius]] in Maastricht; and [[Notker of Li\u00e8ge|Notger]]'s gospel in Li\u00e8ge.\n\n===13th\u201316th centuries===\n[[File:Battle of Courtrai2.jpg|thumb|right|14th-century illustration of the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] in 1302 where forces from the [[County of Flanders]] defeated their nominal overlords of the [[Kingdom of France]].]]\nIn this period, many cities, including [[Ypres]], [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], obtained their [[City rights in the Low Countries|city charter]].

The lack of imperial protection also meant that the French and English began vying for influence in the region.\n\nIn 1214, King [[Philip II of France]] defeated the Count of Flanders in the [[Battle of Bouvines]] and forced his submission to the French crown. Through the remainder of the 13th century, French control over Flanders steadily increased until 1302 when an attempt at total annexation by Philip IV met a stunning defeat when Count Guy (who had the support of the guilds and craftsmen) rallied the townspeople and humiliated the French knights at the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]]. Undaunted, Philip launched a new campaign that ended with the inconclusive [[Battle of Mons-en-P\u00e9v\u00e8le]] in 1304. The king imposed harsh peace terms on Flanders, which included ceding the important textile-making centers of [[Lille]] and [[Douai]].\n\n[[File:Brugse metten.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bruges Matins (massacre)|Massacre of the French]] in Bruges by Flemish militia during the [[Franco-Flemish War]]]]\nThereafter, Flanders remained a French tributary until the start of the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1337. In Brabant, skillful work by the duke of that territory and the Count of Hainaut-Holland foiled various French manipulations. Paris's influence in the Low Countries was counterbalanced by England, which maintained important ties to the coastal ports.\n\nFlanders faced the difficult situation of being politically subservient to France, but also reliant on trade with England. Many craftsmen emigrated to England, which also came to dominate the wool-shipping business. Flemish cloth nonetheless remained a highly valued product, and it was highly dependent on English wool. Any interruption in the supply of that invariably resulted in riots and violence from the weavers' guilds. On the whole though, Flemish trade became a passive one. Flanders received imports from other areas of Europe, but itself purchased little abroad except wine from Spain and France. [[Bruges]] became a great commercial center after the Hanseatic League set up business there and the Italian banking houses followed suit.\n\nA few towns in the Low Countries dated back to Roman times, but most had been founded from the 9th century onward. The oldest were in the Scheldt and Meuse areas, with many towns in what's now the Netherlands being much younger and only dating from the 13th century. From early on, the Low Countries began to develop as a commercial and manufacturing center. Merchants became the dominant class in the towns, with the nobility largely limited to countryside estates.\n\n{{history Benelux states}}\n\nBy 1433 most of the Belgian and [[Luxembourg]]ish territory along with much of the rest of the [[Low Countries]] became part of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] under [[Philip the Good]]. When [[Mary of Burgundy]], granddaughter of Philip the Good married [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], the Low Countries became [[Habsburg]] territory. Their son, [[Philip I of Castile]] (Philip the Handsome) was the father of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The Holy Roman Empire was unified with [[Spain]] under the [[Habsburg]] Dynasty after Charles V inherited several domains.\n\nEspecially during the Burgundy period (the 15th and 16th centuries), [[Tournai]], [[Bruges]], [[Ypres]], [[Ghent]], [[Brussels]], and [[Antwerp]] took turns at being major European centers for commerce, industry (especially textiles) and art. Bruges was the pioneer. It had a strategic location at the crossroads of the northern [[Hanseatic League]] trade and the southern trade routes. Bruges was already included in the circuit of the Flemish and French cloth fairs at the beginning of the 13th century, but when the old system of fairs broke down the entrepreneurs of Bruges innovated. They developed, or borrowed from Italy, new forms of merchant capitalism, whereby several merchants would share the risks and profits and pool their knowledge of markets.  They employed new forms of economic exchange, including bills of exchange (i.e. promissory notes) and letters of credit.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mack|last=Ott|title=The Political Economy of Nation Building: The World's Unfinished Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJyRLypfagYC&pg=PA92|year=2012|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=92|isbn=9781412847421}}</ref>  Antwerp eagerly welcomed foreign traders, most notably the Portuguese pepper and spice traders.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herman van der Wee|title=The growth of the Antwerp market and the European economy: (fourteenth-sixteenth centuries)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bufsAAAAMAAJ|year=1963|publisher=Nijhoff|page=127}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=James Donald Tracy|title=The Rise of Merchant Empires: Long-Distance Trade in the Early Modern World, 1350\u20131750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heEdZziizrUC&pg=PA263|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=263|isbn=9780521457354}}</ref>\n\nIn art the [[Early Renaissance painting|Renaissance was represented]] by the [[Flemish Primitives]], a group of painters active primarily in the Southern Netherlands in the 15th and early 16th centuries (for example, [[Jan van Eyck|Johannes Van Eyck]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden|Rogier Van der Weyden]]), and the [[Franco-Flemish school|Franco-Flemish composers]] (e.g. [[Guillaume Dufay]]).

This comprised all of Belgium, present-day north-western France, present-day Luxembourg, and present-day Netherlands, except for the lands of the [[Prince-Bishop of Li\u00e8ge]].\n\nThe Burgundian princes from Philip II (the Bold) to Charles the Bold enhanced their political prestige with economic growth and artistic splendour. These \"Great Dukes of the West\" were effectively sovereigns, with domains extending from the Zuiderzee to the Somme. The urban and other textile industries, which had developed in the Belgian territories since the 12th century, became the economic center of northwestern Europe.\n\nThe death of Charles the Bold (1477) and the marriage of his daughter Mary to the archduke Maximilian of Austria ended the independence of the Low Countries by bringing them increasingly under the sway of the Habsburg dynasty. Mary and Maximilian's grandson Charles became king of Spain as Charles I in 1516 and Holy Roman emperor as Charles V in 1519.\n\nIn Brussels on 25 October 1555, Charles V abdicated Belgica Regia to his son, who in January 1556 assumed the throne of Spain as Philip II.\n\n===Dutch Revolt===\n{{main|Dutch Revolt}}\n{{see also|Dunkirkers}}\nThe northern part of Belgica Regia, comprising seven provinces and eventually forming the Dutch Republic, became increasingly [[Protestant]] (specifically, [[Calvinist]]), while the larger part, called 't Hof van Brabant and comprising the ten southern provinces, remained primarily Catholic.

The most notable event of this period was the [[Battle of Oosterweel]], in which Spanish forces destroyed an army of Dutch Calvinists. King Philip II sent in [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba]], as Governor-General of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] from 1567 to 1573. Alba established a special court called the [[Council of Troubles]] (nicknamed the \"Council of Blood\").

Alba boasted that he had burned or executed 18,600 persons in the Netherlands, in addition to the far greater number he massacred during the war, many of them women and children; 8,000 persons were burned or hanged in one year, and the total number of Alba's Flemish victims can not have fallen short of 50,000.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sharp Hume |first1=Mart\u00edn Andrew |title=The Spanish People: Their Origin, Growth and Influence |page=372}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Dutch Revolt]] spread to the south in the mid-1570s after the [[Army of Flanders]] mutinied for lack of pay and went on the rampage in several cities.

The city was open to the sea, strongly fortified, and well defended under the leadership of [[Marnix van St. Aldegonde]]. Engineer Sebastian Baroccio cut off all access to the sea by constructing a [[bridge of boats]] across the [[Scheldt]]. The Dutch sailed fireships, called [[Hellburners]],{{efn|Hellburners were a special type of [[fireship]] designed by an Italian engineer, [[Federigo Giambelli]].}} against the bridge and one of the exploding infernal machines blew up a 200-foot-long span and [[Largest artificial non-nuclear explosions|killed 800 Spaniards]].

From 1659, Madrid increasingly relied on the aid of allied armies to restrain French ambitions to annex the [[Spanish Netherlands]], in which Spain showed declining interest after more than a century of war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nolan |first1=Cathal J. |title=Wars of the Age of Louis XIV, 1650-1715: An Encyclopedia of Global Warfare and Civilization |date=2008 |page=444}}</ref>\n\nUnder [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1643\u20131715), France pursued an expansionist policy, particularly affecting Belgium. France frequently held control of territories in the Southern Netherlands, confronted by various opponents including the Netherlands and Austria. There was the [[War of Devolution]] (1667\u20131668), the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672\u20131678), the [[War of the Reunions]] (1683\u20131684), and the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688\u20131697). These were then followed by the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131714).\n\nWhen [[Charles II of Spain]] died in 1700, two dynasties of foreign relatives contested for the throne, the [[House of Bourbon]], who ruled France, and the [[Habsburgs]], who were emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as well as holding various territories in central Europe. The Austrian Habsburgs were supported by an alliance led by Britain, the Dutch Republic, and several other northern European Protestant states, and the French were supported by [[Bavaria]]. Much of the war occurred on Belgian soil, with the allies there being led upon the field by John Churchill, the [[Duke of Marlborough]].\n\nAfter the victory of Austria and its allies, under the [[Treaty of Rastatt]], the Belgian and present-day Luxembourg territories (except the lands under the lordship of the Prince Bishop of Li\u00e8ge) were transferred to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]] while the Bourbon Dynasty succeeded in inheriting Spain itself. They were thus called Belgium Austriacum from 1705 to 1795.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belgium|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/59268/Belgium|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> Louis XIV died in 1715.\n\n===Brabant Revolution===\nThe [[Brabant Revolution|Belgian Revolution]] of 1789\u201390 overlapped with the [[French Revolution]] which began in 1789. The movement called for independence from [[Austrian Netherlands|Austrian rule]]. Brabant rebels, under the command of [[Jean-Andr\u00e9 van der Mersch]], defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Turnhout (1789)|Battle of Turnhout]] and launched the [[United States of Belgium]] together with the Prince Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge. The new state was beset by factionalism between the radical \"[[Vonckists]]\", led by [[Jan Frans Vonck]] and the more conservative \"[[Statists (Belgium)|Statists]]\" of the [[Henri Van der Noot]]. Businessmen with widescale operations generally supported the Statists, while the Vonckists attracted small business and members of the trade guilds. They called for independence from Austria but were conservative in social and religious questions.<ref>Jacques Godechot, \"The Business Classes and the Revolution Outside France\", ''American Historical Review'' (1958) 64#1 p. 7 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1844853 in JSTOR]</ref> By November 1790, the revolt had been crushed and the Habsburg Monarchy had returned to power.<ref>Janet L.

The [[Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] was dissolved. Its territory was divided over the ''d\u00e9partements'' [[Meuse-Inf\u00e9rieure]] and [[Ourte]]. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] confirmed the loss of [[Southern Netherlands]],  by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], in 1797.\n\nThe French invaded and controlled Belgium, 1794\u20131814, imposing all their new reforms and incorporating what had been the \"Austrian Netherlands\" and the Prince-Bishopric of Liege into France. New rulers were sent in by Paris. Belgian men were drafted into the French wars and heavily taxed. Nearly everyone was Catholic, but the Church was repressed. Resistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule. The French legal system, however, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of class distinctions. Belgium now had a government bureaucracy selected by merit, but it was not at all popular.<ref>{{cite book|first= E.H.|last = Kossmann|title =The Low Countries: 1780\u20131940|date = 1978|pages =65\u201381, 101\u20132|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 9780198221081}}</ref>\n\nUntil the establishment of the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] in 1799, Catholics were heavily repressed by the French.

The plan was to join Belgium and the Netherlands, under Dutch control. Napoleon briefly returned to power during the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815, but was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], south of Brussels.\n\n====Economics====\nFrance promoted commerce and capitalism, paving the way for the ascent of the bourgeoisie and the rapid growth of manufacturing and mining.  In economics, therefore, the nobility declined while the middle class Belgian entrepreneurs flourished because of their inclusion in a large market, paving the way for Belgium's leadership role after 1815 in the [[Industrial Revolution]] on the Continent.<ref>{{cite book|first =Bernard A.|last = Cook|title =Belgium: A History |date = 2005|pages =  49\u201354|isbn = 9780820458243 }}</ref><ref>Samuel Clark, \"Nobility, Bourgeoisie and the Industrial Revolution in Belgium\",  ''Past & Present'' (1984) # 105 pp. 140\u2013175; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650548 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nGodechot finds that after the annexation, Belgium's business community supported the new regime, unlike the peasants, who remained hostile.

This was under the rule of a Protestant king, namely [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]]. Most of the small and [[ecclesiastical]] states in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were given to larger states at this time, and this included the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] which now became formally part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nThe [[enlightened despot]] William I, who reigned from 1815\u20131840, had almost unlimited constitutional power, the constitution having been written by a number of notable people chosen by him. As despot, he had no difficulty in accepting some of the changes resulting from the social transformation of the previous 25 years, including equality of all before the law. However, he resurrected the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] as a political class and elevated a large number of people to the nobility. Voting rights were still limited, and only the nobility were eligible for seats in the upper house.\n\nWilliam I was a [[Calvinist]] and intolerant of the Catholic majority in the newly created [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. He promulgated the \"Fundamental Law of Holland\", with some modifications. This entirely overthrew the old order of things in the southern Netherlands, suppressed the clergy as an order, abolished the privileges of the Catholic Church, and guaranteed equal protection to every religious creed and the enjoyment of the same civil and political rights to every subject of the king. It reflected the spirit of the French Revolution and in so doing did not please the Catholic bishops in the south, who had detested the Revolution.<ref>Kurth, Godefroid, \"Belgium\" in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02395a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907) online]</ref>\n\nWilliam I actively promoted economic modernization. His position as monarch was ambivalent, however; his sovereignty was real, but his authority was shared with a legislature elected partly by himself and partly by the wealthy citizens under a constitution granted by the king. Government was in the hands of ministries of state. The old provinces were reestablished in name only. The government was now fundamentally unitary, and all authority flowed from the center. The first 15 years of the Kingdom showed progress and prosperity, as industrialization proceeded rapidly in the south, where the [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed entrepreneurs and labor to combine in a new textile industry, powered by local coal mines. There was little industry in the northern provinces, but most overseas colonies were restored, and highly profitable trade resumed after a 25-year hiatus. Economic liberalism combined with moderate monarchical authoritarianism to accelerate the adaptation of the Netherlands to the new conditions of the 19th century. The country prospered until a crisis arose in relations with the southern provinces.\n\n====Unrest in the southern provinces====\nProtestants controlled the new country although they formed only a quarter of the population.<ref>For a religion map see [http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/kuyper.html map]</ref> In theory, Catholics had full legal equality; in practice their voice was not heard. Few Catholics held high state or military offices. The king insisted that schools in the South end their traditional teaching of Catholic doctrine, even though everyone there was Catholic.<ref>Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330\", p 86</ref> Socially, the French-speaking Walloons strongly resented the king's policy to make Dutch the language of government. There was also growing outrage at the king's insensitivity to social differences. According to [[Simon Schama|Schama]], there was growing hostility to the Dutch government whose \"initiatives were met at first with curiosity, then with apprehension and finally with fierce and unyielding hostility\".<ref>Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330\", p.&nbsp;87</ref>\n\nPolitical liberals in the south had their own grievances, especially regarding the king's authoritarian style; he seemed uncaring about the issue of regionalism, flatly vetoing a proposal for a French-language teacher-training college in francophone [[Li\u00e8ge]].  Finally, all factions in the South complained of unfair representation in the national legislature. The south was industrializing faster and was more prosperous than the north, leading to resentment of northern arrogance and political domination.\n\nThe outbreak of [[July Revolution|revolution in France]] in 1830 was used as a signal for revolt. The demand at first was autonomy for Belgium, as the southern provinces were now called. Eventually, revolutionaries began demanding total independence.<ref>J. C. H. Blom; E. Lamberts et al.

Violent street fighting soon broke out, and anarchy reigned in Brussels.  The liberal bourgeoisie, who had initially been at the forefront of the burgeoning revolution, were appalled by the violence and became willing to accept a compromise with the Dutch.<ref name=\"autogenerated60\">{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium: a history|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0820458243|pages=59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nThe revolution broke out for numerous reasons. On a political level, the Belgians felt significantly under-represented in the Netherlands' elected Lower Assembly and disliked the unpopular Prince of Orange, the future [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] who was the representative of King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] in Brussels. The French-speaking [[Walloons]] also felt ostracised in a majority Dutch speaking country. There were also significant religious grievances felt by the majority Catholic Belgians in a nation controlled by the Dutch Protestants.\n\nThe king assumed the protest would blow itself out. He waited for a surrender, announcing an amnesty for all revolutionaries, except foreigners and the leaders. When this did not succeed he sent in the army. Dutch forces were able to penetrate the [[Schaerbeek|Schaerbeek Gate]] into Brussels, but the advance was stalled in the [[Parc de Bruxelles]] under a hail of sniper fire. Royal troops elsewhere met determined resistance from revolutionaries at makeshift barricades. It is estimated that there were no more than 1,700 revolutionaries (described by the French Ambassador as an \"undisciplined rabble\"<ref name=\"autogenerated60\"/>) in Brussels at the time, faced with over 6,000 Dutch troops.  However, faced with strong opposition, Dutch troops were ordered out of the capital on the night of 26 September after three days of street fighting. There were also battles around the country as revolutionaries clashed with Dutch forces. In Antwerp, eight Dutch warships bombarded the city following its capture by revolutionary forces.\n\nBelgian independence was not allowed by the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]]; nevertheless the revolutionaries were regarded sympathetically by the major powers of Europe, especially the British. In November 1830, the [[London Conference of 1830]] or \"Belgian Congress\" (comprising delegates from Great Britain, France, Russia, Prussia and Austria) ordered an armistice on November 4. At the end of November Britain and France came up with a proposal \u2014 no military intervention and the establishment of an independent kingdom of Belgium \u2014 which was accepted by the other three more conservative participants, who had favored a military intervention to restore the absolutist regime of William I.<ref>Els Witte, \"La Construction de la Belgique 1828\u20131847\", in E.

The new kingdom would be obliged to remain neutral in foreign affairs. The British foreign secretary [[Lord Palmerston]] strongly backed the Prince of Orange as the new king, a choice which would have maintained a dynastic link between the Netherlands and the new kingdom. The Prince proved to be unacceptable to William I, his father, as well as to the French, who wanted a clear break with the Netherlands. Finally, Palmerston came up with his second choice, [[Leopold of Saxe-Coburg|Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg]] \u2014 [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]]' widower, and an admirer of the British constitutional model \u2014 who was accepted by all.<ref>Els Witte, pp. 74\u201376</ref> On July 21, 1831, the first \"King of the Belgians\" was inaugurated.

The [[Belgian National Congress]] was formed to draw up a constitution. Under the new constitution, Belgium became a sovereign, independent state with a [[constitutional monarchy]]. However, the constitution did severely limit [[suffrage|voting rights]] to the French-speaking [[bourgeoisie|haute-bourgeoisie]] and the clergy, in a country where French was not the majority language. The Catholic church was afforded a good deal of freedom from state intervention.\n\nThe state of conflict (but not open warfare) with the Netherlands lasted another eight years, but in 1839, the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] was signed between the two countries. By the treaty of 1839, the eastern part of [[Luxembourg]] did not join Belgium, but remained a possession of the Netherlands until different inheritance laws caused it to separate as an independent [[Grand Duchy]] (the western, French-speaking part of Luxembourg became the Belgian province of that name). Belgium lost Eastern [[Province of Limburg (1815\u20131839)|Limburg]], [[Zeeuws Vlaanderen]] and [[French Flanders]] and [[Eupen]]: four territories which it had claimed on historical grounds.

The availability of cheap coal was a main factor that attracted entrepreneurs. Numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around [[Li\u00e8ge]] and [[Charleroi]]. The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]]. His factories at [[Seraing]] integrated all stages of production, from engineering to the supply of raw materials, as early as 1825.<ref>Chris Evans, G\u00f6ran Ryd\u00e9n, ''The Industrial Revolution in Iron; The impact of British Coal Technology in Nineteenth-Century Europe'' (Ashgate, 2005, pp. 37\u201338).</ref>\n\nIndustry spread through the [[Sillon industriel]] (\"industrial district\"), [[Haine]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse]] valleys.<ref>Muriel Neven and Isabelle Devos, 'Breaking stereotypes', in M.

Coal was sold to local mills and railways as well as to France and Prussia.\n\nThe textile industry, based on cotton and flax, employed about half of the industrial workforce for much of the industrial period. [[Ghent]] was the premier industrial city in Belgium until the 1880s, when the center of growth moved to [[Li\u00e8ge]], with its steel industry.<ref>Carl Strikwerda, ''A house divided: Catholics, Socialists, and Flemish nationalists in nineteenth-century Belgium''  (1997) p 44-46</ref>\n\nWallonia had rich coalfields over much of its area, and the highly folded nature of coal seams meant that it could be found at relatively shallow depths. Deep mines were not required at first so there were a large number of small operations. There was a complex legal system for concessions, often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper (thanks to the innovation of steam pumping). In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was 220 meters. By 1856, the average depth in the area west of [[Mons]] was 361, and in 1866, 437 meters and some pits had reached down 700 and 900 meters; one was 1,065 meters deep, probably the deepest coal mine in Europe at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted and the steel industry was importing some coal from the Ruhr.<ref>Norman Pounds and William Parker, ''Coal and steel in Western Europe'' (1957) ch 5</ref>\n\nCheap and readily available coal attracted firms producing metals and glass, both of which required considerable amounts of coal, and so regions around coal fields became highly industrialised. The ''[[Sillon industriel]]'' (''Industrial Valley''), and in particular the ''[[Pays Noir]]'' around [[Charleroi]], were the centre of the steel industry until the Second World War.\n\n====Railways====\n[[File:Stoomloc Le Belge.jpg|thumb|right|The first Belgian-produced steam locomotive, ''\"The Belgian\"'' ([[Le Belge (locomotive)|\"''Le Belge''\"]]) built in 1835]]\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Belgium}}\nThe nation provided an ideal model for showing the value of the railways for speeding the Industrial Revolution. After 1830, the new nation decided to stimulate industry. It funded a simple cross-shaped system that connected the major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. The system was very soundly built along British lines, so that profits and wages were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place. L\u00e9opold I went on to build the [[Rail transport in Belgium|first railway in continental Europe]] in 1835, between Brussels and [[Mechelen]]. The first trains were drawn by [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]] engines imported from Great Britain.<ref>Patrick O'Brien, ''Railways and the economic development of Western Europe, 1830\u20131914'' (1983) ch 7</ref> The development of smaller railways in Belgium, notably the [[Li\u00e8ge]]\u2013[[Jemappes]] line, was launched by tendering contracts to private companies which \"became the model for the extension of small local railways all over the low countries.\"<ref name=\"ascherson231\">{{cite book|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|title=The King incorporated : Leopold the Second and the Congo.|year=1999|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=978-1862072909|page=231|edition=[New ed.]}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1900s, Belgium was a major exporter of trams and other rail components, exporting vast quantities of railway materials.

In general terms, the Catholics represented the relatively religious, conservative and rural elements in the society, while the Liberals represented the more secular, more progressive and more urban middle-class elements.\"<ref>Samuel Clark, \"Nobility, bourgeoisie and the industrial revolution in Belgium,\" ''Past & Present'' (1984) p 165</ref>  Before the arrival of the socialists in the 1890s, the nation was therefore polarised between the conservative [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] and the secular [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]]. The Liberals were anticlerical and wanted to reduce the power of the Church. The conflict came to a head during the \"[[First School War]]\" of 1879\u20131884 as Liberal attempts to introduce a greater level of secularism in primary education were beaten back by outraged Catholics. The School War ushered in a period of Catholic Party dominance in Belgian politics that lasted (almost unbroken) until 1917.<ref>Kossmann, ''The Low Countries,'' ch 4\u20138</ref>\n\nReligious conflict also extended to university education, where secular universities like the [[Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)|Free University of Brussels]] competed with Catholic universities like the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]].\n\n===Linguistic conflict===\nThe majority of those in the north of the country spoke Dutch and other [[Low Franconian languages]] while those in the south spoke [[Langues d'o\u00efl]] such as [[French language|French]], [[Walloon language|Walloon]] and [[Picard language|Picard]]. French became the official language of government after the separation from the Netherlands in 1830 and Belgian cultural life was especially dominated by the French influence,<ref>Rondo E.

This was partly due to a sense of growing Flemish identity, made possible through greater awareness of Flemish culture and history from the 1840s. Flemish victories, like the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] in 1302 were celebrated and a Flemish cultural movement, led by figures like [[Hendrik Conscience]] was born.  About the same time a Walloon Movement emerged, led by [[Jules Destr\u00e9e]] (1863\u20131936) and based on loyalty to the French language. Universal suffrage meant the Francophones were a political minority, so the Walloon Movement concentrated on protecting French where it had a majority, and did not contest the expanded use of Dutch in Flemish areas.<ref>Kas Deprez and Louis Vos, eds.

Dutch became the language of government, education, and the courts in the northern provinces of East Flanders and West Flanders, Antwerp, Limburg, and eastern Brabant. French remained the official language in Wallonia; Brussels, which had seen a major [[Francization of Brussels|language shift to French]], became an officially bilingual region.  Meanwhile, a small separatist Flemish movement had emerged; the Germans had supported it during the war, and in the 1930s it turned fascist. In the Second World War it collaborated with the Nazis.<ref>Kas Deprez and Louis Vos, eds.

These reforms, led by [[Jules d'Anethan|d'Anethan]] under pressure from [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]], divided Belgian politics. The Catholics united with the Liberals under [[Walth\u00e8re Fr\u00e8re-Orban|Fr\u00e8re-Orban]] to oppose them, and the reforms were finally defeated when [[Jules d'Anethan|d'Anethan's]] government fell during an unrelated scandal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|title=The King incorporated : Leopold the Second and the Congo.|year=1999|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=978-1862072909|page=81|edition=[New ed.]}}</ref>  Eventually, the military was reformed. The 1909 System instituted compulsory military service of eight years on active duty and five years in the reserves.

Kossmann, ''The Low Countries'' pp 316\u201318</ref> The [[Belgian Labour Party|Belgian Workers' Party]] was founded in 1885 in Brussels. It issued the [[Charter of Quaregnon]] in 1894 calling for an end to capitalism and a thorough reorganization of society. Though, the Belgian Workers' Party was not elected to government until the late 20th century, it exerted considerable pressure on the rest of the political process, both through direct participation in politics themselves, but also through general strikes.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, [[Belgian general strikes|general strikes]] became an established aspect of the political process. Between 1892 and 1961, there were 20 major strikes, including 7 general strikes. Many of these had overtly political motives, like the [[Belgian general strike of 1893|1893 General Strike]] that helped achieve universal suffrage.\n\nOn several occasions, Belgian general strikes escalated into violence. In 1893, soldiers fired on the striking crowd, killing several. [[Karl Marx]] wrote, \"There exists but one country in the civilised world where every strike is eagerly and joyously turned into a pretext for the official massacre of the Working Class. That country of single blessedness is Belgium!\"<ref>''Marx and Engels on the Trade Unions.''

Sickness compensation was established in 1894, voluntary old-age insurance in 1900 and unemployment insurance in 1907, achieving good coverage nationwide much more quickly than its neighbours.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peter Flora &|first=Arnold J.

Outraged, the [[Belgian Labour Party]] called a General Strike; by April 17, there were more than 50,000 strikers. Violent confrontations broke out with the ''[[Garde Civique]]'' (the ''Civil Guard'' or militia) around the country, as in [[Mons]], where several strikers were killed. Violence escalated. The government soon backed down, and passed male universal suffrage but reduced its impact by creating [[Plural voting#Belgium|plural votes]] based on wealth, education and age. The Catholic conservatives, with 68% of the seats, remained in power, as the Liberals dropped to only 13% of the seats and the Socialists held their share.<ref>Els Witte, et al., ''Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards'' (2009), p. 86.</ref>\n\nAgain in [[Belgian general strike of 1902|1902]] and [[Belgian general strike of 1913|1913]] there were general strikes aimed at forcing electoral reform and ending the system of plural voting.  After the 1913 strike a commission was created and was expected to remove plural voting \u2013 but implementation was delayed by the 1914 German invasion of Belgium. In 1918, King Albert forged a post-war \"Government of National Union\" and brought about one man, one vote universal male suffrage. The last restrictions on women's voting were only lifted in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|last=Meier|first=Petra|title=Report from Belgium|url=http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Belgien.htm|publisher=European Database \u2013 Women in Decision-making|accessdate=3 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112220709/http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Belgien.htm|archive-date=12 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Culture===\nArtistic and literary culture in Belgium began a revival towards the late 19th century.

There was little investment and no settlement. However it led to a contract to supply an electric light and trolley system. In 1906, Tianjin became the first city in China with a modern public transportation system. The supply of electricity and lighting and the trolley business were profitable ventures. All the rolling stock was supplied by Belgian industries and by 1914, the network also reached nearby Austrian, French, Italian, Japanese and Russian concessions.\n\n===Ruanda-Urundi 1917\u201361===\nAfter the defeat of Germany in World War I, Belgium inherited [[League of Nations]] mandates over [[Ruanda-Urundi]].\n\nThe colony was administered in a similar way as by the former German administrators, continuing policies such as ethnic identity cards. In 1959, moves towards independence could be seen in the territory and agitation by [[PARMEHUTU]], a Hutu political party, was evident. In 1960, the [[Rwandan Revolution]] occurred and Belgium changed the appointments of chiefs and vice-chiefs to promote Hutus into the posts.\n\nRuanda-Urundi gained independence in 1962 and its two regions, [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]], separated.\n\n==World War I==\n[[File:Belgian machinegunner in 1918 guarding trench.jpg|thumb|250px|A Belgian machine gunner at the front lines in 1918, firing a [[Chauchat]] machine gun.]]\n{{see also|Belgium in World War I}}\nWhen World War I began, Germany invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg as part of the [[Schlieffen Plan]], trying to take Paris quickly. The threat to France caused Britain to enter the war; it used the 1839 agreement as justification.  The [[Belgian Army order of battle (1914)|Belgian army]] is remembered for their stubborn resistance during the early days of the war, with the army \u2013 around a tenth the size of the Germany Army \u2013 holding up the German offensive for nearly a month, giving the French and British forces time to prepare for the [[First Battle of the Marne|Marne counteroffensive]] later in the year. The German invaders treated any resistance\u2014such as sabotaging rail lines\u2014as illegal and subversive, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation.\n\nBelgium had a prosperous economy in 1914 at the start of the war but after four years of occupation, it emerged in a poor state; although Belgium itself had suffered few deaths. The Germans had \"brutally and efficiently stripped the country bare. Machinery, spare parts, whole factories including the roofs, had disappeared eastward.

There was never a violent resistance movement, but there was a large-scale spontaneous passive resistance of refusal to work for the benefit of German victory. Belgium was heavily industrialized; while farms operated and small shops stayed open most large establishments shut down or drastically reduced their output. The faculty closed the universities; many publishers shut down their newspapers. Most Belgians \"turned the four war years into a long and extremely dull vacation,\" says Kossmann.<ref>Kossmann, p 525</ref>  In 1916 Germany shipped 120,000 men and boys to work in Germany; this set off a storm of protest from neutral countries and they were returned.

Hoover's [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]] (CRB) had the permission of Germany and the Allies.<ref>David Burner, ''Herbert Hoover: A Public Life'' (1996) p. 74.</ref> As chairman of the CRB, Hoover worked with the leader of the Belgian ''[[Comit\u00e9 National de Secours et d'Alimentation]]'' (CNSA), [[\u00c9mile Francqui]], to feed the entire nation for the duration of the war. The CRB obtained and imported millions of tons of foodstuffs for the CN to distribute, and watched over the CN to make sure the German army didn't appropriate the food. The CRB became a veritable independent republic of relief, with its own flag, navy, factories, mills, and railroads. Private donations and government grants (78%) supplied an $11-million-a-month budget.<ref>Burner, p. 79.</ref>\n\nAt its peak, the American arm, the [[American Relief Administration|ARA]] fed 10.5 million people daily. Great Britain grew reluctant to support the CRB, preferring instead to emphasize Germany's obligation to supply the relief; [[Winston Churchill]] led a military faction that considered the Belgian relief effort \"a positive military disaster.\"<ref>Burner, p. 82.</ref>\n\n==Interwar Period==\n[[File:1920 olympics poster.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Poster for the [[1920 Summer Olympics]], held at [[Antwerp]]]]\nKing [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert]] returned as a war hero, leading the victorious army and acclaimed by the population. In contrast, the government and the exiles came back discreetly.  Belgium had been devastated\u2014not so much by combat, but rather by German seizure of valuable machinery. Only 81 operable locomotives remained, out of the 3,470 available in 1914. 46 of 51 steel mills were damaged, with 26 destroyed totally. More than 100,000 houses had been destroyed, as well as more than {{convert|300000|acre|ha|order=flip}} of farmland.<ref name=\"autogenerated113\">{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium : a history|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|page=113}}</ref>\n\nWaves of popular violence accompanied liberation in November and December 1918 and the government responded through the judicial punishment of collaboration with the enemy conducted between 1919 and 1921. Shop windows were broken and houses sacked, men were harassed, and women's heads were shaved. Manufacturers who had closed their businesses sought the severe repression of those who had pursued their activities. Journalists who had boycotted and stopped writing called for harsh treatment of the newspapers that submitted to German censorship. Many people stigmatized profiteers and demanded justice. Thus in 1918, Belgium was already confronted with the problems associated with occupation that most European countries only discovered at the end of World War II.<ref>Laurence VanYpersele, and Xavier Rousseaux, \"Leaving the War: Popular Violence and Judicial Repression of 'Unpatriotic' Behaviour in Belgium (1918\u20131921).''

The [[1920 Summer Olympics|first postwar Olympic Games]] were held in Antwerp in 1920. In 1921, [[Luxembourg]] formed a customs union with Belgium.\n\n===Reparations===\nGerman reparations to Belgium for damage incurred during the [[First World War]] was set at \u00a312.5 billion [[pounds sterling]].\nIn 1919 under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] the area of [[Eupen-Malmedy]], along with [[Moresnet]] was transferred to Belgium. \"[[Neutral Moresnet]]\" was transferred to Belgium, as well as the [[Vennbahn]] railway. An opportunity was given to the population to \"oppose\" against the transfer by signing a petition, which gathered few signatures, in large part thanks to intimidation by local authorities, and all regions remain part of Belgium today.\n\nBelgian requests to annex territory considered as historically theirs, from the Dutch, who were perceived as collaborators, was denied.<ref name=\"autogenerated113\"/>\n\nBetween 1923 and 1926, Belgian and French soldiers were sent to the [[Ruhr]] in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] to force the German government to agree to continue reparation payments. The [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] led the [[Dawes Plan]] which allowed the German government more leniency in paying reparations.\n\nThe League of Nations in 1925 made Belgium the trustee for the former [[German East Africa]] which bordered the Belgian Congo to the east. It became [[Rwanda-Urundi]] (or \"Ruanda-Urundi\") (modern day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]).<ref>William Roger Louis, ''Ruanda-Urundi 1884\u20131919'' (Oxford U.P., 1963).</ref> Although promising the League it would promote education, Belgium left the task to subsidised Catholic missions and unsubsidised Protestant missions. As late as 1962, when independence arrived, fewer than 100 natives had gone beyond secondary school. The policy was one of low-cost paternalism, as explained by Belgium's special representative to the Trusteeship Council: \"The real work is to change the African in his essence, to transform his soul, [and] to do that one must love him and enjoy having daily contact with him. He must be cured of his thoughtlessness, he must accustom himself to living in society, he must overcome his inertia.\"<ref>Mary T.

[[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]]'s first surrealist painting, ''The Lost Jockey'', appeared in 1926. [[Paul Delvaux]] was also an extremely influential painter in this genre.\n\n[[Franco-Belgian comics|Comic strips]] became extremely popular in Belgium during the 1930s. One of the most popular comics of the 20th century, [[Herg\u00e9]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' first appeared in 1929. The growth of comic strips was also accompanied by a popular art movement, exemplified by [[Edgar P. Jacobs]], [[Jij\u00e9]], [[Willy Vandersteen]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Franquin]].\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-127-0362-14, Belgien, belgischer Panzer T13.jpg|thumb|German soldiers examine an abandoned Belgian [[Belgian combat vehicles of World War II#The T-13 Models B1, B2, and B3|T13 Tank]], 1940]]\n{{main|Belgium in World War II}}\nBelgium tried to pursue a policy of unaligned neutrality before the war, but on May 10, 1940 the country was [[Battle of Belgium|invaded by German forces]]. In the initial attacks, the fortifications which had been constructed to protect the borders like [[Fort Eben-Emael]] and the [[K-W Line]] were captured or bypassed by German forces. On May 28, after 18 days of fighting, Belgian forces (including the commander in chief, [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]])<ref>''Chronicle of the 20th Century''; editors: Derrik Mercer [et al.] London: Dorling Kindersley {{ISBN|0-7513-3006-X}}; pp. 529\u201331</ref> surrendered.

The Brigade Piron was involved in the [[D-Day|Normandy Invasion]] and the battles in France and the Netherlands until liberation. Belgians also served in British special forces units during the war, forming a troop of [[No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando#No. 4 Belgian Troop|No.10 Commando]] which was heavily involved in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] and [[Operation Infatuate|Landings on Walcheren]]. The [[5th Special Air Service]] (SAS) was entirely made up of Belgians.\n\nTwo Belgian squadrons, amounting to over 400 pilots, served in the [[Royal Air Force]] during the war, both [[349th Squadron (Belgium)|349]] and [[350th Squadron (Belgium)|350 Squadrons]], which claimed over 50 'kills'.<ref>J. Lee Ready, Jefferson: McFarland, ''Forgotten Allies'' (Vol.1), (1985) pp.254</ref>\n\nTwo [[Corvettes]] and a group of [[Minesweeper (ship)|Minesweeper]]s were also operated by the Belgians during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], comprising some 350 men in 1943<ref>Nigel Thomas ''Foreign Volunteers of the Allied Forces: 1939\u201345'' (Osprey, 1998) pp. 17</ref>\n\nA significant contribution was made by the [[Belgian Congo]]. Congolese soldiers of the [[Force Publique]] were involved in fighting with Italian forces during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. Congolese soldiers also served in the Middle East and Burma. The Congo was also a vitally important economic asset to the allied powers, particularly through its exports of rubber and uranium; in fact the uranium used during the [[Manhattan Project]] \u2013 including that used for the atomic bombs dropped on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] was supplied by the Belgian firm [[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]] from [[Katanga Province]] in the Belgian Congo.\n\n===Occupation 1940\u201344===\n[[File:Breendonk046.jpg|thumb|right|The gallow at [[Fort Breendonk|Breendonk Concentration Camp]], near [[Mechelen]]]]\n:''See also [[Belgium in World War II]], [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|Military Government]] and [[History of the Jews in Belgium#Holocaust|The Holocaust in Belgium]]''\nBelgium was run by a Germany military government between its surrender and liberation in September 1944.\n\nThe former fort at [[Fort Breendonk|Breendonk]], near [[Mechelen]] was requisitioned by the Nazis and used for detainment and interrogation of Jews, political prisoners and captured members of the resistance.

Of these, 46 percent were deported from the [[Mechelen transit camp]], while a further 5,034 people were deported via the Drancy internment camp (close to Paris). From the summer of 1942 until 1944, twenty-eight transports left Belgium carrying 25,257 Jews and 351 Roma to eastern Europe. Their destination was often [[Auschwitz]] Death Camp. Over the course of the war, 25,257 Jews were transported (including 5,093 children) and 352 Roma over the Mechelen-Leuven railway to concentration camps. Only 1,205 returned home alive at the end of the war.\n\n===Resistance===\n:''See also [[Belgian Resistance]] and [[Comit\u00e9 de D\u00e9fense des Juifs|CDJ]]''\nResistance against the German occupiers of Belgium can be seen at all levels and from all quarters of the political spectrum, but was highly fragmented. The [[Pierlot IV Government|Government in Exile]] dealt with resistance collectively under the name ''Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te'', however this was just a broad name for the many resistance organisations which existed. Some organisations were very left-wing, like the Communist ''[[Front de l'Ind\u00e9pendance]]'', but there was also a far-right resistance movement, the ''L\u00e9gion Belge'' which comprised dissident [[Rexism|Rexists]]. However, there were also other groups like ''Groupe G'' which had no obvious political affiliation.\n\nResistance to the occupiers chiefly came in the form of helping allied airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this, for instance the [[Comet line]] which evacuated an estimated 14,000 allied airmen to [[Gibraltar]].<ref>John Nichol and Tony Rennell, ''Home Run: Escape from Nazi Europe'' (Penguin, 2007) pp.470</ref> Sabotage was also used, and ''Group G's'' activities alone are estimated to have cost the Nazis 20 million man-hours of labor to repair damages done.<ref>Miller, Russell. The Resistance: WWII Time Life Education (1979)</ref> The resistance were also instrumental in saving Jews and Roma from deportation to death camps, for instance the attack on the ''[[Twentieth convoy]]'' to [[Auschwitz]] Death Camp.There was also significant low-level resistance, for instance in June 1941, the [[City of Brussels|City Council of Brussels]] refused to distribute [[Yellow badge|Stars of David badges]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Museum van Deportatie en Verzet|url=http://www.cicb.be|accessdate=3 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226071856/http://www.cicb.be/|archivedate=26 February 2011}}</ref> Many Belgians also hid Jews and political dissidents during the occupation, with one estimate putting the number at some 20,000 people.<ref>The number provided by the Museum van Deportatie en Verzet ({{cite web|title=Museum van Deportatie en Verzet|url=http://www.cicb.be|accessdate=3 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226071856/http://www.cicb.be/|archivedate=26 February 2011}}) puts the number at 20,000 Jews, including 3,000 children.

There were pro-Nazi political organizations in both Flemish and Walloon communities before and during the war. The most significant were the Flemish [[DeVlag]] and ''Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond'' ([[Flemish National Union|VNV]])  as well as the Catholic Walloon ''[[Rexism|Rexist]]'' movement. These organisations were also fundamental to encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German army. Two divisions of the [[Waffen SS]], the Flemish [[27th SS Volunteer Division Langemarck|27th SS \"Langemarck\" Division]] and the Walloon [[28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Wallonien|28th SS \"Wallonien\" Division]]. Some organisations, like [[Verdinaso]] appealed directly to Flemish separatist ideologies, though they did not become very popular.\n\nAfter the war, many of those who had collaborated \u2013 including many of the guards at [[Fort Breendonk]] \u2013 were tried, imprisoned or shot.\n\n===Allied liberation 1944\u201345===\nBelgium was liberated late in 1944 by Allied forces, including [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], and [[United States|American]] armies, including the [[1st Belgian Infantry Brigade|Brigade Piron]]. On 3 September 1944 the Welsh Guards liberated Brussels. The [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] seized [[Antwerp]] on 4 of September 1944, and the [[First Canadian Army]] began conducting combat operations around the port that same month. Antwerp became a highly prized and heavily fought-over objective because its deep-water port was necessary to keep the allied armies supplied. The [[Battle of the Scheldt]] in October 1944 was fought primarily on Dutch soil, but with the objective of opening the way for boats to Antwerp. The port city was also the ultimate objective of German armies during the [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes Offensive]]  which resulted in heavy fighting on Belgian soil during the winter of 1944\u20135.\n\nFollowing liberation, large numbers of Belgians who had remained in the country during the occupation were mobilised into the Belgian army in 57 \"Fusilier Battalions\". 100,000 Belgians were mobilised for the allies by the end of the war.\n\n==Postwar Belgium==\n\n===The \"Royal Question\"===\n{{Main|Royal Question}}\n\nImmediately after the war, [[Leopold III of Belgium|L\u00e9opold III]], who had surrendered himself to the German army in 1940, was released; however, the issue of whether he had [[treason|betrayed]] his country by surrendering, while most government ministers had escaped to the United Kingdom, presented an important constitutional dilemma. In particular, the Belgian public was concerned that he might be a collaborator with the Nazis. He had met [[Hitler]] in [[Berchtesgaden]] on November 19, 1940 and had even remarried (to [[Lilian Baels]]) during the war. Many Belgians, especially the Socialists, strongly opposed his return to power. He was kept in exile in Switzerland until 1950, while his brother [[Prince Charles of Belgium|Prince Charles]] presided as regent.\n\nA referendum was proposed in 1950 to solve the problem. However, it produced a very close result. In [[Flanders]], the electorate voted 70% in favour (\"Yes\") of his return but [[Wallonia]] voted 58% against. Brussels also returned a 51% \"No\" vote. Although the referendum narrowly produced a favourable result for L\u00e9opold (about 57.68% in the country as a whole), the militant socialist movement in Li\u00e8ge, Hainaut and other urban centres incited major protests and even called a [[General strike against Leopold III of Belgium|General Strike]] against his return.\n\nBecause of the possibility that the situation might escalate even further, L\u00e9opold III abdicated on July 16, 1951, in favour of his 20-year-old son [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin]].\n\n===Occupation of Germany, Korean War and EDC===\n[[File:Belgische Strijdkrachten Duitsland.gif|thumb|right|Map showing the area of [[West Germany]] occupied by Belgian forces after the Second World War, known as FBA-BSD]]\nAfter the defeat of Germany in 1945, Belgian soldiers were assigned to occupy a section of [[West Germany]], known as ''[[Belgian Forces in Germany]]'' or FBA-BSD.

Though the planned EDC was never actually realised, it was still responsible for a major re-organisation of the Belgian army along [[US Army]] lines. Belgium was also involved in [[NATO]].\n\nIn 1950, a unit of volunteers from the Belgian army was sent to fight for the [[United Nations]] in the [[Korean War]] against [[Chinese People's Volunteers|Chinese]] and [[North Korea]]n troops. The [[Belgian United Nations Command]] (or BUNC) arrived in Korea in early 1951, and fought at several key engagements of the conflict, including at the [[Battle of the Imjin River]], [[Battle of Haktang-ni|Haktang-ni]] and [[Battle of Chatkol|Chatkol]].

The [[Benelux Parliament]] was created in 1955.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Brussels]], signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, is considered the precursor to the [[NATO]] agreement, which Belgium became an official member of on April 4, 1949.

A central goal of the ERP was to promote the growth of productivity along the lines of American management and labor practices. Obstacles arose which clearly limited its impact. The interest among some Belgian employers in increasing rates of productivity per worker was motivated by the rise in wage levels. But the Americans also intended to inject a new \"spirit of productivity\" in Belgian industries, which implied, among other measures, a reinforcement of structures of corporatist negotiation between the social partners at a local level. The ambitions of the American strategy therefore extended beyond the defined goal of introducing a [[Fordism|Fordist]] type of economic system with high wages, high productivity, and low prices to consumers. After the belated establishment of the Belgian Office for the Increase of Productivity in 1952, the political character of the program became apparent. By incorporating American management principles, while at the same time decoding them and adapting them to the national situation, Belgian employers' organizations and trade unions skillfully exploited their position as intermediaries in order to appropriate the \"modernist\" label that they advocated. The \"policy of productivity\" was successful for a certain time because it matched the contours of the evolution of social reforms in Belgium. This policy success, however, was rendered impotent by the failure of the economic dimension of the productivity campaigns. The Americans had in effect failed to recognize the structural importance of the major financial groups which dominated heavy industry in Belgium. By not adopting the American notions of productivity, and more generally by not carrying out any large-scale programs of innovation and investment in the key sectors that they controlled in the aftermath of the war, these holding companies greatly restricted the scope for American influence.  Consequently, it was by other means, such as the training of managers, that the American paradigms entered into Belgian economic culture.<ref>Kenneth Bertrams, \"Productivite Economique et Paix Sociale au sein du Plan Marshall: Les Limites de l'influence Americaine aupres des Industriels et Syndicats Belges, 1948\u20131960,\"  [Economic Productivity and Social Peace Within the Marshall Plan: the Limits of American Influence on Belgian Industrialists and Trade Unionists, 1948\u201360].

Issn: 0771-6435</ref>\n\n====Growth and poverty====\nDuring the period 1945\u20131975, [[Keynesian]] economic theory guided politicians throughout Western Europe and this was particularly influential in Belgium. After the war, the government cancelled Belgium's debts. It was during this period that the well-known Belgian highways were built. In addition, both the economy and the average standard of living rose significantly. As noted by [[Robert Gildea]], \"Social and economic policy was designed to restore liberal capitalism tempered by social reform, as prepared for during the war. Trade unions were also involved in a price and wage policy to cut inflation and this, together with the Allied use of Antwerp as the main entry point for war supplies, produced the so-called Belgian miracle of high economic growth combined with high wages.\"<ref>Surviving Hitler and Mussolini: daily life in occupied Europe by Robert Gildea</ref> According to one study, Belgian workers by 1961 earned wages \u201csecond only to those of the French in the Common Market area,\u201d and earned 50% more than their Italian counterparts and 40% more than their Dutch counterparts.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1961/xx/belgium.htm | title=Tony Cliff: Belgium \u2013 strike to revolution? (Spring 1961)}}</ref>\n\nDespite postwar affluence, however, many Belgians continued to live in poverty. An organisation of several poverty action groups, known as the National Action for Security of Subsistence, claimed that more than 900,000 Belgians (about 10% of the population) lived in poverty in 1967, while in the early Seventies, a group of social scientists called the Working Group on Alternative Economics estimated that about 14.5% of the Belgian population lived in poverty.<ref>Victor George and Roger Lawson, eds. ''Poverty and Inequality in Common Market Countries'' (1980)</ref>\n\nIn the sphere of economics, World War II marks a turning point. Because Flanders had been widely devastated during the war and had been largely agricultural since the Belgian uprising, it benefited most from the Marshall Plan. Its standing as an economically backward agricultural region meant that it obtained support from Belgium's membership of the [[History of the European Union#The three communities|European Union]] and its predecessors. At the same time, Wallonia experienced a slow relative decline as the products of its mines and mills came to be less in demand. The economic balance between the two parts of the country has remained less in favour of Wallonia than it was before 1939.\n\n===The Second ''\"School War\"'' 1950\u201359===\n{{main|Second School War}}\nAfter victory in the 1950 elections, a [[Christian Social Party (Belgium, defunct)|Christian Social Party]] (PSC-CVP) government came to power in Belgium. The new education minister, [[Pierre Harmel]] increased the wages of teachers in private (Catholic) schools and introduced laws linking the subsidies for private schools to the number of pupils. These measures were perceived by the anti-clerical [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]] and [[Belgian Socialist Party|Socialists]] as a \"declaration of war\".\n\nWhen the 1954 elections brought to power a coalition of [[Belgian Socialist Party|Socialists]] and [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]], the new Education Minister, [[Leo Collard]], immediately set out to reverse the measures taken by his predecessor, founding a large number of secular schools and only permitting teachers with a diploma, forcing many priests out of the profession. These measures sparked mass protests from the Catholic bloc. A compromise was eventually found by the next government (a Catholic minority led by [[Gaston Eyskens]]), and the ''\"Schools War\"'' was concluded by the November 6, 1958 \"School Pact\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Michel|first=ARIES ....

In June 1960, the [[Belgian Congo]] was replaced by the short lived [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|First Republic of Congo]], led by the democratically elected and charismatic Congolese statesman [[Patrice Lumumba]], a former political prisoner. Belgian forces withdrew, leaving the military force, the [[Force Publique]], under Congo's control. Order broke down as mutinying soldiers attacked whites who remained in the country. Belgians forces were briefly sent in to evacuate Belgian nationals and army officers.\n\nIn July 1960, the southern state of [[Katanga Province]] declared its independence, forming the [[State of Katanga]]. Katanga's bid for sovereignty was supported by Belgian mining companies and soldiers, who had considerable assets in the area. Later that month, [[United Nations]] peacekeepers were deployed to the country. During this period of anarchy, the region of [[South Kasai]] also declared independence. Faced with the possibility that the [[Soviet Union]] would attempt to use the situation to install a sympathetic regime, western powers including Belgium, supported [[Joseph Mobutu]] who installed his own, right-wing regime in the Congo. Lumumba was murdered and civil war ensued. Belgian paratroopers were again deployed to the country, this time to rescue civilian hostages captured in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] during an operation known as ''[[Operation Dragon Rouge|Dragon Rouge]]''.  At the end Mobutu emerged as the ruler of the re-unified country, which he named [[Zaire]].\n\n===The General Strike of 1960\u201361===\n[[File:Metingue Brussele1960a.jpg|thumb|Walloon workers demonstration in Brussels in the winter of 1960]]\n:''See also [[1960\u20131961 Winter General Strike]]''\nIn December 1960, Wallonia was gripped by a general strike in response the general decline of Wallonian manufacturing but it succeeded only in Wallonia, in a period of turbulence in the aftermath of the ''Second Schools War''. The Wallonian workers demanded federalism, in addition to structural reforms. Even though the strike had been intended to be nationwide, Flemish workers appeared reluctant to support it.\n\nThe [[1960-1961 Winter General Strike|Strike]] was led by [[Andr\u00e9 Renard]], the founder of \"[[Renardism]]\" which combined militant socialism with Walloon nationalism. The historian Ren\u00e9e Fox described Wallonia's alienation:\n\n<blockquote>At the beginning of the 1960s (...), a major reversal in the relationship between Flanders and Wallonia was taking place. Flanders had entered a vigorous, post\u2013World War II period of industrialization, and a significant percentage of the foreign capital (particularly from the United States, coming into Belgium to support new industries, was being invested in Flanders. In contrast, Wallonia's coal mines and time-worn steel plants and factories were in crisis. The region had lost thousands of jobs and much investment capital. A new Dutch-speaking, upwardly mobile \"populist bourgeoisie\" was not only becoming visible and vocal in Flemish movements but also in both the local and national policy...  [The strike of December 1960 against the austerity law of [[Gaston Eyskens]] ] was replaced by a collective expression of the frustrations, anxieties, and grievances that Wallonia was experiencing in response to its altered situation, and by the demands of the newly formed [[Walloon Movement#Independentism|Walloon Popular Movement]] for...regional autonomy for Wallonia...<ref>Ren\u00e9e C. Fox, ''In the Belgian Ch\u00e2teau'', Ivan R.Dee, Chicago, page 13,  1994 {{ISBN|1-56663-057-6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNationwide the economy was generally healthy with an annual growth rate of 5% in the 1960s. However old inefficient factories were being shut down in textiles and leather goods. Coal miners were angered by the closure of used-up mines. Limburg miners at the Zwartberg mine rioted in 1966 to protest its closure. Two miners were killed by police and ten were injured, while nineteen policemen were hurt.<ref>{{cite book|author=Els Witte and Alain Meynen|title=Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4Em8G76kbkC&pg=PA280|year=2009|publisher=Asp / Vubpress / Upa|page=280|isbn=9789054875178}}</ref> In 1973 a series of worldwide crises adversely affected the Belgian economy.\n\n===The \"Linguistic Wars\"===\n{{Main|Flemish Movement}}\nThis Flemish resurgence has been accompanied by a corresponding shift of political power to the Flemish, who constituted the majority of the population of around 60%.

The government of [[Paul Vanden Boeynants]] fell over the issue in 1968.\n\n===The rise of the federal state===\n[[File:Flag of Flanders.svg|thumb|The flag of [[Flanders]] incorporating the Flemish lion, also used by the [[Flemish Movement]].]]\n{{Main|State reform in Belgium}}\nThe successive linguistic disputes have made the successive Belgian governments very unstable. The three major parties (Liberal -right wing-, Catholic -center- and, Socialist -left wing-) all split in two according to their French- or Dutch-speaking electorate. A language border was determined by the first Gilson Act of November 8, 1962. The boundaries of certain [[provinces]], [[arrondissements]] and [[municipalities]] were modified (among others, [[Mouscron]] became a part of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and [[Voeren]] became a part of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]) and [[Municipalities with language facilities|facilities]] for linguistic minorities were introduced in 25 municipalities. On August 2, 1963, the second Gilson Act entered into force, fixing the division of Belgium into four language areas: a Dutch, a French and a German language area, with [[Brussels]] as a bilingual area.\n\nIn 1970, there was a first state reform, which resulted in the establishment of three cultural communities: the Dutch Cultural Community, the French Cultural Community and the German Cultural Community. This reform was a response to the [[Flanders|Flemish]] demand for cultural autonomy. The constitutional revision of 1970 also laid the foundations for the establishment of three [[Communities and regions of Belgium|Regions]], which was a response to the demand of the [[Wallonia|Walloons]] and the French-speaking inhabitants of [[Brussels Capital Region|Brussels]] for economic autonomy. On February 18, 1970, [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Gaston Eyskens]] announces the end of \"La Belgique de papa\".\n\nThe second state reform took place in 1980, when the cultural communities became [[Communities and regions of Belgium|Communities]]. The Communities assumed the competencies of the cultural communities with regard to cultural matters, and became responsible for the 'matters relating to the person', such as health and youth policy. From then on, these three Communities were known as the [[Flemish Community]], the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]]. Two Regions were established as well in 1980: the [[Flemish Region]] and the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]]. However, in Flanders it was decided in 1980 to immediately merge the institutions of the Community and the Region. Although the creation of a Brussels Region was provided for in 1970, the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] was not established until the third state reform.\n\nDuring the third state reform in 1988 and 1989, under [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Wilfried Martens]], the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] was established with its own regional institutions, as well as [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[French language|French]] institutions for community matters. The Brussels-Capital Region remained limited to 19 municipalities. Other changes included that the competencies of the Communities and Regions were expanded. One notable responsibility that was transferred to the Communities during the third state reform was education.\n\n[[File:Belgium province Brabant.png|thumb|right|Map showing the division of [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]] into [[Flemish Brabant]] (yellow), [[Walloon Brabant]] (red) and the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]] (orange) in 1995]]\n\nThe fourth state reform, which took place in 1993 under Prime Minister [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]], consolidated the previous state reforms and turned Belgium into a fully-fledged federal state. The first article of the [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian Constitution]] was amended to read as follows, \u201cBelgium is a Federal State which consists of Communities and Regions\u201d. During the fourth state reform, the responsibilities of the Communities and the Regions were expanded again, their resources were increased and they were given more fiscal responsibilities. Other major changes included the direct election of the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions, the splitting up of the [[Province of Brabant]] into [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Walloon Brabant]], and the reformation of the [[Federal Parliament of Belgium|Federal Parliament's]] [[bicameralism|bicameral]] system and the relations between the Federal Parliament and the [[Belgian Federal Government|Federal Government]]. The first direct elections for the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions took place on May 21, 1995.\n\nHowever, the fourth state reform was not the end of the process of federalization. In 2001, a fifth state reform took place,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=indexDisplay.jsp&event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&pageid=contentPage&docId=42152.0 | title = Belgium.be | accessdate = 1 November 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184522/http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=indexDisplay.jsp&event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&pageid=contentPage&docId=42152.0 | archive-date = 30 September 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref> under Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]], with the Lambermont and the Lombard Accords. In the course of that reform, more powers were transferred to the Communities and the Regions, with regard to agriculture, fisheries, foreign trade, development cooperation, auditing of electoral expenses and the supplementary financing of the political parties. The Regions became responsible for twelve regional taxes, and local and provincial government became a matter for the Regions. The first municipal and provincial elections under the supervision of the Regions were the [[Belgian municipal elections, 2006|2006 municipal elections]]. The functioning of the Brussels institutions was also amended during the fifth state reform, which resulted among other things in a guaranteed representation of the Flemish inhabitants of Brussels in the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]].\n\nAt the end of 2011, following the longest political crisis in Belgium's contemporary history, a constitutional accord between the four main political families (socialists, liberals, social-Christians, ecologists), but excluding the Flemish nationalists, ushered in the [[Sixth Belgian state reform|sixth state reform]] which provided for major institutional changes and additional transfers of competences from the federal level to the Communities and the Regions. Among other changes, the Senate ceased to be directly elected to become an assembly of regional parliaments, the Brussels-Capital Region was granted constitutive autonomy, and the Regions received economic, employment and family welfare competences as well as greater fiscal autonomy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/country/history/belgium_from_1830/formation_federal_state/sixth_state_reform/ | title=Sixth State Reform| date=2013-06-05}}</ref>\n\nBelgium was one of the founders of the European [[European Economic Community|Common Market]].

They wrote dissertations using the critical approach to particular historical problems. This development was sponsored by [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium]] and reflected Enlightenment influences\u2014such as that of [[Voltaire]]\u2014in exploring the history of the people. They pondered questions of causality. Their goal was building the blocks for a general history of the Austrian Netherlands, thus marking an important step toward the creation of a Belgian national history.<ref>Tom Verschaffel, \"The modernization of historiography in 18th-century Belgium,\" ''History of European Ideas'' (2005) 31#2 pp 135\u2013146</ref>\n\nSince Belgium became an independent nation only in 1830, defining nationhood was a special issue for the historians of the late 19th century.  The usual European solutions which defined nationhood in terms of language would not work.  The Romantic Joseph-Jean de Smet portrayed his country as a \"phoenix\" (a reference to the great bird that rose from the dead.)  The challenge of defining the nation's past and present in the face of Dutch, Spanish, Austrian, French, and German influences posed a central problem.  Defending the boundaries of Belgium (especially why Flanders should not be in the Netherlands) was another issue that preoccupied historical writers such as Pirenne.<ref>Jo Tollebeek, \"Historical representation and the nation-state in romantic Belgium (1830\u20131850),\" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1998) 59#2 pp 329\u201353 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3653979 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe medievalist Godefroid Kurth (1847\u20131916) was a student of Germany's famous professor [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Kurth introduced Ranke's advanced scholarly methods in his seminar at the Universite de Li\u00e8ge. Belgian historiography achieved international stature in the early 20th century with the work of medievalist [[Henri Pirenne]] (1862\u20131935).<ref>Jo Tollebeek, \"At the crossroads of nationalism: Huizinga, Pirenne and the Low Countries in Europe,\" ''European Review of History'' (2010) 17#2 pp 187\u2013215.</ref>\n\nHistoriography at [[Ghent University]] was pioneered by medievalists, especially Hubert Van Houtte. After 1945 [[Charles Verlinden]] introduced the methods of the French [[Annales School]] of social history. Research topics at Ghent included colonial and maritime history, the history of prices and wages, agrarian history, business history, and the textile industry. In the 1970 and 1980s came a broadening to such topics as historical demography; living standards and lifestyles; beggary and crime; and the history of culture and mind-sets.<ref>Hugo Soly, \"Honderd Jaar Geschiedenis van de Nieuwe Tijd Aan de Universiteit Gent: De Dynamiek van een Selectief En Kritisch Eclectisme,\" [One hundred years of modern history at the University of Ghent: the dynamics of a selective and critical eclecticism], ''Handelingen der Maatschappij voor Geschiedenis en Oudheidkunde te Gent'' (2006), Vol. 60, pp 49\u201362.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[BELvue Museum]] \u2013 a Brussels museum tracing the history of Belgium from 1830 until the present.\n* [[History of Flanders]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Belgium]]\n* [[History of Wallonia]]\n* [[List of Belgian monarchs]]\n**[[Family tree of Belgian monarchs]]\n* [[List of World Heritage Sites in Belgium]]\n* [[Politics of Belgium]]\n** [[Politics of Flanders]]\n** [[Politics of Wallonia]]\n* [[Timeline of Belgian history]]\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n*{{StateDept}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Reference and surveys===\n* ''Encyclop\u00e9die du Mouvement wallon,'' 3 vol., Charleroi, 2000. {{ISBN|2-87035-017-1}}\n* Arblaster, Paul.

For most of its history, what is now [[Belgium]] was either a part of a larger territory, such as the [[Carolingian Empire]], or divided into a number of smaller states, prominent among them being the [[Duchy of Brabant]], the [[County of Flanders]], the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] and [[County of Luxembourg]]. Due to its strategic location and the many armies fighting on its soil Belgium has often been called the \"battlefield of Europe\" or the \"[[Cockfight|cockpit]] of Europe\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Bindeshwar|last=Patak|title=Glimpses of Europe: A Crucible of Winning Ideas, Great Civilizations and Bloodiest Wars|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MPMkaHfHLRgC&pg=PA565&dq=%22battlefield+of+Europe%22+%22cockpit+of+europe%22#v=onepage&q=%22battlefield%20of%20Europe%22%20%22cockpit%20of%20europe%22&f=false|year=2010|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|page=565|isbn=9788178358314}}</ref> It is also remarkable as a European nation which contains, and is divided by, a [[language boundary]] between [[Romance languages|Latin-derived]] [[French language|French]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[Dutch language|Dutch]].\n\nBelgium's modern shape can be partly traced back at least as far as the \"[[Seventeen Provinces]]\" within the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. These lands straddled the ancient boundary of the [[Scheldt]] that had divided medieval France and Germany, but they were brought together under the [[House of Valois-Burgundy]], and unified into one autonomous territory by their heir [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], in his [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]]. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) later led to the split between a northern [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Southern Netherlands]] from which Belgium and Luxembourg developed. This southern territory continued to be ruled by the [[Habsburg]] descendants of the Burgundian house, at first as the \"Spanish Netherlands\". Invasions from France under [[Louis XIV]] led to the loss of what is now [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] to France, while the remainder finally became the \"Austrian Netherlands\". The [[French Revolutionary wars]] led to Belgium becoming part of France in 1795, bringing the end of the semi-independence of areas which had belonged to the Catholic church. After the defeat of the French in 1814, a new [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was created, which eventually split one more time during the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830\u20131839, giving three modern nations, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.\n\nThe ports and textile industry of Belgium were important back into the Middle Ages, and modern Belgium was one of the first countries to experience an [[Industrial Revolution]], which brought prosperity in the 19th century but also opened a political dichotomy between liberal businessmen and socialist workers. The king set up his own private colonial empire in the [[Belgian Congo]], which the government took over after a major scandal in 1908. Belgium was neutral but its strategic location as a pathway to France made it an invasion target for Germany in 1914 and 1940. Conditions under the occupation were severe. In the postwar period Belgium was a leader in European unification, as a founding member of what has become the [[European Union]]. [[Brussels]] is now host to the headquarters of [[NATO]] and is the ''de facto'' capital of the European Union. The colonies became independent in the early 1960s.\n\nPolitically the country was once polarized on matters of religion and, in recent decades, it has faced new divisions over [[culture of Belgium|differences of language]] and [[economy of Belgium|unequal economic development]]. This ongoing antagonism has caused [[state reform in Belgium|far-reaching reforms since the 1970s]], changing the formerly unitary Belgian state into a federal state, and repeated governmental crises. It is now divided into three regions: [[Flanders]]  (Dutch-speaking) in the north, [[Wallonia]] (French-speaking) in the south, and bilingual Brussels in the middle. There is also a German-speaking population along the border with Germany that was granted to [[Prussia]] in the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 but added to Belgium following the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] following World War I. German is the third official language of Belgium.\n\n==Names==\nBelgium was a name chosen when the modern country was created, but it has a long history. It is originally a classical name, used by Julius Caesar, which continued to be used occasionally in different ways until the creation of the modern country. However, while Caesar described the Belgian part of Gaul as a larger area, much bigger than modern Belgium, including large parts of modern France, Germany and the Netherlands, he only used the term \"Belgium\" to refer to a smaller core area now in Northern France, where the tribes ruling the Belgian military alliance lived. Under Roman rule this region was the basis of the province of ''Belgica Secunda'', which stretched into the coastal Flemish part of modern Belgium. \n\nIn late Roman and medieval times the term Belgium tended to be used to refer to Roman ''Belgica Prima'', and its successor [[Upper Lotharingia]], in the [[Moselle]] region of Germany, Luxembourg and France. Only slowly in modern times did the old term start to be used for the area to the north of the two Roman Belgica provinces, now the Netherlands and Belgium. For example it was sometimes used as a classical name for the northern \"United Provinces\", roughly the predecessor of the modern Netherlands, after they separated from the Spanish-ruled south, roughly the predecessor of modern Belgium, in the early modern era. \n\nBelgium only began to be used exclusively for the southern part of the Netherlands when it was deliberately chosen as the new name for the new country, which broke out of the post-Waterloo kingdom of the Netherlands after a struggle which lasted from 1830 to 1839.\n\n==Before independence==\n\n===Prehistory===\n[[File:Belgian flint knives.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flint]] [[knife|knives]] discovered in Belgian caves]]\nOn Belgian territory [[Neanderthal]] fossils were discovered at [[Engis]] in 1829\u201330 and elsewhere, some dating back to at least 100,000 [[Before Common Era|BCE]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boneandstone.com/neandertal/neandertal_descriptions.html#engis |title=Descriptions of Fossil Neandertals |publisher=Bone and Stone |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest [[Neolithic]] farming technology of northern Europe, the so-called [[Linear Pottery culture|LBK culture]], reached the east of Belgium at its furthest northwesterly stretch from its origins in southeast Europe.

In the last part of the Neolithic, evidence is found for the [[Corded Ware]] and [[Bell Beaker]] cultures in the south of the Netherlands, but these cultures also do not seem to have had a big impact in all of Belgium.\n\nThe population of Belgium started to increase permanently with the late [[Bronze age]] from around 1750 BCE. Three possibly related European cultures arrived in sequence. First the [[Urnfield]] culture arrived (for example, [[tumulus|tumuli]] are found at [[Ravels]] and [[Hamont-Achel]] in the [[Campine]]). Then, coming into the [[Iron Age]], the [[Hallstatt culture]], and the [[La T\u00e8ne culture]]. All three of these are associated with [[Indo-European languages]], with specifically [[Celtic languages]] being especially associated with La T\u00e8ne material culture, and possibly Halstatt. This is because historical Greek and Roman records from areas where this culture settled show Celtic placenames and personal names.\n\nHowever it is possible in Belgium that especially in the northern areas the Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne cultures were brought by new elites, and that the main language of the population was not Celtic. From 500 BC [[Celt]]ic tribes settled in the region and traded with the [[Mediterranean]] world. From c. 150 BC, the first coins came into use, under the influence of trade with the Mediterranean.\n\n===Celtic and Roman periods===\n[[File:Belgica1.png|right|thumb|The [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Belgica]] in around 120 AD]]\n{{Main|Gallia Belgica}}\n\nWhen [[Julius Caesar]] arrived in the region, as recorded in his ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'', the inhabitants of Belgium, northwestern France, and the German Rhineland were known as the [[Belgae]] (after whom modern [[Belgium]] is named), and they were considered to be the northern part of [[Gaul]]. The region of [[Luxembourg]], including the part of the [[Luxembourg (province of Belgium)|Belgian province of Luxembourg]] around [[Arlon]], was inhabited by the [[Treveri]], who were not listed by Caesar as Belgae, although the Romans later placed them in the province of the Belgae.\n\nThe exact nature of the distinction between the Belgae to the North and the Celts to the south, and the Germani across the Rhine, is disputed.<ref name=\"Lamarcq, Danny 1996\">{{cite book|last=Lamarcq, Danny|first=Rogge, Marc|title=De Taalgrens: Van de oude tot de nieuwe Belgen|year=1996|publisher=Davidsfonds}}</ref> Caesar said that the Belgae were separated from the rest of Gaul by language, law and custom, and he also says they had Germanic ancestry, but he does not go into detail. It seems clear that Celtic culture and language were very influential upon the Belgae, especially those in modern France.

The Menapii and northern Germani lived among low thorny forests, islands and swamps, and the central Belgian Nervii lands were deliberately planted with thick hedges, in order to be impenetrable to cavalry. There is also less archaeological evidence of large settlements and trade in the area. According to [[Tacitus]], writing a generation later, the ''Germani cisrhenani'' (who included the [[Eburones]]) were in fact the original tribe to be called ''Germani'', and all other uses of the term extended from them, though in his time the same people were now called the [[Tungri]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tacitus|first=Gaius Claudius|title=Germania 2|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=2&highlight=tungrians}}</ref> Tacitus also reported that both the Treveri and Nervii claimed Germanic and Belgic kinship.\n\nModern linguists use the word \"germanic\" to refer to languages but it is not known for sure whether even the Belgian ''Germani'' spoke a [[Germanic language]], and their tribal and personal names are clearly Celtic. This is in fact also true of the possibly related tribes across the Rhine from them at this time. Archaeologists have also had difficulty finding evidence of the exact migrations from east of the Rhine which Caesar reports and more generally there has been skepticism about using him in this way due to the political motives of his commentaries. But the archaeological record gives the impression that the classical Belgian ''Germani'' were a relatively stable population going back to [[Urnfield]] times, with a more recently immigrated elite class who would have been of more interest to Caesar.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gallia Belgica|last=Wightman|first =Edith Mary|year=1985|publisher= University of California Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEyS54uSj88C|page=14|isbn=9780520052970}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tongeren Romeinse wallen.jpg|thumb|left|Surviving Roman city walls in [[Tongeren]], the former city of [[Atuatuca|Atuatuca Tongrorum]]]]\n\nThe Menapii and Nervii flourished within the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Belgica]], along with the southern Belgae and the [[Treveri]]. These Roman provinces were broken into ''civitates'', each with a capital city, and each representing one of the major tribal groups named by Caesar. At first, only one, [[Tongeren]] capital of the Tungri, was in modern Belgium. Later, the capital of the Menapii was moved from [[Cassel, Nord|Cassel]] in modern France to [[Tournai]] in Belgium. The Nervian capital was in the south of the territory in modern France, at [[Bavay]], and later moved to [[Cambrai]]. [[Trier]], the capital of the Treveri, is today in Germany, near Luxembourg.\n\nThe northeastern corner of this province, including Tongeren and the area of the earlier ''Germani'', was united with the militarized Rhine border to form a newer province known as [[Germania Inferior]].<ref name=\"Povinzen\">{{cite web | url =http://www.antikefan.de/kulturen/rom/provinzen.html | title =Povinzen | publisher =Antikefan}}</ref> Its cities included Ulpia Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]] in the modern Netherlands), Colonia Ulpia Trajana ([[Xanten]] in modern Germany) and the capital Colonia Agrippina ([[Cologne]] in Germany).<ref name=\"Povinzen\"/> Later, Emperor [[Diocletian]] restructured the provinces around 300, and split the remaining Belgica into two provinces: ''Belgica Prima'' and ''Belgica Secunda''. Belgica Prima was the eastern part and had Trier as its main city, and included part of the Belgian province of Luxembourg. It became one of the most important Roman cities in Western Europe in the 3rd century.\n\nChristianity was also first introduced to Belgium during the late-Roman period, and the first known bishop in the region [[Saint Servatius|Servatius]] taught in the middle of the Fourth century in [[Tongeren]].\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n[[File:StServatius-Treasury2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Servatius]], bishop of [[Tongeren]] and one of the first known Christian figures in the region. 16th century [[reliquary]].]]\nIn the Middle Ages, the old Roman ''civitates'' became the basis of Christian dioceses, and the row of dioceses which form the core of modern Belgium (Tournai, Cambrai, and Li\u00e8ge) were the most northerly continental areas to retain a Romanized culture. The modern Belgian language boundary derives from this period, as the area was a contact point of Frankish and Romanized populations.\n\nAs the [[Western Roman Empire]] lost power, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]s came to dominate the military, and then form kingdoms. Coastal Flanders, the old territory of the Menapii, became part of the \"[[Saxon Shore]]\". In inland northern Belgium, [[Franks]] from the Roman frontier in the Rhine delta were allowed to re-settle in [[Toxandria]] in the 4th century. Wallonia, dominated by bands of forests and poor farming land, remained more heavily Romanized, although eventually became subject to Franks in the 5th century. Franks remained important in the Roman military, and the Romanized Frankish [[Merovingian Dynasty]] eventually took over northern France. [[Clovis I]], the best-known king of this dynasty, first conquered Romanized northern France, later called [[Neustria]], then turned north to the Frankish lands later referred to as [[Austrasia]], which included all or most of Belgium. He converted to [[Catholicism]], followed by many followers. Christian missionaries preached to the populace and started a wave of [[Religious conversion|conversion]] ([[Saint Servatius]], [[Saint Remacle]], [[Saint Hadelin]]).\n\n[[File:Lage Landen (Frankische Tijd).svg|thumb|Southern part of the [[Low Countries]] with bishopry towns and abbeys c. 7th century. [[Abbey]]s were the onset to larger villages and even some towns to reshape the landscape.]]\nThe Merovingian dynasty was succeeded by the [[Carolingian dynasty]], whose family power base was in and around the eastern part of modern Belgium. After [[Charles Martel]] countered the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion from Spain (732 \u2014 Poitiers), King [[Charlemagne]] (born close to [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] in [[Herstal]] or [[Jupille]]{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}) brought a huge part of Europe under his rule and was [[Crown (headgear)|crowned]] the \"[[Emperor]] of the new [[Holy Roman Empire]]\" by the [[Pope Leo III]] (800 in [[Aachen]]).\n\nThe [[Vikings]] raided widely throughout this period, but a major settlement that had caused problems in the area of Belgium was defeated in 891 by [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] in the [[Battle of Leuven (891)|battle of Leuven]].\n\nThe Frankish lands were divided and reunified several times under the [[Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian]] dynasties, but eventually were firmly divided into [[France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The parts of the [[County of Flanders]] stretching out west of the river [[Scheldt]] (Schelde in Dutch, Escaut in French) became part of France during the Middle Ages, but the remainders of the County of Flanders and the [[Low Countries]] were part of the Holy Roman Empire, specifically they were in the [[stem duchy]] of [[Lower Lorraine|Lower Lotharingia]], which had a period as an independent kingdom.\n\nThrough the early Middle Ages, the northern part of present-day Belgium (now commonly referred to as [[Flanders]]) was a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]]-speaking area, whereas in the southern part people had continued to be Romanized and spoke derivatives of [[Vulgar Latin]].\n\nAs the Holy Roman Emperors and French Kings lost effective control of their domains in the 11th and 12th centuries, the territory more or less corresponding to the present Belgium was divided into relatively independent feudal states, including:\n*The [[County of Flanders]]\n*The [[Marquis of Namur|Marquisate of Namur]]\n*The [[Duchy of Brabant]] (see also [[Duke of Brabant]])\n*The [[County of Hainaut]]\n*The [[Duchy of Limburg]]\n*The [[County of Luxembourg]]\n*The [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] (the territory over which the bishop ruled as a lord, which was smaller than the diocese)\n\nThe coastal county of Flanders was one of the wealthiest parts of Europe in the late Middle Ages, from trading with England, France and Germany, and it became culturally important. During the 11th and 12th centuries, the [[Rheno-Mosan art|Rheno-Mosan]] or [[Mosan art]] movement flourished in the region moving its centre from [[Cologne]] and [[Trier]] to [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], [[Maastricht]] and [[Aachen]]. Some masterpieces of this [[Romanesque art]] are the [[shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral]]; the [[baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge]] by [[Renier de Huy]]; the [[Stavelot Triptych]]; the shrine of [[Saint Remacle]] in [[Stavelot]]; the shrine of [[Saint Servatius]] in Maastricht; and [[Notker of Li\u00e8ge|Notger]]'s gospel in Li\u00e8ge.\n\n===13th\u201316th centuries===\n[[File:Battle of Courtrai2.jpg|thumb|right|14th-century illustration of the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] in 1302 where forces from the [[County of Flanders]] defeated their nominal overlords of the [[Kingdom of France]].]]\nIn this period, many cities, including [[Ypres]], [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], obtained their [[City rights in the Low Countries|city charter]].

The lack of imperial protection also meant that the French and English began vying for influence in the region.\n\nIn 1214, King [[Philip II of France]] defeated the Count of Flanders in the [[Battle of Bouvines]] and forced his submission to the French crown. Through the remainder of the 13th century, French control over Flanders steadily increased until 1302 when an attempt at total annexation by Philip IV met a stunning defeat when Count Guy (who had the support of the guilds and craftsmen) rallied the townspeople and humiliated the French knights at the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]]. Undaunted, Philip launched a new campaign that ended with the inconclusive [[Battle of Mons-en-P\u00e9v\u00e8le]] in 1304. The king imposed harsh peace terms on Flanders, which included ceding the important textile-making centers of [[Lille]] and [[Douai]].\n\n[[File:Brugse metten.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bruges Matins (massacre)|Massacre of the French]] in Bruges by Flemish militia during the [[Franco-Flemish War]]]]\nThereafter, Flanders remained a French tributary until the start of the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1337. In Brabant, skillful work by the duke of that territory and the Count of Hainaut-Holland foiled various French manipulations. Paris's influence in the Low Countries was counterbalanced by England, which maintained important ties to the coastal ports.\n\nFlanders faced the difficult situation of being politically subservient to France, but also reliant on trade with England. Many craftsmen emigrated to England, which also came to dominate the wool-shipping business. Flemish cloth nonetheless remained a highly valued product, and it was highly dependent on English wool. Any interruption in the supply of that invariably resulted in riots and violence from the weavers' guilds. On the whole though, Flemish trade became a passive one. Flanders received imports from other areas of Europe, but itself purchased little abroad except wine from Spain and France. [[Bruges]] became a great commercial center after the Hanseatic League set up business there and the Italian banking houses followed suit.\n\nA few towns in the Low Countries dated back to Roman times, but most had been founded from the 9th century onward. The oldest were in the Scheldt and Meuse areas, with many towns in what's now the Netherlands being much younger and only dating from the 13th century. From early on, the Low Countries began to develop as a commercial and manufacturing center. Merchants became the dominant class in the towns, with the nobility largely limited to countryside estates.\n\n{{history Benelux states}}\n\nBy 1433 most of the Belgian and [[Luxembourg]]ish territory along with much of the rest of the [[Low Countries]] became part of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] under [[Philip the Good]]. When [[Mary of Burgundy]], granddaughter of Philip the Good married [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], the Low Countries became [[Habsburg]] territory. Their son, [[Philip I of Castile]] (Philip the Handsome) was the father of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The Holy Roman Empire was unified with [[Spain]] under the [[Habsburg]] Dynasty after Charles V inherited several domains.\n\nEspecially during the Burgundy period (the 15th and 16th centuries), [[Tournai]], [[Bruges]], [[Ypres]], [[Ghent]], [[Brussels]], and [[Antwerp]] took turns at being major European centers for commerce, industry (especially textiles) and art. Bruges was the pioneer. It had a strategic location at the crossroads of the northern [[Hanseatic League]] trade and the southern trade routes. Bruges was already included in the circuit of the Flemish and French cloth fairs at the beginning of the 13th century, but when the old system of fairs broke down the entrepreneurs of Bruges innovated. They developed, or borrowed from Italy, new forms of merchant capitalism, whereby several merchants would share the risks and profits and pool their knowledge of markets.  They employed new forms of economic exchange, including bills of exchange (i.e. promissory notes) and letters of credit.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mack|last=Ott|title=The Political Economy of Nation Building: The World's Unfinished Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJyRLypfagYC&pg=PA92|year=2012|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=92|isbn=9781412847421}}</ref>  Antwerp eagerly welcomed foreign traders, most notably the Portuguese pepper and spice traders.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herman van der Wee|title=The growth of the Antwerp market and the European economy: (fourteenth-sixteenth centuries)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bufsAAAAMAAJ|year=1963|publisher=Nijhoff|page=127}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=James Donald Tracy|title=The Rise of Merchant Empires: Long-Distance Trade in the Early Modern World, 1350\u20131750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heEdZziizrUC&pg=PA263|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=263|isbn=9780521457354}}</ref>\n\nIn art the [[Early Renaissance painting|Renaissance was represented]] by the [[Flemish Primitives]], a group of painters active primarily in the Southern Netherlands in the 15th and early 16th centuries (for example, [[Jan van Eyck|Johannes Van Eyck]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden|Rogier Van der Weyden]]), and the [[Franco-Flemish school|Franco-Flemish composers]] (e.g. [[Guillaume Dufay]]).

This comprised all of Belgium, present-day north-western France, present-day Luxembourg, and present-day Netherlands, except for the lands of the [[Prince-Bishop of Li\u00e8ge]].\n\nThe Burgundian princes from Philip II (the Bold) to Charles the Bold enhanced their political prestige with economic growth and artistic splendour. These \"Great Dukes of the West\" were effectively sovereigns, with domains extending from the Zuiderzee to the Somme. The urban and other textile industries, which had developed in the Belgian territories since the 12th century, became the economic center of northwestern Europe.\n\nThe death of Charles the Bold (1477) and the marriage of his daughter Mary to the archduke Maximilian of Austria ended the independence of the Low Countries by bringing them increasingly under the sway of the Habsburg dynasty. Mary and Maximilian\u2019s grandson Charles became king of Spain as Charles I in 1516 and Holy Roman emperor as Charles V in 1519.\n\nIn Brussels on 25 October 1555, Charles V abdicated Belgica Regia to his son, who in January 1556 assumed the throne of Spain as Philip II.\n\n===Dutch Revolt===\n{{main|Dutch Revolt}}\n{{see also|Dunkirkers}}\nThe northern part of Belgica Regia, comprising seven provinces and eventually forming the Dutch Republic, became increasingly [[Protestant]] (specifically, [[Calvinist]]), while the larger part, called 't Hof van Brabant and comprising the ten southern provinces, remained primarily Catholic.

Alba boasted that he had burned or executed 18,600 persons in the Netherlands, in addition to the far greater number he massacred during the war, many of them women and children; 8,000 persons were burned or hanged in one year, and the total number of Alba's Flemish victims can not have fallen short of 50,000.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sharp Hume |first1=Mart\u00edn Andrew |title=The Spanish People: Their Origin, Growth and Influence |page=372}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Dutch Revolt]] spread to the south in the mid-1570s after the [[Army of Flanders]] mutinied for lack of pay and went on the rampage in several cities.

The city was open to the sea, strongly fortified, and well defended under the leadership of [[Marnix van St. Aldegonde]]. Engineer Sebastian Baroccio cut off all access to the sea by constructing a [[bridge of boats]] across the [[Scheldt]]. The Dutch sailed fireships, called [[Hellburners]],{{efn|Hellburners were a special type of [[fireship]] designed by an Italian engineer, [[Federigo Giambelli]].}} against the bridge and one of the exploding infernal machines blew up a 200-foot-long span and [[Largest artificial non-nuclear explosions|killed 800 Spaniards]].

From 1659, Madrid increasingly relied on the aid of allied armies to restrain French ambitions to annex the [[Spanish Netherlands]], in which Spain showed declining interest after more than a century of war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nolan |first1=Cathal J. |title=Wars of the Age of Louis XIV, 1650-1715: An Encyclopedia of Global Warfare and Civilization |date=2008 |page=444}}</ref>\n\nUnder [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1643\u20131715), France pursued an expansionist policy, particularly affecting Belgium. France frequently held control of territories in the Southern Netherlands, confronted by various opponents including the Netherlands and Austria. There was the [[War of Devolution]] (1667\u20131668), the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672\u20131678), the [[War of the Reunions]] (1683\u20131684), and the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688\u20131697). These were then followed by the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131714).\n\nWhen [[Charles II of Spain]] died in 1700, two dynasties of foreign relatives contested for the throne, the [[House of Bourbon]], who ruled France, and the [[Habsburgs]], who were emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as well as holding various territories in central Europe. The Austrian Habsburgs were supported by an alliance led by Britain, the Dutch Republic, and several other northern European Protestant states, and the French were supported by [[Bavaria]]. Much of the war occurred on Belgian soil, with the allies there being led upon the field by John Churchill, the [[Duke of Marlborough]].\n\nAfter the victory of Austria and its allies, under the [[Treaty of Rastatt]], the Belgian and present-day Luxembourg territories (except the lands under the lordship of the Prince Bishop of Li\u00e8ge) were transferred to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]] while the Bourbon Dynasty succeeded in inheriting Spain itself. They were thus called Belgium Austriacum from 1705 to 1795.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belgium|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/59268/Belgium|publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> Louis XIV died in 1715.\n\n===Brabant Revolution===\nThe [[Brabant Revolution|Belgian Revolution]] of 1789\u201390 overlapped with the [[French Revolution]] which began in 1789. The movement called for independence from [[Austrian Netherlands|Austrian rule]]. Brabant rebels, under the command of [[Jean-Andr\u00e9 van der Mersch]], defeated the Austrians at the [[Battle of Turnhout (1789)|Battle of Turnhout]] and launched the [[United States of Belgium]] together with the Prince Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge. The new state was beset by factionalism between the radical \"[[Vonckists]]\", led by [[Jan Frans Vonck]] and the more conservative \"[[Statists (Belgium)|Statists]]\" of the [[Henri Van der Noot]]. Businessmen with widescale operations generally supported the Statists, while the Vonckists attracted small business and members of the trade guilds. They called for independence from Austria but were conservative in social and religious questions.<ref>Jacques Godechot, \"The Business Classes and the Revolution Outside France\", ''American Historical Review'' (1958) 64#1 p. 7 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1844853 in JSTOR]</ref> By November 1790, the revolt had been crushed and the Habsburg Monarchy had returned to power.<ref>Janet L.

The [[Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] was dissolved. Its territory was divided over the ''d\u00e9partements'' [[Meuse-Inf\u00e9rieure]] and [[Ourte]]. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] confirmed the loss of [[Southern Netherlands]],  by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], in 1797.\n\nThe French invaded and controlled Belgium, 1794\u20131814, imposing all their new reforms and incorporating what had been the \"Austrian Netherlands\" and the Prince-Bishopric of Liege into France. New rulers were sent in by Paris. Belgian men were drafted into the French wars and heavily taxed. Nearly everyone was Catholic, but the Church was repressed. Resistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule. The French legal system, however, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of class distinctions. Belgium now had a government bureaucracy selected by merit, but it was not at all popular.<ref>{{cite book|first= E.H.|last = Kossmann|title =The Low Countries: 1780\u20131940|date = 1978|pages =65\u201381, 101\u20132|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 9780198221081}}</ref>\n\nUntil the establishment of the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] in 1799, Catholics were heavily repressed by the French.

The plan was to join Belgium and the Netherlands, under Dutch control. Napoleon briefly returned to power during the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815, but was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], south of Brussels.\n\n====Economics====\nFrance promoted commerce and capitalism, paving the way for the ascent of the bourgeoisie and the rapid growth of manufacturing and mining.  In economics, therefore, the nobility declined while the middle class Belgian entrepreneurs flourished because of their inclusion in a large market, paving the way for Belgium's leadership role after 1815 in the [[Industrial Revolution]] on the Continent.<ref>{{cite book|first =Bernard A.|last = Cook|title =Belgium: A History |date = 2005|pages =  49\u201354|isbn = 9780820458243 }}</ref><ref>Samuel Clark, \"Nobility, Bourgeoisie and the Industrial Revolution in Belgium\",  ''Past & Present'' (1984) # 105 pp. 140\u2013175; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650548 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nGodechot finds that after the annexation, Belgium's business community supported the new regime, unlike the peasants, who remained hostile. Annexation opened new markets in France for wool and other goods from Belgium. Bankers and merchants helped finance and supply the French army. France ended the [[Barrier Treaty|prohibition against seaborne trade on the Scheldt]] that had been enforced by the Netherlands.

This was under the rule of a Protestant king, namely [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]]. Most of the small and [[ecclesiastical]] states in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were given to larger states at this time, and this included the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] which now became formally part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nThe [[enlightened despot]] William I, who reigned from 1815\u20131840, had almost unlimited constitutional power, the constitution having been written by a number of notable people chosen by him. As despot, he had no difficulty in accepting some of the changes resulting from the social transformation of the previous 25 years, including equality of all before the law. However, he resurrected the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] as a political class and elevated a large number of people to the nobility. Voting rights were still limited, and only the nobility were eligible for seats in the upper house.\n\nWilliam I was a [[Calvinist]] and intolerant of the Catholic majority in the newly created [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. He promulgated the \"Fundamental Law of Holland\", with some modifications. This entirely overthrew the old order of things in the southern Netherlands, suppressed the clergy as an order, abolished the privileges of the Catholic Church, and guaranteed equal protection to every religious creed and the enjoyment of the same civil and political rights to every subject of the king. It reflected the spirit of the French Revolution and in so doing did not please the Catholic bishops in the south, who had detested the Revolution.<ref>Kurth, Godefroid, \"Belgium\" in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02395a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907) online]</ref>\n\nWilliam I actively promoted economic modernization. His position as monarch was ambivalent, however; his sovereignty was real, but his authority was shared with a legislature elected partly by himself and partly by the wealthy citizens under a constitution granted by the king. Government was in the hands of ministries of state. The old provinces were reestablished in name only. The government was now fundamentally unitary, and all authority flowed from the center. The first 15 years of the Kingdom showed progress and prosperity, as industrialization proceeded rapidly in the south, where the [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed entrepreneurs and labor to combine in a new textile industry, powered by local coal mines. There was little industry in the northern provinces, but most overseas colonies were restored, and highly profitable trade resumed after a 25-year hiatus. Economic liberalism combined with moderate monarchical authoritarianism to accelerate the adaptation of the Netherlands to the new conditions of the 19th century. The country prospered until a crisis arose in relations with the southern provinces.\n\n====Unrest in the southern provinces====\nProtestants controlled the new country although they formed only a quarter of the population.<ref>For a religion map see [http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/kuyper.html map]</ref> In theory, Catholics had full legal equality; in practice their voice was not heard. Few Catholics held high state or military offices. The king insisted that schools in the South end their traditional teaching of Catholic doctrine, even though everyone there was Catholic.<ref>Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330\", p 86</ref> Socially, the French-speaking Walloons strongly resented the king's policy to make Dutch the language of government. There was also growing outrage at the king's insensitivity to social differences. According to [[Simon Schama|Schama]], there was growing hostility to the Dutch government whose \"initiatives were met at first with curiosity, then with apprehension and finally with fierce and unyielding hostility\".<ref>Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330\", p.&nbsp;87</ref>\n\nPolitical liberals in the south had their own grievances, especially regarding the king's authoritarian style; he seemed uncaring about the issue of regionalism, flatly vetoing a proposal for a French-language teacher-training college in francophone [[Li\u00e8ge]].  Finally, all factions in the South complained of unfair representation in the national legislature. The south was industrializing faster and was more prosperous than the north, leading to resentment of northern arrogance and political domination.\n\nThe outbreak of [[July Revolution|revolution in France]] in 1830 was used as a signal for revolt. The demand at first was autonomy for Belgium, as the southern provinces were now called. Eventually, revolutionaries began demanding total independence.<ref>J. C. H. Blom; E. Lamberts et al.

Violent street fighting soon broke out, and anarchy reigned in Brussels.  The liberal bourgeoisie, who had initially been at the forefront of the burgeoning revolution, were appalled by the violence and became willing to accept a compromise with the Dutch.<ref name=\"autogenerated60\">{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium: a history|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0820458243|pages=59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nThe revolution broke out for numerous reasons. On a political level, the Belgians felt significantly under-represented in the Netherlands' elected Lower Assembly and disliked the unpopular Prince of Orange, the future [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] who was the representative of King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] in Brussels. The French-speaking [[Walloons]] also felt ostracised in a majority Dutch speaking country. There were also significant religious grievances felt by the majority Catholic Belgians in a nation controlled by the Dutch Protestants.\n\nThe king assumed the protest would blow itself out. He waited for a surrender, announcing an amnesty for all revolutionaries, except foreigners and the leaders. When this did not succeed he sent in the army. Dutch forces were able to penetrate the [[Schaerbeek|Schaerbeek Gate]] into Brussels, but the advance was stalled in the [[Parc de Bruxelles]] under a hail of sniper fire. Royal troops elsewhere met determined resistance from revolutionaries at makeshift barricades. It is estimated that there were no more than 1,700 revolutionaries (described by the French Ambassador as an \"undisciplined rabble\"<ref name=\"autogenerated60\"/>) in Brussels at the time, faced with over 6,000 Dutch troops.  However, faced with strong opposition, Dutch troops were ordered out of the capital on the night of 26 September after three days of street fighting. There were also battles around the country as revolutionaries clashed with Dutch forces. In Antwerp, eight Dutch warships bombarded the city following its capture by revolutionary forces.\n\nBelgian independence was not allowed by the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]]; nevertheless the revolutionaries were regarded sympathetically by the major powers of Europe, especially the British. In November 1830, the [[London Conference of 1830]] or \"Belgian Congress\" (comprising delegates from Great Britain, France, Russia, Prussia and Austria) ordered an armistice on November 4. At the end of November Britain and France came up with a proposal \u2014 no military intervention and the establishment of an independent kingdom of Belgium \u2014 which was accepted by the other three more conservative participants, who had favored a military intervention to restore the absolutist regime of William I.<ref>Els Witte, \"La Construction de la Belgique 1828\u20131847\", in E.

The new kingdom would be obliged to remain neutral in foreign affairs. The British foreign secretary [[Lord Palmerston]] strongly backed the Prince of Orange as the new king, a choice which would have maintained a dynastic link between the Netherlands and the new kingdom. The Prince proved to be unacceptable to William I, his father, as well as to the French, who wanted a clear break with the Netherlands. Finally, Palmerston came up with his second choice, [[Leopold of Saxe-Coburg|Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg]] \u2014 [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]]' widower, and an admirer of the British constitutional model \u2014 who was accepted by all.<ref>Els Witte, pp. 74\u201376</ref> On July 21, 1831, the first \"King of the Belgians\" was inaugurated.

The [[Belgian National Congress]] was formed to draw up a constitution. Under the new constitution, Belgium became a sovereign, independent state with a [[constitutional monarchy]]. However, the constitution did severely limit [[suffrage|voting rights]] to the French-speaking [[bourgeoisie|haute-bourgeoisie]] and the clergy, in a country where French was not the majority language. The Catholic church was afforded a good deal of freedom from state intervention.\n\nThe state of conflict (but not open warfare) with the Netherlands lasted another eight years, but in 1839, the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] was signed between the two countries. By the treaty of 1839, the eastern part of [[Luxembourg]] did not join Belgium, but remained a possession of the Netherlands until different inheritance laws caused it to separate as an independent [[Grand Duchy]] (the western, French-speaking part of Luxembourg became the Belgian province of that name). Belgium lost Eastern [[Province of Limburg (1815\u20131839)|Limburg]], [[Zeeuws Vlaanderen]] and [[French Flanders]] and [[Eupen]]: four territories which it had claimed on historical grounds. The Netherlands retained the former two while French Flanders, which had been annexed at the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] remained in French possession, and Eupen remained within the [[German Confederation]], although it would pass to Belgium after [[World War I]] in reparations.\n\nAt the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]], Britain also made a guarantee of Belgian neutrality that would be the stated ''[[Casus belli]]'' of Britain's entry into World War I.<ref name=\"autogenerated70\">{{cite book|last=Bond|first=Brian|title=War and society in Europe, 1870\u20131970|year=1984|publisher=Fontana Paperbacks|location=London|isbn=978-0006355472|page=70}}</ref>\n\n==Independence to World War I==\n{{main|Belgium in the long nineteenth century}}\n\n===The Industrial Revolution===\n{{see also|Industrial Revolution#Belgium}}\n[[File:La coul\u00e9e \u00e0 Ougr\u00e9e.jpg|thumb|Painting of steel production in [[Ougr\u00e9e]] by the celebrated 19th century artist [[Constantin Meunier]]]]\nMost of society was highly traditional, especially in the small villages and rural areas and the quality of education was low.<ref>Simon Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" ''History of Education'' (1972) 1:1, pp 81\u201389 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0046760720010106 link]</ref> Few people expected that Belgium \u2013 seemingly a \"sluggish\" and \"culturally dormant\" bastion of traditionalism \u2013 would leap to the forefront of the industrial revolution on the Continent.<ref>Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance,'' p 83</ref> Nevertheless, Belgium was the second country, after Britain, in which the industrial revolution took place.

The availability of cheap coal was a main factor that attracted entrepreneurs.

The leader was a transplanted Englishman [[John Cockerill (industrialist)|John Cockerill]].

Coal was sold to local mills and railways as well as to France and Prussia.\n\nThe textile industry, based on cotton and flax, employed about half of the industrial workforce for much of the industrial period. [[Ghent]] was the premier industrial city in Belgium until the 1880s, when the center of growth moved to [[Li\u00e8ge]], with its steel industry.<ref>Carl Strikwerda, ''A house divided: Catholics, Socialists, and Flemish nationalists in nineteenth-century Belgium''  (1997) p 44-46</ref>\n\nWallonia had rich coalfields over much of its area, and the highly folded nature of coal seams meant that it could be found at relatively shallow depths. Deep mines were not required at first so there were a large number of small operations. There was a complex legal system for concessions, often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper (thanks to the innovation of steam pumping). In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was 220 meters. By 1856, the average depth in the area west of [[Mons]] was 361, and in 1866, 437 meters and some pits had reached down 700 and 900 meters; one was 1,065 meters deep, probably the deepest coal mine in Europe at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted and the steel industry was importing some coal from the Ruhr.<ref>Norman Pounds and William Parker, ''Coal and steel in Western Europe'' (1957) ch 5</ref>\n\nCheap and readily available coal attracted firms producing metals and glass, both of which required considerable amounts of coal, and so regions around coal fields became highly industrialised. The ''[[Sillon industriel]]'' (''Industrial Valley''), and in particular the ''[[Pays Noir]]'' around [[Charleroi]], were the centre of the steel industry until the Second World War.\n\n====Railways====\n[[File:Stoomloc Le Belge.jpg|thumb|right|The first Belgian-produced steam locomotive, ''\"The Belgian\"'' ([[Le Belge (locomotive)|\"''Le Belge''\"]]) built in 1835]]\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Belgium}}\nThe nation provided an ideal model for showing the value of the railways for speeding the Industrial Revolution. After 1830, the new nation decided to stimulate industry. It funded a simple cross-shaped system that connected the major cities, ports and mining areas, and linked to neighboring countries. Belgium thus became the railway center of the region. The system was very soundly built along British lines, so that profits and wages were low but the infrastructure necessary for rapid industrial growth was put in place. L\u00e9opold I went on to build the [[Rail transport in Belgium|first railway in continental Europe]] in 1835, between Brussels and [[Mechelen]]. The first trains were drawn by [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]] engines imported from Great Britain.<ref>Patrick O'Brien, ''Railways and the economic development of Western Europe, 1830\u20131914'' (1983) ch 7</ref> The development of smaller railways in Belgium, notably the [[Li\u00e8ge]]\u2013[[Jemappes]] line, was launched by tendering contracts to private companies which \"became the model for the extension of small local railways all over the low countries.\"<ref name=\"ascherson231\">{{cite book|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|title=The King incorporated : Leopold the Second and the Congo.|year=1999|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=978-1862072909|page=231|edition=[New ed.]}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1900s, Belgium was a major exporter of trams and other rail components, exporting vast quantities of railway materials.

In general terms, the Catholics represented the relatively religious, conservative and rural elements in the society, while the Liberals represented the more secular, more progressive and more urban middle-class elements.\"<ref>Samuel Clark, \"Nobility, bourgeoisie and the industrial revolution in Belgium,\" ''Past & Present'' (1984) p 165</ref>  Before the arrival of the socialists in the 1890s, the nation was therefore polarised between the conservative [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]] and the secular [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]]. The Liberals were anticlerical and wanted to reduce the power of the Church. The conflict came to a head during the \"[[First School War]]\" of 1879\u20131884 as Liberal attempts to introduce a greater level of secularism in primary education were beaten back by outraged Catholics. The School War ushered in a period of Catholic Party dominance in Belgian politics that lasted (almost unbroken) until 1917.<ref>Kossmann, ''The Low Countries,'' ch 4\u20138</ref>\n\nReligious conflict also extended to university education, where secular universities like the [[Free University of Brussels (1834\u20131969)|Free University of Brussels]] competed with Catholic universities like the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]].\n\n===Linguistic conflict===\nThe majority of those in the north of the country spoke Dutch and other [[Low Franconian languages]] while those in the south spoke [[Langues d'o\u00efl]] such as [[French language|French]], [[Walloon language|Walloon]] and [[Picard language|Picard]]. French became the official language of government after the separation from the Netherlands in 1830 and Belgian cultural life was especially dominated by the French influence,<ref>Rondo E.

This was partly due to a sense of growing Flemish identity, made possible through greater awareness of Flemish culture and history from the 1840s. Flemish victories, like the [[Battle of the Golden Spurs]] in 1302 were celebrated and a Flemish cultural movement, led by figures like [[Hendrik Conscience]] was born.  About the same time a Walloon Movement emerged, led by [[Jules Destr\u00e9e]] (1863\u20131936) and based on loyalty to the French language. Universal suffrage meant the Francophones were a political minority, so the Walloon Movement concentrated on protecting French where it had a majority, and did not contest the expanded use of Dutch in Flemish areas.<ref>Kas Deprez and Louis Vos, eds.

Dutch became the language of government, education, and the courts in the northern provinces of East Flanders and West Flanders, Antwerp, Limburg, and eastern Brabant. French remained the official language in Wallonia; Brussels, which had seen a major [[Francization of Brussels|language shift to French]], became an officially bilingual region.  Meanwhile, a small separatist Flemish movement had emerged; the Germans had supported it during the war, and in the 1930s it turned fascist. In the Second World War it collaborated with the Nazis.<ref>Kas Deprez and Louis Vos, eds.

These reforms, led by [[Jules d'Anethan|d'Anethan]] under pressure from [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]], divided Belgian politics. The Catholics united with the Liberals under [[Walth\u00e8re Fr\u00e8re-Orban|Fr\u00e8re-Orban]] to oppose them, and the reforms were finally defeated when [[Jules d'Anethan|d'Anethan's]] government fell during an unrelated scandal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ascherson|first=Neal|title=The King incorporated : Leopold the Second and the Congo.|year=1999|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=978-1862072909|page=81|edition=[New ed.]}}</ref>  Eventually, the military was reformed. The 1909 System instituted compulsory military service of eight years on active duty and five years in the reserves.

Kossmann, ''The Low Countries'' pp 316\u201318</ref> The [[Belgian Labour Party|Belgian Workers' Party]] was founded in 1885 in Brussels. It issued the [[Charter of Quaregnon]] in 1894 calling for an end to capitalism and a thorough reorganization of society. Though, the Belgian Workers' Party was not elected to government until the late 20th century, it exerted considerable pressure on the rest of the political process, both through direct participation in politics themselves, but also through general strikes.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, [[Belgian general strikes|general strikes]] became an established aspect of the political process. Between 1892 and 1961, there were 20 major strikes, including 7 general strikes. Many of these had overtly political motives, like the [[Belgian general strike of 1893|1893 General Strike]] that helped achieve universal suffrage.\n\nOn several occasions, Belgian general strikes escalated into violence. In 1893, soldiers fired on the striking crowd, killing several. [[Karl Marx]] wrote, \"There exists but one country in the civilised world where every strike is eagerly and joyously turned into a pretext for the official massacre of the Working Class. That country of single blessedness is Belgium!\"<ref>''Marx and Engels on the Trade Unions.''

Sickness compensation was established in 1894, voluntary old-age insurance in 1900 and unemployment insurance in 1907, achieving good coverage nationwide much more quickly than its neighbours.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peter Flora &|first=Arnold J.

Outraged, the [[Belgian Labour Party]] called a General Strike; by April 17, there were more than 50,000 strikers. Violent confrontations broke out with the ''[[Garde Civique]]'' (the ''Civil Guard'' or militia) around the country, as in [[Mons]], where several strikers were killed. Violence escalated. The government soon backed down, and passed male universal suffrage but reduced its impact by creating [[Plural voting#Belgium|plural votes]] based on wealth, education and age. The Catholic conservatives, with 68% of the seats, remained in power, as the Liberals dropped to only 13% of the seats and the Socialists held their share.<ref>Els Witte, et al., ''Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards'' (2009), p. 86.</ref>\n\nAgain in [[Belgian general strike of 1902|1902]] and [[Belgian general strike of 1913|1913]] there were general strikes aimed at forcing electoral reform and ending the system of plural voting.  After the 1913 strike a commission was created and was expected to remove plural voting \u2013 but implementation was delayed by the 1914 German invasion of Belgium. In 1918, King Albert forged a post-war \"Government of National Union\" and brought about one man, one vote universal male suffrage. The last restrictions on women's voting were only lifted in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|last=Meier|first=Petra|title=Report from Belgium|url=http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Belgien.htm|publisher=European Database \u2013 Women in Decision-making|accessdate=3 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112220709/http://www.db-decision.de/CoRe/Belgien.htm|archive-date=12 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Culture===\nArtistic and literary culture in Belgium began a revival towards the late 19th century.

Kurth taught modern historical methods to his students at the [[University of Li\u00e8ge]].

Championed in part by King [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] (known as the \"Builder King\"), the style can be seen in the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palais de Justice]] (designed by [[Joseph Poelaert]]) and the [[Cinquantenaire]], both of which survive in Brussels.\n\nNevertheless, Brussels became one of the major European cities for the development of the [[Art Nouveau]] style in the late 1890s.

''The Low Countries'' (1978), p 523-35</ref>  After the systematic atrocities by the German army in the first few weeks of the war, German civil servants took control and were generally correct, albeit strict and severe.  There was never a violent resistance movement, but there was a large-scale spontaneous passive resistance of refusal to work for the benefit of German victory. Belgium was heavily industrialized; while farms operated and small shops stayed open most large establishments shut down or drastically reduced their output. The faculty closed the universities; many publishers shut down their newspapers. Most Belgians \"turned the four war years into a long and extremely dull vacation,\" says Kossmann.<ref>Kossmann, p 525</ref>  In 1916 Germany shipped 120,000 men and boys to work in Germany; this set off a storm of protest from neutral countries and they were returned.

The CRB obtained and imported millions of tons of foodstuffs for the CN to distribute, and watched over the CN to make sure the German army didn't appropriate the food. The CRB became a veritable independent republic of relief, with its own flag, navy, factories, mills, and railroads. Private donations and government grants (78%) supplied an $11-million-a-month budget.<ref>Burner, p. 79.</ref>\n\nAt its peak, the American arm, the [[American Relief Administration|ARA]] fed 10.5 million people daily. Great Britain grew reluctant to support the CRB, preferring instead to emphasize Germany's obligation to supply the relief; [[Winston Churchill]] led a military faction that considered the Belgian relief effort \"a positive military disaster.\"<ref>Burner, p. 82.</ref>\n\n==Interwar Period==\n[[File:1920 olympics poster.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Poster for the [[1920 Summer Olympics]], held at [[Antwerp]]]]\nKing [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert]] returned as a war hero, leading the victorious army and acclaimed by the population. In contrast, the government and the exiles came back discreetly.  Belgium had been devastated\u2014not so much by combat, but rather by German seizure of valuable machinery. Only 81 operable locomotives remained, out of the 3,470 available in 1914. 46 of 51 steel mills were damaged, with 26 destroyed totally. More than 100,000 houses had been destroyed, as well as more than {{convert|300000|acre|ha|order=flip}} of farmland.<ref name=\"autogenerated113\">{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|title=Belgium : a history|year=2004|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|page=113}}</ref>\n\nWaves of popular violence accompanied liberation in November and December 1918 and the government responded through the judicial punishment of collaboration with the enemy conducted between 1919 and 1921. Shop windows were broken and houses sacked, men were harassed, and women's heads were shaved. Manufacturers who had closed their businesses sought the severe repression of those who had pursued their activities. Journalists who had boycotted and stopped writing called for harsh treatment of the newspapers that submitted to German censorship. Many people stigmatized profiteers and demanded justice. Thus in 1918, Belgium was already confronted with the problems associated with occupation that most European countries only discovered at the end of World War II.<ref>Laurence VanYpersele, and Xavier Rousseaux, \"Leaving the War: Popular Violence and Judicial Repression of 'Unpatriotic' Behaviour in Belgium (1918\u20131921).''

The [[1920 Summer Olympics|first postwar Olympic Games]] were held in Antwerp in 1920. In 1921, [[Luxembourg]] formed a customs union with Belgium.\n\n===Reparations===\nGerman reparations to Belgium for damage incurred during the [[First World War]] was set at \u00a312.5 billion [[pounds sterling]].\nIn 1919 under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] the area of [[Eupen-Malmedy]], along with [[Moresnet]] was transferred to Belgium. \"[[Neutral Moresnet]]\" was transferred to Belgium, as well as the [[Vennbahn]] railway. An opportunity was given to the population to \"oppose\" against the transfer by signing a petition, which gathered few signatures, in large part thanks to intimidation by local authorities, and all regions remain part of Belgium today.\n\nBelgian requests to annex territory considered as historically theirs, from the Dutch, who were perceived as collaborators, was denied.<ref name=\"autogenerated113\"/>\n\nBetween 1923 and 1926, Belgian and French soldiers were sent to the [[Ruhr]] in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] to force the German government to agree to continue reparation payments. The [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] led the [[Dawes Plan]] which allowed the German government more leniency in paying reparations.\n\nThe League of Nations in 1925 made Belgium the trustee for the former [[German East Africa]] which bordered the Belgian Congo to the east. It became [[Rwanda-Urundi]] (or \"Ruanda-Urundi\") (modern day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]).<ref>William Roger Louis, ''Ruanda-Urundi 1884\u20131919'' (Oxford U.P., 1963).</ref> Although promising the League it would promote education, Belgium left the task to subsidised Catholic missions and unsubsidised Protestant missions. As late as 1962, when independence arrived, fewer than 100 natives had gone beyond secondary school. The policy was one of low-cost paternalism, as explained by Belgium's special representative to the Trusteeship Council: \"The real work is to change the African in his essence, to transform his soul, [and] to do that one must love him and enjoy having daily contact with him. He must be cured of his thoughtlessness, he must accustom himself to living in society, he must overcome his inertia.\"<ref>Mary T.

[[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]]'s first surrealist painting, ''The Lost Jockey'', appeared in 1926. [[Paul Delvaux]] was also an extremely influential painter in this genre.\n\n[[Franco-Belgian comics|Comic strips]] became extremely popular in Belgium during the 1930s. One of the most popular comics of the 20th century, [[Herg\u00e9]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' first appeared in 1929. The growth of comic strips was also accompanied by a popular art movement, exemplified by [[Edgar P.

The Brigade Piron was involved in the [[D-Day|Normandy Invasion]] and the battles in France and the Netherlands until liberation. Belgians also served in British special forces units during the war, forming a troop of [[No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando#No. 4 Belgian Troop|No.10 Commando]] which was heavily involved in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] and [[Operation Infatuate|Landings on Walcheren]]. The [[5th Special Air Service]] (SAS) was entirely made up of Belgians.\n\nTwo Belgian squadrons, amounting to over 400 pilots, served in the [[Royal Air Force]] during the war, both [[349th Squadron (Belgium)|349]] and [[350th Squadron (Belgium)|350 Squadrons]], which claimed over 50 'kills'.<ref>J.

Congolese soldiers of the [[Force Publique]] were involved in fighting with Italian forces during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. Congolese soldiers also served in the Middle East and Burma. The Congo was also a vitally important economic asset to the allied powers, particularly through its exports of rubber and uranium; in fact the uranium used during the [[Manhattan Project]] \u2013 including that used for the atomic bombs dropped on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] was supplied by the Belgian firm [[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]] from [[Katanga Province]] in the Belgian Congo.\n\n===Occupation 1940\u201344===\n[[File:Breendonk046.jpg|thumb|right|The gallow at [[Fort Breendonk|Breendonk Concentration Camp]], near [[Mechelen]]]]\n:''See also [[Belgium in World War II]], [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|Military Government]] and [[History of the Jews in Belgium#Holocaust|The Holocaust in Belgium]]''\nBelgium was run by a Germany military government between its surrender and liberation in September 1944.\n\nThe former fort at [[Fort Breendonk|Breendonk]], near [[Mechelen]] was requisitioned by the Nazis and used for detainment and interrogation of Jews, political prisoners and captured members of the resistance.

Of these, 46 percent were deported from the [[Mechelen transit camp]], while a further 5,034 people were deported via the Drancy internment camp (close to Paris). From the summer of 1942 until 1944, twenty-eight transports left Belgium carrying 25,257 Jews and 351 Roma to eastern Europe. Their destination was often [[Auschwitz]] Death Camp. Over the course of the war, 25,257 Jews were transported (including 5,093 children) and 352 Roma over the Mechelen-Leuven railway to concentration camps. Only 1,205 returned home alive at the end of the war.\n\n===Resistance===\n:''See also [[Belgian Resistance]] and [[Comit\u00e9 de D\u00e9fense des Juifs|CDJ]]''\nResistance against the German occupiers of Belgium can be seen at all levels and from all quarters of the political spectrum, but was highly fragmented. The [[Pierlot IV Government|Government in Exile]] dealt with resistance collectively under the name ''Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te'', however this was just a broad name for the many resistance organisations which existed. Some organisations were very left-wing, like the Communist ''[[Front de l'Ind\u00e9pendance]]'', but there was also a far-right resistance movement, the ''L\u00e9gion Belge'' which comprised dissident [[Rexism|Rexists]]. However, there were also other groups like ''Groupe G'' which had no obvious political affiliation.\n\nResistance to the occupiers chiefly came in the form of helping allied airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this, for instance the [[Comet line]] which evacuated an estimated 14,000 allied airmen to [[Gibraltar]].<ref>John Nichol and Tony Rennell, ''Home Run: Escape from Nazi Europe'' (Penguin, 2007) pp.470</ref> Sabotage was also used, and ''Group G's'' activities alone are estimated to have cost the Nazis 20 million man-hours of labor to repair damages done.<ref>Miller, Russell. The Resistance: WWII Time Life Education (1979)</ref> The resistance were also instrumental in saving Jews and Roma from deportation to death camps, for instance the attack on the ''[[Twentieth convoy]]'' to [[Auschwitz]] Death Camp.There was also significant low-level resistance, for instance in June 1941, the [[City of Brussels|City Council of Brussels]] refused to distribute [[Yellow badge|Stars of David badges]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Museum van Deportatie en Verzet|url=http://www.cicb.be|accessdate=3 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226071856/http://www.cicb.be/|archivedate=26 February 2011}}</ref> Many Belgians also hid Jews and political dissidents during the occupation, with one estimate putting the number at some 20,000 people.<ref>The number provided by the Museum van Deportatie en Verzet ({{cite web|title=Museum van Deportatie en Verzet|url=http://www.cicb.be|accessdate=3 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226071856/http://www.cicb.be/|archivedate=26 February 2011}}) puts the number at 20,000 Jews, including 3,000 children.

There were pro-Nazi political organizations in both Flemish and Walloon communities before and during the war. The most significant were the Flemish [[DeVlag]] and ''Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond'' ([[Flemish National Union|VNV]])  as well as the Catholic Walloon ''[[Rexism|Rexist]]'' movement. These organisations were also fundamental to encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German army. Two divisions of the [[Waffen SS]], the Flemish [[27th SS Volunteer Division Langemarck|27th SS \"Langemarck\" Division]] and the Walloon [[28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Wallonien|28th SS \"Wallonien\" Division]]. Some organisations, like [[Verdinaso]] appealed directly to Flemish separatist ideologies, though they did not become very popular.\n\nAfter the war, many of those who had collaborated \u2013 including many of the guards at [[Fort Breendonk]] \u2013 were tried, imprisoned or shot.\n\n===Allied liberation 1944\u201345===\nBelgium was liberated late in 1944 by Allied forces, including [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], and [[United States|American]] armies, including the [[1st Belgian Infantry Brigade|Brigade Piron]]. On 3 September 1944 the Welsh Guards liberated Brussels. The [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] seized [[Antwerp]] on 4 of September 1944, and the [[First Canadian Army]] began conducting combat operations around the port that same month. Antwerp became a highly prized and heavily fought-over objective because its deep-water port was necessary to keep the allied armies supplied. The [[Battle of the Scheldt]] in October 1944 was fought primarily on Dutch soil, but with the objective of opening the way for boats to Antwerp. The port city was also the ultimate objective of German armies during the [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes Offensive]]  which resulted in heavy fighting on Belgian soil during the winter of 1944\u20135.\n\nFollowing liberation, large numbers of Belgians who had remained in the country during the occupation were mobilised into the Belgian army in 57 \"Fusilier Battalions\". 100,000 Belgians were mobilised for the allies by the end of the war.\n\n==Postwar Belgium==\n\n===The \"Royal Question\"===\n{{Main|Royal Question}}\n\nImmediately after the war, [[Leopold III of Belgium|L\u00e9opold III]], who had surrendered himself to the German army in 1940, was released; however, the issue of whether he had [[treason|betrayed]] his country by surrendering, while most government ministers had escaped to the United Kingdom, presented an important constitutional dilemma. In particular, the Belgian public was concerned that he might be a collaborator with the Nazis. He had met [[Hitler]] in [[Berchtesgaden]] on November 19, 1940 and had even remarried (to [[Lilian Baels]]) during the war. Many Belgians, especially the Socialists, strongly opposed his return to power. He was kept in exile in Switzerland until 1950, while his brother [[Prince Charles of Belgium|Prince Charles]] presided as regent.\n\nA referendum was proposed in 1950 to solve the problem. However, it produced a very close result. In [[Flanders]], the electorate voted 70% in favour (\"Yes\") of his return but [[Wallonia]] voted 58% against. Brussels also returned a 51% \"No\" vote. Although the referendum narrowly produced a favourable result for L\u00e9opold (about 57.68% in the country as a whole), the militant socialist movement in Li\u00e8ge, Hainaut and other urban centres incited major protests and even called a [[General strike against Leopold III of Belgium|General Strike]] against his return.\n\nBecause of the possibility that the situation might escalate even further, L\u00e9opold III abdicated on July 16, 1951, in favour of his 20-year-old son [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Baudouin]].\n\n===Occupation of Germany, Korean War and EDC===\n[[File:Belgische Strijdkrachten Duitsland.gif|thumb|right|Map showing the area of [[West Germany]] occupied by Belgian forces after the Second World War, known as FBA-BSD]]\nAfter the defeat of Germany in 1945, Belgian soldiers were assigned to occupy a section of [[West Germany]], known as ''[[Belgian Forces in Germany]]'' or FBA-BSD.

Though the planned EDC was never actually realised, it was still responsible for a major re-organisation of the Belgian army along [[US Army]] lines. Belgium was also involved in [[NATO]].\n\nIn 1950, a unit of volunteers from the Belgian army was sent to fight for the [[United Nations]] in the [[Korean War]] against [[Chinese People's Volunteers|Chinese]] and [[North Korea]]n troops. The [[Belgian United Nations Command]] (or BUNC) arrived in Korea in early 1951, and fought at several key engagements of the conflict, including at the [[Battle of the Imjin River]], [[Battle of Haktang-ni|Haktang-ni]] and [[Battle of Chatkol|Chatkol]]. BUNC was decorated and received presidential citations from both the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|United States]] and [[Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation|Republic of Korea]].

A central goal of the ERP was to promote the growth of productivity along the lines of American management and labor practices. Obstacles arose which clearly limited its impact. The interest among some Belgian employers in increasing rates of productivity per worker was motivated by the rise in wage levels. But the Americans also intended to inject a new \"spirit of productivity\" in Belgian industries, which implied, among other measures, a reinforcement of structures of corporatist negotiation between the social partners at a local level. The ambitions of the American strategy therefore extended beyond the defined goal of introducing a [[Fordism|Fordist]] type of economic system with high wages, high productivity, and low prices to consumers. After the belated establishment of the Belgian Office for the Increase of Productivity in 1952, the political character of the program became apparent. By incorporating American management principles, while at the same time decoding them and adapting them to the national situation, Belgian employers' organizations and trade unions skillfully exploited their position as intermediaries in order to appropriate the \"modernist\" label that they advocated. The \"policy of productivity\" was successful for a certain time because it matched the contours of the evolution of social reforms in Belgium. This policy success, however, was rendered impotent by the failure of the economic dimension of the productivity campaigns. The Americans had in effect failed to recognize the structural importance of the major financial groups which dominated heavy industry in Belgium. By not adopting the American notions of productivity, and more generally by not carrying out any large-scale programs of innovation and investment in the key sectors that they controlled in the aftermath of the war, these holding companies greatly restricted the scope for American influence.  Consequently, it was by other means, such as the training of managers, that the American paradigms entered into Belgian economic culture.<ref>Kenneth Bertrams, \"Productivite Economique et Paix Sociale au sein du Plan Marshall: Les Limites de l'influence Americaine aupres des Industriels et Syndicats Belges, 1948\u20131960,\"  [Economic Productivity and Social Peace Within the Marshall Plan: the Limits of American Influence on Belgian Industrialists and Trade Unionists, 1948\u201360].

After the war, the government cancelled Belgium's debts. It was during this period that the well-known Belgian highways were built. In addition, both the economy and the average standard of living rose significantly. As noted by [[Robert Gildea]], \"Social and economic policy was designed to restore liberal capitalism tempered by social reform, as prepared for during the war. Trade unions were also involved in a price and wage policy to cut inflation and this, together with the Allied use of Antwerp as the main entry point for war supplies, produced the so-called Belgian miracle of high economic growth combined with high wages.\"<ref>Surviving Hitler and Mussolini: daily life in occupied Europe by Robert Gildea</ref> According to one study, Belgian workers by 1961 earned wages \u201csecond only to those of the French in the Common Market area,\u201d and earned 50% more than their Italian counterparts and 40% more than their Dutch counterparts.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1961/xx/belgium.htm | title=Tony Cliff: Belgium \u2013 strike to revolution? (Spring 1961)}}</ref>\n\nDespite postwar affluence, however, many Belgians continued to live in poverty. An organisation of several poverty action groups, known as the National Action for Security of Subsistence, claimed that more than 900,000 Belgians (about 10% of the population) lived in poverty in 1967, while in the early Seventies, a group of social scientists called the Working Group on Alternative Economics estimated that about 14.5% of the Belgian population lived in poverty.<ref>Victor George and Roger Lawson, eds. ''Poverty and Inequality in Common Market Countries'' (1980)</ref>\n\nIn the sphere of economics, World War II marks a turning point. Because Flanders had been widely devastated during the war and had been largely agricultural since the Belgian uprising, it benefited most from the Marshall Plan. Its standing as an economically backward agricultural region meant that it obtained support from Belgium's membership of the [[History of the European Union#The three communities|European Union]] and its predecessors. At the same time, Wallonia experienced a slow relative decline as the products of its mines and mills came to be less in demand. The economic balance between the two parts of the country has remained less in favour of Wallonia than it was before 1939.\n\n===The Second ''\"School War\"'' 1950\u201359===\n{{main|Second School War}}\nAfter victory in the 1950 elections, a [[Christian Social Party (Belgium, defunct)|Christian Social Party]] (PSC-CVP) government came to power in Belgium. The new education minister, [[Pierre Harmel]] increased the wages of teachers in private (Catholic) schools and introduced laws linking the subsidies for private schools to the number of pupils. These measures were perceived by the anti-clerical [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]] and [[Belgian Socialist Party|Socialists]] as a \"declaration of war\".\n\nWhen the 1954 elections brought to power a coalition of [[Belgian Socialist Party|Socialists]] and [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberals]], the new Education Minister, [[Leo Collard]], immediately set out to reverse the measures taken by his predecessor, founding a large number of secular schools and only permitting teachers with a diploma, forcing many priests out of the profession. These measures sparked mass protests from the Catholic bloc. A compromise was eventually found by the next government (a Catholic minority led by [[Gaston Eyskens]]), and the ''\"Schools War\"'' was concluded by the November 6, 1958 \"School Pact\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Michel|first=ARIES ....

In June 1960, the [[Belgian Congo]] was replaced by the short lived [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|First Republic of Congo]], led by the democratically elected and charismatic Congolese statesman [[Patrice Lumumba]], a former political prisoner. Belgian forces withdrew, leaving the military force, the [[Force Publique]], under Congo's control. Order broke down as mutinying soldiers attacked whites who remained in the country. Belgians forces were briefly sent in to evacuate Belgian nationals and army officers.\n\nIn July 1960, the southern state of [[Katanga Province]] declared its independence, forming the [[State of Katanga]]. Katanga's bid for sovereignty was supported by Belgian mining companies and soldiers, who had considerable assets in the area. Later that month, [[United Nations]] peacekeepers were deployed to the country. During this period of anarchy, the region of [[South Kasai]] also declared independence. Faced with the possibility that the [[Soviet Union]] would attempt to use the situation to install a sympathetic regime, western powers including Belgium, supported [[Joseph Mobutu]] who installed his own, right-wing regime in the Congo. Lumumba was murdered and civil war ensued. Belgian paratroopers were again deployed to the country, this time to rescue civilian hostages captured in [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] during an operation known as ''[[Operation Dragon Rouge|Dragon Rouge]]''.  At the end Mobutu emerged as the ruler of the re-unified country, which he named [[Zaire]].\n\n===The General Strike of 1960\u201361===\n[[File:Metingue Brussele1960a.jpg|thumb|Walloon workers demonstration in Brussels in the winter of 1960]]\n:''See also [[1960\u20131961 Winter General Strike]]''\nIn December 1960, Wallonia was gripped by a general strike in response the general decline of Wallonian manufacturing but it succeeded only in Wallonia, in a period of turbulence in the aftermath of the ''Second Schools War''. The Wallonian workers demanded federalism, in addition to structural reforms. Even though the strike had been intended to be nationwide, Flemish workers appeared reluctant to support it.\n\nThe [[1960-1961 Winter General Strike|Strike]] was led by [[Andr\u00e9 Renard]], the founder of \"[[Renardism]]\" which combined militant socialism with Walloon nationalism. The historian Ren\u00e9e Fox described Wallonia's alienation:\n\n<blockquote>At the beginning of the 1960s (...), a major reversal in the relationship between Flanders and Wallonia was taking place. Flanders had entered a vigorous, post\u2013World War II period of industrialization, and a significant percentage of the foreign capital (particularly from the United States, coming into Belgium to support new industries, was being invested in Flanders. In contrast, Wallonia's coal mines and time-worn steel plants and factories were in crisis. The region had lost thousands of jobs and much investment capital. A new Dutch-speaking, upwardly mobile \"populist bourgeoisie\" was not only becoming visible and vocal in Flemish movements but also in both the local and national policy...  [The strike of December 1960 against the austerity law of [[Gaston Eyskens]] ] was replaced by a collective expression of the frustrations, anxieties, and grievances that Wallonia was experiencing in response to its altered situation, and by the demands of the newly formed [[Walloon Movement#Independentism|Walloon Popular Movement]] for...regional autonomy for Wallonia...<ref>Ren\u00e9e C. Fox, ''In the Belgian Ch\u00e2teau'', Ivan R.Dee, Chicago, page 13,  1994 {{ISBN|1-56663-057-6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNationwide the economy was generally healthy with an annual growth rate of 5% in the 1960s. However old inefficient factories were being shut down in textiles and leather goods. Coal miners were angered by the closure of used-up mines. Limburg miners at the Zwartberg mine rioted in 1966 to protest its closure. Two miners were killed by police and ten were injured, while nineteen policemen were hurt.<ref>{{cite book|author=Els Witte and Alain Meynen|title=Political History of Belgium: From 1830 Onwards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4Em8G76kbkC&pg=PA280|year=2009|publisher=Asp / Vubpress / Upa|page=280|isbn=9789054875178}}</ref> In 1973 a series of worldwide crises adversely affected the Belgian economy.\n\n===The \"Linguistic Wars\"===\n{{Main|Flemish Movement}}\nThis Flemish resurgence has been accompanied by a corresponding shift of political power to the Flemish, who constituted the majority of the population of around 60%.

The government of [[Paul Vanden Boeynants]] fell over the issue in 1968.\n\n===The rise of the federal state===\n[[File:Flag of Flanders.svg|thumb|The flag of [[Flanders]] incorporating the Flemish lion, also used by the [[Flemish Movement]].]]\n{{Main|State reform in Belgium}}\nThe successive linguistic disputes have made the successive Belgian governments very unstable. The three major parties (Liberal -right wing-, Catholic -center- and, Socialist -left wing-) all split in two according to their French- or Dutch-speaking electorate. A language border was determined by the first Gilson Act of November 8, 1962. The boundaries of certain [[provinces]], [[arrondissements]] and [[municipalities]] were modified (among others, [[Mouscron]] became a part of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and [[Voeren]] became a part of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]) and [[Municipalities with language facilities|facilities]] for linguistic minorities were introduced in 25 municipalities. On August 2, 1963, the second Gilson Act entered into force, fixing the division of Belgium into four language areas: a Dutch, a French and a German language area, with [[Brussels]] as a bilingual area.\n\nIn 1970, there was a first state reform, which resulted in the establishment of three cultural communities: the Dutch Cultural Community, the French Cultural Community and the German Cultural Community. This reform was a response to the [[Flanders|Flemish]] demand for cultural autonomy. The constitutional revision of 1970 also laid the foundations for the establishment of three [[Communities and regions of Belgium|Regions]], which was a response to the demand of the [[Wallonia|Walloons]] and the French-speaking inhabitants of [[Brussels Capital Region|Brussels]] for economic autonomy. On February 18, 1970, [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Gaston Eyskens]] announces the end of \"La Belgique de papa\".\n\nThe second state reform took place in 1980, when the cultural communities became [[Communities and regions of Belgium|Communities]]. The Communities assumed the competencies of the cultural communities with regard to cultural matters, and became responsible for the 'matters relating to the person', such as health and youth policy. From then on, these three Communities were known as the [[Flemish Community]], the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]]. Two Regions were established as well in 1980: the [[Flemish Region]] and the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]]. However, in Flanders it was decided in 1980 to immediately merge the institutions of the Community and the Region. Although the creation of a Brussels Region was provided for in 1970, the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] was not established until the third state reform.\n\nDuring the third state reform in 1988 and 1989, under [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Prime Minister]] [[Wilfried Martens]], the [[Brussels-Capital Region]] was established with its own regional institutions, as well as [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[French language|French]] institutions for community matters. The Brussels-Capital Region remained limited to 19 municipalities. Other changes included that the competencies of the Communities and Regions were expanded. One notable responsibility that was transferred to the Communities during the third state reform was education.\n\n[[File:Belgium province Brabant.png|thumb|right|Map showing the division of [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]] into [[Flemish Brabant]] (yellow), [[Walloon Brabant]] (red) and the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]] (orange) in 1995]]\n\nThe fourth state reform, which took place in 1993 under Prime Minister [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]], consolidated the previous state reforms and turned Belgium into a fully-fledged federal state. The first article of the [[Constitution of Belgium|Belgian Constitution]] was amended to read as follows, \u201cBelgium is a Federal State which consists of Communities and Regions\u201d. During the fourth state reform, the responsibilities of the Communities and the Regions were expanded again, their resources were increased and they were given more fiscal responsibilities. Other major changes included the direct election of the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions, the splitting up of the [[Province of Brabant]] into [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Walloon Brabant]], and the reformation of the [[Federal Parliament of Belgium|Federal Parliament's]] [[bicameralism|bicameral]] system and the relations between the Federal Parliament and the [[Belgian Federal Government|Federal Government]]. The first direct elections for the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions took place on May 21, 1995.\n\nHowever, the fourth state reform was not the end of the process of federalization. In 2001, a fifth state reform took place,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=indexDisplay.jsp&event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&pageid=contentPage&docId=42152.0 | title = Belgium.be | accessdate = 1 November 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184522/http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?origin=indexDisplay.jsp&event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&pageid=contentPage&docId=42152.0 | archive-date = 30 September 2007 | url-status = dead }}</ref> under Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]], with the Lambermont and the Lombard Accords. In the course of that reform, more powers were transferred to the Communities and the Regions, with regard to agriculture, fisheries, foreign trade, development cooperation, auditing of electoral expenses and the supplementary financing of the political parties. The Regions became responsible for twelve regional taxes, and local and provincial government became a matter for the Regions. The first municipal and provincial elections under the supervision of the Regions were the [[Belgian municipal elections, 2006|2006 municipal elections]]. The functioning of the Brussels institutions was also amended during the fifth state reform, which resulted among other things in a guaranteed representation of the Flemish inhabitants of Brussels in the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]].\n\nAt the end of 2011, following the longest political crisis in Belgium's contemporary history, a constitutional accord between the four main political families (socialists, liberals, social-Christians, ecologists), but excluding the Flemish nationalists, ushered in the [[Sixth Belgian state reform|sixth state reform]] which provided for major institutional changes and additional transfers of competences from the federal level to the Communities and the Regions. Among other changes, the Senate ceased to be directly elected to become an assembly of regional parliaments, the Brussels-Capital Region was granted constitutive autonomy, and the Regions received economic, employment and family welfare competences as well as greater fiscal autonomy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/country/history/belgium_from_1830/formation_federal_state/sixth_state_reform/ | title=Sixth State Reform| date=2013-06-05}}</ref>\n\nBelgium was one of the founders of the European [[European Economic Community|Common Market]].

This development was sponsored by [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium]] and reflected Enlightenment influences\u2014such as that of [[Voltaire]]\u2014in exploring the history of the people. They pondered questions of causality. Their goal was building the blocks for a general history of the Austrian Netherlands, thus marking an important step toward the creation of a Belgian national history.<ref>Tom Verschaffel, \"The modernization of historiography in 18th-century Belgium,\" ''History of European Ideas'' (2005) 31#2 pp 135\u2013146</ref>\n\nSince Belgium became an independent nation only in 1830, defining nationhood was a special issue for the historians of the late 19th century.  The usual European solutions which defined nationhood in terms of language would not work.  The Romantic Joseph-Jean de Smet portrayed his country as a \"phoenix\" (a reference to the great bird that rose from the dead.)  The challenge of defining the nation's past and present in the face of Dutch, Spanish, Austrian, French, and German influences posed a central problem.  Defending the boundaries of Belgium (especially why Flanders should not be in the Netherlands) was another issue that preoccupied historical writers such as Pirenne.<ref>Jo Tollebeek, \"Historical representation and the nation-state in romantic Belgium (1830\u20131850),\" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1998) 59#2 pp 329\u201353 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3653979 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe medievalist Godefroid Kurth (1847\u20131916) was a student of Germany's famous professor [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Kurth introduced Ranke's advanced scholarly methods in his seminar at the Universite de Li\u00e8ge. Belgian historiography achieved international stature in the early 20th century with the work of medievalist [[Henri Pirenne]] (1862\u20131935).<ref>Jo Tollebeek, \"At the crossroads of nationalism: Huizinga, Pirenne and the Low Countries in Europe,\" ''European Review of History'' (2010) 17#2 pp 187\u2013215.</ref>\n\nHistoriography at [[Ghent University]] was pioneered by medievalists, especially Hubert Van Houtte. After 1945 [[Charles Verlinden]] introduced the methods of the French [[Annales School]] of social history. Research topics at Ghent included colonial and maritime history, the history of prices and wages, agrarian history, business history, and the textile industry. In the 1970 and 1980s came a broadening to such topics as historical demography; living standards and lifestyles; beggary and crime; and the history of culture and mind-sets.<ref>Hugo Soly, \"Honderd Jaar Geschiedenis van de Nieuwe Tijd Aan de Universiteit Gent: De Dynamiek van een Selectief En Kritisch Eclectisme,\" [One hundred years of modern history at the University of Ghent: the dynamics of a selective and critical eclecticism], ''Handelingen der Maatschappij voor Geschiedenis en Oudheidkunde te Gent'' (2006), Vol. 60, pp 49\u201362.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[BELvue Museum]] \u2013 a Brussels museum tracing the history of Belgium from 1830 until the present.\n* [[History of Flanders]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Belgium]]\n* [[History of Wallonia]]\n* [[List of Belgian monarchs]]\n**[[Family tree of Belgian monarchs]]\n* [[List of World Heritage Sites in Belgium]]\n* [[Politics of Belgium]]\n** [[Politics of Flanders]]\n** [[Politics of Wallonia]]\n* [[Timeline of Belgian history]]\n\n==References==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n*{{StateDept}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Reference and surveys===\n* ''Encyclop\u00e9die du Mouvement wallon,'' 3 vol., Charleroi, 2000. {{ISBN|2-87035-017-1}}\n* Arblaster, Paul.

In late October 1938, Skalite, together with adjacent villages, was occupied by the [[Polish Army]]. In response, units of the Czechoslovak Border Guard opened fire on the Polish units, and a skirmish took place, with some victims. On November 1, 1938, Poland and Czechoslovakia signed a treaty, after which a commission was created to establish a new borderline. On November 30 in [[Zakopane]], both sides agreed that Skalit\u00e9 would be annexed by the [[Second Polish Republic]]. As a result, the town became a border station of the [[Polish State Railways]], along the strategic line from [[Zwardo\u0144]] to [[\u010cadca]].

In late October 1938, Skalite, together with adjacent villages, was occupied by the [[Polish Army]]. In response, units of the Czechoslovak Border Guard opened fire on the Polish units, and a skirmish took place, with some victims. On November 1, 1938, Poland and Czechoslovakia signed a treaty, after which a commission was created to establish a new borderline. On November 30 in [[Zakopane]], both sides agreed that Skalit\u00e9 would be annexed by the [[Second Polish Republic]]. As a result, the town became a border station of the [[Polish State Railways]], along the strategic line from [[Zwardo\u0144]] to [[\u010cadca]]. In the period fall 1938 - September 1939, Polish trains ran along the Zwardo\u0144 - \u010cadca - [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty Slaskie]] line, without stopping at [[\u010cadca railway station]], which remained part of Czechoslovakia (later Slovakia). In September 1939, following [[Polish September Campaign]], Skalit\u00e9 was re-annexed by Slovakia.\n\n==Geography==\nThe municipality lies at an altitude of 524 metres and covers an area of 33.163&nbsp;km\u00b2.
