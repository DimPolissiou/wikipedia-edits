An editorial dated 5 November, asked rhetorically, \"Do you want four more years of war? Vote for Lincoln. Do you want the Constitution destroyed?

In 2004, the editorial board voted to endorse Democratic US Senator [[John Kerry]]; after publisher Alex Machaskee overruled it, ordering the board to write an endorsement of Republican [[George W.

Editor Doug Clifton defended the paper's decision, sparking a feud with a pro-carry lobbyist group. State Senator Steve Austria called it abuse of the media access privilege, saying publishing these names would threaten the safety of the men and women who obtain these permits.

Wilson was a prominent critic of the administration. The decision to compel the reporters to reveal sources was seen in the news media as a license to go after reporters and newspapers in the courtroom for not revealing confidential informants. It was considered a violation of the trust between reporter and said informants. Clifton was vilified in the news media as \"having no backbone\" and he admitted that people could refer to him as \"chickenshit\". Clifton told the national press that while he and the reporters involved in the story were willing to be jailed for not revealing sources, the legal department of the Plain Dealer Publishing Company was worried that the newspaper itself would be sued and strongly opposed the printing of the stories. \"Talking isn't an option and jail is too high a price to pay\", Clifton said.<ref name=\"clifton2\">\"WHO HAS YOUR BACK? Journalism in the Corporate Age\", ''Columbia Journalism Review'', September 2005.</ref>\n\nThe controversy ended when the ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'', an [[alternative weekly]] Cleveland newspaper, published a similar story. ''The Plain Dealer'' then printed the withheld story. It was a report of a federal corruption probe of former [[List of mayors of Cleveland|Mayor]] [[Michael R.

Wilson was a prominent critic of the administration. The decision to compel the reporters to reveal sources was seen in the news media as a license to go after reporters and newspapers in the courtroom for not revealing confidential informants. It was considered a violation of the trust between reporter and said informants. Clifton was vilified in the news media as \"having no backbone\" and he admitted that people could refer to him as \"chickenshit\". Clifton told the national press that while he and the reporters involved in the story were willing to be jailed for not revealing sources, the legal department of the Plain Dealer Publishing Company was worried that the newspaper itself would be sued and strongly opposed the printing of the stories. \"Talking isn't an option and jail is too high a price to pay\", Clifton said.<ref name=\"clifton2\">\"WHO HAS YOUR BACK?

He served as Controller General of Finances of France under the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orleans]], who was regent for the youthful king, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. In 1716 Law established the private [[Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] in France. A year later was nationalised at his request as the [[Bank of France|Banque Royale]], the first Central [[Bank of France]]. The original private bank was substantially funded by John Law and Louis XV; three-quarters of its [[capital (economics)|capital]] consisted of government bills and government-accepted notes, effectively making it both the first [[central bank]] of the nation and since only partially backed by silver, a [[Fractional-reserve banking|fractional reserve bank]].

The first manifestation of [[Law's system]] came when he had returned to Scotland and contributed to the debates leading to the [[Treaty of Union 1707]].

P. F. Collier Inc., 1978.</ref>\n\nHe spent ten years moving between France and the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]], dealing in financial [[speculation]]s. Problems with the French economy presented the opportunity to put his system into practice.\n\nHe had the idea of abolishing minor [[monopoly|monopolies]] and private [[tax farming (France)|farming of taxes]]. He would create a bank for national finance and a state company for commerce, ultimately to exclude all private revenue. This would create a huge monopoly of finance and trade run by the state, and its profits would pay off the [[national debt]]. The council called to consider Law's proposal, including financiers such as [[Samuel Bernard]], rejected the proposition on 24 October 1715.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|141}}\n\nLaw made his home in Place Louis-le-Grand, a royal square where he hosted and entertained various Parisian nobles. Gaining the attention of such notable people as the Duke of Orleans, Law quickly found himself a regular in high-stakes gambling parties attended by only the most affluent of Paris. His tall stature and elegant dress allowed Law to charm his way across Europe's financial hubs, from Amsterdam to Venice. These travels heavily influenced Law's theories on monetary policy and the importance of paper money as credit. Law's idea of a centralised bank which would deal in a new form of paper money was years ahead of its time. Despite this forward concept, Law still championed mercantilist beliefs with the promotion of monopolistic companies through government charters.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Diligent: A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade |last=Robert |first=Harms |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=43\u201354}}</ref>\n\nThe wars waged by [[Louis XIV]] left the country completely wasted, both economically and financially. The resultant shortage of [[precious metal]]s led to a shortage of coins in circulation, which in turn limited the production of new coins. With the death of Louis XIV seventeen months after Law's arrival, the Duke of Orleans finally presented Law with the opportunity to display his ingenuity. Since, following the devastating [[War of the Spanish Succession]], France's economy was stagnant and her [[national debt]] was crippling, Law proposed to stimulate industry by replacing gold with paper credit and then increasing the supply of credit, and to reduce the national debt by replacing it with shares in economic ventures.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kduEtlToecC&pg=PA105 |title=John Law |author=Antoin E Murphy |publisher=Oxford U.

The second key feature of the proposal centred on the premise that this private bank was able to issue its own currency backed by [[Louis d'or|Louis of gold]]. This enabled the currency to be redeemed by the weight of silver from the original deposit instead of the fluctuating value of the [[French livre|livres]] which had been devaluing rapidly.<ref name=\"Velde07\">{{Cite journal |last=Velde |first=Fran\u00e7ois R. |date=May 2007 |title=John Law's System |journal=American Economic Review |volume=97 |issue=2 |jstor=30034460}}</ref>{{rp|277}}\n\nIn May 1716 Law set up the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Priv\u00e9e (\"General Private Bank\"), which developed the use of paper money.<ref>BACKHOUSE, Roger, ''Economists and the economy: the evolution of economic ideas'', Transaction Publishers, 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-56000-715-9}}, p. 118</ref>\nIt was one of only six such banks to have issued paper money, joining Sweden, England, Holland, Venice, and Genoa.<ref name=nyfed>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2014/01/crisis-chronicles-the-mississippi-bubble-of-1720-and-the-european-debt-crisis.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York: \"Crisis Chronicles: The Mississippi Bubble of 1720 and the European Debt Crisis\" (Narron and Skeie)]</ref> The bank was nationalised in December 1718 at Law's request.<ref name=\"Velde07\"/>{{rp|277}}\n\nFrom this new banking platform, Law was able to pursue the [[monopoly]] companies he envisioned by having France bankroll the endeavour with 100&nbsp;million ''livres'' in the form of company stock. The founding of the Mississippi Company, later renamed the Occident Company and eventually part of the Company of the Indies, was financed in the same way as the bank.\n\nIn this context the regent, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans]], appointed Law as Controller General of Finances in 1720, effectively giving him control over external and internal commerce.

Squatters now occupied the square of Palace Louis-le-Grand and openly attacked the financiers that inhabited the area. It was under these circumstances and the cover of night that John Law left Paris some seven months later, leaving all of his substantial property assets in France, including the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]] and at least twenty-one Chateaux which he had purchased over his years in Paris, for the repayment of creditors.\n\nThe descent of a relatively unknown man came as fast as his rise, leaving an economic power vacuum.

He served as Controller General of Finances of France under the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orleans]], who was regent for the youthful king, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. In 1716 Law established the private [[Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] in France, which a year later was nationalised at his request to become the [[Bank of France|Banque Royale]], the first Central [[Bank of France]]. The original private bank was substantially funded by John Law and Louis XV; three-quarters of its [[capital (economics)|capital]] consisted of government bills and government-accepted notes, effectively making it both the first [[central bank]] of the nation and since it was only partially backed by silver, a [[Fractional-reserve banking|fractional reserve bank]].

P. F. Collier Inc., 1978.</ref>\n\nHe spent ten years moving between France and the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]], dealing in financial [[speculation]]s. Problems with the French economy presented the opportunity to put his system into practice.\n\nHe had the idea of abolishing minor [[monopoly|monopolies]] and private [[tax farming (France)|farming of taxes]]. He would create a bank for national finance and a state company for commerce, ultimately to exclude all private revenue. This would create a huge monopoly of finance and trade run by the state, and its profits would pay off the [[national debt]]. The council called to consider Law's proposal, including financiers such as [[Samuel Bernard]], rejected the proposition on 24 October 1715.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|141}}\n\nLaw made his home in Place Louis-le-Grand, a royal square where he hosted and entertained various Parisian nobles. Gaining the attention of such notable people as the Duke of Orleans, Law quickly found himself a regular in high-stakes gambling parties attended by only the most affluent of Paris. His tall stature and elegant dress allowed Law to charm his way across Europe's financial hubs, from Amsterdam to Venice. These travels heavily influenced Law's theories on monetary policy and the importance of paper money as credit. Law's idea of a centralised bank which would deal in a new form of paper money was years ahead of its time. Despite this forward concept, Law still championed mercantilist beliefs with the promotion of monopolistic companies through government charters.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Diligent: A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade |last=Robert |first=Harms |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=43\u201354}}</ref>\n\nThe wars waged by [[Louis XIV]] left the country completely wasted, both economically and financially. The resultant shortage of [[precious metal]]s led to a shortage of coins in circulation, which in turn limited the production of new coins. With the death of Louis XIV seventeen months after Law's arrival, the Duke of Orleans finally presented Law with the opportunity to display his ingenuity. Since, following the devastating [[War of the Spanish Succession]], France's economy was stagnant and her [[national debt]] was crippling, Law proposed to stimulate industry by replacing gold with paper credit and then increasing the supply of credit, and to reduce the national debt by replacing it with shares in economic ventures.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kduEtlToecC&pg=PA105 |title=John Law |author=Antoin E Murphy |publisher=Oxford U.

The second key feature of the proposal centred on the premise that this private bank was able to issue its own currency backed by [[Louis d'or|Louis of gold]]. This enabled the currency to be redeemed by the weight of silver from the original deposit instead of the fluctuating value of the [[French livre|livres]] which had been devaluing rapidly.<ref name=\"Velde07\">{{Cite journal |last=Velde |first=Fran\u00e7ois R. |date=May 2007 |title=John Law's System |journal=American Economic Review |volume=97 |issue=2 |jstor=30034460}}</ref>{{rp|277}}\n\nIn May 1716 Law set up the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Priv\u00e9e (\"General Private Bank\"), which developed the use of paper money.<ref>BACKHOUSE, Roger, ''Economists and the economy: the evolution of economic ideas'', Transaction Publishers, 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-56000-715-9}}, p. 118</ref>\nIt was one of only six such banks to have issued paper money, joining Sweden, England, Holland, Venice, and Genoa.<ref name=nyfed>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2014/01/crisis-chronicles-the-mississippi-bubble-of-1720-and-the-european-debt-crisis.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York: \"Crisis Chronicles: The Mississippi Bubble of 1720 and the European Debt Crisis\" (Narron and Skeie)]</ref> The bank was nationalised in December 1718 at Law's request.<ref name=\"Velde07\"/>{{rp|277}}\n\nFrom this new banking platform, Law was able to pursue the [[monopoly]] companies he envisioned by having France bankroll the endeavour with 100&nbsp;million ''livres'' in the form of company stock.

The share price rose to 1,000 livres before the second instalment was even due, and ordinary citizens flocked to Paris to participate.<ref name=nyfed/>\n</blockquote>\nIn October 1719 Law's Company lent the French state 1.5 billion livres at 3% to pay off the national debt, a transaction funded by issuing a further 300,000 shares in the company.<ref name=\"RSA91\">{{Cite journal |last1=Lande |first1=Lawrence |last2=Congdon |first2=Tim |date=January 1991 |title=John Law and the invention of paper money |journal=RSA Journal |volume=139 |issue=5414 |jstor=41375433}}</ref>{{rp|919}}<ref name=nyfed/>\n\nBetween May and December 1719 the market price of a share rose from 500 to 10,000 livres<ref name=\"Velde07\"/>{{rp|277}} and continued rising into early 1720, supported by Law's 4% dividend promise.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|143\u20134}} Under rapidly emerging price inflation,<ref name=nyfed/> Law sought to hold the share price at 9,000 livres in March 1720, and then on 21 May 1720 to engineer a controlled reduction in the value of both notes and the shares, a measure that was itself reversed 6 days later.<ref name=\"RSA91\"/>{{rp|920}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hayek |first=F A |title=The Trend of Economic Thinking |year=1991 |publisher=Liberty Fund |isbn=9780865977426 |page=162}}</ref><ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|147}} \n<blockquote>\nAs the public rushed to convert banknotes to coin, Law was forced to close the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for ten days, then limit the transaction size once the bank reopened. But the queues grew longer, the Mississippi Company stock price continued to fall, and food prices soared by as much as 60 percent.<ref name=nyfed/>\n</blockquote>\nThe fractional reserve ratio was one fifth,<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (5:55 of 9:44)</ref> and a Royal edict to criminalise the sale of gold was decreed.<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (6:45 of 9:44)</ref> A later Royal edict decreed that gold coin was illegal,<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (7:35 of 9:44)</ref> which was soon reversed,<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (7:55 of 9:44)</ref> leading 50 people to be stampeded to death.<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (8:00 of 9:44)</ref> The company's shares were ultimately rendered worthless, and initially inflated speculation about their worth led to widespread financial stress, which saw Law dismissed at the end of 1720 from his sinecure as Controller General<ref name=nyfed/> and his post as Chief Director of the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\n===Downfall===\nSpeculation gave way to panic as people flooded the market with future shares trading as high as fifteen thousand livres per share, while the shares themselves maintained at ten thousand livres each. By May 1720, prices fell to 4,000 livres per share, a 73% decrease within a year. The rush to convert paper money to coins led to sporadic bank hours and riots. Squatters now occupied the square of Palace Louis-le-Grand and openly attacked the financiers that inhabited the area. It was under these circumstances and the cover of night that John Law left Paris some seven months later, leaving all of his substantial property assets in France, including the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]] and at least twenty-one Chateaux which he had purchased over his years in Paris, for the repayment of creditors.\n\nThe descent of a relatively unknown man came as fast as his rise, leaving an economic power vacuum. Law's theories live on 300 years later and \"captured many key conceptual points which are very much a part of modern monetary theorizing\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kduEtlToecC&pg=PA1&lpg=PP1&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |title=John Law |author=Antoin E Murphy|publisher=Oxford U.

Law realised he would never return to France when Orl\u00e9ans died suddenly in 1723 and Law was granted permission to return to London, having received a pardon in 1719. He lived in London for four years and then moved to Venice, where he contracted [[pneumonia]] and died as a poor man in 1729.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[Sharon Condie]] and [[Richard Condie]]'s 1978 [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) [[animated short]] ''John Law and the Mississippi Bubble'' is a humorous interpretation.

As a result, the 216-year reign of the L\u00fd dynasty was ended, and the new Tr\u1ea7n dynasty was created on the first day of the twelfth lunar month ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]: December 31) 1225.{{sfn|Ng\u00f4 S\u0129 Li\u00ean|1993|pp=157\u2013158}}{{sfn|Chapuis|1995|p=79}}\n\n===Early Tr\u1ea7n===\n{{see also|Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng|Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng}}\nAfter the collapse of the L\u00fd Dynasty, Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ed9 was still afraid that the newly established Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty might be overthrown by its political opponents.

The church functioned as parish church for Howth until recent centuries, eventually being replaced by a church in the village due to the limitations of having to take a boat for every service. The Martello Tower, built in 1803, was one of three constructed in Howth on the instructions of the Duke of York to repel a possible invasion by Napoleon. Its window entrance, 5 metres above ground level, can be accessed by a rope that hangs down from the window.\n\nIn September 1852 a woman named Sarah Maria Louisa Kirwan was killed on the island; her husband, artist [[William Burke Kirwan]], was convicted of her murder.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irelandoldnews.com/Cavan/1852/Kirwan.html |newspaper=Anglo-Celt |title=The Ireland Eye Case \u2013 Trial of Mr William Burke Kirwan |date=16 December 1852 |location=Cavan |accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1853/01/15/75123762.pdf |newspaper=New York Times |title=The \"Ireland's Eye\" Murder |date=15 January 1853 |accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref> [[Matthias McDonnell Bodkin]] claimed in ''Famous Irish Trials'' that no murder had taken place, instead that Sarah Kirwan had drowned accidentally as a result of a fit.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/General/eyemurder.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224123125/http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/General/eyemurder.htm |archivedate=24 February 2014 |title=Famous Irish Trials |accessdate=11 July 2018 |first=Matthias McDonnell |last=Bodkin}}</ref>\n\n==Structure and fauna==\nIreland's Eye comprises the main island, a range of rocks and an islet called Thulla.

Eria was a woman's name and this became confused with Erin, derived from \u00c9ireann, the Irish name for Ireland. The [[Viking]]s substituted the word Island with ''ey'', their Norse equivalent, and so it became known as Erin's Ey and ultimately Ireland's Eye.

The church functioned as parish church for Howth until recent centuries, eventually being replaced by a church in the village due to the limitations of having to take a boat for every service.

Its window entrance, 5 metres above ground level, can be accessed by a rope that hangs down from the window.\n\nIn September 1852 a woman named Sarah Maria Louisa Kirwan was killed on the island; her husband, artist [[William Burke Kirwan]], was convicted of her murder.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irelandoldnews.com/Cavan/1852/Kirwan.html |newspaper=Anglo-Celt |title=The Ireland Eye Case \u2013 Trial of Mr William Burke Kirwan |date=16 December 1852 |location=Cavan |accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1853/01/15/75123762.pdf |newspaper=New York Times |title=The \"Ireland's Eye\" Murder |date=15 January 1853 |accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref> [[Matthias McDonnell Bodkin]] claimed in ''Famous Irish Trials'' that no murder had taken place, instead that Sarah Kirwan had drowned accidentally as a result of a fit.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/General/eyemurder.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224123125/http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/General/eyemurder.htm |archivedate=24 February 2014 |title=Famous Irish Trials |accessdate=11 July 2018 |first=Matthias McDonnell |last=Bodkin}}</ref>\n\n==Structure and fauna==\nIreland's Eye comprises the main island, a range of rocks and an islet called Thulla.

At the age of 18, she went to Milano to complete her education, and there she graduated in 1972 (Lingue e Letterature Straniere Moderne - Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano). \nShe has been defined \u201ca traveller between worlds and a weaver of space-time connections for her ability of embracing distant wide horizons with a loving insight\u201d (Livia Geloso, [http://www.enciclopediadelledonne.it/biografie/luciana-percovich/ www.enciclopediadelledonne.it/biografie/luciana-percovich/]).\n\n== Women\u2019s Movement ==\nSince then, she lived and worked in Milano as a teacher, a translator, an author and an activist in many pioneering projects of the Women\u2019s Movement (women\u2019s health centers, bookshops, cultural and political training, publishing houses, etc.). \nDuring the university years, marked by the students\u2019 movement of 1968, she met the first women\u2019s consciousness rising groups which were bringing their critic to the core of the social economic and political structure. ''Patriarchal Attitudes'' (1970) by Eva Figes, one of the first feminist texts to be read in Italy, was for her a turning point. She joined Lotta Femminista, a group investigating the invisible economic role of female unpaid work, and soon after a collective on female body and health. They produced and published on their own ''Anticoncezionali dalla parte della donna (Birth control from the Women\u2019s side'', 1974, translated in Portuguese in 1978), opened one of the first women\u2019s health clinics in a popular district of Milano, introduced the self-help practice brought to Italy from Los Angeles and by the Boston Women\u2019s Health Collective.  Within a couple of years, a multifaceted Health Women Movement spread all over Italy, which discussed and promoted information in national conferences in Milano, Rome, Florence. A law opening public health services for women was issued in 1975.\n\nA small pamphlet, ''Witches, Midwives and Nurses'' by B. Ehrenreich and D. English brought from the US - which reconstructed from a totally new perspective who were the Witches and why they were burned for more than three centuries, was translated by Luciana and became a most popular text. Its publication (''Le Streghe siamo noi. Il ruolo della medicina nella repression della donna'', 1977) opened her first editorial experience as chief editor of a series of books called \u201cIl Vaso Di Pandora\u201d for La Salamandra Edizioni, a university publisher in Milano which was, together with La Tartaruga Edizioni-Milano and  Edizioni delle Donne-Roma, one of the three independent  feminist publishers of the Seventies and on.\nThis series of books lasted until 1986, and introduced to Italian readers works such as ''A Literature of One\u2019s own'' by E. Showalter and ''A feeling for the Organism'', by [[Evelyn Fox Keller]] on Nobel Prize [[Barbara McClintock]]. \n\nFrom 1975 to 1986 she was part of the Libreria delle Donne di Milano, which issued a series of periodical publications as vehicles of their political and cultural collective research (''Sottosopra'' and the ''Catalogues of the Bookshop''), and of the women\u2019s centres in Milano (Collettivo di Via Cerubini, Collettivo di Via Col di Lana, Cicip & Ciciap, Libera Universit\u00e0 delle Donne). She travelled frequently to Roma, Firenze and Pescara and wrote articles for the women\u2019s reviews of that time, as ''Sottosopra'', ''Orsaminore'', ''Reti'', ''Lapis'', ''Fluttuaria'', ''Madreperla''.\n\n==The fields of Science and Environment==\nIn 1985 she had a son, with her life-long companion Giancarlo De Marinis. The Chernobyl disaster (April 26, 1986) acted as a stimulus to a deeper research in the fields of Science and Environment, themes become central in her research since the groups on women\u2019s health and medicine. \nShe taught at the Free Women\u2019s University affording a variety of topics, ranging from female aggressivity (1995), to women and Islam (1996) and the Cyber revolution (1997). She cooperated with different '''Centri Documentazione Donne''' in various parts of Italy. In the same years, she was a member of the '''Commissione Consultiva sui Temi della Donna della Provincia di Milano''' (Milan Provincial Commission on Women\u2019s issues).\nIn 1990 she was awarded for the translation of ''Memoirs of a Space Woman'' by Naomi Mitchison (Premio Citt\u00e0 di Monselice for Literary and Scientific Translation - chairmen Franco Fortini and Mario Luzi, ''Diario di una Astronauta'', La Tartaruga, 1988), and produced some titles by female authors in Science Fiction. \n\n== The Sacred Feminine ==\nA new horizon opened during her travel to Australia where she met in Alice Springs the indigenous vision of life/nature/religion. Through the Aranda culture, as narrated by T.G.H. Strehlow (whose ''Central Australian Religion. Personal Monotemism in a Polytotemic Comunity'' she translated in 1997), she entered the path of the Sacred Feminine, that is of a radically different vision of the terrain occupied by monotheistic male religions in Europe and elsewhere. For some years, she investigated shamanic and kundalini practices, while reading a series of books produced by the pioneer women anthropologists and theologians of the Seventies and eventually the work of  [[Marija Gimbutas|Marija Gimbutas]]. Reconstructing her-story (or history before the advent of patriarchy), reclaiming a cosmo-biological vision of the \u201cdivine in nature\u201d (or \u201cinclusive transcendence\u201d in the words of the radical feminist theologian [[Mary Daly]]), investigating on myths and on the symbolic language of societies with  \u201cwomen at the centre\u201d have become the focus of her research from then on.\n\nMary Daly was invited to Italy by the Universit\u00e0 delle donne di Milano in 2002 and by Armonie \u2013 Bologna in 2004. During that conference, \u201cDopo la Dea\u201d, she met an independent publisher, Chiara Orlandini - '''Venexia Editrice''',  and together they convened translating ''Quintessence'' by Daly and beginning a new collection of books on Women\u2019s history and spirituality, which was called '''\u201cLe Civette Saggi\u201d''' (2005).\nThe same year, for the Fondazione Badaracco/Archivi Riuniti delle Donne di Milano she published ''La Coscienza nel Corpo. Donne salute e medicina negli anni Settanta'', a well-documented history of the health movement in Italy during the Seventies.\nRetired from teaching at the Liceo Classico Manzoni di Milano, she moved to the country, to join the small familiar organic farm in Abruzzo.\n\nIn the following years she has introduced, and made their books available to Italian readers, the works of many women authors ([[Mary Daly]], [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Vicki Noble]], [[Tsultrim Allione]], [[Starhawk]], [[Genevieve Vaughan]], [[Phyllis Currott]], [[Kathy Jones]], [[Heide Goettner-Abendroth]] among others). \nWith Laima Association, the International Indigenous Cultures of Peace conferences have been organized in Torino (2012, 2013, 2015) and in Rome (in honor of Marija Gimbutas, 20 years after her death, 2014). \nIn 2015 she has presented a panel on Earth based Spirituality of the Native cultures of the Past and Present at The Parliament of World Religions, in Salt Lake City, Utah, Usa; in 2016 she was invited at the Goddess Conference in Glastonbury, GB. \nShe works on the archetypes of the Goddess and in Crone Circles, a project to reclaim the Wise Women of the matriarchal traditions.\n\n== Books ==\n* ''Posizioni amorali e relazioni etiche'', Melusine, Milano 1993. \n* ''La coscienza nel corpo.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

{"title_page": "Concessions and leases in international relations", "text_new": "{{Original research|date=May 2015}}\nIn [[international relations]], a '''concession''' is a \"[[:wikt:synallagmatic|synallagmatic]] act by which a State transfers the exercise of rights or functions proper to itself to a foreign private person which, in turn, participates in the performance of public functions and thus gains a privileged position vis-a-vis other private law subjects within the jurisdiction of the State concerned.\"<ref name=Grantconcession>John P. Grant and J. Craig Barker (eds.), [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195389777.001.0001/acref-9780195389777-e-445 \"Concession, concessionary contract\"], in ''Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law'', 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2009). Accessed 23 February 2019. The definition is that of Peter Fischer, ''Die Internationale Konzession''.</ref> International concessions are not defined in [[international law]] and do not generally fall under it. Rather, they are governed by the [[municipal law]] of the [[Concession (contract)|conceding]] state. There may, however, be a law of succession for such concessions, whereby the concession is continued even when the conceding state ceases to exist.<ref name=Grantconcession/>\n\nIn international law, a '''lease''' is \"an arrangement whereby territory is [[lease]]d or [[Pledge (law)|pledged]] by the owner-State to another State. In such cases, sovereignty is, for the term of the lease, transferred to the lessee State.\"<ref name=Grantlease>John P. Grant and J. Craig Barker (eds.), [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195389777.001.0001/acref-9780195389777-e-1312 \"Lease, international\"], in ''Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law'', 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2009). Accessed 23 February 2019.</ref> The term \"international lease\" is sometimes also used to describe any leasing of property by one state to another or to a foreign national, but the normal leasing of property, as in [[Diplomatic law|diplomatic premises]], is governed by municipal, not international, law. Sometimes the term \"quasi-international lease\" is used for leases between states when less than full sovereignty over a territory is involved. A true international lease, or \"political\" lease, involves the transfer of sovereignty for a specified period of time. Although they may have the same character as [[cession]]s, the terminability of such leases is now fully accepted.<ref name=Grantlease/>\n\n\n==Austro-Hungarian concession holders==\n*One of the [[concessions in Tianjin#Austro-Hungarian concession (1901-1917)|concessions in Tianjin]] (Tientsin), in China (1901\u20131917). Officially surrendered by Austria in 1919 ([[Treaty of Saint-Germain]]) and Hungary in 1920 respectively ([[Treaty of Trianon]]).\n\n==Belgian concession holders==\n*The [[Guatemala]]n parliament issued a decree on 4 May 1843 by virtue of which the district of [[Santo Tom\u00e1s de Castilla|Santo Tomas]] was given \"in perpetuity\" to the ''Compagnie belge de colonisation'', a private Belgian company under the protection of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]]. Belgian colonizing efforts ceased after a few years, due to the lack of financial means and the harsh climate.\n*The [[Lado enclave]], in the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], leased to the [[Congo Free State]] (not a part of Belgium itself, but in a personal union with Belgium under [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]) (1894\u20131910)\n*Belgian [[Concessions in Tianjin#Belgian concession|Concession in Tianjin]] (Tientsin) (1902\u20131931)\n\n==British concession holders==\n\n===Held by the United Kingdom===\n*On 9 June 1898, the [[New Territories]] (comprising areas north of Kowloon along with 230 small islands) were leased from China for 99 years as a leased territory under the [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory]]. On 19 December 1984, the UK agreed to [[handover of Hong Kong|restore all of Hong Kong]]\u2014including the territories ceded in perpetuity\u2014to China on 1 July 1997. \n*On 20 November 1846, a British concession in [[Shanghai]] (in China) was established (after the 16 June 1842 \u2013 29 August 1842 [[First Opium War|British occupation of Shanghai]], since 17 November 1843 a Treaty Port); on 27 November 1848, this concession was expanded, but on 21 September 1863 (after the 1862 proposal to make Shanghai an independent \"free city\" was rejected) an International Settlement in Shanghai was created by union of the American and British concessions (consummated in December 1863). \n*The British [[Concessions in Tianjin#British concession|concession in Tianjin]] (Tientsin), in which the trade centred, was situated on the right bank of the river Peiho below the native city, occupying some {{convert|200|acre|km2}}. It was held on a lease in perpetuity granted by the Chinese government to the British Crown, which sublet plots to private owners in the same way as at [[Hankou District|Hankou]] (Hankow). The local management was entrusted to a municipal council organized on lines similar to those at Shanghai.<ref>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Tientsin |volume=26 |page=963 |inline=1}}</ref>\n* The British concession on the [[Shamian Island]] (Shameen Island) in [[Guangzhou]] (Canton).\n\n===Privately held===\n*[[Tati Concessions Land]] 1872\u20131911, in a small part of present [[Botswana]], detached from the [[Matabele kingdom]].\n\n==Canadian concessions==\nFollowing the [[First World War]] the Republic of [[France]] granted [[Canada]] perpetual use of a portion of land on [[Vimy Ridge]] under the understanding that the Canadians were to use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial. The park, known as the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial]], contains an impressive monument to the fallen, a museum and extensive recreations of the wartime trench system, preserved tunnels and cemeteries.\n\n==Chinese concessions==\nBetween 1882 and 1884, the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing Empire]] obtained concessions in [[Korea]] at [[Incheon]], [[Busan]] and [[Wonsan]]. The concessions were occupied by Japan in 1894 after the outbreak of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. After China's defeat in that war, Korea (now with Japanese support) declared the unequal treaties with Qing China to be void, and unilaterally withdrew the extraterritoriality and other powers granted to China in respect of the concessions. The concessions were formally abolished in 1898.\n\n==French concessions==\n*The [[Shanghai French Concession|French concession in Shanghai]] was established on 6 April 1849 (it had been a [[Treaty Port]] since 17 November 1843). On 17 July 1854 a Municipal Council established. The concession was relinquished by [[Vichy France]] to a Japan-sponsored puppet government in China, and was formally returned to China by France in 1946. \n*[[Concessions in Tianjin#French concession|Tianjin]] (Tientsin) (1860-1946)\n*One of the concessions in [[Hankou District|Hankou]] (Hankow; 1898\u20131946; now part of [[Wuhan]])\n*The French concession on the [[Shamian Island]] (Shameen Island) in [[Guangzhouwan|Guangzhou]] (Canton) (1861-1946)\n\n==German concessions==\nAll in China:\n*On 6 March 1898, [[Qingdao]] (Tsingtao) was leased \"for 99 years\" to [[Germany]] ([[Kiautschou Bay concession]]); it was already occupied by Germany since 14 November 1897. On 23 August 1914, [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] canceled the German lease. The concession was [[Siege of Tsingtao|occupied by Japan]] on 7 November 1914. \n*One of the [[Concessions in Tianjin]] (Tientsin)\n*One of the concessions in [[Hankou District|Hankou]] (Hankow; now a part of [[Wuhan]])\n\n==Italian concession==\n* A [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession zone]] in [[Tianjin]] (Tientsin) was conceded to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] by [[Qing China]] on 7 September 1901. It was administered by Italy's [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] and had a population of 6,261 in 1935, including 536 foreigners.\n* Several ships of the Italian Royal Navy (''[[Regia Marina]]'') were based at Tianjin. During [[World War II]], the primary Italian vessels based at Tianjin were the [[minelayer]] ''Lepanto'' and the [[gunboat]] ''Carlotto''. \n* On 10 September 1943, the Italian concession at Tianjin was occupied by [[Japan]]. In 1943, Italian Fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s (however virtually powerless) [[Italian Social Republic]] relinquished the concession to the Japanese-sponsored [[Wang Jingwei Government|'Chinese National Government']], a Japanese [[puppet state]] led by [[Wang Jingwei]]; it was never recognized by the Kingdom of Italy, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], or most world governments. On 10 February 1947, by [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|peace treaty]], the zone was formally returned to [[China|Nationalist China]] by the [[Italy|Republic of Italy]].\n\n==Japanese concessions==\nIn China:\n*the only non-Western [[concessions in Tianjin|concession in Tianjin]] (Tientsin).\n*the only non-Western concession in [[Hankou District|Hankou]] (Hankow; today a part of [[Wuhan]]).\n\nIn Korea (Chosen), before the Annex of Japan-Korea (1910):\n*Busan\n*Incheon\n\n==Portuguese concession==\n*[[Portuguese Macau|Macau]]: around 1552\u20131553, the Portuguese obtained permission to establish a settlement as a reward for defeating pirates and to mediate in trade between China and Japan and between both nations and Europe; it was leased from the empire of China from 1670. The concession turned into a Portuguese colony in mid-19th Century. The Chinese government assumed sovereignty over Macau on 20 December 1999, ending 329 years of Portuguese colonial rule.\n\n==Romanian concession==\n*[[Romanian concession in Sarand\u00eb|Sarand\u00eb concession]]: a coastal territory in the [[Albania]]n town of [[Sarand\u00eb]]; awarded by [[King Zog of Albania]] to the Romanian historian and politician [[Nicolae Iorga]], who in turn donated half of this territory to the Romanian State on 13 August 1934.

The area is host to the [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] and several other natural attractions, which draw considerable numbers of [[tourists]] and [[naturalists]].\n\n[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] has called the Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological Reserve \"the jewel in the crown of [[cloud forest]] reserves\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://traveler.nationalgeographic.com/books-excerpts/top-ten-costa-rica-text |title=Top Ten Costa Rica - National Geographic Traveler |publisher=Traveler.nationalgeographic.com |date=}}</ref> [[Newsweek]] has declared Monteverde the world's #14 \"Place to Remember Before it Disappears\".

This includes Santa Elena, the area's largest town and tourist hub, as well as the nearby cluster of homes and businesses known as [[Cerro Plano]], the community of Monteverde, and numerous reserves and attractions in the wider region.\n\n==Climate==\nResting roughly at {{convert|1400|m|ft}} above sea level, Monteverde is misty, humid, and windy, with a mean annual temperature of {{convert|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (Nadkarni 2000: 17). Annual rainfall averages around {{convert|3000|mm|in|0}}. Humidity oscillates between 74% and 97% (Nadkarni 2000: 34).\n\n==History==\n\nVarious [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] artifacts testify to the existence of small populations of [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], who once farmed in villages in the area circa 3000 BC. Between roughly 3300 BC to 2000 BC, the nearby tribes of the Arenal area experienced a population decline. These nearby tribes re-established villages in the region between 2000 BC to 500 BC. Agriculture intensified in the 500 BC to AD 300 period, with [[chiefdom]] societies replacing small [[tribal]] societies. Intense deforestation accompanied [[horticulture]], and stone foundations dating to this period can be found. [[Costa Rican jade tradition|Jade]] objects became prominent characteristics of these villages. From AD 300 to 800, complex chiefdoms supplanted simpler chiefdoms and more intricate villages appear, with [[cemeteries]], [[public squares]],  [[gold-work]] and inter-tribal trade and conflict. Around 1300, a general decline in population occurred, possibly due to [[Arenal Volcano]]'s increased activity.<ref name='Nadkarni'>Nadkarni, Nalini. Monteverde. 1. Berlin: Oxford University, 1999.</ref>{{rp|408\u2013409}}\n\nAfter the [[Spain|Spanish]] made landfall in 1502, Costa Rica endured two generations of [[warfare]]. Nationwide indigenous populations fell from an estimated 400,000 to 80,000 within little more than 50 years. However, unlike Costa Rica's neighbors, Nicaragua and Panama, Costa Rica did not yield considerable amounts of Indian labor or mineral resources, and thus the region experienced colonization at a much slower rate than many other Spanish colonies.\n\n===Early 20th century===\n\nIn the first three decades of the 20th century, [[Creole peoples|Creole]] populations arrived in small numbers to what is now called Monteverde. Many either worked for the [[Guacimal District|Guacimal]] gold mines or provided its workers with goods and services. Some families also settled the nearby lower, warmer valley of San Luis.<ref name='Nadkarni'/>{{rp|353}}\n\n===1950s and forwards===\n\nWhat is now considered Monteverde was founded by [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] from the [[United States]] whose pacifist values led them to defy the American draft before the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|page=85}}</ref> The majority of these settlers hailed from [[Fairhope, Alabama]], and included some non-Quaker pacifists and conscientious objectors.

Annual rainfall averages around {{convert|3000|mm|in|0}}. Humidity oscillates between 74% and 97% (Nadkarni 2000: 34).\n\n==History==\n\nVarious [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] artifacts testify to the existence of small populations of [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], who once farmed in villages in the area circa 3000 BC. Between roughly 3300 BC to 2000 BC, the nearby tribes of the [[Arenal Tilaran Conservation Area|Arenal]] area experienced a population decline. These nearby tribes re-established villages in the region between 2000 BC to 500 BC. Agriculture intensified in the 500 BC to AD 300 period, with [[chiefdom]] societies replacing small [[tribal]] societies. Intense deforestation accompanied [[horticulture]], and stone foundations dating to this period can be found. [[Costa Rican jade tradition|Jade]] objects became prominent characteristics of these villages. From AD 300 to 800, complex chiefdoms supplanted simpler chiefdoms and more intricate villages appear, with [[cemeteries]], [[public squares]],  [[gold-work]] and inter-tribal trade and conflict. Around 1300, a general decline in population occurred, possibly due to [[Arenal Volcano]]'s increased activity.<ref name='Nadkarni'>Nadkarni, Nalini. Monteverde. 1.

Nationwide indigenous populations fell from an estimated 400,000 to 80,000 within little more than 50 years. However, unlike Costa Rica's neighbors, Nicaragua and Panama, Costa Rica did not yield considerable amounts of Indian labor or mineral resources, and thus the region experienced colonization at a much slower rate than many other Spanish colonies.\n\n===Early 20th century===\n\nIn the first three decades of the 20th century, [[Creole peoples|Creole]] populations arrived in small numbers to what is now called Monteverde.
