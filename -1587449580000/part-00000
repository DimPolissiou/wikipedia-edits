Two options were discussed at the hearing. The commission, in response to intense requests from riders on the line, called for the introduction of express service between Atlantic Avenue and Utica Avenue on tracks which had been unused since the line's opening in 1920. It proposed extending half of 4 trains from Atlantic Avenue to New Lots Avenue, running express to Utica Avenue. The introduction of express service would have made it possible to run 30 more trains per hour east of Atlantic Avenue (27 trains per hour had been operating), decreasing overcrowding from 325% to 185%. The plan preferred by the IRT was to place 70 cars on the West Side Line for service to Flatbush Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue and New Lots Avenue, and 40 additional cars for service along Eastern Parkway.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35414638/times-union/|title=I.R.T.

The IRT stated that two minutes would not be enough time to turn around trains terminating at Atlantic Avenue while maintaining the headway between trains and that this service pattern would risk train collisions. Operating this service pattern would have required 2 minutes and 45 seconds to turn around trains, which would reduce capacity by 25%. While operating all 4 trains to Utica Avenue would have obviated the problem, the IRT did not have enough cars to run such a service. Instead, the Transit Commission accepted the IRT's plan to allocate 70 new cars to West Side express service to Brooklyn.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35414788/the-standard-union/|title=Orders I.R.T. to Improve Service|date=November 17, 1924|work=Brooklyn Standard Union|access-date=March 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Express service along Eastern Parkway would start at the earliest in February 1925 when additional new cars arrived.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35414740/the-brooklyn-citizen/|title=Hundred I.R.T.

During a one hour period, four morning weekday rush hour trains from Woodlawn only stopped at Mosholu Parkway, Burnside Avenue and 149th Street\u2013Grand Concourse before resuming regular service in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The express was expected to save riders 3.5 minutes. The pilot was made possible due to signaling upgrades to the line's center track made as part of the 2005\u20142009 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Program.<ref name=\"MTA-June2009Pilot\">{{cite press release|title=MTA New York City Transit Pilots Bronx Express Service Along the Jerome Ave. Line|url=http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mta-new-york-city-transit-pilots-bronx-express-service-along-jerome-ave|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/events/BronxExpressPilot.htm|title=Bronx Express Pilot Program June 8 to 26, Monday to Friday, 7 AM to 8 AM|last=|first=|date=June 10, 2009|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610212200/http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/events/BronxExpressPilot.htm|archivedate=June 10, 2009|access-date=September 23, 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn July 6, 2009, select Bronx bound 4 trains began running express from 167th Street to Burnside Avenue to terminate at the latter station before running out of service to the Jerome Yard.\n\nOn October 26, 2009, another 4 express pilot program was implemented based on the success of the first and ran until December 11, 2009.

Two options were discussed at the hearing. The commission, in response to intense requests from riders on the line, called for the introduction of express service between Atlantic Avenue and Utica Avenue on tracks which had been unused since the line's opening in 1920. It proposed extending half of 4 trains from Atlantic Avenue to New Lots Avenue, running express to Utica Avenue. The introduction of express service would have made it possible to run 30 more trains per hour east of Atlantic Avenue (27 trains per hour had been operating), decreasing overcrowding from 325% to 185%. The plan preferred by the IRT was to place 70 cars on the West Side Line for service to Flatbush Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue and New Lots Avenue, and 40 additional cars for service along Eastern Parkway.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35414638/times-union/|title=I.R.T.

The IRT stated that two minutes would not be enough time to turn around trains terminating at Atlantic Avenue while maintaining the headway between trains and that this service pattern would risk train collisions. Operating this service pattern would have required 2 minutes and 45 seconds to turn around trains, which would reduce capacity by 25%. While operating all 4 trains to Utica Avenue would have obviated the problem, the IRT did not have enough cars to run such a service.

This means that small family owned restaurants and businesses have been moving out and bigger Western style places are moving in (Pacific Coffee, Starbucks, Jaspas, Dymocks) all of which are increasing rents in the area and unfortunately, animosity toward the school from longtime residents as well. Be aware that Sai Kung is just over an hour away from central. If you are single you might not want to live so far away from the heartbeat of the city. Some teachers commute in every day using a combination of taxi shares and carpools in the morning and public transport to get home; others live in Sai Kung and enjoy the openness and greenery of Sai Kung. If you enjoy the outdoors and a quiet night life, then you might enjoy living here. I found working at Hong Kong Academy the most frustrating of my entire teaching career, and was not alone in this assessment. The majority of teachers here are dissatisfied with their lot but fail to speak up for several reasons. First and foremost administrators at HKA are not leading with compassion and intellect but with, as American president Dwight D. Eisenhower once coined, \u201cmisplaced power\u201d. Teachers are consistently treated like worker-bees, being told what to do with little appreciation for their contributions and/or hard work. They have no voice when it comes to school policy, nor is there a system in place for genuine feedback or even back-and-forth dialogue. Teachers who are more verbal in their attempts to have an open dialogue are frequently not offered contract renewals; this was true during my time there and has continued to be true since my departure. Teachers are reviewed annually using Instructional Rounds, where teaching teams are observed by a team of administrators and teachers, and observations are shared with \u201cI saw....\u201d statements. Though it felt validating to be noticed no new information was shared, no genuine feedback was given, and no recommendations for improvements were given. The rounds inform administrators in knowing what is going on in the classroom and provides them with a greater understanding of their teacher\u2019s unique skills, but is a far cry from teachers receiving specific feedback for the work that they do. To add to the frustration level administrators frequently say one thing, then model another. They constantly talk about collaboration and diversity, yet they rarely collaborate with their teachers and have a system in place that lacks diversity among the staff. Hong Kong might be a good choice for relocation but there are lots of other schools in this city that offer better packages, pay, location and certainly a more fulfilling work environment. <ref> name= \"International School Reviews\">{{cite web | title= HKA International School Reviews| publisher= International School Reviews | url=https://www.internationalschoolsreview.com/members/hongkongacademy.htm | accessdate= 2012-03-03}}</ref>\n\n''Sample Two:''\n\nThe school was founded to intentionally support a range of learners. As a young school that started with 3 students and grown to 600 there are bound to be some growing pains and those who want things to stay just as they were when it was a much smaller institution. With growth and change, it can cause discomfort, frustration and even push back. However it can also present exciting opportunities. The school has taken these opportunities to establish itself as a lead learning institution within Hong Kong and the greater international community. Professional Development is very important to the school and expects it for their teachers to continue to improve and reflect on their practice.\n\n... All schools have areas they are developing in and areas that are real strengths. HKA prides itself on being mission driven and tries to embed that in all initiatives taken throughout the school. I have been with the school for many years and it is definitely a busy place with high expectations and standards for itself. An school that supports student learning should hold not only students to this standard but all the faculty. If hard work is something you shy away from and instead spend time complaining perpetuating a \"conspiracy theory\" than this is not the place for you. Teachers can be involved as much as they'd like, however if you do, know that with this involvement comes more responsibility.\n\nSai Kung is beautiful place to live with a lot of outdoor activities. It is also one of the safest places I have ever lived in. The families and teachers care a lot about what they do and how it is viewed by all stakeholders. Every school is not for everyone and its important that a teacher coming here is dedicated to the maintenance and growth of the program, students and mission.\n\n=== Student/ Parent Reviews ===\nGoogle reviews by students and parents rate Hong Kong Academy a 3.8/5 and its facebook reviews have been deleted by the administration.

Students study four International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Programme (PYP) units of inquiry, integrating [[Art]], [[Music]], [[Physical Education]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. The school claims there are at least two full-time teachers in each class, however, it does not specify whether the second teacher is in fact a qualified full-time instructor. Stating that in PK1 and PK2, there is one English-speaking and one Mandarin-speaking teacher.\n\n=== Primary school ===\nHKA has adopted the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme. The school chose the PYP intentionally because of its curriculum and its focus on personal development. The PYP's transdisciplinary approach to learning promotes creative questioning and meaningful exploration of themes. Using \u201cUnits of Inquiry\u201d, students develop core competencies in mathematics and language arts within and across themes in a context that promotes learning for understanding.\n\nThe primary school is led by a principal, an assistant principal and PYP coordinator, and a counsellor. For students receiving learner support, the Learner Support Team works closely with teachers and with the primary school leadership.\n\n=== Secondary school ===\nStudents in grades 6-10 follow the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme. The full full IB Diploma Programme is available to grade 11 and 12 students.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>\n\n=== Diploma Options ===\nStudents at HKA are given the opportunity to qualify for the HKA Diploma and/or a mix of Diploma Certificates or the full IB Diploma. Qualification for the HKA High School Diploma is determined by credits awarded in the final four years of school.\n\n==== Option 1: HKA Diploma ====\nStudents must earn 26 credits over four years (Grades 9-12) in order to obtain their HKA Diploma.  A credit is earned by earning a year-end mark of 3 (out of a possible 7) or higher.\n\n==== Option 2: HKA Diploma and the IB DP ====\nStudents that choose to pursue the IB DP must complete all of the requirements of the IB DP during Grades 11 and 12. This includes scoring a minimum of 24 points on their 6 IB exams, and successful completion of the extended essay, CAS, and the Theory of Knowledge. Students successful in this option will have earned BOTH the HKA and IB DP.\n\n====Option 3: HKA Diploma and IB Certificates====\nStudents that do not choose the IB DP will sit for external IB examinations in May of their grade 12 year in SOME IB classes and SOME HKA classes.

This means that small family owned restaurants and businesses have been moving out and bigger Western style places are moving in (Pacific Coffee, Starbucks, Jaspas, Dymocks) all of which are increasing rents in the area and unfortunately, animosity toward the school from longtime residents as well. Be aware that Sai Kung is just over an hour away from central. If you are single you might not want to live so far away from the heartbeat of the city. Some teachers commute in every day using a combination of taxi shares and carpools in the morning and public transport to get home; others live in Sai Kung and enjoy the openness and greenery of Sai Kung. If you enjoy the outdoors and a quiet night life, then you might enjoy living here. I found working at Hong Kong Academy the most frustrating of my entire teaching career, and was not alone in this assessment. The majority of teachers here are dissatisfied with their lot but fail to speak up for several reasons. First and foremost administrators at HKA are not leading with compassion and intellect but with, as American president Dwight D. Eisenhower once coined, \u201cmisplaced power\u201d. Teachers are consistently treated like worker-bees, being told what to do with little appreciation for their contributions and/or hard work. They have no voice when it comes to school policy, nor is there a system in place for genuine feedback or even back-and-forth dialogue. Teachers who are more verbal in their attempts to have an open dialogue are frequently not offered contract renewals; this was true during my time there and has continued to be true since my departure. Teachers are reviewed annually using Instructional Rounds, where teaching teams are observed by a team of administrators and teachers, and observations are shared with \u201cI saw....\u201d statements. Though it felt validating to be noticed no new information was shared, no genuine feedback was given, and no recommendations for improvements were given. The rounds inform administrators in knowing what is going on in the classroom and provides them with a greater understanding of their teacher\u2019s unique skills, but is a far cry from teachers receiving specific feedback for the work that they do. To add to the frustration level administrators frequently say one thing, then model another. They constantly talk about collaboration and diversity, yet they rarely collaborate with their teachers and have a system in place that lacks diversity among the staff. Hong Kong might be a good choice for relocation but there are lots of other schools in this city that offer better packages, pay, location and certainly a more fulfilling work environment. <ref> name= \"International School Reviews\">{{cite web | title= HKA International School Reviews| publisher= International School Reviews | url=https://www.internationalschoolsreview.com/members/hongkongacademy.htm | accessdate= 2012-03-03}}</ref>\n\n''Sample Two:''\n\nThe school was founded to intentionally support a range of learners. As a young school that started with 3 students and grown to 600 there are bound to be some growing pains and those who want things to stay just as they were when it was a much smaller institution. With growth and change, it can cause discomfort, frustration and even push back. However it can also present exciting opportunities. The school has taken these opportunities to establish itself as a lead learning institution within Hong Kong and the greater international community. Professional Development is very important to the school and expects it for their teachers to continue to improve and reflect on their practice.\n\n... All schools have areas they are developing in and areas that are real strengths. HKA prides itself on being mission driven and tries to embed that in all initiatives taken throughout the school. I have been with the school for many years and it is definitely a busy place with high expectations and standards for itself. An school that supports student learning should hold not only students to this standard but all the faculty. If hard work is something you shy away from and instead spend time complaining perpetuating a \"conspiracy theory\" than this is not the place for you. Teachers can be involved as much as they'd like, however if you do, know that with this involvement comes more responsibility.\n\nSai Kung is beautiful place to live with a lot of outdoor activities. It is also one of the safest places I have ever lived in. The families and teachers care a lot about what they do and how it is viewed by all stakeholders. Every school is not for everyone and its important that a teacher coming here is dedicated to the maintenance and growth of the program, students and mission.\n\n=== Student/ Parent Reviews ===\nGoogle reviews by students and parents rate Hong Kong Academy a 3.8/5 and its facebook reviews have been deleted. <ref> name= \"Google Reviews\">{{cite web | title= Hong Kong Academy | publisher= Google | url=https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03vmySBbmB2gprkbFUAOKlr6Ql2GQ%3A1585800997531&ei=JWeFXtr4H4SU-gS87YawBQ&q=hong+kong+academy+review&oq=hong+kong+academy+review&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1CoAVioAWCwA2gAcAB4AIABAIgBAJIBAJgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXo&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwian5GJ8cjoAhUEip4KHby2AVYQ4dUDCAs&uact=5#lrd=0x3403ff970c8694f5:0xe547a8219abade64,1,,, | accessdate= 2012-03-03}}</ref> \nTo put this into perspective, Hong Kong International School (HKIS) has a 4.6/5 on Facebook. <ref> name= \"Facebook\">{{cite web | title= HKIS | publisher= Facebook | url=https://www.facebook.com/HongKongInternationalSchool/ | accessdate= 2012-03-03}}</ref>\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\n=== Early childhood ===\nThe Hong Kong Academy Early Childhood program consists of grades PK1-G1. Students study four International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Programme (PYP) units of inquiry, integrating [[Art]], [[Music]], [[Physical Education]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. The school claims there are at least two full-time teachers in each class, however, it does not specify whether the second teacher is in fact a qualified full-time instructor. Stating that in PK1 and PK2, there is one English-speaking and one Mandarin-speaking teacher.\n\n=== Primary school ===\nHKA has adopted the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme. The school chose the PYP intentionally because of its curriculum and its focus on personal development. The PYP's transdisciplinary approach to learning promotes creative questioning and meaningful exploration of themes. Using \u201cUnits of Inquiry\u201d, students develop core competencies in mathematics and language arts within and across themes in a context that promotes learning for understanding.\n\nThe primary school is led by a principal, an assistant principal and PYP coordinator, and a counsellor. For students receiving learner support, the Learner Support Team works closely with teachers and with the primary school leadership.\n\n=== Secondary school ===\nStudents in grades 6-10 follow the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme. The full full IB Diploma Programme is available to grade 11 and 12 students.<ref name=\"Profile\"/>\n\n=== Diploma Options ===\nStudents at HKA are given the opportunity to qualify for the HKA Diploma and/or a mix of Diploma Certificates or the full IB Diploma. Qualification for the HKA High School Diploma is determined by credits awarded in the final four years of school.\n\n==== Option 1: HKA Diploma ====\nStudents must earn 26 credits over four years (Grades 9-12) in order to obtain their HKA Diploma.  A credit is earned by earning a year-end mark of 3 (out of a possible 7) or higher.\n\n==== Option 2: HKA Diploma and the IB DP ====\nStudents that choose to pursue the IB DP must complete all of the requirements of the IB DP during Grades 11 and 12. This includes scoring a minimum of 24 points on their 6 IB exams, and successful completion of the extended essay, CAS, and the Theory of Knowledge. Students successful in this option will have earned BOTH the HKA and IB DP.\n\n====Option 3: HKA Diploma and IB Certificates====\nStudents that do not choose the IB DP will sit for external IB examinations in May of their grade 12 year in SOME IB classes and SOME HKA classes. They will earn IB certificates for subjects in which they sit for the IB examination.  \n\n===Learner support===\nChildren needing learning support are admitted upon the same criteria as other students.  They must be able to succeed in the mainstream classroom with support services. HKA learning support includes children who are performing beyond grade level expectations, those with [[physical disabilities]], or intellectual challenges, etc.\n\n==Campus==\nThe campus was located in [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lingnan+Middle+School,+15+Stubbs+Rd,+Hong+Kong/@22.2681015,114.17737,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3404004601dd3c3d:0xf516d524fdc4e704!8m2!3d22.2680966!4d114.179564 Wan Chai] and [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=12+ka+wai+man+road&hl=en&ll=22.281427,114.124893&spn=0.003663,0.006142&sll=22.338693,114.139865&sspn=0.234357,0.393105&vpsrc=6&t=m&z=18 Kennedy Town].

It can be caused by either [[livestock]] in poorly managed [[agriculture|agricultural]] applications, [[game reserve]]s, or [[nature reserve]]s. It can also be caused by immobile, travel restricted populations of [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] or [[Introduced species|non-native]] [[Wildlife|wild animals]]. However, \"overgrazing\" is a controversial concept, based on equilibrium system theory. A strong indicator of overgrazing is where additional feed needs to be brought in from outside the farm, often to support livestock through the winter. Traditionally this feed was sourced on the farm, with fewer animals being kept and some fields being used for hay and silage production. Modern farm businesses often choose to keep more animals than their land can support alone; buying in external feed to offset this.\n\nIt reduces the usefulness, [[primary productivity|productivity]], and [[biodiversity]] of the land and is one cause of [[desertification]] and [[erosion]]. Overgrazing is also seen as a cause of the spread of [[invasive species]] of [[invasive plant|non-native plants]] and of [[weed]]s. It is reversed or prevented by moving [[grazing|grazers]] in large herds, such as the American bison of the Great Plains,<ref>{{cite book |last=Laduke |first=Winona |date=1999 |title=All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life |url=https://archive.org/details/allourrelationsn00ladu |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=South End Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/allourrelationsn00ladu/page/146 146] |isbn=0896085996 |access-date=30 March 2015 |url-status=dead |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref name=\"Duke University\">{{cite web |url=https://twp.duke.edu/uploads/assets/Duval.pdf |title=Bison Conservation: Saving an Ecologically and Culturally Keystone Species |last1=Duval |first1=Clay |publisher=Duke University |access-date=April 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308011257/http://twp.duke.edu/uploads/assets/Duval.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2012 }}</ref> or migratory [[Wildebeest]]s of the African [[savanna]]s,<ref>In [[Predator\u2013prey equations|balance]] with, and accompanied by, prides of [[Keystone species#Predators|keystone predators]].</ref> or by [[Holistic management (agriculture)|holistic]] planned grazing.<ref name=\"Forbes-AS\">[https://www.forbes.com/sites/terrywaghorn/2012/12/20/holistic-land-management-key-to-global-stability/ \"Holistic Land Management: Key to Global Stability\"] by Terry Waghorn.

In some regions of the United States under continuous grazing, overgrazed pastures are predominated by short-grass species such as [[Poa|bluegrass]] and will be less than 2-3&nbsp;inches tall in the grazed areas. In other parts of the world, overgrazed pasture is typically taller than sustainably grazed pasture, with grass heights typically over 1 meter and dominated by unpalatable species such as ''[[Aristida]]'' or ''[[Imperata]]''. In all cases, palatable tall grasses such as [[orchard grass]] are sparse or non-existent. In such cases of overgrazing, soil may be visible between plants in the stand, allowing erosion to occur, though in many circumstances overgrazed pastures have a greater sward cover than sustainably grazed pastures.\n\n=== Rotational grazing ===\nUnder rotational grazing, overgrazed plants do not have enough time to recover to the proper height between grazing events. The animals resume grazing before the plants have restored carbohydrate reserves and grown back roots lost after the last [[defoliation]]. The result is the same as under continuous grazing: in some parts of the United States tall-growing species die and short-growing species that are more subject to drought injury predominate the pasture, while in most other parts of the world tall, drought tolerant, unpalatable species such as ''[[Imperata]]'' or ''[[Aristida]]'' come to dominate. As the sod thins, weeds encroach into the pasture in some parts of the [[United States]], whereas in most other parts of the world overgrazing can promote thick swards of native unpalatable grasses that hamper the spread of weeds.\n\nAnother indicator of overgrazing in some parts of [[North America]] is that livestock run out of pasture, and hay needs to be fed early in the fall. In contrast, most areas of the world do not experience the same climatic regime as the continental United States and hay feeding is rarely conducted.\n\nOvergrazing is also indicated in livestock performance and condition. Cows having inadequate pasture immediately following their [[calf (animal)|calf]]'s [[weaning]] may have poor body condition the following season. This may reduce the health and vigor of cows and calves at [[Birth|calving]]. Also, cows in poor body condition do not cycle as soon after calving, which can result in delayed breeding and a long calving season.

Soil fertility can sometimes be mitigated by applying the appropriate lime and [[organic fertilizer]]s. However, the loss of soil depth and organic matter takes centuries to correct. Their loss is critical in determining the soil's water-holding capacity and how well pasture plants do during dry weather. \n\nOvergrazing results in increased trampling of soil by livestock, which increases soil compaction (Fuls, 1992) and thus, decreases the permeability of the soil. Furthermore, with more exposure of soil due to the decrease in plant biomass, the soil is exposed to increased levels of direct rainfall, creating a crust layer that is compacted and impermeable. This impermeability is what increases runoff and soil erosion <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fuls |first1=E.R. |title=Ecosystem modification created by patch-overgrazing in semi-arid grassland |journal=Journal of arid environments |date=1992 |volume=23 |issue=1}}</ref>.  \n\nWith continued overutilization of land for grazing, there is an increase in degradation.

This means that a buffer needs to be in the system to adjust for the fastest growth of forages.\n\nAnother potential buffer is to plant warm-season perennial grasses such as [[switchgrass]], which do not grow early in the season. This reduces the area that the livestock can use early in the season, making it easier for them to keep up with the cool-season grasses. The animals then use the warm-season grasses during the heat of the summer, and the cool-season grasses recover for fall grazing.\n\nThe grazing guidelines in the table are for rotationally grazed, cool-season forages. When using continuous grazing, manage pasture height at one-half the recommended turn-in height for rotational grazing to optimize plant health. The growth habit of some forage species, such as [[alfalfa]], does not permit their survival under continuous grazing. When managing for legumes in the stand, it is beneficial to use rotational grazing and graze the stand close and then give adequate rest to stimulate the legumes' growth.\n\n==Economic theory==\n{{main|Common land}}\nOvergrazing is used as an example in the economic concept now known as the [[Tragedy of the Commons]] devised in a 1968 paper by [[Garrett Hardin]].<ref name=hardin68>Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 \"The Tragedy of the Commons\"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243-1248.

The Egyptian side, to the left, is overgrazed]]\n\n'''Overgrazing''' occurs when plants are exposed to intensive [[grazing]] for extended periods of time, or without sufficient recovery periods. It can be caused by either [[livestock]] in poorly managed [[agriculture|agricultural]] applications, [[game reserve]]s, or [[nature reserve]]s. It can also be caused by immobile, travel restricted populations of [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] or [[Introduced species|non-native]] [[Wildlife|wild animals]]. However, \"overgrazing\" is a controversial concept, based on equilibrium system theory. A strong indicator of overgrazing is where additional feed needs to be brought in from outside the farm, often to support livestock through the winter. Traditionally this feed was sourced on the farm, with fewer animals being kept and some fields being used for hay and silage production. Modern farm businesses often choose to keep more animals than their land can support alone; buying in external feed to offset this.\n\nIt reduces the usefulness, [[primary productivity|productivity]], and [[biodiversity]] of the land and is one cause of [[desertification]] and [[erosion]]. Overgrazing is also seen as a cause of the spread of [[invasive species]] of [[invasive plant|non-native plants]] and of [[weed]]s. It is reversed or prevented by moving [[grazing|grazers]] in large herds, such as the American bison of the Great Plains,<ref>{{cite book |last=Laduke |first=Winona |date=1999 |title=All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life |url=https://archive.org/details/allourrelationsn00ladu |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=South End Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/allourrelationsn00ladu/page/146 146] |isbn=0896085996 |access-date=30 March 2015 |url-status=dead |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref name=\"Duke University\">{{cite web |url=https://twp.duke.edu/uploads/assets/Duval.pdf |title=Bison Conservation: Saving an Ecologically and Culturally Keystone Species |last1=Duval |first1=Clay |publisher=Duke University |access-date=April 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308011257/http://twp.duke.edu/uploads/assets/Duval.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2012 }}</ref> or migratory [[Wildebeest]]s of the African [[savanna]]s,<ref>In [[Predator\u2013prey equations|balance]] with, and accompanied by, prides of [[Keystone species#Predators|keystone predators]].</ref> or by [[Holistic management (agriculture)|holistic]] planned grazing.<ref name=\"Forbes-AS\">[https://www.forbes.com/sites/terrywaghorn/2012/12/20/holistic-land-management-key-to-global-stability/ \"Holistic Land Management: Key to Global Stability\"] by Terry Waghorn.

In some regions of the United States under continuous grazing, overgrazed pastures are predominated by short-grass species such as [[Poa|bluegrass]] and will be less than 2-3&nbsp;inches tall in the grazed areas. In other parts of the world, overgrazed pasture is typically taller than sustainably grazed pasture, with grass heights typically over 1 meter and dominated by unpalatable species such as ''[[Aristida]]'' or ''[[Imperata]]''. In all cases, palatable tall grasses such as [[orchard grass]] are sparse or non-existent. In such cases of overgrazing, soil may be visible between plants in the stand, allowing erosion to occur, though in many circumstances overgrazed pastures have a greater sward cover than sustainably grazed pastures.\n\n=== Rotational grazing ===\nUnder rotational grazing, overgrazed plants do not have enough time to recover to the proper height between grazing events. The animals resume grazing before the plants have restored carbohydrate reserves and grown back roots lost after the last [[defoliation]]. The result is the same as under continuous grazing: in some parts of the United States tall-growing species die and short-growing species that are more subject to drought injury predominate the pasture, while in most other parts of the world tall, drought tolerant, unpalatable species such as ''[[Imperata]]'' or ''[[Aristida]]'' come to dominate. As the sod thins, weeds encroach into the pasture in some parts of the [[United States]], whereas in most other parts of the world overgrazing can promote thick swards of native unpalatable grasses that hamper the spread of weeds.\n\nAnother indicator of overgrazing in some parts of [[North America]] is that livestock run out of pasture, and hay needs to be fed early in the fall. In contrast, most areas of the world do not experience the same climatic regime as the continental United States and hay feeding is rarely conducted.\n\nOvergrazing is also indicated in livestock performance and condition. Cows having inadequate pasture immediately following their [[calf (animal)|calf]]'s [[weaning]] may have poor body condition the following season. This may reduce the health and vigor of cows and calves at [[Birth|calving]]. Also, cows in poor body condition do not cycle as soon after calving, which can result in delayed breeding and a long calving season. With good cow genetics, nutrition, ideal seasons and controlled breeding 55% to 75% of the calves should come in the first 21 days of the calving season. Poor weaning weights of calves can be caused by insufficient pasture, when cows give less milk and the calves need pasture to maintain weight gain.\n\n==Ecological impacts==\n{{see|land degradation}}\nOvergrazing typically increases [[soil erosion]].<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2009.

Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has [[export]] commodities that are not required in the region from which its major [[import]]s come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying [[trade imbalance]]s between the above regions.\n\nHistorically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of [[winds in the Age of Sail|winds and currents]] during the [[age of sail]].  For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going ''south'' of [[30th parallel north|30 N latitude]] and reaching the so-called \"[[trade winds]]\"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the [[Northern America|North American mainland]]. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the [[Gulf Stream]] in a northeasterly direction using the [[westerlies]]. A similar triangle to this, called the ''[[volta do mar]]'' was already being used by the Portuguese, before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage, to sail to the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. Columbus simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.\n\n==Atlantic triangular slave trade==\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Atlantic slave trade|Slave Coast of West Africa}}\n\nThe best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic [[slave trade]] that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between [[West Africa]],  [[Caribbean]] or [[Americas|America]]n colonies and the [[Europe]]an colonial powers, with the northern colonies of [[British North America]], especially [[New England]], sometimes taking over the role of Europe.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm About.com: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade].

Merchants purchased raw [[sugar]] (often in its liquid form, [[molasses]]) from plantations in the Caribbean and shipped it to New England and Europe, where it was sold to distillery companies that produced rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase rum, furs, and lumber in New England which merchants shipped to Europe.  With the profits from the European sales, merchants purchased Europe's manufactured goods, including tools and weapons.  Then the merchants shipped those manufactured goods, along with the American sugar and rum, to West Africa where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of slaves in Brazil, the Caribbean islands, and the American South were then used to buy more sugar, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.\n[[File:Luxborough galley burnt nearly to the water, 25 June 1727.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The loss of the slaver ''[[Luxborough Galley]]'' in 1727  (\"I.C. 1760\"), lost in the last leg of the triangular trade, between the Caribbean and Britain.]]\n[[File:North Atlantic Gyre.png|thumb|[[North Atlantic Gyre]]]]\nThe first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as [[copper]], [[cloth]], trinkets, [[slave beads]], [[guns]] and [[ammunition]].<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ Scotland and the Abolition of the Slave Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172434/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ |date=2012-01-03 }}.

On the second leg, ships made the journey of the [[Middle Passage]] from Africa to the [[New World]]. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the [[slave ship]]s. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port,<ref>A. P. Middleton, ''Tobacco Coast''.</ref> from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from [[Virginia]], [[tobacco]] and [[hemp]]. The ship then returned to Europe to complete the triangle.\n\nHowever, because of several disadvantages that slave ships faced compared to other trade ships, they often returned to their home port carrying whatever goods were readily available in the Americas and filled up a large part or all of their capacity with ballast. Other disadvantages include the different form of the ships (to carry as many humans as possible, but not ideal to carry a maximum amount of produce) and the variations in the duration of a slave voyage, making it practically impossible to pre-schedule appointments in the Americas, which meant that slave ships often arrived in the Americas out-of-season.  When the ships did reach their intended ports, only about 90% of the passengers survived the journey across the middle passage.  Due to the slaves being transported in tight, confined spaces, a significant percentage of the group that started perished on board or shortly after arrival due to disease and lack of nourishment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Death Toll From The Slave Trade|url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/Reports/Slavedeathtoll/slaverydeathtoll.html|publisher=World Future Fund|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|reason=|date=March 2018}} Cash crops were transported mainly by a separate fleet which only sailed from Europe to the Americas and back, mitigating the impact the slaves' involvement.

When the ships did reach their intended ports, only about 90% of the passengers survived the journey across the middle passage.  Due to the slaves being transported in tight, confined spaces, a significant percentage of the group that started perished on board or shortly after arrival due to disease and lack of nourishment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Death Toll From The Slave Trade|url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/Reports/Slavedeathtoll/slaverydeathtoll.html|publisher=World Future Fund|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|reason=|date=March 2018}} Cash crops were transported mainly by a separate fleet which only sailed from Europe to the Americas and back, mitigating the impact the slaves' involvement brought forth.
