The latter is predominantly a function of N domain portion on the ACE enzyme.

After studying at [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Meharry Medical College]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Emory conducted his residency at St. Paul's Hospital, which was the first major hospital in Dallas to grant staff privileges to African American doctors.\n\nEmory was a staff physician at [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) medical centers in Dallas and [[McKinney, Texas]], before beginning a private practice specializing in internal medicine in [[South Dallas]] in 1960. Starting in 1966, he specialized in psychiatry at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical School]] in Dallas, the [[Terrell State Hospital]], and the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Seagoville|Federal Correctional Institution]] in [[Seagoville, Texas]], before ultimately resuming private practice as a specialist in both internal medicine and psychiatry.\n\nEmory was also active in politics and the community. Although he was never elected, he ran for office several times, including twice for [[Mayor of Dallas]], once for the [[Dallas City Council]], and once for the [[Texas Legislature]]. He was a member of the Texas State Convention of the [[Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the World]], the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC)'s Dallas branch, and the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO)'s Dallas Council. He was also a member of the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\nEmerson Emory was born in [[Dallas]] on January 29, 1925 to Corry Bates Emory and Louise (Linthicum) Emory.

The Sibleys borrowed money and began clearing the overgrown property to convert it into a farm with livestock brought from Fort Osage.

As the work on Linden Wood continued, the idea of opening a boarding school evolved.<ref name=\"indom\"/><ref name=\"factbook\"/>\n\nMary Sibley took in students within a year of moving into the cabin.

As the work on Linden Wood continued, the idea of opening a boarding school evolved.<ref name=\"indom\"/><ref name=\"factbook\"/>\n\nMary Sibley took in students within a year of moving into the cabin.
