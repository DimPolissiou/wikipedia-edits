The area is administered by [[Dublin City Council]]. It was best known for decades as the location of [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)|St Brendan's Hospital]], which was the main psychiatric hospital serving the greater Dublin region. The area is currently the subject of a major redevelopment plan under the aegis of the [[Grangegorman Development Agency]], including the new [[Technological University Dublin]] campus.\n\nGrangegorman is also a [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in the historical [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]].<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/2977.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - Grangegorman civil parish</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Grangegorman, as with other [[placenames]] containing the name \"gorman\" in the [[Leinster]] region, probably indicates that at one time this territory was held by the [[U\u00ed Bairrche]], an [[Irish clans|Irish clan]] based in Leinster. The two main representatives of this clan were U\u00ed Treasaig (Tracey) and Mac Gorm\u00e1in (MacGorman).

Situated on North Brunswick Street, it now forms part of the Dublin operations of the Court Service.]]\nGrangegorman has evolved over time to its current boundaries, which, like those of most Dublin suburbs, are imprecise, while for the purposes of redevelopment, an extended \"neighbourhood\" was defined.  A major historic feature was the Bradogue River, now culverted but still cutting right through the area on its way to the [[River Liffey]].\n\n===Modern suburb of Grangegorman===\nGrangegorman is located in the [[Dublin 7]] [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]], north of the [[River Liffey]] and about 1&nbsp;km from [[Dublin]] city centre, and its boundaries run, approximately, along Brunswick Street North, Prussia Street and Manor Street, the [[R101 road (Ireland)|North Circular Road]] and Phibsborough Road and Constitution Hill. Grangegorman is surrounded to the south east by [[Smithfield, Dublin|Smithfield]] to the west by [[Stoneybatter]], north by [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]], to the north and east by [[Phibsborough]] / [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]].\n\nThe geographical definition of the north Dublin [[District Electoral Division|electoral division]] known as Arran Quay B, encompasses Grangegorman. The 2006 [[Census#Ireland|Census]] gives the population of Arran Quay B as 3,692. This represents a 19.5 per cent increase from the population of the area in 2002.<ref name=cso20065960>{{cite book|last=Central Statistics Office, Ireland|year=2007|url=http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Amended%20census2006_%20Volume%201%20Pop%20Classified%20by%20Area.pdf|title=Census 2006 Volume I: Population Defined by Area|location=Dublin|pages=59\u201360}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Grangegorman Development Agency|title=GDA Draft Strategic Plan 2010: Environmental Report|date=2 November 2010|location=Dublin|page=8 (chapter 6), fig 6.3|url=http://www.grangegormandevelopmentagency.ie/assets/strategic_plan/GG_Strategic_Plan_Corrected_Environmental_Report.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===The historical civil parish of Grangegorman===\nGrangegorman [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] consisted of five separate districts comprising Grangegorman North, South, East, West and Middle.

As shown, the original quadrangular building of the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum (1815) was built beside the new premises of the North Dublin Union. The Richmond Asylum also purchased land and constructed buildings on the western side of Grangegorman Lane. A tunnel running underground across Grangegorman Lane connected the east and west half of the Richmond's facilities. The original section on the eastern half became known as the \"lower house\" which that on the western side became known as the \"upper house\" or \"male house\". Not shown are the Hardwicke Fever Hospital (1803) or the Whitworth Chronic Hospital (1814) and its Dispensary (1820). These medical buildings were situated on Brunswick Street North or off Morning Star Avenue. This avenue is shown on the map although it is not named. It is the avenue leading northward from Brunswick Street North towards the North Dublin Union. The House of Industry (1773) became the North Dublin Union following the passage of the Irish Poor Law (1838).</ref>]]\n\nIn the fourteenth-century Dublin was a small walled city with perhaps 10,000 inhabitants. At this time Grangegorman functioned as one of three home farms, the others being [[Glasnevin]] and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as [[Deansgrange]]), which served to meet the expenditure of the [[Prior]] of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at The Church of the Holy Trinity. The [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] of this priory served The Church of the Holy Trinity, which was the State Church until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the sixteenth-century when it was re-established as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mac Giolla Phadraig|first=Brian|year=1938|title=14th century life in a Dublin Monastery|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69, 72}}</ref> The farm buildings at Grangegorman consisted of one large hall with some rooms attached and an enclosed farmyard around which there stood a barn, a malthouse, a workshop and a haggard (a farm enclosure for stacking grain or hay, etc.).

The lease of Grangegorman dated 1485 refers to its lands as \"the Orchard\". With the dissolution of the monasteries, [[King Henry VIII]] on 10 May 1541 by [[letters patent]] authorised the transformation of the Prior and Canons of Christ Church to a [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] and [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]]. The lease granted that same year refers to \"the Great Orchard\" and in 1542 to \"an orchard belonging to the Dean situate beyond the town of Oxmantown Green\". In 1560 the lease simply referred to '''\"the Dean's Orchard\"'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|year=1945|title=The district of Grangegorman (Part III)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=7|issue=3|page=103}}</ref>\n\nThe possession of the Manor of Grangegorman passed into the hands of Rt. Hon. Francis Agard after the formation of Dean and Chapter for the management of Christ Church Cathedral. Following Agard's death in 1577, this possession passed to the control of his son-in-law, [[Henry Harington (d. 1613)|Sir Henry Harrington]]. In the period after the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]], the residential expanse of Grangegorman consisted of forty houses. The Manor House at this time was held by Sir [[John Stanley (died 1674)|Thomas Stanley]]. It is assumed that the domicile to which the now defunct Stanley Street once led was the manorial house.<ref>{{cite book |author=Old Dublin Society |year=1945 |title=Dublin Historical Record |volume=7\u20139 |publisher=The Old Dublin Society|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&dq=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IdecUvuEHYWS7Aal-IFI&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg 67]}}</ref> This site is currently occupied by the Stanhope Street Convent of the [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sisters of Charity]].

In 1704 Dublin's first [[House of Industry]] was established on St. James's Street south of the River Liffey, on the site currently occupied by [[St. James's Hospital]]. However, from 1729 this institution was converted into the rather notorious [[Foundling hospital#Ireland|Dublin Foundling Hospital]]. In 1771\u201372 a philanthropic body called \"The Corporation for the Relief of the Poor\" was instituted following the passage of permissive legislation and this entity was responsible for the opening in 1773 of Dublin's second House of Industry<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tutty|first=M.J.|year=1961|title=Dublin's oldest charity|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=16|issue=3|page=73}}</ref> which was situated at the site of the derelict malthouse on Channel Row on what is now North Brunswick Street.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|year=1992|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|page=5}}</ref> Channel Row at this time was considered to form part of the locality of Glassmanogue to which also belonged the area known as Broadstone. The establishment of this institution was to be the single most important factor in shaping the urban character of Grangegorman as a site increasingly predominated by the presence of a range of institutions meeting nineteenth-century expectations of philanthropy, care and social control.<ref>The minutes of the Corporation's first meeting on Monday 3 August 1772 describes its purpose as a body in the following terms: 'The Corporation instituted for the relief of the Poor and for punishing Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars in the County of the City of Dublin'. Quoted in, {{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|page=45}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to site the House of Industry in this part of the city no doubt reflected the fact that the local population in Grangegorman and the surrounding districts of the north west of Dublin were and are overwhelming proletarian in nature. Indeed, this reflects a long-standing east-west divide in the city, which continues into the present day. In the parishes of St. Paul's and St. Michan's, resting either side of Smithfield in the north west, between 76 per cent and 79 per cent of the population were considered working class in 1797. Conversely, in the parishes of St. Thomas and St. George in the north east of the city the percentage of the population which was working class was 45 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Tommy|year=1944|title=Whitelaw's 1798 Census of Dublin|journal=History Ireland|volume=2|issue=3|page=14}}</ref> A degree of elite distaste toward the behaviour of working class populations is revealed in the visitation report of an episcopalian archbishop to the region of Grangegorman-Glassmanogue in 1727 when he described the local population, who lacked a church at this point, as lewd and unruly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Canon E.J.|year=1940|title=St. Michan's Parish in the eighteenth century|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=3|issue=1|page=3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1787 the Governors of the House of Industry considered the need for new accommodation to provide facilities for some two thousand inmates. The old malt house was in a ruinous condition and by the 1790s was deemed in danger of collapse. In September 1791 work began on the New House of Industry at a plot adjoining and to the north of the original building. The site of this building, now demolished, was located at the end of Morning Star Avenue. In 1798 the Governors of the House of Industry petitioned the [[Irish House of Commons]] to build a proper infirmary. Work on this, the Hardwicke Fever Hospital, began in 1803. To cope with the increasing number of children in the workhouse, the Bedford Asylum for Industrious Children, named after the then Lord Lieutenant and the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and designed by the noted architect, [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]] to accommodate one thousand children, was constructed in 1806 on a site on North Brunswick Street. To care for the 'ruptured poor', the [[Richmond Surgical Hospital]] was opened in 1810. The building used for this hospital had been a convent constructed in 1688 by the [[Benedictine Nuns]] in Channel Row, opposite Red Cow Lane. Subsequently, it passed into the possession of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican Nuns]] who largely rebuilt the structure. The hospital was subsequently rebuilt in 1900 in distinctive red-brick. This building still stands and from 1996 to 2013 functioned as the Dublin Metropolitan Court before being purchased by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which after extensive renovations reopened the building on 20th April 2018 (117 years to the day since the building was originally opened) as an education and events centre<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therichmond.ie/history|title=History|website=The Richmond Education and Event Centre|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>.

Therefore, the governors of the House of Industry petitioned the British parliament for funds to construct additional buildings to meet this demand. The government agreed to fund the construction of an asylum and at the cost of \u00a32,000 lands adjoining and to the east of the site of the House of Industry were purchased and an architect, Francis Johnston, was appointed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=20\u20131}} {{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Brian |last2=Falvey |first2=Jane|chapter=A history of the Richmond Asylum (St. Brendan's Hospital), Dublin|editor=Hugh Freeman |editor2=German E.

Thereafter it was renamed the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum and its catchment area was defined as the city and county of Dublin, the counties of [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], [[County Louth|Louth]], [[County Meath|Meath]], and the town of [[Drogheda]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|year=1992|pages=24, 46}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)]]\n* [[Richmond General Penitentiary]]\n* [[Grangegorman Development Agency]]\n* [[Grangegorman killings]]\n* [[Grangegorman Military Cemetery]] which is located beside the [[Phoenix Park]]\n* [[List of subdivisions of County Dublin]]\n* [[Charles Monck, 1st Viscount Monck]] whose ancestors were from Grangegorman.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[http://www.cso.ie/ Central Statistics Office], [http://www.cso.ie/census/census_1971_results/Volume1/A%20C%201%201971%20V1.pdf ''Census of Population of Ireland 1971 Volume I: Population of District Electoral Divisions, Towns and Larger Units of Area''] (Dublin, July 1972).\n*[http://www.cso.ie/ Central Statistics Office], [http://www.cso.ie/census/documents/Amended%20census2006_%20Volume%201%20Pop%20Classified%20by%20Area.pdf ''Census 2006 Volume I: Population Defined by Area''] (Dublin, 2007).\n*Cromwell, Thomas, [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/thomas-cromwell/excursions-through-ireland-comprising-topographical-and-historical-delineations-ala/page-4-excursions-through-ireland-comprising-topographical-and-historical-delineations-ala.shtml ''Excursions through Ireland'']\n*McGregor, John James, [https://archive.org/details/newpictureofdubl00mcgr <!-- quote=grange. --> ''New Picture of Dublin''](Dublin, 1821).\n\n{{Dublin residential areas}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://dublin1798.com/dublin09b.htm Map of Grangegorman region 1798]\n* [http://www.grangegorman.ie/ Grangegorman Community Museum]\n* [http://www.grangegormandevelopmentagency.ie/ Grangegorman Development Agency]\n* [http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2005/a2105.pdf Grangegorman Development Agency Act]\n* [http://www.ditsu.ie/grangegorman Video of planned development of DIT Campus on Grangegorman site] (Flash Video software or a web browser supporting H.264/MPEG-4 AVC is necessary to see the content).\n* [http://www.nwicn.ie/ North West Inner City Network]\n* [http://grangegorman.org/ Grangegorman Community Forum]\n* [http://fiveprime.org/hivemind/Tags/dit,grangegorman Contemporary photographs of St. Brendan's Mental Hospital, Grangegorman from Flickr Hive Mind]\n* [http://www.stbrendansgaa.org/?sec=static/history History of St. Brendan's Hospital, Grangegorman: St. Brendan's G.A.A.

It was best known for decades as the location of [[St. Brendan's Hospital (Grangegorman)|St Brendan's Hospital]], which was the main psychiatric hospital serving the greater Dublin region. The area is currently the subject of a major redevelopment plan under the aegis of the [[Grangegorman Development Agency]], including the new [[Technological University Dublin]] campus.\n\nGrangegorman is also a [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in the historical [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of Dublin City and [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]].<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/2977.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland] - Grangegorman civil parish</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Grangegorman, as with other [[placenames]] containing the name \"gorman\" in the [[Leinster]] region, probably indicates that at one time this territory was held by the [[U\u00ed Bairrche]], an [[Irish clans|Irish clan]] based in Leinster. The two main representatives of this clan were U\u00ed Treasaig (Tracey) and Mac Gorm\u00e1in (MacGorman).

A major historic feature was the Bradogue River, now culverted but still cutting right through the area on its way to the [[River Liffey]].\n\n===Modern suburb of Grangegorman===\nGrangegorman is located in the [[Dublin 7]] [[Dublin postal districts|postal district]], north of the [[River Liffey]] and about 1&nbsp;km from [[Dublin]] city centre, and its boundaries run, approximately, along Brunswick Street North, Prussia Street and Manor Street, the [[R101 road (Ireland)|North Circular Road]] and Phibsborough Road and Constitution Hill. Grangegorman is surrounded to the south east by [[Smithfield, Dublin|Smithfield]] to the west by [[Stoneybatter]], north by [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]], to the north and east by [[Phibsborough]] / [[Broadstone, Dublin|Broadstone]].\n\nThe geographical definition of the north Dublin [[District Electoral Division|electoral division]] known as Arran Quay B, encompasses Grangegorman. The 2006 [[Census#Ireland|Census]] gives the population of Arran Quay B as 3,692.

As shown, the original quadrangular building of the Richmond District Lunatic Asylum (1815) was built beside the new premises of the North Dublin Union. The Richmond Asylum also purchased land and constructed buildings on the western side of Grangegorman Lane. A tunnel running underground across Grangegorman Lane connected the east and west half of the Richmond's facilities. The original section on the eastern half became known as the \"lower house\" which that on the western side became known as the \"upper house\" or \"male house\". Not shown are the Hardwicke Fever Hospital (1803) or the Whitworth Chronic Hospital (1814) and its Dispensary (1820). These medical buildings were situated on Brunswick Street North or off Morning Star Avenue. This avenue is shown on the map although it is not named. It is the avenue leading northward from Brunswick Street North towards the North Dublin Union. The House of Industry (1773) became the North Dublin Union following the passage of the Irish Poor Law (1838).</ref>]]\n\nIn the fourteenth-century Dublin was a small walled city with perhaps 10,000 inhabitants. At this time Grangegorman functioned as one of three home farms, the others being [[Glasnevin]] and Clonken or Clonkene (now known as [[Deansgrange]]), which served to meet the expenditure of the [[Prior]] of the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Priory]] at The Church of the Holy Trinity. The [[Canon (priest)|Canons]] of this priory served The Church of the Holy Trinity, which was the State Church until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the sixteenth-century when it was re-established as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mac Giolla Phadraig|first=Brian|year=1938|title=14th century life in a Dublin Monastery|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=3|pages=69, 72}}</ref> The farm buildings at Grangegorman consisted of one large hall with some rooms attached and an enclosed farmyard around which there stood a barn, a malthouse, a workshop and a haggard (a farm enclosure for stacking grain or hay, etc.).

The lease of Grangegorman dated 1485 refers to its lands as \"the Orchard\". With the dissolution of the monasteries, [[King Henry VIII]] on 10 May 1541 by [[letters patent]] authorised the transformation of the Prior and Canons of Christ Church to a [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] and [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]]. The lease granted that same year refers to \"the Great Orchard\" and in 1542 to \"an orchard belonging to the Dean situate beyond the town of Oxmantown Green\". In 1560 the lease simply referred to '''\"the Dean's Orchard\"'''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=King Moylan|first=Thomas|year=1945|title=The district of Grangegorman (Part III)|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=7|issue=3|page=103}}</ref>\n\nThe possession of the Manor of Grangegorman passed into the hands of Rt. Hon. Francis Agard after the formation of Dean and Chapter for the management of Christ Church Cathedral. Following Agard's death in 1577, this possession passed to the control of his son-in-law, [[Henry Harington (d. 1613)|Sir Henry Harrington]]. In the period after the [[Restoration (Ireland)|Restoration]], the residential expanse of Grangegorman consisted of forty houses. The Manor House at this time was held by Sir [[John Stanley (died 1674)|Thomas Stanley]]. It is assumed that the domicile to which the now defunct Stanley Street once led was the manorial house.<ref>{{cite book |author=Old Dublin Society |year=1945 |title=Dublin Historical Record |volume=7\u20139 |publisher=The Old Dublin Society|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JoUMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&dq=%22Sir%2BThomas%2BStanley,+one%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IdecUvuEHYWS7Aal-IFI&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg 67]}}</ref> This site is currently occupied by the Stanhope Street Convent of the [[Religious Sisters of Charity|Irish Sisters of Charity]].

In 1704 Dublin's first [[House of Industry]] was established on St. James's Street south of the River Liffey, on the site currently occupied by [[St. James's Hospital]]. However, from 1729 this institution was converted into the rather notorious [[Foundling hospital#Ireland|Dublin Foundling Hospital]]. In 1771\u201372 a philanthropic body called \"The Corporation for the Relief of the Poor\" was instituted following the passage of permissive legislation and this entity was responsible for the opening in 1773 of Dublin's second House of Industry<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tutty|first=M.J.|year=1961|title=Dublin's oldest charity|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=16|issue=3|page=73}}</ref> which was situated at the site of the derelict malthouse on Channel Row on what is now North Brunswick Street.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Joseph|year=1992|title=Grangegorman: Psychiatric Care in Dublin since 1815|location=Dublin|page=5}}</ref> Channel Row at this time was considered to form part of the locality of Glassmanogue to which also belonged the area known as Broadstone. The establishment of this institution was to be the single most important factor in shaping the urban character of Grangegorman as a site increasingly predominated by the presence of a range of institutions meeting nineteenth-century expectations of philanthropy, care and social control.<ref>The minutes of the Corporation's first meeting on Monday 3 August 1772 describes its purpose as a body in the following terms: 'The Corporation instituted for the relief of the Poor and for punishing Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars in the County of the City of Dublin'. Quoted in, {{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|page=45}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to site the House of Industry in this part of the city no doubt reflected the fact that the local population in Grangegorman and the surrounding districts of the north west of Dublin were and are overwhelming proletarian in nature. Indeed, this reflects a long-standing east-west divide in the city, which continues into the present day. In the parishes of St. Paul's and St. Michan's, resting either side of Smithfield in the north west, between 76 per cent and 79 per cent of the population were considered working class in 1797. Conversely, in the parishes of St. Thomas and St. George in the north east of the city the percentage of the population which was working class was 45 per cent and 31 per cent respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Tommy|year=1944|title=Whitelaw's 1798 Census of Dublin|journal=History Ireland|volume=2|issue=3|page=14}}</ref> A degree of elite distaste toward the behaviour of working class populations is revealed in the visitation report of an episcopalian archbishop to the region of Grangegorman-Glassmanogue in 1727 when he described the local population, who lacked a church at this point, as lewd and unruly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Canon E.J.|year=1940|title=St. Michan's Parish in the eighteenth century|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=3|issue=1|page=3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1787 the Governors of the House of Industry considered the need for new accommodation to provide facilities for some two thousand inmates. The old malt house was in a ruinous condition and by the 1790s was deemed in danger of collapse. In September 1791 work began on the New House of Industry at a plot adjoining and to the north of the original building. The site of this building, now demolished, was located at the end of Morning Star Avenue. In 1798 the Governors of the House of Industry petitioned the [[Irish House of Commons]] to build a proper infirmary. Work on this, the Hardwicke Fever Hospital, began in 1803. To cope with the increasing number of children in the workhouse, the Bedford Asylum for Industrious Children, named after the then Lord Lieutenant and the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and designed by the noted architect, [[Francis Johnston (architect)|Francis Johnston]] to accommodate one thousand children, was constructed in 1806 on a site on North Brunswick Street. To care for the 'ruptured poor', the [[Richmond Surgical Hospital]] was opened in 1810. The building used for this hospital had been a convent constructed in 1688 by the [[Benedictine Nuns]] in Channel Row, opposite Red Cow Lane. Subsequently, it passed into the possession of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican Nuns]] who largely rebuilt the structure. The hospital was subsequently rebuilt in 1900 in distinctive red-brick. This building still stands and currently functions as the Dublin Metropolitan Court. In 1814 the [[Whitworth Hospital]] for chronic patients was built on a site just to the south of the new House of Industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moylan|first=Thomas King|year=1938|title=Vagabonds and sturdy beggars|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=1|issue=2|pages=66\u20139}}</ref> On 24 April 1820, the Talbot dispensary was opened and attached to the Richmond Surgical Hospital to afford relief to those among the sick poor who were not considered suitable for hospital accommodation and were resident in the north west district of Dublin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thom|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Thom (almanac editor)|year=1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=518NAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA715|title=Thom's Directory of Ireland|location=Dublin|page=715}}</ref>\n\n===Richmond General Penitentiary===\n[[File:Richmond Penitentiary Architectural Drawing Francis Johnson 1811.jpg|thumb|right|Architectural drawing of the Richmond General Penitentiary by Francis Johnston (1811)]]\n{{Main|Richmond General Penitentiary}}\n\nIn 1810, the Governors of the House Industry were instructed by the Lord Lieutenant to purchase land for the construction of a penitentiary. They obtained a three half acre site from Lord Monck in Grangegorman which was at that time planted with apple and pear trees.  They were assigned the task of overseeing the building of the institution that would be known as the Richmond General Penitentiary.

Therefore, the governors of the House of Industry petitioned the British parliament for funds to construct additional buildings to meet this demand.

However, shortened telomeres impair immune function that might also increase cancer susceptibility.<ref name=\"10.1002/ajhb.21127\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eisenberg DT | title = An evolutionary review of human telomere biology: the thrifty telomere hypothesis and notes on potential adaptive paternal effects | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 149\u201367 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21319244 | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.21127 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1b4e9742b2fe7c6ee86baa8ea60df570a69440a }}</ref> If telomeres become too short, they have the potential to unfold from their presumed closed structure. The cell may detect this uncapping as DNA damage and then either stop growing, enter cellular old age ([[Cellular senescence|senescence]]), or begin programmed cell self-destruction ([[apoptosis]]) depending on the cell's genetic background ([[p53]] status). Uncapped telomeres also result in chromosomal fusions. Since this damage cannot be repaired in normal somatic cells, the cell may even go into apoptosis. Many aging-related diseases are linked to shortened telomeres. Organs deteriorate as more and more of their cells die off or enter cellular senescence.\n\n[[File:Telosome.png|thumb|300x300px|Shelterin co-ordinates the T-loop formation of telomeres]]\n\n===Shelterin===\n{{Main|Shelterin}}\nAt the very distal end of the telomere is a 300 base pair single-stranded portion, which forms the T-loop. This loop is analogous to a knot, which stabilizes the telomere, preventing the telomere ends from being recognized as break points by the DNA repair machinery. Should non-homologous end joining occur at the telomeric ends, chromosomal fusion will result. The T-loop is held together by several proteins, the most notable ones being TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN1, and TIN2, collectively referred to as the shelterin complex. In humans, the shelterin complex consists of six proteins identified as TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, POT1, TPP1, and RAP1.<ref name=\"pmid20569239\" />\n\n==Shortening==\n\nTelomeres shorten in part because of the ''end replication problem'' that is exhibited during DNA replication in [[eukaryote]]s only. Because DNA replication does not begin at either end of the DNA strand, but starts in the center, and considering that all known [[DNA polymerase]]s read the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction, one finds a leading and a lagging strand on the DNA molecule being replicated.\n\nOn the leading strand, DNA polymerase can make a complementary DNA strand without any difficulty because it reads the template strand from 3' to 5'. However, there is a problem going in the other direction on the lagging strand. To counter this, short sequences of [[RNA]] acting as [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]]s attach to the lagging strand a short distance ahead of where the initiation site was. The DNA polymerase can start replication at that point and go to the end of the initiation site. This causes the formation of [[Okazaki fragment]]s. More RNA primers attach further on the DNA strand and DNA polymerase comes along and continues to make a new DNA strand.[[File:Dnareplication.svg|thumb|250 px|Lagging strand during DNA replication]]Eventually, the last RNA primer attaches, and DNA polymerase, RNA nuclease, and [[DNA ligase]] come along to convert the RNA (of the primers) to DNA and to seal the gaps in between the Okazaki fragments. But, in order to change RNA to DNA, there must be another DNA strand in front of the RNA primer. This happens at all the sites of the lagging strand, but it does not happen at the end where the last RNA primer is attached. Ultimately, that RNA is destroyed by enzymes that degrade any RNA left on the DNA. Thus, a section of the telomere is lost during each cycle of replication at the 5' end of the lagging strand's daughter.\n\nHowever, [[in vitro|test-tube]] studies have shown that telomeres are highly susceptible to [[oxidative stress]].

[[Ectotherm]]s are significantly more likely than endotherms to have variation in somatic telomerase expression. For instance, in many fish, telomerase occurs throughout the body (and associated with this, telomere length is roughly the same across all its tissue). Studies on ectotherms, and other non-mammalian organisms, show that there\u2019s no single universal model of telomere erosion; rather, there is wide variation in relevant dynamics across Metazoa, and even within smaller taxonomic groups these patterns appear diverse. Due to the different reproductive timelines of some ectotherms, selection on disease is relevant for a much larger fraction of these creatures\u2019 lives than it is for mammals, so early- and late-life telomere length, and their possible links to cancer, seem especially important in these species from a [[life history theory]] point of view.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olsson M, Wapstra E, Friesen C | title = Ectothermic telomeres: it's time they came in from the cold | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Hence, these sequences and the information they carry may get lost. This is the reason telomeres are so important in context of successful cell division: They \"cap\" the end-sequences and themselves get lost in the process of DNA replication. But the cell has an enzyme called telomerase, which carries out the task of adding repetitive nucleotide sequences to the ends of the DNA. Telomerase \"replenishes\" the telomere \"cap.\" In most multicellular eukaryotic organisms, telomerase is active only in [[germ cell]]s, some types of [[stem cell]]s such as [[embryonic stem cells]], and certain [[white blood cell]]s.

However, shortened telomeres impair immune function that might also increase cancer susceptibility.<ref name=\"10.1002/ajhb.21127\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eisenberg DT | title = An evolutionary review of human telomere biology: the thrifty telomere hypothesis and notes on potential adaptive paternal effects | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 149\u201367 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21319244 | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.21127 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1b4e9742b2fe7c6ee86baa8ea60df570a69440a }}</ref> If telomeres become too short, they have the potential to unfold from their presumed closed structure. The cell may detect this uncapping as DNA damage and then either stop growing, enter cellular old age ([[Cellular senescence|senescence]]), or begin programmed cell self-destruction ([[apoptosis]]) depending on the cell's genetic background ([[p53]] status). Uncapped telomeres also result in chromosomal fusions. Since this damage cannot be repaired in normal somatic cells, the cell may even go into apoptosis. Many aging-related diseases are linked to shortened telomeres. Organs deteriorate as more and more of their cells die off or enter cellular senescence.\n\n[[File:Telosome.png|thumb|300x300px|Shelterin co-ordinates the T-loop formation of telomeres]]\n\n===Shelterin===\n{{Main|Shelterin}}\nAt the very distal end of the telomere is a 300 base pair single-stranded portion, which forms the T-loop. This loop is analogous to a knot, which stabilizes the telomere, preventing the telomere ends from being recognized as break points by the DNA repair machinery. Should non-homologous end joining occur at the telomeric ends, chromosomal fusion will result. The T-loop is held together by several proteins, the most notable ones being TRF1, TRF2, POT1, TIN1, and TIN2, collectively referred to as the shelterin complex. In humans, the shelterin complex consists of six proteins identified as TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, POT1, TPP1, and RAP1.<ref name=\"pmid20569239\" />\n\n==Shortening==\n\nTelomeres shorten in part because of the ''end replication problem'' that is exhibited during DNA replication in [[eukaryote]]s only. Because DNA replication does not begin at either end of the DNA strand, but starts in the center, and considering that all known [[DNA polymerase]]s read the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction, one finds a leading and a lagging strand on the DNA molecule being replicated.\n\nOn the leading strand, DNA polymerase can make a complementary DNA strand without any difficulty because it reads the template strand from 3' to 5'. However, there is a problem going in the other direction on the lagging strand. To counter this, short sequences of [[RNA]] acting as [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]]s attach to the lagging strand a short distance ahead of where the initiation site was. The DNA polymerase can start replication at that point and go to the end of the initiation site. This causes the formation of [[Okazaki fragment]]s. More RNA primers attach further on the DNA strand and DNA polymerase comes along and continues to make a new DNA strand.[[File:Dnareplication.svg|thumb|250 px|Lagging strand during DNA replication]]Eventually, the last RNA primer attaches, and DNA polymerase, RNA nuclease, and [[DNA ligase]] come along to convert the RNA (of the primers) to DNA and to seal the gaps in between the Okazaki fragments. But, in order to change RNA to DNA, there must be another DNA strand in front of the RNA primer. This happens at all the sites of the lagging strand, but it does not happen at the end where the last RNA primer is attached. Ultimately, that RNA is destroyed by enzymes that degrade any RNA left on the DNA. Thus, a section of the telomere is lost during each cycle of replication at the 5' end of the lagging strand's daughter.\n\nHowever, [[in vitro|test-tube]] studies have shown that telomeres are highly susceptible to [[oxidative stress]]. There is evidence that oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage is an important determinant of telomere shortening.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Richter T, von Zglinicki T | title = A continuous correlation between oxidative stress and telomere shortening in fibroblasts | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 42 | issue = 11 | pages = 1039\u201342 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17869047 | doi = 10.1016/j.exger.2007.08.005 }}</ref> Telomere shortening due to free radicals explains the difference between the estimated loss per division because of the end-replication problem (c. 20 bp) and actual telomere shortening rates (50\u2013100 bp), and has a greater absolute impact on telomere length than shortening caused by the end-replication problem.

[[Ectotherm]]s are significantly more likely than endotherms to have variation in somatic telomerase expression. For instance, in many fish, telomerase occurs throughout the body (and associated with this, telomere length is roughly the same across all its tissue). Studies on ectotherms, and other non-mammalian organisms, show that there\u2019s no single universal model of telomere erosion; rather, there is wide variation in relevant dynamics across Metazoa, and even within smaller taxonomic groups these patterns appear diverse. Due to the different reproductive timelines of some ectotherms, selection on disease is relevant for a much larger fraction of these creatures\u2019 lives than it is for mammals, so early- and late-life telomere length, and their possible links to cancer, seem especially important in these species from a [[life history theory]] point of view.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olsson M, Wapstra E, Friesen C | title = Ectothermic telomeres: it's time they came in from the cold | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

In 2014, the band released their debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'' and spawned the single \"Gooey\", which was eventually certified Platinum in the United States. Their second full album, ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]'', received critical acclaim and won in two categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize shortlist. Outside of his work for Glass Animals, Bayley has written and produced for a number of artists including [[6lack]], [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]], [[Joey Badass]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], [[Flume (musician)|Flume]] and [[Denzel Curry]].\n \nThe band has become known for their live shows, playing re-worked, dance-heavy versions of their songs. They have performed on international TV shows including late night shows with [[Jools Holland]], [[James Corden]] and [[Jimmy Kimmel]]. Glass Animals has played at a number of venues and festivals around the world including [[Radio City Music Hall]], Red Rocks, Brixton Academy, [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Lollapalooza]], Glastonbury, Latitude, Reading and Leeds, and Falls.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== 2012\u20132015: ''Zaba'' and various EPs  ===\nThe band released their debut EP, ''Leaflings'', on 28 May 2012, which included the single \"Cocoa Hooves\". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of [[XL Recordings]] (part of the [[Beggars Group]] of labels). At the time, lead singer and guitarist Dave Bayley was attending medical school at King's College, London but left after [[Adele]]'s producer [[Paul Epworth]] saw Glass Animals performing in London and signed them to his label Wolf Tone.\n\nIn 2013, the band released ''Black Mambo / Exxus EP'' in Europe, and ''Glass Animals EP'' in the US. The digital release of the track \"Black Mambo\" brought the band their first attention through online reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypem.com/track/1wegy/Glass+Animals+-+Black+Mambo|title=Black Mambo|website=Hype Machine|accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> The ''Glass Animals'' EP also saw the band collaborating with Jean Deaux, a soulful hip-hop teenager from Chicago, on a song titled \"Woozy\".\n\nIn 2014, the band made their first visit to the USA, performing at ''[[South by Southwest]]'' in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: \"Pools\", \"Gooey\", and \"Hazey\", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer [[Tei Shi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAll five singles were included on the band's debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'', which was released on 6 June 2014. The band performed the single \"Gooey\" on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals Get \"Gooey\" Again on Late Night With Seth Meyers {{!}} The Lefort Report|url = http://www.thelefortreport.com/blog/2014-10/watch-glass-animals-get-gooey-again-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers/|website = www.thelefortreport.com|access-date = 21 January 2016}}</ref> in 2014, and again on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' with [[David Letterman]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals play 'Gooey' on Letterman|url = http://diymag.com/2015/02/26/watch-glass-animals-play-gooey-on-letterman|website = DIY|access-date = 21 January 2016}}</ref> on 24 February 2015, and toured extensively after ''Zaba'', visiting both hemispheres and played over 130 shows in 2015 alone. Their October 2015 US tour included two sold out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the [[Midland Theatre]] in [[Kansas City]].\n\nA collaboration with American rapper [[Joey Badass|Joey Bada$$]], titled \"Lose Control\", was released on 6 October 2015. The idea for the song was apparently sparked during a randomly shared studio session. Following the collaboration, Bayley remarked that he would be interested in working with Joey again in the future. \n\nBayley also worked with DJ Dahi, resulting in a writing cut on the track \"The Middle Finger\" on Wale's ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number one album, ''[[The Album About Nothing]]'' in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Wale - The Middle Finger Lyrics {{!}} Genius Lyrics |url= https://genius.com/Wale-the-middle-finger-lyrics |website= genius.com}}</ref>\n\n=== 2016\u20132018: ''How to Be a Human Being'' and tour ===\n[[File:Dave Studio.jpg|thumb|Glass Animals frontman Dave Bayley]]\nOn 16 May 2016, the band released the lead single, \"Life Itself\", from their second album ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/glass-animals-tickle-the-feet-with-new-single-life-itself-listen/|title=Glass Animals tickle the feet with new single \"Life Itself\" \u2014 listen|date=2016-05-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref> \"Life Itself\" peaked at number 14 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Alternative Songs chart and spent 26 weeks on Sirius XM's Alt-18 chart, peaking at number one.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/glass-animals-track-by-track-guide-to-how-to-be-a.html|title=Glass Animals: Track-By-Track Guide to How To Be A Human Being|newspaper=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref> A music video for the song was released on 7 June 2016.

They played [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway Festivals]] in six different cities (Singapore, Sydney, and Auckland, among others).

In 2014, the band released their debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'' and spawned the single \"Gooey\", which was eventually certified Platinum in the United States. Their second full album, ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]'', received critical acclaim and won in two categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize shortlist.

At the time, lead singer and guitarist Dave Bayley was attending medical school at King's College, London but left after [[Adele]]'s producer [[Paul Epworth]] saw Glass Animals performing in London and signed them to his label Wolf Tone.\n\nIn 2013, the band released ''Black Mambo / Exxus EP'' in Europe, and ''Glass Animals EP'' in the US. The digital release of the track \"Black Mambo\" brought the band their first attention through online reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypem.com/track/1wegy/Glass+Animals+-+Black+Mambo|title=Black Mambo|website=Hype Machine|accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> The ''Glass Animals'' EP also saw the band collaborating with Jean Deaux, a soulful hip-hop teenager from Chicago, on a song titled \"Woozy\".\n\nIn 2014, the band made their first visit to the USA, performing at ''[[South by Southwest]]'' in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: \"Pools\", \"Gooey\", and \"Hazey\", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer [[Tei Shi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAll five singles were included on the band's debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'', which was released on 6 June 2014. The band performed the single \"Gooey\" on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals Get \"Gooey\" Again on Late Night With Seth Meyers {{!}} The Lefort Report|url = http://www.thelefortreport.com/blog/2014-10/watch-glass-animals-get-gooey-again-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers/|website = www.thelefortreport.com|access-date = 21 January 2016}}</ref> in 2014, and again on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' with [[David Letterman]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals play 'Gooey' on Letterman|url = http://diymag.com/2015/02/26/watch-glass-animals-play-gooey-on-letterman|website = DIY|access-date = 21 January 2016}}</ref> on 24 February 2015, and toured extensively after ''Zaba'', visiting both hemispheres and played over 130 shows in 2015 alone. Their October 2015 US tour included two sold out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the [[Midland Theatre]] in [[Kansas City]].\n\nA collaboration with American rapper [[Joey Badass|Joey Bada$$]], titled \"Lose Control\", was released on 6 October 2015. The idea for the song was apparently sparked during a randomly shared studio session. Following the collaboration, Bayley remarked that he would be interested in working with Joey again in the future. \n\nBayley also worked with DJ Dahi, resulting in a writing cut on the track \"The Middle Finger\" on Wale's ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' number one album, ''[[The Album About Nothing]]'' in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Wale - The Middle Finger Lyrics {{!}} Genius Lyrics |url= https://genius.com/Wale-the-middle-finger-lyrics |website= genius.com}}</ref>\n\n=== 2016\u20132018: ''How to Be a Human Being'' and tour ===\n[[File:Dave Studio.jpg|thumb|Glass Animals frontman Dave Bayley]]\nOn 16 May 2016, the band released the lead single, \"Life Itself\", from their second album ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/glass-animals-tickle-the-feet-with-new-single-life-itself-listen/|title=Glass Animals tickle the feet with new single \"Life Itself\" \u2014 listen|date=2016-05-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref> \"Life Itself\" peaked at number 14 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Alternative Songs chart and spent 26 weeks on Sirius XM's Alt-18 chart, peaking at number one.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/08/glass-animals-track-by-track-guide-to-how-to-be-a.html|title=Glass Animals: Track-By-Track Guide to How To Be A Human Being|newspaper=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref> A music video for the song was released on 7 June 2016.

The album received critical acclaim for its \"sense of wonder\" and \"immediate impression\", though it was also met with some mixed reactions, for critics felt that it was somewhat premature. They played [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway Festivals]] in six different cities (Singapore, Sydney, and Auckland, among others).

The PVV won in Almere and came second to the Labour Party in The Hague. In Almere, the PVV won 21 percent of the vote to Labour's 18 percent, preliminary results showed. In The Hague, the PVV had 8 seats \u2013 second to Labour with 10 seats. The local elections were the first test of public opinion since the collapse of the 4th Balkenende cabinet in February 2010.

These calls were rejected. The Hague council said the municipal elections had gone well and that any complaint should anyway have been lodged immediately after the results were announced.

In a press release, the party said most of the other parties had refused to give ground to PVV demands on what it describes as ''\"essential issues\"''. These include what the party calls \u2018city commandos\u2019: street patrols to keep order in the face of inadequate proper law enforcement. Other obstacles were the PVV's demands for reduced taxes for Almere residents and its fight against what the party sees as ''\"the increasing influence of Islam in Dutch society\"''.

While the party would not gain a ministerial appointment, the PVV would tolerate a centre-right minority government coalition: a proposed deal that would make the party one of the most influential forces. Led by [[Ivo Opstelten]], a former mayor of Rotterdam who was appointed mediator for the next stage of negotiations, the forming of a government of VVD and [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) with support of the PVV was negotiated; the resulting coalition agreement \"included elements it pushed for, such as a [[Islamic dress in Europe#Netherlands|burqa ban]],\" though the ban was never put in place.<ref>{{cite news| title= Dutch government collapses after far right pulls plug| url= http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/23/world/europe/netherlands-politics/ |date= 23 April 2012| publisher= CNN| quote= The Party for Freedom did not get control of any government ministries, but the coalition agreement included elements it pushed for, such as a burqa ban.

They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.\n\nBy 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of Rome|History of the Papacy}}\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}\n\nFor its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schn\u00fcrer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.

Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome and thus, under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated; in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them.<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>\n\nOther donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. However, the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside.

A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Donation of Pepin===\n{{main|Donation of Pepin}}\nWhen the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part.

Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards \u2013 taking control of northern Italy \u2013 and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.\n\nIn 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]], and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.\n\n===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nThe precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] \u2013 and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] \u2013 is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.\n\nEvents in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum|''Saeculum obscurum'']] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[\u00c9mile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'\u00e9glise au pouvoir des la\u00efques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'\u00c9glise depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>\n\nIn practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.\n\nOver several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.\n\n===Avignon Papacy===\n{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}\n\n[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]\n\nFrom 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings.

The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of [[Cola di Rienzo]], who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=225}} and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} As Prof. [[Guido Ruggiero]] states, \"even with the support of [[Petrarch]], his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}}\n\nThe Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who was appointed papal legate, and his [[condottieri]] heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on 29 April 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanct\u00e6 Matris Ecclesi\u00e6]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. [[Pope Urban V]] ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=19}}\n\n[[File:RomaPalazzoQuirinale.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Quirinal Palace]], papal residence and home to the civil offices of the Papal States from the [[Renaissance]] until their annexation]]\n\n===Renaissance===\nDuring [[the Renaissance]], the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.\n\nPapal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict.

Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}\n\nAt its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy \u2013 [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]].

For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.\n\n===Italian unification===\n{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\n[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.\n\nThe nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city.

This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.\n\n[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]\n\nA unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870.

Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy \u2013 then under [[Pius XI]] \u2013 renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.\n\n==Regional governors==\n[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]\n\nAs the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.\n\n==Papal military==\nHistorically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>\nIn 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created.

They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.\n\nBy 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of Rome|History of the Papacy}}\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}\n\nFor its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schn\u00fcrer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.

Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome and thus, under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated; in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them.<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>\n\nOther donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. However, the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from [[Ravenna]], where the Emperor's representative, or [[Exarch of Ravenna|Exarch]], was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEvedy|first1=Colin|title=The Penguin atlas of medieval history|date=1961|publisher=Penguin Books|page=32|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rjHVAAAAMAAJ&q=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlns3LrcHKAhVM1hQKHcgFBd84ChDoAQgrMAE|quote=... separated from their theoretical overlord in Pavia by the continuing Imperial control of the Rome-Ravenna corridor.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Charles|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199651924|page=661|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UtMVAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The empire retained control only of Rome, Ravenna, a fragile corridor between them, ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-752|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317678175|page=230|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=In 749 Ratchis embarked on a bid to capture Perusia, the key to the Rome-Ravenna land corridor}}</ref>), plus coastal exclaves.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|page=378}}\n\nWith effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the [[Duchy of Rome]], an area roughly equivalent to [[Lazio|modern-day Latium]], became an independent state ruled by the pope.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=1060}}\n\nThe Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; [[Pope Gregory II]] even [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] during the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy.

The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards \u2013 taking control of northern Italy \u2013 and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.\n\nIn 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]], and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.\n\n===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nThe precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] \u2013 and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] \u2013 is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.\n\nEvents in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum|''Saeculum obscurum'']] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[\u00c9mile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'\u00e9glise au pouvoir des la\u00efques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds.

As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.\n\n===Avignon Papacy===\n{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}\n\n[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]\n\nFrom 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings.

Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanct\u00e6 Matris Ecclesi\u00e6]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816.

Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}\n\nAt its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy \u2014 [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]].

For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically.

In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.\n\n[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]\n\nA unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair.

Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy \u2013 then under [[Pius XI]] \u2013 renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.\n\n==Regional governors==\n[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]\n\nAs the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]].

The story was set in an [[alternative history]] 1970s, in which [[Nazi Germany]] won [[World War II]] and [[England]] is run by a collaborationist fascist government. Peter Ingram ([[Kenneth More]]) is a writer for a soap opera (also called ''An Englishman's Castle''), which is set in [[London]] in 1940, during the fictional Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation.\n\n==Plot==\nPeter Ingram is a successful London screenwriter, the creator of one of the most popular television shows in Nazi-occupied Europe, ''An Englishman's Castle''. It is a period soap opera, following an ordinary London family during an imagined German invasion of England in 1940. Ingram is oblivious to Nazi rule, which is hidden behind a fa\u00e7ade of seemingly-normal English daily life. The invasion was followed by several years of guerrilla warfare, which ended in a truce with Germany and an amnesty that enabled the resisters to resume normal daily life in return for accepting the reality of German occupation, which they generally did, feeling that further resistance was futile.\n\nIngram's show furthers the feeling among the population in the present (1978) and so is highly valuable to the authorities. A kind of normality was restored, with few Germans to be seen in the streets. German rule is maintained mainly through an extensive system of collaborators, known as \"[[delator]]s\". When dissidents are detained it is done by polite, soft-spoken English police, but they are then delivered to horrible torture chambers, kept discreetly out of sight.\n\nIngram gradually becomes aware of the real state of things. Firstly, he encounters his superiors' firm objection to the inclusion of a character with a [[Jewish]] name in the series. The series is largely based on his own life, he argues, and the Jewish man was a real friend. However, having such a character would violate the official policy of letting the [[Holocaust|extermination of the Jews]] remain forgotten, never discussed openly. Then, Ingram discovers that his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]], Jill, one of the stars of his show, is secretly Jewish and a member of an underground [[resistance movement]]. Eventually, his loyalties are tested, and he sides with the resistance.\n\nWhen the resistance decides to include the [[code word]] that will signal a nationwide [[insurgency]] in his show, due to its huge audience, he complies, allowing Sally (Jill) to speak the phrase when it is filmed. However, in the closing scene, he locks himself in his office as the episode is broadcast, cuts off the feed just before her scene airs, and speaks the phrase himself instead, live over the air. As the sounds of a rebellion against the collaborationist government begin to come through the windows of his office, Ingram awaits the [[secret police]], when someone breaks down the door and he turns to stare at the unseen intruder.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Kenneth More]] as Peter Ingram\n* [[Isla Blair]] as Jill / \"Sally\"\n* [[Anthony Bate]] as Harmer\n* [[Kathleen Byron]] as Mrs. Ingram\n* [[Noel Dyson]] as Connie / \"Mrs. Worth\"\n* [[Rob Edwards (actor)|Rob Edwards]] as Adrian / \"Bert Worth\"\n* Fiona Gray as Susan\n* [[Nigel Havers]] as Mark Ingram\n* [[Peter Hughes (actor)|Peter Hughes]] as John / \"Mr. Worth\"\n* [[David Meyer]] as Henry Ingram\n* [[Frederick Treves (actor)|Frederick Treves]] as Lonsdale\n* David Roy Paul as Head waiter\n* Brian Peck as Jimmy\n* [[Philip Bond (actor)|Philip Bond]] as Inspector\n* Anthony Stafford as Arthur / \"Frank Worth\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n==DVD==\nAccording to the DVD cover, the series was released by Simply Media and the BBC in 2015.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II]]<!-- includes list of other works of World War II alternative histories, included in place of listing various works -->\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0077007|title=An Englishman's Castle}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Englishman's Castle, An}}\n[[Category:Alternate history television series]]\n[[Category:Television series about World War II alternate histories]]\n[[Category:1970s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1978 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1978 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:BBC television dramas]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1978 British television series}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2016}}\n{{one source|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = An Englishman's Castle\n| image                    = <!-- include ALT text per [[WP:ALT]] guideline -->\n| caption                  = \n| genre                    = [[Dramatic programming|Drama]]\n| writer                   = [[Philip Mackie]]\n| director                 = Paul Ciappessoni\n| starring                 = {{plainlist|\n*[[Kenneth More]]\n*[[Isla Blair]]\n*[[Anthony Bate]]\n*[[Kathleen Byron]]\n*[[Noel Dyson]]\n}}\n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = \n| country                  = United Kingdom\n| language                 = English\n| num_episodes             = 3\n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = \n| producer                 = [[Innes Lloyd]]\n| editor                   = \n| location                 = \n| cinematography           = \n| camera                   = \n| runtime                  = 50 minutes\n| company                  = [[BBC]]\n| distributor              = \n| channel                  = [[BBC Two]]\n| picture_format           = \n| audio_format             = \n| first_aired              = {{Start date|1978|6|5|df=yes}}\n| last_aired               = {{End date|1978|6|19|df=yes}}\n}}\n'''''An Englishman's Castle''''' is a [[BBC]] television serial first broadcast in 1978, written by [[Philip Mackie]] and directed by Paul Ciappessoni.

She patrolled between principal [[Japan]]ese ports until October 1946; then she based at [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]], [[China]], for patrol along the coast of [[Korea]].

When fighting erupted, she sped back to the Mediterranean in November 1956 to protect Americans in that area and serve notice that the United States was determined to contain and terminate the conflict.
