In ''[[Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo]]'', Velma is described by her younger sister Madelyn as being \"born with a mystery book in her hand\". Consequently, Velma is usually the one to figure out the mystery, sometimes with the help of [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]] and [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]]. Velma Dinkley was inspired by the brainy [[Zelda Gilroy]], as played by [[Sheila James Kuehl|Sheila James]], from the late 1950s/early 1960s American sitcom ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.<ref>[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]]. (July 10, 2002).[http://povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm Post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514000000/http://povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm |date=May 14, 2006 }} on \"News from Me\" blog for ''Povonline.com''. Retrieved March 27, 2006. Excerpt: \"Fred was based on Dobie, Velma on Zelda, Daphne on Thalia and Shaggy on [[Maynard G. Krebs|Maynard]].\"</ref>\n\nA [[running gag]] in ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' and ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' is Velma's severe [[nearsighted]]ness and her trouble with keeping her glasses on her face (often resulting in them falling off while she is being chased by the villain).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7GN0E_diWbAC&pg=PA512 |title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century |first=David |last=Mansour |date=June 1, 2011 |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |accessdate=December 22, 2016 |via=Google Books}}</ref> Another running gag is that despite the fact that she is the smallest of the Scooby-Doo gang she can actually carry away the whole gang in her arms from a villain.\n\nWhen Scooby-Doo is too afraid to volunteer to help with a mission, Velma often offers him a dog treat called a \"[[Scooby Snacks|Scooby Snack]]\" as a bribe. She also occasionally displays a strong, take-charge personality when needed, sharply ordering Shaggy to \"march!\" in an early episode, and she is not above physically attacking a villain when provoked, as when she kicked The Creeper in the knee for snatching her glasses right off her face.  Her catchphrases are: \"Jinkies!\" and \"My glasses! I can't see without my glasses!\" (when she accidentally loses her glasses).\n\nVelma is the most skeptical of the four human members of Mystery Inc. and most likely to discount any [[paranormal]] explanations. This is particularly evident in the movies ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Curse of the 13th Ghost]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo! Return to Zombie Island]]'', in which she discounts ghosts and zombies (real within the context of the franchise) that could not be unmasked by claiming they must be [[hallucination]]s.\n\n===Character background===\nLike all of the Scooby-Doo kids, later [[Retroactive continuity|ret-conned]] as Mystery Incorporated members, Velma has differing personal backgrounds and histories depending on which series one is referring to.\n\nIn the original flagship ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' series, Velma attended the same high school as the rest of the gang (as stated in the inaugural episode \"What a Night for a Knight\"). However, by ''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'', Velma is said to have graduated from a different high school than her friends (as stated in the episode \"Spirited Spooked Sports Show\").\n\nAccording to ''[[Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes]]'', before she said \"Jinkies!\", Velma just said \"Oh, my!\" Velma says it was not that catchy. According to her, her catchphrase just came out of nowhere. Her parents pushed her at an early age to excel in her studies, resulting in her winning hundreds of awards for outstanding achievement. Because of this, she can be more vocal than her friends would like.\n\nIn the film ''Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster'', it is revealed that her middle name is Daisy.\n\nIn ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'', she's in a brief romantic relationship with [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] before he breaks up with her in \"''Howl of the Fright Hound.''\" She is shown as secretive, sarcastic, and controlling in this incarnation of the series by secretly working for Mr. E and trying to change Shaggy's behavior while they were together.\n\n==Relatives==\nRelatives of Velma shown during the series' run include:\n\n* '''Dale and Angie Dinkley''': Velma's parents in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' (2010\u201313), voiced by [[Kevin Dunn]] and [[Frances Conroy]]. They own the Crystal Cove Mystery Museum, which has in its display all of the costumes from the villains the gang has defeated over the years, as well as other objects that have connections to the supernatural or the unexplainable. Angie constantly tries to help her daughter in any way she can, while Dale tends to reprimand Velma.\n* '''Madelyn Dinkley''': Velma's younger sister voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]. She appears to be in her late teens and somewhat resembles her older sister in appearance and personality. Velma refers to Madelyn as a nerd and does not seem to realize how much alike they really are. Unlike Velma, Madelyn was not exactly sure what she wanted to do for a living and had previously attended clown college until she discovered a fondness for stage magic and enrolls in a school for stage [[Illusionist|magicians]]. Madelyn has a huge crush on [[Shaggy Rogers]] and as a result of this, Shaggy refers to Madelyn as \"Doe-eyed Dinkley\" or by simply \"Madds\". She plays an important role in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo]]'', when the magic school she's enrolled in is being terrorized by a giant [[griffin]]. In ''Scooby Doo: Behind the Scenes'', Velma has an older, blonde haired sister.\n* '''Aunt Meg''' and '''Uncle Evan''': Velma's aunt and uncle (voiced by [[Julia Sweeney]] and [[Diedrich Bader]]), who live in a small town called Banning Junction which features in a [[Halloween]] episode of ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]''.\n* '''Marcy''': Velma's cousin and the daughter of Meg and Evan. She is studying mechanical engineering in college, but unlike Velma, she is fashionable. This along with Marcy's interest in Fred made her Daphne's rival of sorts. She was born on [[Halloween]] which over time led to her hatred of the holiday as it usually upstaged her birthday (even her parents have forgotten it). Consequently, she used local legend and her engineering background to create Mechanical Scarecrow Monsters to terrorize the town on her eighteenth birthday.\n* '''Aunt Thelma''': A [[Marine Biology|marine biologist]] at the Coolsville Marine Institute whose dolphins were being stolen in the ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' episode \"Scooby Dude\".\n* '''Uncle Dave (Walton)''': A member of the [[U.S. Border Patrol]], as seen in the episode ''Watch Out! The Willawaw!''\n* '''Uncle John''': works as an [[archaeology|archaeologist]].\n* '''Uncle Cosmo''': also works as an archaeologist.\n* '''Uncle Elmo''': a [[Physician|doctor]].\n* '''Uncle Ted''': also works as an archaeologist.\n* '''Great Uncle Dr. Von Dinkenstein''': Velma's infamous great-uncle, resembling Frankenstein. He is the reason for Velma's crime-solving business.\n\n==Portrayals==\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | header_align      = center\n | header            = Select Velmas\n | image1            =VelmaLinda.jpg\n | width1 = 152\n | caption1 = Portrayed by [[Linda Cardellini]] in ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' (2004)\n | image2            = Hayley Kiyoko as Velma Dinkley.jpg\n | width2 = 152\n | caption2 =  Portrayed by [[Hayley Kiyoko]] in ''[[Scooby-Doo!

From 1969 to 1973, [[Nicole Jaffe]] voiced Velma; from 1976 to 1979, [[Pat Stevens]] voiced the character. From 1979 to 1980, Marla Frumkin provided her voice. Velma did not speak in the ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' final episode, \"The Ransom of Scooby Chief\". After the character's absence from 1980 to 1983 series, Marla Frumkin reprised the role of Velma as a guest star in ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries]]''.

In ''[[Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo]]'', Velma is described by her younger sister Madelyn as being \"born with a mystery book in her hand\". Consequently, Velma is usually the one to figure out the mystery, sometimes with the help of [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]] and [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]]. Velma Dinkley was inspired by the brainy [[Zelda Gilroy]], as played by [[Sheila James Kuehl|Sheila James]], from the late 1950s/early 1960s American sitcom ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.<ref>[[Mark Evanier|Evanier, Mark]]. (July 10, 2002).[http://povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm Post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514000000/http://povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm |date=May 14, 2006 }} on \"News from Me\" blog for ''Povonline.com''. Retrieved March 27, 2006. Excerpt: \"Fred was based on Dobie, Velma on Zelda, Daphne on Thalia and Shaggy on [[Maynard G. Krebs|Maynard]].\"</ref>\n\nA [[running gag]] in ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' and ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' is Velma's severe [[nearsighted]]ness and her trouble with keeping her glasses on her face (often resulting in them falling off while she is being chased by the villain).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7GN0E_diWbAC&pg=PA512 |title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century |first=David |last=Mansour |date=June 1, 2011 |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |accessdate=December 22, 2016 |via=Google Books}}</ref> Another running gag is that despite the fact that she is the smallest of the Scooby-Doo gang she can actually carry away the whole gang in her arms from a villain.\n\nWhen Scooby-Doo is too afraid to volunteer to help with a mission, Velma often offers him a dog treat called a \"[[Scooby Snacks|Scooby Snack]]\" as a bribe. She also occasionally displays a strong, take-charge personality when needed, sharply ordering Shaggy to \"march!\" in an early episode, and she is not above physically attacking a villain when provoked, as when she kicked The Creeper in the knee for snatching her glasses right off her face.  Her catchphrases are: \"Jinkies!\" and \"My glasses! I can't see without my glasses!\" (when she accidentally loses her glasses).\n\nVelma is the most skeptical of the four human members of Mystery Inc. and most likely to discount any [[paranormal]] explanations. This is particularly evident in the movies ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Curse of the 13th Ghost]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo! Return to Zombie Island]]'', in which she discounts ghosts and zombies (real within the context of the franchise) that could not be unmasked by claiming they must be [[hallucination]]s.\n\n===Character background===\nLike all of the Scooby-Doo kids, later [[Retroactive continuity|ret-conned]] as Mystery Incorporated members, Velma has differing personal backgrounds and histories depending on which series one is referring to.\n\nIn the original flagship ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' series, Velma attended the same high school as the rest of the gang (as stated in the inaugural episode \"What a Night for a Knight\"). However, by ''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'', Velma is said to have graduated from a different high school than her friends (as stated in the episode \"Spirited Spooked Sports Show\").\n\nAccording to ''[[Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes]]'', before she said \"Jinkies!\", Velma just said \"Oh, my!\" Velma says it was not that catchy. According to her, her catchphrase just came out of nowhere. Her parents pushed her at an early age to excel in her studies, resulting in her winning hundreds of awards for outstanding achievement. Because of this, she can be more vocal than her friends would like.\n\nIn the film ''Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster'', it is revealed that her middle name is Daisy.\n\nIn ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'', she's in a brief romantic relationship with [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] before he breaks up with her in \"''Howl of the Fright Hound.''\" She is shown as secretive, sarcastic, and controlling in this incarnation of the series by secretly working for Mr. E and trying to change Shaggy's behavior while they were together.\n\n==Relatives==\nRelatives of Velma shown during the series' run include:\n\n* '''Dale and Angie Dinkley''': Velma's parents in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' (2010\u201313), voiced by [[Kevin Dunn]] and [[Frances Conroy]]. They own the Crystal Cove Mystery Museum, which has in its display all of the costumes from the villains the gang has defeated over the years, as well as other objects that have connections to the supernatural or the unexplainable. Angie constantly tries to help her daughter in any way she can, while Dale tends to reprimand Velma.\n* '''Madelyn Dinkley''': Velma's younger sister voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]. She appears to be in her late teens and somewhat resembles her older sister in appearance and personality. Velma refers to Madelyn as a nerd and does not seem to realize how much alike they really are. Unlike Velma, Madelyn was not exactly sure what she wanted to do for a living and had previously attended clown college until she discovered a fondness for stage magic and enrolls in a school for stage [[Illusionist|magicians]]. Madelyn has a huge crush on [[Shaggy Rogers]] and as a result of this, Shaggy refers to Madelyn as \"Doe-eyed Dinkley\" or by simply \"Madds\". She plays an important role in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo]]'', when the magic school she's enrolled in is being terrorized by a giant [[griffin]]. In ''Scooby Doo: Behind the Scenes'', Velma has an older, blonde haired sister.\n* '''Aunt Meg''' and '''Uncle Evan''': Velma's aunt and uncle (voiced by [[Julia Sweeney]] and [[Diedrich Bader]]), who live in a small town called Banning Junction which features in a [[Halloween]] episode of ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]''.\n* '''Marcy''': Velma's cousin and the daughter of Meg and Evan. She is studying mechanical engineering in college, but unlike Velma, she is fashionable. This along with Marcy's interest in Fred made her Daphne's rival of sorts. She was born on [[Halloween]] which over time led to her hatred of the holiday as it usually upstaged her birthday (even her parents have forgotten it). Consequently, she used local legend and her engineering background to create Mechanical Scarecrow Monsters to terrorize the town on her eighteenth birthday.\n* '''Aunt Thelma''': A [[Marine Biology|marine biologist]] at the Coolsville Marine Institute whose dolphins were being stolen in the ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' episode \"Scooby Dude\".\n* '''Uncle Dave (Walton)''': A member of the [[U.S. Border Patrol]], as seen in the episode ''Watch Out! The Willawaw!''\n* '''Uncle John''': works as an [[archaeology|archaeologist]].\n* '''Uncle Cosmo''': also works as an archaeologist.\n* '''Uncle Elmo''': a [[Physician|doctor]].\n* '''Uncle Ted''': also works as an archaeologist.\n* '''Great Uncle Dr. Von Dinkenstein''': Velma's infamous great-uncle, resembling Frankenstein. He is the reason for Velma's crime-solving business.\n\n==Portrayals==\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | header_align      = center\n | header            = Select Velmas\n | image1            =VelmaLinda.jpg\n | width1 = 152\n | caption1 = Portrayed by [[Linda Cardellini]] in ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' (2004)\n | image2            = Hayley Kiyoko as Velma Dinkley.jpg\n | width2 = 152\n | caption2 =  Portrayed by [[Hayley Kiyoko]] in ''[[Scooby-Doo!

From 1969 to 1973, [[Nicole Jaffe]] voiced Velma; from 1976 to 1979, [[Pat Stevens]] voiced the character. From 1979 to 1980, Marla Frumkin provided her voice. Velma did not speak in the ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' final episode, \"The Ransom of Scooby Chief\". After the character's absence from 1980 to 1983 series, Marla Frumkin reprised the role of Velma as a guest star in ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries]]''. Velma was absent again until ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'' when Christina Lange voiced the role. [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B.J. Ward]] voiced Velma in a [[Johnny Bravo]] crossover episode.

For most of their history, the band maintained a trio format with a singer, a sampler player and a drummer, albeit with multiple line-up changes.

During their career, the band have extensively collaborated with producer [[Roli Mosimann]].\n\nThe band's music is largely based on [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and sound manipulation; the tracks are constructed from various samples, such as distorted guitar riffs and [[string section]]s. Their later releases incorporated elements from [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[electronic music]], as well as the introducing diverser instrumentation. Their sample-based approach to rock music influenced numerous musicians such as [[David Bowie]], [[The Edge]] and [[Mike Patton]].<!-- cited in article body -->\n\n==History==\n=== Formation, ''The Young Gods'' and ''L'eau rouge'' (1985-1991)===\nCirca 1984, [[Fribourg]]-native guitarist [[Franz Treichler]] relocated to [[Geneva]] and started experimenting with [[sound collage]]s on his [[multitrack recording|4-track recorder]],<ref name=\"documents\"/><ref name=\"redbull\"/> following the dissolution of his [[punk rock|punk]] band Jof & The Ram, previously known as Johnny Furgler & the Raclette Machine.<ref name=\"documents\"/><ref name=\"fri-son\"/> Inspired by the sampling synthesizer [[E-mu Emulator]],<ref name=\"melody-maker-1987-int\"/> he started composing songs from these sound collages in early 1985 and introduced his roommate, former the Raclette Machine bassist Cesare Pizzi, to the sampler.<ref name=\"decibel-interview\"/> The band started rehearsing with the addition of drummer Frank Bagnoud, who previously played in the same band as Pizzi.<ref name=\"documents\"/>\n\nThe band took their name from the track \"Young God\" from [[Swans (band)|Swans]]'s [[Young God (EP)|1984 EP of the same name]];<ref name=\"rough-guide-rock\"/><ref name=\"mtv-young-gods\"/> Treichler was exposed to the track after booking the band for a performance in Switzerland in 1984.<ref name=\"mtv-young-gods\"/> In their early performances, Pizzi operated the samples through tape-playing keyboards and a [[Live looping|loop pedal]]; the samples were stored in cassettes and taped through an [[answering machine]].

The band performed to small crowds and regularly improvised; Treichler has started playing guitar.<ref name=\"decibel-interview\"/><ref name=\"trebuchet\"/> The resulting record, ''Data Mirage Tangram'', was released in 2019.<ref name=\"allmusic-dmt\"/> [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|Mixed]] by [[Alan Moulder]],<ref name=\"sans-fin\"/> the album was nominated for [[Independent Music Companies Association|IMPALA]]{{'}}s European Independent Album of the Year Award (2019).<ref name=\"impala\"/> The band had approached Wax Trax! Records, which released their early work, for the record's North American release, which was turned down by the label.<ref name=\"decibel-wax-trax\"/>\n\n==Musical style and legacy==\nThe Young Gods's sound has been described as [[industrial rock]],<ref name=\"decibel-interview\"/><ref name=\"skinny-ipecac\"/> [[Industrial music|industrial]],<ref name=\"cmj-only-heaven\"/> [[experimental rock|avant-rock]]<ref name=\"indepedent-super-ready\"/> and [[post-industrial music]];<ref name=\"exclaim-rouyn\"/> Treichler favours the term \"[[electronic rock]] music.\"<ref name=\"rpmonline-interview\"/> \nSince their early career, the band have used sampling as a compositional and performance tool,<ref name=\"allmusic-1987\"/> constructing tracks electronically with treated electric guitar samples, [[musique concr\u00e8te]], [[classical music|classical]] vignettes and [[electronica]].<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> ''[[Trouser Press]]'' remarked that The Young Gods's \"unusual vocals/sampler/drums configuration reconstructs rock from the ground up, producing a fiery collage of roaring guitars, blistering rhythms and [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] orchestras, all presided over by Franz Treichler's leering, guttural voice.\"<ref name=\"trouserpress\" /> Treichler has regarded \"abstraction\" and \"element of surprise\" as important factors for using the sampler, since they rendered the listeners to \"the first time you\u2019re listening to music because you don\u2019t know what it is.\"<ref name=\"redbull\" /> He has cited [[Psychedelic music#1960s: Original psychedelic era|60s psychedelia]], [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[punk rock]] movement and [[post-punk]] acts such as [[Killing Joke]] and [[Wire]] as influences on The Young Gods.<ref name=\"redbull\" /><ref name=\"rpmonline-interview\"/> Kurt Weill, whose compositions were covered on 1991's ''The Young Gods Play Kurt Weill'', is also an influence:<ref name=\"redbull\" /><ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> Treichler has credited him as a model for the band's \"experiments with music but still in a song format.\"<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/>\n\nThe band has infused various styles of music to their sound through sampling:<ref name=\"decibel-interview\"/> 1987's ''The Young Gods'' made use of classical and [[heavy metal music|metal]] guitar samples,<ref name=\"allmusic-1987\"/> while their second album, ''L{{'}}eau rouge'', incorporated [[cabaret]] and [[chanson]] influences.<ref name=\"rough-guide-rock\"/><ref name=\"allmusic-1989\"/> 1995's ''Only Heaven'' delved into ambient territories while \"being cherished equally by heavy metal, [[indie rock|indie]], [[techno]] and industrial\";<ref name=\"rough-guide-rock\"/> the ambient elements were explored on instrumental albums such as ''Heaven Deconstruction''.<ref name=\"quietus\"/> Focusing on [[Synthesizer|synthesized]], [[Found object (music)|found sounds]] and [[Audio plug-in|computer plug-in]]s on 2000's ''Second Nature'',<ref name=\"spike-second-nature\"/><ref name=\"chaos-control-interview\"/> The Young Gods also occasionally strayed away from their sampler-based formula: multi-instrumentalist Vincent H\u00e4nni was employed for the recording of ''Everybody Knows'' and the acoustic record ''Knock on Wood''. Treichler also played the guitar on those albums and ''Data Mirage Tangram''.<ref name=\"decibel-interview\"/><ref name=\"chaos-control-interview\"/>\n\nTreichler's lyrics are mostly sung in [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. ''The Young Gods'' and ''L'eau rouge'' largely featured French vocals while 1991's ''T.V. Sky'' became the band's first English-language record. On the subsequent records Treichler mixed the two languages; in 2005, he stated: \"I hope to find a solution in between. But they're very different to sing; they both have their rules.\"<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> Lyricwise, Treichler often uses [[double entendre]]s: the track \"L'Amourir\" from ''L'eau rouge'' can be interpreted as \"an intense love song or the end of a love affair.\"<ref name=\"independent-sounds-like\"/> The title track from ''L'eau rouge'' is regarded as \"a celebration of <nowiki>'red water'</nowiki>\" and is a reference to [[menstruation]].<ref name=\"allmusic-1989\"/> The track \"Lucidogen\" from ''Second Nature'' illustrates \"a fictitious drug which would make people more [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]]\" and was inspired by an anti-[[World Trade Organization]] riot that Treichler witnessed in Geneva in 1998.<ref name=\"spike-second-nature\"/> On ''The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion and Rock 'n' Roll'', authors [[Simon Reynolds]] and [[Joy Press]] argued: \"Treichler's lyrics brought out all the militaristic, fascistic tendencies inherent in [[Romanticism]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] et al., only to transcend and transfigure them;\"<ref name=\"sex-revolts\"/> in a 1995 interview, Treichler dismissed Reynolds's and Press's Nietzschean interpretation of his lyrics.<ref name=\"mtv-young-gods\"/>\n{{Quote box\n |title = \n |width=340px\n |align=left\n |quote = I thought they had some extraordinary ideas, by taking one chunk guitar riff and then sampling it, looping it, and having that as the consistent pattern through a piece of music.

The Model X has standard a [[collision avoidance system]] that uses radar-based autonomous emergency braking (AEB) and side-directed ultrasound detection that steers the car away from threats. Tesla uses a wide-band radar system to help prevent the falcon wing doors from hitting nearby objects when opening or closing.\n\nThe Model X has double-hinged falcon wing doors which open upwards, allowing the leading edge of the door to remain tucked close to the body, unlike traditional gull-wing doors. Tesla claims the falcon-wing (modified gull-wing) doors ease access to the vehicle by having the door raise up vertically, rather than swinging out hinged at the front, which tremendously reduces accessibility.

The Model X does come with Autopilot as standard, and has an optional [[Tesla Autopilot#Hardware 3|Full Self Driving]] chip. The Model X has standard a [[collision avoidance system]] that uses radar-based autonomous emergency braking (AEB) and side-directed ultrasound detection that steers the car away from threats. Tesla uses a wide-band radar system to help prevent the falcon wing doors from hitting nearby objects when opening or closing.\n\nThe Model X has double-hinged falcon wing doors which open upwards, allowing the leading edge of the door to remain tucked close to the body, unlike traditional gull-wing doors. Tesla claims the falcon-wing (modified gull-wing) doors ease access to the vehicle by having the door raise up vertically, rather than swinging out hinged at the front, which tremendously reduces accessibility. The Model X offers room for seven adults and their luggage in three rows of seating and front and rear trunks.<ref name=NYT032013/>\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:FoS20162016 0625 104642AA (27867778826).jpg|thumb|The Model X has double-hinged [[gullwing doors|falcon doors]]]]\n[[File:Tesla Model S & X side by side at the Gilroy Supercharger.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Tesla Model S]] (left) and Model X (right) share the same platform and 30% of their parts]]\nThe Model X weighs about 8% more than the Model S and shares about 30% of its parts content \u2013 down from around 60% expected when development began.

to be a much, much higher-volume car, and if there are any quality issues, that could overwhelm the service centers and undermine the Tesla brand.\" Nonetheless, Sacconaghi was impressed with the ride quality, performance and interior space, and concluded that the 3 \"risks cannibalizing the [much more expensive] Model S going forward.\"<ref>{{cite

to be a much, much higher-volume car, and if there are any quality issues, that could overwhelm the service centers and undermine the Tesla brand.\" Nonetheless, Sacconaghi was impressed with the ride
