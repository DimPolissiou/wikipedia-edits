They finished in 10th position in the league and reached the fourth qualifying round of the [[FA Cup]].\n\nBradford City were formed following a series of meetings during the first half of 1903 and replaced the former [[rugby league]] club of [[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]], whose [[Valley Parade]] ground they used. The club had already signed six players before they were accepted into the league before the rest of the side were later signed by a five-man committee. The board directors appointed [[Robert Campbell (football manager)|Robert Campbell]] as the club's first manager. Bradford City's first game ended in a 2\u20130 defeat at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and the first home game resulted in another loss to [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]]. Club captain [[John McMillan (footballer born 1871)|Johnny McMillan]] finished the top goalscorer with 14 league and two FA Cup goals.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|History of Bradford City A.F.C.}}\nOrganised league football had been played in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] since 1894 in the West Yorkshire League,<ref>{{Harvnb|Frost|1988|page=9}}</ref> but no side from the county had played in the [[Football League]]. So on 30 January 1903, Scotsman James Whyte, a sub-editor of the ''Bradford Observer'', met with [[The Football Association|Football Association]] representative John Brunt at [[Valley Parade]], the home of the city's [[rugby league]] side [[Manningham F.C.|Manningham Football Club]], to discuss establishing a Football League club within Bradford. In May, Manningham's committee decided to swap codes from rugby to association football<ref>{{Harvnb|Frost|1988|page=11}}</ref> and so the Football League decided to invite Bradford City to join their league in a bid to introduce association football to the West Riding, the main sport in which was rugby league.<ref name=\"frost 13\">{{Harvnb|Frost|1988|page=13}}</ref> The League voted in favour of replacing [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]],<ref name=\"frost 13\"/> who had finished the [[1902\u201303 in English football|1902\u201303 season]] in 16th position in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]],<ref name=\"butler 50\">{{Harvnb|Butler|1987|page=50}}</ref> with Bradford City even though Bradford had yet to play a single game.<ref name=\"frost 13\"/>\n\n==Review==\n[[File:Bradford City 1903-04.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City's]] first squad.

Instead, Campbell and Cutts, decided on the first selection for the opening game of the season with [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] by playing a series of ''Whites v Stripes'' games between professionals already signed by the club and amateur players. The first squad was signed at a cost of \u00a3917 10s 0d, with the players choosing [[John McMillan (footballer born 1871)|Johnny McMillan]] as their own captain.<ref name=\"frost 14\"/> Millar, a defender signed from [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], was chosen as vice-captain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frost|1988|page=124}}</ref>\n\n===September===\nBradford City's first league game was at [[Blundell Park]] against Grimsby Town on 1 September 1903, on a sunny Tuesday evening in front of 10,000 fans.

The first ended in a 5\u20132 defeat to [[Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]]; the second \u2013 on 24 October \u2013 finished in a 3\u20131 victory to Bradford against fellow Yorkshire side [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. Instead, City played their first games in the [[FA Cup]] in the club's history. The first qualifying round match and the club's debut in the competition was a 6\u20131 victory against Rockingham Colliery with six different City players on the scoresheet. City progressed through the following two qualifying rounds against Mirfield United and [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]], with all three games being held at Valley Parade.<ref name=\"frost 170\"/>\n\nDuring October, City also hosted an inter-league game between the English and Irish Leagues at Valley Parade. Although the ground was not up to high standards, the Football League was keen to encourage football in Bradford. An estimated 20,000 supporters attended the match which finished with a 2\u20131 victory for the Football League.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frost|1988|page=62}}</ref> The club also made their first signing since the start of the season, bringing in forward [[Thomas Drain]] from Scottish side Maybole.<ref name=\"frost transfers\"/>\n\n===November and December===\nCity went another two weeks before playing again when their FA Cup run came to an end with a 2\u20131 defeat at their fellow Second Division side [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in the fourth qualifying round. They returned to league action on 21 November against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], nearly a month since their win against Barnsley. Drain, who had scored on his debut against Barnsley, scored Bradford's first ever [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]], but the game finished in a 3\u20133 draw. A week later, Drain scored for the third successive league match but City lost 3\u20132 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].<ref name=\"frost 170\"/>\n\nBradford played six games during December, with the first two ending in draws against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. On 19 December, City defeated [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester Fosse]] 4\u20130 at Valley Parade. It was City's highest league victory of the season with McMillan scoring his side's second hat-trick of the campaign. City finished the month with three games in the space of four days. They first lost 4\u20131 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] on Christmas Day, before a 1\u20130 victory at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. The year finished with a draw against Port Vale.<ref name=\"frost 170\"/>\n\n===January, February and March===\nAt the turn of the new year, City were defeated by Gainsborough Trinity, before they completed their first double by defeating Burton United 3\u20130. Two draws followed \u2013 against Bristol City and Manchester United. City extended their unbeaten run by winning all three matches during February, with victories against [[Glossop North End F.C.|Glossop]], Barnsley and [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. Each victory finished 2\u20131 with Beckram, Drain and Robinson all scoring twice during the month. The club's six-game unbeaten run came to an end in the return fixture at Glossop, with further defeats following against Stockport County and Chesterfield. The three-game losing streak was overturned with a 3\u20130 win over Burnley; Graham scored twice to become the third player to score more than one goal during a league game.<ref name=\"frost 170\"/>\n\n===April===\nCity packed in eight games during April to complete the league season. On 1 April, they lost to Lincoln City and then the following day they lost to Preston North End. A third game in four days finished in a 1\u20131 draw with Chesterfield. The first victory of the month came in the reverse fixture against the club's first ever league opponents Grimsby Town. City lost 1\u20130 to Bolton Wanderers before a 2\u20131 victory followed against Leicester Fosse, with McMillan scoring one of the goals. The final two matches both ended in defeats without City scoring; first to Arsenal, then to Blackpool.<ref name=\"frost 170\"/> City finished 10th at the end of the first season recording 31 points from 34 games.<ref name=\"butler 50\"/>\n\nTeam captain McMillan finished as the club's top scorer with 14 goals.<ref name=\"frost 171\"/> He played 32 games, with goalkeeper Seymour, [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|half-back]] Robinson and forward Graham all being ever-presents.<ref name=\"frost 171\"/> With the advent of league football in Bradford, thousands of people came to home games, resulting in the club's end-of-season receipts totalling \u00a33,896.

They finished in 10th position in the league and reached the fourth qualifying round of the [[FA Cup]].\n\nBradford City were formed following a series of meetings during the first half of 1903 and replaced the former [[rugby league]] club of [[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]], whose [[Valley Parade]] ground they used. The club had already signed six players before they were accepted into the league before the rest of the side were later signed by a five-man committee. The board directors appointed [[Robert Campbell (football manager)|Robert Campbell]] as the club's first manager. Bradford City's first game ended in a 2\u20130 defeat at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] and the first home game resulted in another loss to [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]].

So on 30 January 1903, Scotsman James Whyte, a sub-editor of the ''Bradford Observer'', met with [[The Football Association|Football Association]] representative John Brunt at [[Valley Parade]], the home of the city's [[rugby league]] side [[Manningham F.C.|Manningham Football Club]], to discuss establishing a Football League club within Bradford. In May, Manningham's committee decided to swap codes from rugby to association football<ref>{{Harvnb|Frost|1988|page=11}}</ref> and so the Football League decided to invite Bradford City to join their league in a bid to introduce association football to the West Riding, the main sport in which was rugby league.<ref name=\"frost 13\">{{Harvnb|Frost|1988|page=13}}</ref> The League voted in favour of replacing [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]],<ref name=\"frost 13\"/> who had finished the [[1902\u201303 in English football|1902\u201303 season]] in 16th position in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]],<ref name=\"butler 50\">{{Harvnb|Butler|1987|page=50}}</ref> with Bradford City even though Bradford had yet to play a single game.<ref name=\"frost 13\"/>\n\n==Review==\n[[File:Bradford City 1903-04.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City's]] first squad.

Instead, City played their first games in the [[FA Cup]] in the club's history. The first qualifying round match and the club's debut in the competition was a 6\u20131 victory against Rockingham Colliery with six different City players on the scoresheet. City progressed through the following two qualifying rounds against Mirfield United and [[Worksop Town F.C.|Worksop Town]], with all three games being held at Valley Parade.<ref name=\"frost 170\"/>\n\nDuring October, City also hosted an inter-league game between the English and Irish Leagues at Valley Parade. Although the ground was not up to high standards, the Football League was keen to encourage football in Bradford. An estimated 20,000 supporters attended the match which finished with a 2\u20131 victory for the Football League.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frost|1988|page=62}}</ref> The club also made their first signing since the start of the season, bringing in forward [[Thomas Drain]] from Scottish side Maybole.<ref name=\"frost transfers\"/>\n\n===November and December===\nCity went another two weeks before playing again when their FA Cup run came to an end with a 2\u20131 defeat at their fellow Second Division side [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in the fourth qualifying round. They returned to league action on 21 November against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], nearly a month since their win against Barnsley. Drain, who had scored on his debut against Barnsley, scored Bradford's first ever [[Hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]], but the game finished in a 3\u20133 draw. A week later, Drain scored for the third successive league match but City lost 3\u20132 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].<ref name=\"frost 170\"/>\n\nBradford played six games during December, with the first two ending in draws against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. On 19 December, City defeated [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester Fosse]] 4\u20130 at Valley Parade. It was City's highest league victory of the season with McMillan scoring his side's second hat-trick of the campaign. City finished the month with three games in the space of four days. They first lost 4\u20131 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] on Christmas Day, before a 1\u20130 victory at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. The year finished with a draw against Port Vale.<ref name=\"frost 170\"/>\n\n===January, February and March===\nAt the turn of the new year, City were defeated by Gainsborough Trinity, before they completed their first double by defeating Burton United 3\u20130. Two draws followed \u2013 against Bristol City and Manchester United. City extended their unbeaten run by winning all three matches during February, with victories against [[Glossop North End F.C.|Glossop]], Barnsley and [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. Each victory finished 2\u20131 with Beckram, Drain and Robinson all scoring twice during the month. The club's six-game unbeaten run came to an end in the return fixture at Glossop, with further defeats following against Stockport County and Chesterfield. The three-game losing streak was overturned with a 3\u20130 win over Burnley; Graham scored twice to become the third player to score more than one goal during a league game.<ref name=\"frost 170\"/>\n\n===April===\nCity packed in eight games during April to complete the league season. On 1 April, they lost to Lincoln City and then the following day they lost to Preston North End. A third game in four days finished in a 1\u20131 draw with Chesterfield. The first victory of the month came in the reverse fixture against the club's first ever league opponents Grimsby Town.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B.

He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Sherman|Sherman]]\u2019s Atlanta campaign, before retiring from front-line service through illness. He later received the [[Medal of Honor]].\n\nIn [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]]\u2019s administration, he was Assistant Treasurer of the United States, abusing that position to [[Black Friday (1869)|manipulate the price of gold]], and being forced to resign. He then resumed his business career. Butterfield\u2019s extensive war archives are displayed at Cold Spring, New York.\n\n==Early life==\nButterfield was born on October 31, 1831 in [[Utica, New York]]. He attended Union Academy and then graduated in 1849, from [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], where he became a member of the [[Sigma Phi Society]]. That same year, his father, [[John Warren Butterfield]], founded the express company of Butterfield, Wasson, and Co., which later became the [[American Express]] Company. After graduating, Daniel studied law but as he was too young to sit the New York bar exam, he toured the country instead. Upon his return to Utica, he joined the Utica Citizen\u2019s Corps as a private.<ref name=union>[http://www.union.edu/library/collections/digital-collections/notables/notables-archive/butterfield-daniel/ \"Daniel Butterfield (1831 - 1901)\", Schaffer Library, Union College]</ref> He was employed in various businesses in New York and the South, including the [[American Express]] Company, which had been co-founded by his father, an owner of the Overland Mail Company, stage-coaches, steamships and telegraph lines.\n\n==Civil War==\n[[File:DanielButterfieldonMount.jpg|thumb|Union General Daniel Butterfield]]\nButterfield went to New York City as superintendent of the eastern division of his father's company. There, he joined the Seventy-First regiment of New York militia as a captain.

Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]]'s [[Army of the Potomac]] for the [[Peninsula Campaign]] in the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Fitz John Porter]].  In the [[Seven Days Battles]], at [[Battle of Gaines' Mill|Gaines' Mill]] on June 27, 1862, he was wounded but demonstrated the bravery that was eventually recognized in 1892, with the [[Medal of Honor]].\n \nButterfield continued in brigade command at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] and the [[Battle of Antietam]], became division commander and then V Corps commander for the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. His corps was one of those assaulting through the city before facing an assault from Marye's Heights. After the debacles of Fredericksburg and the [[Mud March (American Civil War)|Mud March]], Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] replaced [[Ambrose Burnside]] as Army of the Potomac commander and Butterfield became Hooker's [[Chief of staff (military)|chief of staff]] in January 1863. Butterfield was promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] of volunteers in March 1863, with a date of rank of November 29, 1862.<ref>Eicher, p. 158.</ref>\n\nHooker and Butterfield developed a close personal and political relationship. To the disgust of many army generals, their headquarters were frequented by women and liquor, being described as a combination of a \"bar and brothel\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} Political infighting became rampant in the high command and Butterfield was widely disliked by most of his colleagues.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, in the spring of 1863, the two officers managed to turn around the poor morale of the army and greatly improved food, shelter and medical support. During this period Butterfield introduced another custom that remains in the Army today: the use of distinctive hat or shoulder patches to denote the unit to which a soldier belongs, in this case the corps. He was inspired by the division patches used earlier by Maj. Gen. [[Philip Kearny]], but extended those to the full army; Butterfield designed most of the patches himself.\n\nHooker was replaced after the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] by Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]], just before the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Meade distrusted Butterfield, but retained him as chief of staff. Butterfield was wounded at Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, and left active duty to convalesce. Meade removed him as chief of staff on July 14, 1863.<ref>Hyde, pp. 264\u2013265 gives the text of the letter.</ref>  On July 1, 1863, Butterfield was appointed as colonel of the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|5th United States Infantry]].\n\nAfter Gettysburg, Butterfield actively undermined Meade in cooperation with Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Sickles]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} another crony of Hooker's. Although the battle was a great Union victory, Sickles and Butterfield testified to the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]] that Meade vacillated and planned as early as July 1, to retreat from Gettysburg, thus damaging his reputation. Butterfield's chief evidence for this assertion was the Pipe Creek Circular that Meade had his staff prepare before it became apparent there would be a battle at Gettysburg.<ref>Hyde, p. 275.</ref>\n\nButterfield returned to duty that fall as chief of staff once again for Hooker, now commanding two corps in the [[Army of the Cumberland]] at [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. When these two depleted corps (the [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI]] and [[XII Corps (Union Army)|XII]] Corps) were combined to form the [[XX Corps (Union Army)|XX Corps]], Butterfield was given the 3rd Division, which he led through the first half of [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]]'s [[Atlanta Campaign]]. Illness prevented his continuing with Sherman, resulting in Butterfield's assuming light duties at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], followed by recruiting and the command of harbor forces in New York.\n\n===''Taps''===\nWhile the Union Army recuperated at [[Harrison's Landing, Virginia]], from its grueling withdrawal during the Seven Days Battles, Butterfield experimented with bugle calls and is credited with the composition of \"[[Taps]]\". He wrote \"Taps\" to replace the customary firing of three rifle volleys at the end of burials during battle. \"Taps\" also replaced ''Tattoo'', the French bugle call to signal \"lights out\". Butterfield's bugler, Oliver W. Norton of the 83rd Pennsylvania Volunteers, was the first to sound the new call. Within months, \"Taps\" was played by buglers in both the Union and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] armies. This account has been disputed by some military and musical historians, who maintain Butterfield merely revised an earlier call known as the ''[[Scott Tattoo]]'' and did not compose an original work.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Medal of Honor===\n[[File:US-MOH-1896.png|thumb|right|75px|Medal of Honor(1896 version)]]\nRank and organization: Brigadier General, U.S. Volunteers.

Sherman as he approached Atlanta, a battle map of Gettysburg, handwritten casualty lists, a manuscript by a field officer detailing the Battle of Gettysburg, and other material.\n\nBequeathed to the library by his widow in 1927, the collection's historical significance was not known until April 2011 when the West Point Museum Director & Chief Curator David Reel reviewed the collection.  According to Reel, \"The historical importance of the collection is unquestionable as a comprehensive archive of a major figure of the American Civil War and contains documents and letters, telegrams from 1861-64 that are irreplaceable and significant in content. . . No doubt, scholars of United States History and specifically the American Civil War will find a treasure trove of original, period material within the archive.\" <ref>[http://www.clir.org/hiddencollections/registry/hc.0976 \"General Daniel Butterfield Civil War Collection\", council on Library and Information Resources]</ref>\n\nHe has also been memorialized in the novel ''[[The Killer Angels]]'' by [[Michael Shaara]]&mdash;a character in the 20th Maine claims that their [[brigade]] bugle call was written by Butterfield and is based on his own name.\nHe was also referenced in the movie ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]''.\n\nThere is a statue of the general by [[Gutzon Borglum]] in [[Sakura Park]] in Manhattan.<ref name=sakura>[http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/sakura-park/monuments/202 \"Sakura Park\", New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|American Civil War}}\n*[[List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients: A\u2013F#B|List of American Civil War Medal of Honor recipients: A\u2013F]]\n*[[List of American Civil War generals (Union)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Eicher, John H., and [[David J.
