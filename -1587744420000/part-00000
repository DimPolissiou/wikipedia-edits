The family includes many of the most popular [[Game (hunting)|gamebirds]].<ref name=McGowan1994>\n   {{Cite book |isbn=84-87334-15-6 |year=1994 |title=New World Vultures to Guineafowl |chapter=Family Phasianidae (Pheasants and Partridges) |series=Handbook of the Birds of the World |volume=2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofbirdso0001unse/page/434 434\u2013479] |last1=McGowan |first1=P.

Sometimes, additional families and birds are treated as part of this family. For example, the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] includes the [[Tetraonidae]] (grouse), [[Numididae]] (guineafowl), and [[Meleagrididae]] (turkeys) as subfamilies in Phasianidae.\n\n==Description==\nPhasianids are terrestrial. They range in weight from {{convert|43|g|oz|abbr=on}} in the case of the [[king quail]] to {{convert|6|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in the case of the [[Indian peafowl]]. If turkeys are included, rather than classified as a separate family, then the considerably heavier [[wild turkey]] reaches a maximum weight of more than {{convert|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Length in this taxonomic family can vary from {{convert|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in the king quail up to {{convert|300|cm|in|abbr=on}} (including elongated tail streamers) in [[green peafowl]], thus they beat even the [[true parrot]]s in length diversity within a family of birds.<ref name=McGowan1994 /><ref>\nHarper, D. 1986. ''Pet Birds for Home and Garden''. London: Salamander Books Ltd.</ref> Generally, [[sexual dimorphism]] is seen in size, with males tending to be larger than females. They are generally plump, with broad, relatively short [[wing]]s and strong legs. Many have a spur on their [[leg]]s, a feature shared only with guineafowl and turkeys. The bill is short and generally strong, particularly in species that dig for food. Males of the larger [[species]] often have brightly coloured [[plumage]], as well as facial ornaments such as [[wattle (anatomy)|wattle]]s or [[Crest (feathers)|crests]].\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe Phasianidae are mostly an [[Old World]] family, with a distribution that includes most of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] (except the far north),  all of [[Africa]] except the driest [[desert]]s, and south into much of eastern [[Australia]] and (formerly) [[New Zealand]]. The Meleagridinae (turkeys) are native to the [[New World]], while the [[Tetraoninae]] (grouse) are circumpolar.  The greatest diversity of species is in [[Southeast Asia]] and Africa. The [[Congo peacock]] is specific to the African [[Congo Basin|Congo]]. The subfamily Perdicinae has a much more widespread distribution. Within their range, they occupy almost every available habitat except for the [[boreal forest]]s and [[tundra]].\n\nThe family is generally [[Wikt:sedentary|sedentary]] and resident, although some quails undertake long [[bird migration|migrations]]. Several species in the family have been widely [[introduced species|introduced]] around the world, particularly pheasants, which have been introduced to Europe, Australia, and the Americas, specifically for hunting purposes. Captive populations of peacocks and chickens have also escaped (or been released) and become [[feral]]. Cool right!?\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nThe pheasants and partridges have a varied diet, with foods taken ranging from purely vegetarian diets of seeds, leaves, fruits, tubers, and roots, to small animals including insects, insect grubs, and even small reptiles. Most species either specialise in feeding on plant matter or are predatory, although the chicks of most species are insectivorous.\n\nIn addition to the variation in diet, a considerable amount of variation exists in breeding strategies among the Phasianidae. Compared to birds in general, a large number of species do not engage in [[monogamy]] (the typical breeding system of most birds). The francolins of Africa and some partridges are reportedly monogamous, but polygamy has been reported in the pheasants and junglefowl, some quail, and the breeding displays of peacocks have been compared to those of a [[Lek (biology)|lek]]. Nesting usually occurs on the ground; only the [[tragopan]]s nest higher up in stumps of bushes. Nests can vary from mounds of vegetation to slight [[Bird nest#Scrape|scrapes]] in the ground. As many as 18 eggs can be laid in the nest, although 7-12 are the more usual numbers, with smaller numbers in tropical species. [[Avian incubation|Incubation]] is almost always performed by the female only, and lasts from 14\u201330 days depending on the species.\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nSeveral species of pheasants and partridges are extremely important to humans. The [[red junglefowl]] of Southeast Asia is the wild ancestor of the domesticated [[chicken]], the most important bird in agriculture. [[Ring-necked pheasant]]s, several partridge and quail species, and some francolins have been widely introduced and managed as game birds for hunting. Several species are [[threatened]] by human activities.\n\n==Systematics and evolution==\n{{see also|List of Galliformes}}\nThe [[clade]] Phasianidae is the largest of the branch [[Galliformes]], comprising more than 150 species. This group includes the pheasants and partridges, junglefowl chickens, quail, and peafowl.\nTurkeys and grouse have also been recognized as having their origins in the pheasant- and partridge-like birds.\n\nUntil the early 1990s, this family was broken up into two [[subfamily (biology)|subfamilies]]: the [[Phasianinae]], including [[pheasant]]s, [[tragopan]]s, [[junglefowl]]s, and [[peafowl]]s;<ref name=Johnsgard1986>\n   {{Cite book \n   |title=The Pheasants of the World \n   |year=1986 \n   |last1=Johnsgard |first1=P.

[[pheasant]]s, [[partridge]]s, [[junglefowl]], [[chicken]]s, [[Turkey bird|turkey]]s, [[Old World quail]], and [[peafowl]]. The family includes many of the most popular [[Game (hunting)|gamebirds]].<ref name=McGowan1994>\n   {{Cite book |isbn=84-87334-15-6 |year=1994 |title=New World Vultures to Guineafowl |chapter=Family Phasianidae (Pheasants and Partridges) |series=Handbook of the Birds of the World |volume=2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofbirdso0001unse/page/434 434\u2013479] |last1=McGowan |first1=P.

Sometimes, additional families and birds are treated as part of this family. For example, the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] includes the [[Tetraonidae]] (grouse), [[Numididae]] (guineafowl), and [[Meleagrididae]] (turkeys) as subfamilies in Phasianidae.\n\n==Description==\nPhasianids are terrestrial. They range in weight from {{convert|43|g|oz|abbr=on}} in the case of the [[king quail]] to {{convert|6|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in the case of the [[Indian peafowl]]. If turkeys are included, rather than classified as a separate family, then the considerably heavier [[wild turkey]] reaches a maximum weight of more than {{convert|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Length in this taxonomic family can vary from {{convert|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in the king quail up to {{convert|300|cm|in|abbr=on}} (including elongated tail streamers) in [[green peafowl]], thus they beat even the [[true parrot]]s in length diversity within a family of birds.<ref name=McGowan1994 /><ref>\nHarper, D. 1986. ''Pet Birds for Home and Garden''. London: Salamander Books Ltd.</ref> Generally, [[sexual dimorphism]] is seen in size, with males tending to be larger than females. They are generally plump, with broad, relatively short [[wing]]s and strong legs. Many have a spur on their [[leg]]s, a feature shared only with guineafowl and turkeys. The bill is short and generally strong, particularly in species that dig for food. Males of the larger [[species]] often have brightly coloured [[plumage]], as well as facial ornaments such as [[wattle (anatomy)|wattle]]s or [[Crest (feathers)|crests]].\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe Phasianidae are mostly an [[Old World]] family, with a distribution that includes most of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] (except the far north),  all of [[Africa]] except the driest [[desert]]s, and south into much of eastern [[Australia]] and (formerly) [[New Zealand]]. The Meleagridinae (turkeys) are native to the [[New World]], while the [[Tetraoninae]] (grouse) are circumpolar.  The greatest diversity of species is in [[Southeast Asia]] and Africa. The [[Congo peacock]] is specific to the African [[Congo Basin|Congo]]. The subfamily Perdicinae has a much more widespread distribution. Within their range, they occupy almost every available habitat except for the [[boreal forest]]s and [[tundra]].\n\nThe family is generally [[Wikt:sedentary|sedentary]] and resident, although some quails undertake long [[bird migration|migrations]]. Several species in the family have been widely [[introduced species|introduced]] around the world, particularly pheasants, which have been introduced to Europe, Australia, and the Americas, specifically for hunting purposes. Captive populations of peacocks and chickens have also escaped (or been released) and become [[feral]].\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nThe pheasants and partridges have a varied diet, with foods taken ranging from purely vegetarian diets of seeds, leaves, fruits, tubers, and roots, to small animals including insects, insect grubs, and even small reptiles. Most species either specialise in feeding on plant matter or are predatory, although the chicks of most species are insectivorous.\n\nIn addition to the variation in diet, a considerable amount of variation exists in breeding strategies among the Phasianidae. Compared to birds in general, a large number of species do not engage in [[monogamy]] (the typical breeding system of most birds). The francolins of Africa and some partridges are reportedly monogamous, but polygamy has been reported in the pheasants and junglefowl, some quail, and the breeding displays of peacocks have been compared to those of a [[Lek (biology)|lek]]. Nesting usually occurs on the ground; only the [[tragopan]]s nest higher up in stumps of bushes. Nests can vary from mounds of vegetation to slight [[Bird nest#Scrape|scrapes]] in the ground. As many as 18 eggs can be laid in the nest, although 7-12 are the more usual numbers, with smaller numbers in tropical species. [[Avian incubation|Incubation]] is almost always performed by the female only, and lasts from 14\u201330 days depending on the species.\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nSeveral species of pheasants and partridges are extremely important to humans. The [[red junglefowl]] of Southeast Asia is the wild ancestor of the domesticated [[chicken]], the most important bird in agriculture. [[Ring-necked pheasant]]s, several partridge and quail species, and some francolins have been widely introduced and managed as game birds for hunting. Several species are [[threatened]] by human activities.\n\n==Systematics and evolution==\n{{see also|List of Galliformes}}\nThe [[clade]] Phasianidae is the largest of the branch [[Galliformes]], comprising more than 150 species. This group includes the pheasants and partridges, junglefowl chickens, quail, and peafowl.\nTurkeys and grouse have also been recognized as having their origins in the pheasant- and partridge-like birds.\n\nUntil the early 1990s, this family was broken up into two [[subfamily (biology)|subfamilies]]: the [[Phasianinae]], including [[pheasant]]s, [[tragopan]]s, [[junglefowl]]s, and [[peafowl]]s;<ref name=Johnsgard1986>\n   {{Cite book \n   |title=The Pheasants of the World \n   |year=1986 \n   |last1=Johnsgard |first1=P.

The [[Fitzgerald Inquiry]] which ran from July 1987 to July 1989 led to charges being laid against many long-serving police, including Jack Herbert, Licensing Branch Sergeant Harry Burgess, Assistant Commissioner Graeme Parker<ref name=\"Whitton\">{{cite news |first = Evan |last=Whitton |authorlink=Evan Whitton|title=When the Sunshine State set up a scoundrel trap |url = http://theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21714244-28737,00.html|work=[[The Australian]] |date = 12 May 2007 |accessdate=14 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070517055606/http://theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21714244-28737,00.html |archivedate=17 May 2007}}</ref> and Commissioner [[Terry Lewis (Queensland)|Terry Lewis]]. Lewis was jailed and served ten and a half years.\n\nThe Fitzgerald Inquiry also led to a [[perjury]] trial against former Premier [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], which ended with a [[hung jury]]. The Director of Public Prosecutions elected not to pursue a retrial due to Bjelke-Petersen's age and health. It was later revealed that the jury foreman for the trial was a member of the [[Young Nationals (Australia)|Young Nationals]] and identified with the \"friends of Joh\" movement.\n\nThe [[Criminal Justice Commission (Australia)|Criminal Justice Commission]] was established in 1989 by the ''Queensland Criminal Justice Act 1989'', following widespread corruption amongst high-level Queensland politicians and police officers being uncovered in the Fitzgerald Inquiry. It has since merged in 2002 with the [[Queensland Crime Commission]] to form the [[Crime and Corruption Commission|Crime and Misconduct Commission]]. The Criminal Justice Commission was responsible for significant research into the Queensland Police Service.\n\nA new [[computer]]ised message switching system was put into use throughout Queensland in 1980.

A second helicopter a [[BO 105]] was introduced by July 2014 in time for the [[2014 G20 Brisbane summit|G20]] summit in November, responsible for patrolling Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Queensland Government|title=Queensland\u2019s second police helicopter launched|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2014/7/1/queenslands-second-police-helicopter-launched|website=Ministerial statements|accessdate=26 April 2015|date=1 July 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619134604/http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2014/7/1/queenslands-second-police-helicopter-launched|archivedate=19 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The helicopters have [[Forward-looking infrared|Forward Looking Infrared]] (FLIR) and Searchlight (TRAKKA beam) capabilities.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/museum/2018/09/25/sunday-lecture-series-polair-policing-by-air/|title=SUNDAY LECTURE SERIES: POLAIR \u2013 Policing By Air|date=25 September 2018|publisher=[[Queensland Police Museum]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129190753/https://mypolice.qld.gov.au/museum/2018/09/25/sunday-lecture-series-polair-policing-by-air/|archive-date=30 November 2018|url-status=live|access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Queensland Police Service drone, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), 2018.jpg|thumb|Queensland Police Service drone, 2018]]\nIn a first for an Australian police department, Queensland Police have purchased numerous [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs; i.e. drones) which have already been used for surveillance purposes in numerous situations where sending in officers is deemed too risky such as during sieges or hostage rescue operations.

The two episodes focus on the group of [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Twilight Sparkle|Twilight Sparkle]] and her friends as they visit a village controlled by [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Starlight Glimmer|Starlight Glimmer]], a unicorn who strives to achieve \"equality\" amongst all ponies by removing their cutie marks. Both episodes were written by Scott Sonneborn and [[M.A. Larson]] from a story by [[Meghan McCarthy]]. It is directed by Jayson Thiessen and co-directed by Jim Miller with Stephen Davis, Kirsten Newlands, and Sarah Wall as executive producers alongside Devon Cody as producer. It was first broadcast on [[Discovery Family]] on April 4, 2015, with both parts airing as an hour-long event.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part one===\nAt [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Twilight Sparkle|Twilight Sparkle]]'s new castle, she and her friends sit on their respective thrones and unwittingly activate a holographic map of Equestria, with floating images of their cutie marks pointing to a remote location on it. Deciding to investigate, the six friends follow the map to find a utopian village of ponies who share the same cutie mark, a black [[equals sign]]. The six become wary of the villagers' exaggerated smiles and overly welcoming nature, except for [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Fluttershy|Fluttershy]], who is charmed by their courtesy. The six meet the village's leader, [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Starlight Glimmer|Starlight Glimmer]], who explains that all the villagers have given up their cutie marks under her philosophy that differing talents and opinions cause strife between friends. Starlight encourages the six to remain and experience the village life, expecting for the rest of Equestria to follow her example.\n\nThe six friends later argue over their purpose for coming to the village, which attracts the attention of Sugar Belle, a baker who regrets giving up her baking talent. Sugar Belle is perplexed when the six are able to set their argument aside, and asks to see them in private. The six meet with her alongside two other villagers, Party Favor and Night Glider, who express eager curiosity over the six's cutie marks and friendship. Desiring to have their original marks again, the villagers inform the six of a cavern vault where their marks are stored alongside a mystical staff called the Staff of Sameness that, according to Starlight, grants her the ability to remove a pony's mark. Starlight leads the six to the vault, where the six become surrounded by the other villagers as Starlight forcibly removes their cutie marks with the staff.\n\n===Part two===\nWithout their cutie marks, the six are trapped in a village prison chamber to be resocialized. Realizing they can escape by convincing Starlight they have conformed to her ways, the group sends Fluttershy to act the part. Fluttershy is successfully welcomed into the community, while Starlight punishes Party Favor to be imprisoned with the other five after he \"confesses\" to helping them alone, protecting Sugar Belle and Night Glider. Fluttershy later spies on Starlight to find she has sent Double Diamond to collect the six friends' cutie marks, with larger plans for Twilight's mark. She then sees Starlight accidentally splashing water over herself, washing off her own equal mark to reveal her real, unremoved mark.\n\nWhen Starlight releases the five friends and Party Favor the next day, Fluttershy splashes water on Starlight to reveal her real mark to the villagers. Starlight confesses that she removed the ponies' marks with her own magic, and that the Staff of Sameness is worthless. The villagers revolt and reclaim their original cutie marks from the vault, while Starlight flees into the mountains with the six friends' marks.

The two episodes focus on the group of [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Twilight Sparkle|Twilight Sparkle]] and her friends as they visit a village controlled by [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Starlight Glimmer|Starlight Glimmer]], a unicorn who strives to achieve \"equality\" amongst all ponies by removing their cutie marks. Both episodes were written by Scott Sonneborn and [[M.A. Larson]] from a story by [[Meghan McCarthy]]. It is directed by Jayson Thiessen and co-directed by Jim Miller with Stephen Davis, Kirsten Newlands, and Sarah Wall as executive producers alongside Devon Cody as producer. It was first broadcast on [[Discovery Family]] on April 4, 2015, with both parts airing as an hour-long event.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part one===\nAt [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Twilight Sparkle|Twilight Sparkle]]'s new castle, she and her friends sit on their respective thrones and unwittingly activate a holographic map of Equestria, with floating images of their cutie marks pointing to a remote location on it. Deciding to investigate, the six friends follow the map to find a utopian village of ponies who share the same cutie mark, a black [[equals sign]]. The six become wary of the villagers' exaggerated smiles and overly welcoming nature, except for [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Fluttershy|Fluttershy]], who is charmed by their courtesy. The six meet the village's leader, [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Starlight Glimmer|Starlight Glimmer]], who explains that all the villagers have given up their cutie marks under her philosophy that differing talents and opinions cause strife between friends. Starlight encourages the six to remain and experience the village life, expecting for the rest of Equestria to follow her example.\n\nThe six friends later argue over their purpose for coming to the village, which attracts the attention of Sugar Belle, a baker who regrets giving up her baking talent. Sugar Belle is perplexed when the six are able to set their argument aside, and asks to see them in private. The six meet with her alongside two other villagers, Party Favor and Night Glider, who express eager curiosity over the six's cutie marks and friendship. Desiring to have their original marks again, the villagers inform the six of a cavern vault where their marks are stored alongside a mystical staff called the Staff of Sameness that, according to Starlight, grants her the ability to remove a pony's mark. Starlight leads the six to the vault, where the six become surrounded by the other villagers as Starlight forcibly removes their cutie marks with the staff.\n\n===Part two===\nWithout their cutie marks, the six are trapped in a village prison chamber to be resocialized. Realizing they can escape by convincing Starlight they have conformed to her ways, the group sends Fluttershy to act the part. Fluttershy is successfully welcomed into the community, while Starlight punishes Party Favor to be imprisoned with the other five after he \"confesses\" to helping them alone, protecting Sugar Belle and Night Glider. Fluttershy later spies on Starlight to find she has sent Double Diamond to collect the six friends' cutie marks, with larger plans for Twilight's mark. She then sees Starlight accidentally splashing water over herself, washing off her own equal mark to reveal her real, unremoved mark.\n\nWhen Starlight releases the five friends and Party Favor the next day, Fluttershy splashes water on Starlight to reveal her real mark to the villagers. Starlight confesses that she removed the ponies' marks with her own magic, and that the Staff of Sameness is worthless. The villagers revolt and reclaim their original cutie marks from the vault, while Starlight flees into the mountains with the six friends' marks. With the six hindered by their equalized abilities, Double Diamond, Party Favor, Sugar Belle, and Night Glider pursue Starlight and are able to recover the six marks using their own unique abilities. Starlight vanishes into the mountain caves while the villagers thank the six friends for helping them regain their individuality. The six later sense the map calling them through their cutie marks, determining that they have completed their work to bring friendship to the village.\n\n==Production and promotion==\nAn animatic for this episode was first shown at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] on July 25, 2014, and was later released as part of the \"2014 San Diego Comic-Con ''My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic'' Panel\" bonus feature on the ''Season Four Disc 4'' DVD.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Magic/dp/B00NALHJN2/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&qid=1409864095&sr=8-15&keywords=My+Little+Pony+Season+4 | title=My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic: Season Four | publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | date=2014-09-04 | accessdate=2014-09-04}}</ref>\n\nSome scenes from this episode were teased in Rainbow Dash's and Rarity's season 5 recap videos.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yESDQWm8M7o|title=My Little Pony Season 5 Teaser (Spring 2015) - Rainbow Dash Recap|work=YouTube|date=2014-12-15|accessdate=2014-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdqBVrW11m0|title=My Little Pony Season 5 Teaser (Spring 2015) - Rarity Recap|work=YouTube|date=2014-12-22|accessdate=2014-12-22}}</ref> On March 14, 2015, Discovery Family's \"Pony Day\" was announced; it included a six back-to-back season 4 episode marathon leading up to the two-part season five premiere, followed by the premiere of the 1986 film ''[[My Little Pony: The Movie (1986 film)|My Little Pony: The Movie]]''.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yABdnL9d8RE|title=My Little Pony - Pony Day Promo|work=YouTube|date=2015-03-14|accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref> Under the approval of Discovery Family and Hasbro, BABSCon showed the entire two-part season five premiere commercial-free on the same day as it premiered on the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast of the United States]] on April 4, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equestriadaily.com/2015/03/discovery-family-and-hasbro-approve.html|title=Discovery Family and Hasbro Approve Commercial Free Season Five Premiere At BABSCon!|author=Sethisto|work=Equestria Daily|date=2015-03-16|accessdate=2015-03-16}}</ref>\n\nThe map was designed by Rebecca Dart.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=TheBiggestJim|number=584371235628388352|title=[Designer for the Cutie Map confirmation]|author=Jim Miller|date=2015-04-04|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref> Directors Jayson Thiessen and Jim Miller along with art director Rebecca Dart and prop designer Charmaine Verhagen came up with the design for the Staff of Sameness;<ref>{{cite tweet|user=TheBiggestJim|number=584411917873209344|title=[Designers for the Staff of Sameness confirmation]|author=Jim Miller|date=2015-04-04|accessdate=2015-04-04}}</ref> Miller denied that it was inspired by the Spear of Longinus from the anime ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=TheBiggestJim|number=584413683125739520|title=@FJRA_Frist @goldenrusset @R_Dart @charmainevee No.|author=Jim Miller|date=2015-04-04|accessdate=2015-04-04}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\nBoth parts of \"The Cutie Map\" aired back-to-back on Discovery Family as an hour long event on April 4, 2015.
