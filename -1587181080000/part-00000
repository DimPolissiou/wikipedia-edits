His debut single, it was released as the lead single from his debut studio album, ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' (1979), on 21 August 1979. It reached the top of the charts in several countries, and today is considered a [[New wave music|new wave]] staple. \n\nThe song was the first release credited solely to Gary Numan after he dropped the band name [[Tubeway Army]], under which name he had released four singles and two [[Gramophone record|LPs]], including the number one UK hit \"[[Are 'Friends' Electric?]]\", and its parent album, ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]''. Musically, the new song was somewhat lighter and more pop-oriented than its predecessors, Numan later conceding that he had chart success in mind: \"This was the first time I had written a song with the intention of 'maybe it could be a hit single'; I was writing this before 'Are \"Friends\" Electric?' happened.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author= Stephen Webbon & Gary Numan |title= Complete Gary Numan UK Discography |journal= [[Record Collector]] |issue=76 |date=December 1985|page= 15}}</ref> He has since described \"Cars\" as \"a pretty average song\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/new-music/theartsdesk-qa-musician-gary-numan|title=Q&A: Musician Gary Numan|last=Green|first=Thomas H|date=19 May 2012|website=[[The Arts Desk]]|access-date=12 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK charts, it reached number 1 in 1979, and in 1980 hit number 1 in Canada two weeks running on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' national singles chart<ref name=\"CAN\">{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0189a&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 33, No. 13, June 21, 1980 |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate= 23 July 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131012174145/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0189a&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archivedate= 12 October 2013 |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 33, No. 14, June 28, 1980 |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0194a&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |accessdate= 23 July 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131012180545/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0194a&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archivedate= 12 October 2013 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> (29 weeks in the top 100). It was his only single to chart there. It rose to number 9 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Though Numan had a string of hits in the UK, \"Cars\" was his only song in the US Hot 100. It debuted on the American Top 40 on 29 March 1980 and spent a total of 17 weeks in the AT40, peaking at #9.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Cars\" is based on two musical sections: a [[Song structure (popular music)#Verse|verse]]/instrumental break and a [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. The recording features a conventional rock [[rhythm section]] of bass guitar and drums, although the rest of the instruments used are [[analog synthesizer|analogue synthesiser]]s, principally the [[Minimoog]] (augmenting the song's recognisable bass [[riff]]) and the [[Polymoog]] keyboard, providing austere synthetic string lines over the bass riff. The bridge section also includes a [[tambourine]] part. Numan's vocal part is sung in an almost expressionless, synthesized style. There is no [[refrain|\"chorus\"]] as such. The song becomes instrumental from the 1:30 point until its conclusion.\n\nAccording to Numan, the song's lyrics were inspired by an incident of [[Road rage (phenomenon)|road rage]]:\n\n{{Cquote|I was in traffic in London once and had a problem with some people in front. They tried to beat me up and get me out of the car. I locked the doors and eventually drove up on the pavement and got away from them. It's kind of to do with that. It explains how you can feel safe inside a car in the modern world... When you're in it, your whole mentality is different... It's like your own little personal empire with four wheels on it.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kaos2000.net/interviews/garynuman/ |title= Gary Numan \u2013 Numan Drives Music More Than Cars |author= Philip Anderson |work= KAOS2000\u2122 |publisher= KAOS2000.net |year= 2001 |accessdate= 23 July 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181101172726/http://www.kaos2000.net/interviews/garynuman/ |archive-date= 1 November 2018 |url-status= dead }}</ref>}}\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video featured Numan's then-current backing band, including [[Billy Currie]] from the band [[Ultravox]], though he had not actually played on the recording of \"Cars\". It is perhaps notable that the video for \"Cars\" depicts no images of actual cars. At 2:43 in the video, five Gary Numans appear to be \"driving\" (in a standing position, holding an imaginary [[steering wheel]]) along a [[Polymoog]] keyboard.\n\n==Release==\nThe original UK single was released in August 1979, backed with a non-album instrumental track called \"Asylum\". The US [[B-side]] was \"[[Metal (Gary Numan song)|Metal]]\", from ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' album. The track has been a UK Top 20 hit for Numan in 3 successive decades: on its original release in 1979 (making number 1); in 1987 as the '[[Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom#1983 to 2001|E Reg Model]]' remix (making number 16); and again in 1996 following its use in an advertisement for [[Carling]] Premier beer (number 17). Numan has regularly performed the song on stage since its original release and it appears on all but one of his official live albums to date.\n\n==Track listing==\n# \"Cars\" (Numan) \u2013 3:44\n# \"Asylum\" (Numan) \u2013 2:30\n\n===US Version===\n# \"Cars\" \u2013 3:57\n# \"Metal\" (Numan) \u2013 3:31\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[Gary Numan]] \u2014 vocals, production, keyboards ([[Minimoog]], [[Polymoog]]), synthetic percussion\n* [[Paul Gardiner]] \u2014 bass guitar\n* [[Chris Payne (musician)|Chris Payne]] \u2014 keyboards (Minimoog, Polymoog)\n* Cedric Sharpley \u2014 drums, [[tambourine]]\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly singles charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1979\u201380)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report|KMR]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&id=21533&pages= |title=Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 CHART POSITIONS PRE 1989 |work=ARIA |publisher=Australian-charts.com |accessdate=23 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020025459/http://australian-charts.com/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&id=21533&pages= |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n|Belgium ([[VRT Top 30]] Flanders)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://top30-2.radio2.be/#/song-info/3031 |title= Cars \u2013 GARY NUMAN |work= VRT |publisher= Top30-2.radio2.be |language= Dutch |accessdate= 26 July 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120409063716/http://top30-2.radio2.be/#/song-info/3031 |archivedate= 9 April 2012 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n|-\n|Canada ([[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'' 100 Singles]])<ref name=\"CAN\"/>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|45|artist=Gary Numan|song=Cars|songid=14841|accessdate=13 February 2019}}\n|-\n|Ireland ([[Irish Recorded Music Association|IRMA]])<ref name=\"IRL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement |title=The Irish Charts \u2013 All there is to know |publisher=[[Irish Recorded Music Association|IRMA]] |accessdate=23 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602061251/http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement |archivedate=2 June 2009 |df=dmy }} Two last results when searching \"Cars\"</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n{{singlechart|New Zealand|18|artist=Gary Numan|song=Cars|accessdate=23 July 2013}}\n|-\n|UK ([[Official Charts Company]])<ref name=\"UK\">{{cite web |url= http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/gary%20numan/ |title= Gary Numan |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |accessdate= 23 June 2013}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref name=\"awards\">{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-pleasure-principle-mw0000599295/awards |title= The Pleasure Principle awards at Allmusic |work= [[AllMusic]] |publisher= [[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate= 23 June 2013}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]]<ref name=\"awards\"/>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|56\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1987)<sup>1</sup>\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|Ireland ([[Irish Recorded Music Association|IRMA]])<ref name=\"IRL\"/>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|23\n|-\n|UK ([[Official Charts Company]])<ref name=\"UK\"/>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1993)<sup>2</sup>\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|UK ([[Official Charts Company]])<ref name=\"UK\"/>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1996)<sup>2</sup>\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|UK ([[Official Charts Company]])<ref name=\"UK\"/>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|}\n\n*<sup>1</sup>Cars (E Reg Model) / Are 'Friends' Electric ?

The song was only included as a [[bonus track]] on the limited edition digipak re-release of ''Obsolete'' and would be instrumental in breaking Fear Factory into the mainstream. In their rendition, Gary Numan performs a duet with [[frontman]] [[Burton C. Bell]].\n\n===Background and recording===\nAccording to Bell, around 1996, the band started performing \"Cars\" as an [[Encore (concert)|encore]] at European concerts. Word spread that Fear Factory was performing the song and as a result Gary Numan's manager contacted them. Upon request, Numan's management flew him out to the [[Vancouver]] studio for a three-day span to record vocals on \"Cars.\" The band also asked Numan to record a [[spoken word]] piece for the introduction of ''Obsolete''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/metal/267/fear.factory.interview.htm |title= Fear Factory (2) |author= David Lee |work= Tinpan.fortunecity.com |publisher= Fortune City |archivedate= 13 March 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120313235922/http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/metal/267/fear.factory.interview.htm |year= 2000 |accessdate= 12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nNuman had a long-standing dislike for being associated with what he perceived as dated music, and this initially made him apprehensive of working with Fear Factory until realizing \"there was a chance that it could introduce me to a new generation of people who didn't know my history. And that can be useful, because my music's got a lot heavier and darker anyway.\" The result would be satisfactory for both parties, and Numan praised the band as \"brilliant, really easy to work with. They didn't have a bad word to say about anyone.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.chaoscontrol.com/gary-numan/ |title= Gary Numan |author= Bob Gourley |work= Chaos Control Digizine |publisher= Chaoscontrol.com |year= 2000 |accessdate= 23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe uncharacteristically bouncy and bright rendition somewhat contrasts with Fear Factory's reputation for intense, grinding metal, while the heavy use of synthesizer and other electronic elements corresponds with the band's industrial style. Drummer Raymond Herrera described the cover as \"basically like a blueprint of a futuristic car.\" He added that, while other songs were considered, the band chose \"Cars\" because all the band members knew and appreciated it and because the keyboards suited Fear Factory's sound. Herrera later noted that the group initially wanted to record U2's \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\" but chose \"Cars\" because they were fortunate enough to have Numan participate. Fear Factory would later cover a different [[U2]] song, \"[[I Will Follow]],\" in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=5038 |title=Deb Rao's Exclusive Interview With Fear Factory Drummer Raymond Herrera |author=Debby Rao |work=Boston Contributor |publisher=Knac.com |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=23 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523095131/http://knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=5038 |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Reception===\n\"Cars\" played a significant part in ''Obsolete''{{'}}s status as Fear Factory's highest-selling album.

SF Bay Area band Lifeunderwater covered the song on guitars during their live performances in the late 1980s. \"Cars\" was [[Cover version|covered]] by the [[Judybats]] on the 1991 single \"Daylight\" and by [[Shampoo (band)|Shampoo]] on the \"Girl Power\" single in 1995. [[Dave Clarke (musician)|Dave Clarke]] performed the song on the ''Random'' tribute album in 1997. [[Nine Inch Nails]] performed \"Cars\" several times during their [[Wave Goodbye Tour]] in 2009, featuring Numan on vocals.\n\nOn December 21, 1999, during a performance of \"[[Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!]]\" on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', the group [[Luscious Jackson]] segued into a variation on \"Cars\" entitled \"Sleds\", using the same music but changing the lyrics to describe winter activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iERPQIPhWmw |title=\"Let It Snow\" performed by Luscious Jackson |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=1999-07-19 |accessdate=2016-10-14}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"New Car\" by [[Cledus T.

The song was remixed with \"[[Technologic]]\" by [[Daft Punk]] and with \"Here Comes My DJ\" by [[Grandmaster Flash]] which is featured as a playable track in ''[[DJ Hero]]''.

A version known as \"Cars (MPH Mix)\" appeared on ''[[NASCAR: Crank It Up]]'' in 2002. From late 1999 to early 2000, the Fear Factory version was used in a commercial for \"Blue\" by credit card company [[American Express]].\n\nThe song appears in the 2002 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'' on the fictional in-game radio station \"Wave 103\".\n\nThe track was included on ''[[The Best of Fear Factory]]'' in 2006. \"Cars (Numanoid Mix),\" a version containing only Numan's vocals, appeared on the ''[[Hatefiles]]'' rarities compilation in April 2003.

His debut single, it was released as the lead single from his debut studio album, ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' (1979), on 21 August 1979. It reached the top of the charts in several countries, and today is considered a [[New wave music|new wave]] staple. \n\nThe song was the first release credited solely to Gary Numan after he dropped the band name [[Tubeway Army]], under which name he had released four singles and two [[Gramophone record|LPs]], including the number one UK hit \"[[Are 'Friends' Electric?]]\", and its parent album, ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]''. Musically, the new song was somewhat lighter and more pop-oriented than its predecessors, Numan later conceding that he had chart success in mind: \"This was the first time I had written a song with the intention of 'maybe it could be a hit single'; I was writing this before 'Are \"Friends\" Electric?' happened.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author= Stephen Webbon & Gary Numan |title= Complete Gary Numan UK Discography |journal= [[Record Collector]] |issue=76 |date=December 1985|page= 15}}</ref> He has since described \"Cars\" as \"a pretty average song\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/new-music/theartsdesk-qa-musician-gary-numan|title=Q&A: Musician Gary Numan|last=Green|first=Thomas H|date=19 May 2012|website=[[The Arts Desk]]|access-date=12 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK charts, it reached number 1 in 1979, and in 1980 hit number 1 in Canada two weeks running on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' national singles chart<ref name=\"CAN\">{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0189a&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 33, No. 13, June 21, 1980 |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate= 23 July 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131012174145/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0189a&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archivedate= 12 October 2013 |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 33, No. 14, June 28, 1980 |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0194a&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |accessdate= 23 July 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131012180545/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0194a&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archivedate= 12 October 2013 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> (29 weeks in the top 100). It was his only single to chart there. It rose to number 9 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Though Numan had a string of hits in the UK, \"Cars\" was his only song in the US Hot 100. It debuted on the American Top 40 on 29 March 1980 and spent a total of 17 weeks in the AT40, peaking at #9.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Cars\" is based on two musical sections: a [[Song structure (popular music)#Verse|verse]]/instrumental break and a [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. The recording features a conventional rock [[rhythm section]] of bass guitar and drums, although the rest of the instruments used are [[analog synthesizer|analogue synthesiser]]s, principally the [[Minimoog]] (augmenting the song's recognisable bass [[riff]]) and the [[Polymoog]] keyboard, providing austere synthetic string lines over the bass riff. The bridge section also includes a [[tambourine]] part. Numan's vocal part is sung in an almost expressionless, synthesized style. There is no [[refrain|\"chorus\"]] as such. The song becomes instrumental from the 1:30 point until its conclusion.\n\nAccording to Numan, the song's lyrics were inspired by an incident of [[Road rage (phenomenon)|road rage]]:\n\n{{Cquote|I was in traffic in London once and had a problem with some people in front. They tried to beat me up and get me out of the car. I locked the doors and eventually drove up on the pavement and got away from them. It's kind of to do with that. It explains how you can feel safe inside a car in the modern world... When you're in it, your whole mentality is different... It's like your own little personal empire with four wheels on it.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kaos2000.net/interviews/garynuman/ |title= Gary Numan \u2013 Numan Drives Music More Than Cars |author= Philip Anderson |work= KAOS2000\u2122 |publisher= KAOS2000.net |year= 2001 |accessdate= 23 July 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181101172726/http://www.kaos2000.net/interviews/garynuman/ |archive-date= 1 November 2018 |url-status= dead }}</ref>}}\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video featured Numan's then-current backing band, including [[Billy Currie]] from the band [[Ultravox]], though he had not actually played on the recording of \"Cars\". It is perhaps notable that the video for \"Cars\" depicts no images of actual cars. At 2:43 in the video, five Gary Numans appear to be \"driving\" (in a standing position, holding an imaginary [[steering wheel]]) along a [[Polymoog]] keyboard.\n\n==Release==\nThe original UK single was released in August 1979, backed with a non-album instrumental track called \"Asylum\". The US [[B-side]] was \"[[Metal (Gary Numan song)|Metal]]\", from ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' album. The track has been a UK Top 20 hit for Numan in 3 successive decades: on its original release in 1979 (making number 1); in 1987 as the '[[Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom#1983 to 2001|E Reg Model]]' remix (making number 16); and again in 1996 following its use in an advertisement for [[Carling]] Premier beer (number 17).

The song was only included as a [[bonus track]] on the limited edition digipak re-release of ''Obsolete'' and would be instrumental in breaking Fear Factory into the mainstream. In their rendition, Gary Numan performs a duet with [[frontman]] [[Burton C. Bell]].\n\n===Background and recording===\nAccording to Bell, around 1996, the band started performing \"Cars\" as an [[Encore (concert)|encore]] at European concerts. Word spread that Fear Factory was performing the song and as a result Gary Numan's manager contacted them. Upon request, Numan's management flew him out to the [[Vancouver]] studio for a three-day span to record vocals on \"Cars.\" The band also asked Numan to record a [[spoken word]] piece for the introduction of ''Obsolete''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/metal/267/fear.factory.interview.htm |title= Fear Factory (2) |author= David Lee |work= Tinpan.fortunecity.com |publisher= Fortune City |archivedate= 13 March 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120313235922/http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/metal/267/fear.factory.interview.htm |year= 2000 |accessdate= 12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nNuman had a long-standing dislike for being associated with what he perceived as dated music, and this initially made him apprehensive of working with Fear Factory until realizing \"there was a chance that it could introduce me to a new generation of people who didn't know my history. And that can be useful, because my music's got a lot heavier and darker anyway.\" The result would be satisfactory for both parties, and Numan praised the band as \"brilliant, really easy to work with. They didn't have a bad word to say about anyone.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.chaoscontrol.com/gary-numan/ |title= Gary Numan |author= Bob Gourley |work= Chaos Control Digizine |publisher= Chaoscontrol.com |year= 2000 |accessdate= 23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe uncharacteristically bouncy and bright rendition somewhat contrasts with Fear Factory's reputation for intense, grinding metal, while the heavy use of synthesizer and other electronic elements corresponds with the band's industrial style. Drummer Raymond Herrera described the cover as \"basically like a blueprint of a futuristic car.\" He added that, while other songs were considered, the band chose \"Cars\" because all the band members knew and appreciated it and because the keyboards suited Fear Factory's sound.

With more than 5,000 sites, including 600 [[cliff dwelling]]s,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mesa Verde National Park {{!}} Mesa Verde Country Colorado |url=https://www.mesaverdecountry.com/see-do/archaeology/mesa-verde-national-park/ |website=mesaverdecountry.com |publisher=Mesa Verde Country Visitor Information Bureau |accessdate=20 November 2018}}</ref> it is the largest archaeological preserve in the United States.<ref name=aramark>{{cite web |title=Mesa Verde National Park {{!}} World Heritage Site {{!}} Discover a place that time has forgotten |url=https://www.visitmesaverde.com/media/666446/mesa-verde-brochure.pdf |website=visitmesaverde.com |publisher=Aramark |accessdate=15 December 2019}}</ref> Mesa Verde (Spanish for \"green table\") is best known for structures such as [[Cliff Palace]], thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America.\n\nStarting {{circa|7500}} BC Mesa Verde was seasonally inhabited by a group of nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]] known as the Foothills Mountain Complex. The variety of projectile points found in the region indicates they were influenced by surrounding areas, including the [[Great Basin]], the [[San Juan Basin]], and the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. Later, [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic]] people established semi-permanent rock shelters in and around the [[mesa]]. By 1000 BC, the [[Basketmaker culture]] emerged from the local Archaic population, and by 750 AD the Ancestral Puebloans had developed from the Basketmaker culture.\n\nThe Mesa Verdeans survived using a combination of hunting, gathering, and subsistence farming of crops such as corn, beans, and squash. They built the mesa's first [[pueblo]]s sometime after 650, and by the end of the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico, including [[Chama River (Rio Grande)|Rio Chama]], [[Pajarito Plateau]], and Santa Fe.\n\n==Inhabitants==\n\n===Paleo-Indians===\n[[File:Glyptodon old drawing.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A painting of two people hunting a large animal|Paleo-Indians hunting a [[Glyptodontidae|glyptodont]], by [[Heinrich Harder]] {{circa|1920}}]]\nThe first occupants of the [[Mesa Verde region]], which spans from southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico, were nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]] who arrived in the area {{circa|9500}} BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Charles|2006|pp=9\u201310}}: Paleo-Indians; {{harvnb|Lekson|2015|p=105}}: southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico.</ref> They followed herds of big game and camped near rivers and streams, many of which dried up as the glaciers that once covered parts of the [[San Juan Mountains]] receded. The earliest Paleo-Indians were the [[Clovis culture]] and [[Folsom tradition]], defined largely by how they fashioned [[projectile point]]s. Although they left evidence of their presence throughout the region, there is little indication that they lived in central Mesa Verde during this time.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAfter 9600 BC, the area's environment grew warmer and drier, a change that brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers {{circa|7500 BC}}, though it is unclear whether they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the [[Spear-thrower|atlatl]] during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance at a time when most of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.{{sfn|Charles|2006|p=10}}\n\n===Archaic===\n[[File:Barrier Canyon style, Sego Canyon.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of some Archaic pictographs|Archaic [[Pictogram|pictographs]], {{circa|2500}} BC, Sego Canyon, Utah]]\n6000 BC marks the beginning of the [[Archaic period in North America]]. Archaeologists differ as to the origin of the Mesa Verde Archaic population; some believe they developed exclusively from local Paleo-Indians, called the Foothills Mountain Complex, but others suggest that the variety of projectile points found in Mesa Verde indicates influence from surrounding areas, including the [[Great Basin]], the [[San Juan Basin]], and the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. The Archaic people probably developed locally, but were also influenced by contact, trade, and intermarriage with immigrants from these outlying areas.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe early Archaic people living near Mesa Verde utilized the atlatl and harvested a wider variety of plants and animals than the Paleo-Indians had while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. They inhabited the outlying areas of the Mesa Verde region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rock shelters and [[rock art]], and left evidence of animal processing and [[chert]] [[knapping]]. Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa Verde, whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled with spring rains, provided relatively plentiful amounts of water.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nBy the late Archaic, more people were living in semi-permanent rock shelters that preserved perishable goods such as baskets, sandals, and mats. They started to make a variety of twig figurines that usually resembled sheep or deer. The late Archaic is marked by increased trade in exotic materials such as [[obsidian]] and [[turquoise]]. Marine shells and [[abalone]] from the Pacific coast made their way to Mesa Verde from Arizona, and the Archaic people worked them into necklaces and pendants. Rock art flourished, and people lived in rudimentary houses made of mud and wood. Their early attempts at plant domestication eventually developed into the sustained agriculture that marked the end of the Archaic period, {{circa|1000}}.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=11\u201312}}\n\n===Basketmaker culture===\n[[File:Zion National Park Basketmaker II basket specifimen from AD 1 to 700.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A color picture of a woven basket|Basketmaker II basket, {{circa|1 to 500}}]]\nWith the introduction of corn to the Mesa Verde region {{circa|1000}} BC and the trend away from nomadism toward permanent [[pit-house|pithouse]] settlements, the Archaic Mesa Verdeans transitioned into what archaeologists call the [[Basketmaker culture]]. [[Late Basketmaker II Era|Basketmaker II]] people are characterized by their combination of foraging and farming skills, use of the [[Spear-thrower|atlatl]], and creation of finely woven baskets in the absence of earthen pottery. By 300, corn had become the preeminent staple of the Basketmaker II people's diet, which relied less and less on wild food sources and more on domesticated crops.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=12\u201313}}{{efn|Corn was introduced to the Great Sage Plain, the regions north and west of Mesa Verde, from Mexico.{{sfn|Naranjo|2006|p=54}}}}\n\nIn addition to the fine basketry for which they were named, Basketmaker II people fashioned a variety of household items from plant and animal materials, including sandals, robes, pouches, mats, and blankets. They also made clay pipes and gaming pieces. Basketmaker men were relatively short and muscular, averaging less than {{convert|5.5|feet}} tall. Their skeletal remains reveal signs of hard labor and extensive travel, including degenerative joint disease, healed fractures, and moderate anemia associated with iron deficiency. They buried their dead near or amongst their settlements, and often included luxury items as gifts, which might indicate differences in relative social status. Basketmaker II people are also known for their distinctive rock art, which can be found throughout Mesa Verde. They depicted animals and people, in both abstract and realistic forms, in single works and more elaborate panels. A common subject was the hunchbacked flute player that the [[Hopi]] call [[Kokopelli]].{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=14\u201315}}\n[[File:Basket of Basketmaker Pueblo people.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A color picture of a weaved basket|Basketmaker III basket, {{circa|450 to 750}}]]\nBy 500 AD, atlatls were being supplanted by the bow and arrow and baskets by pottery, marking the end of the Basketmaker II Era and the beginning of the [[Basketmaker III Era]].<ref>{{harvnb|Charles|2006|pp=14\u201315}}: end of Basketmaker II; {{harvnb|Wilshusen|2006|p=19}} beginning of Basketmaker III.</ref> Ceramic vessels were a major improvement over [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]-lined baskets, gourds, and animal hide containers, which had been the primary water storage containers in the region. Pottery also protected seeds against mold, insects, and rodents. By 600, Mesa Verdeans were using clay pots to cook soups and stews.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=102}} Year-round settlements first appear around this time. The population of the San Juan Basin increased markedly after 575, when there were very few Basketmaker III sites in Mesa Verde; by the early 7th century, there were many such sites in the mesa. For the next 150 years, villages typically consisted of small groups of one to three residences. The population of Mesa Verde {{circa|675}} was approximately 1,000 to 1,500 people.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBeans and new varieties of corn were introduced to the region {{circa|700}}.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|p=383}} By 775, some settlements had grown to accommodate more than one hundred people; the construction of large, above-ground storage buildings began around this time. Basketmakers endeavored to store enough food for their family for one year, but also retained residential mobility so they could quickly relocate their dwellings in the event of resource depletion or consistently inadequate crop yields.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=19\u201321}} By the end of the 8th century, the smaller hamlets, which were typically occupied for ten to forty years, had been supplanted by larger ones that saw continuous occupation for as many as two generations.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=383\u201385}} Basketmaker III people established a tradition of holding large ceremonial gatherings near community pit structures.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Ancestral Puebloans===\n{{main|Ancestral Puebloans}}\n\n====Pueblo I: 750 to 900====\n{{main|Pueblo I Period}}\n{{Multiple image| align = left| direction = vertical| width = 250| header = |image1= Ancestral Puebloan sites.png|alt1=A color map of the Four Corners area of the United States showing major Ancestral Puebloan settlements|caption1=Major Ancestral Puebloan settlements in the San Juan Basin|image2=Pueblo I protokiva at Mesa Verde by RO.JPG|alt2=A color picture of a square subterranean domicile|caption2=Pueblo I protokiva on Chapin Mesa, Mesa Verde National Park}}\n750 marks the end of the Basketmaker III Era and the beginning of the Pueblo I period. The transition is characterized by major changes in the design and construction of buildings and the organization of household activities. Pueblo I people doubled their capacity for food storage from one year to two and built interconnected, year-round residences called [[pueblo]]s. Many household activities that had previously been reserved for subterranean pithouses were moved to these above-ground dwellings. This altered the function of pithouses from all-purpose spaces to ones used primarily for community ceremonies, although they continued to house large extended families, particularly during winter months.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=23\u201324}} During the late 8th century, Mesa Verdeans began building square pit structures that archaeologists call proto[[kiva]]s. They were typically {{convert|3 or 4|feet}} deep and {{convert|12 to 20|feet}} wide.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nThe first pueblos appeared at Mesa Verde sometime after 650; by 850 more than half of Mesa Verdeans lived in them. As local populations grew, Puebloans found it difficult to survive on hunting, foraging, and gardening, which made them increasingly reliant on domesticated corn. This shift from semi-nomadism to a \"sedentary and communal way of life changed ancestral Pueblo society forever\".{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|p=19}} Within a generation the average number of households in these settlements grew from one to three to fifteen to twenty, with average populations of two hundred people. Population density increased dramatically, with as many as a dozen families occupying roughly the same space that had formerly housed two. This brought increased security against raids and encouraged greater cooperation amongst residents. It also facilitated trade and intermarriage between clans, and by the late 8th century, as Mesa Verde's population was being augmented by settlers from the south, four distinct cultural groups occupied the same villages.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=19, 24\u201325}}\n\nLarge Pueblo I settlements laid claim to the resources found within {{convert|15 to 30|mi2}}. They were typically organized in groups of at least three and spaced about {{convert|1|mile}} apart. By 860, there were approximately 8,000 people living in Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|p=26}} Within the plazas of larger villages, the Pueblo I people dug massive pit structures of {{convert|800|ft2}} that became central gathering places. These structures represent early architectural expressions of what would eventually develop into the [[Pueblo II Era]] [[Great house (pueblo)|great houses]] of [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]]. Despite robust growth during the early and mid-9th century, unpredictable rainfall and periodic drought led to a dramatic reversal of settlement trends in the area. Many late Pueblo I villages were abandoned after less than forty years of occupation, and by 880 Mesa Verde's population was in steady decline.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=26\u201327}} The beginning of the 10th century saw widespread depopulation of the region, as people emigrated south of the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]] to Chaco Canyon in search of reliable rains for farming.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}} As Mesa Verdeans migrated south, to where many of their ancestors had emigrated two hundred years before, the influence of Chaco Canyon grew, and by 950 Chaco had supplanted Mesa Verde as the region's cultural center.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=26\u201327}}\n\n====Pueblo II: 900 to 1150====\n{{main|Pueblo II Period}}\n[[File:Square Tower House by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone ruin under an alcove|Square Tower House]]\nThe Pueblo II Period is marked by the growth and outreach of communities centered around the great houses of Chaco Canyon. Despite their participation in the vast Chacoan system, Mesa Verdeans retained a distinct cultural identity while melding regional innovation with ancient tradition, inspiring further architectural advancements; the 9th century Mesa Verdean pueblos influenced two hundred years of Chacoan great house construction.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}} Droughts during the late 9th century rendered Mesa Verdean dry land farming unreliable, which led to their growing crops only near drainages for the next 150 years. Crop yields returned to healthy levels by the early 11th century.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=3\u20134}} By 1050 the population of the area began to rebound; as agricultural prosperity increased, people immigrated to Mesa Verde from the south. {{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}}\n\nMesa Verdean farmers increasingly relied on masonry reservoirs during the Pueblo II Era. During the 11th century, they built [[check dam]]s and terraces near drainages and slopes in an effort to conserve soil and runoff. These fields offset the danger of crop failures in the larger dry land fields.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=34}} By the mid-10th and early 11th centuries, protokivas had evolved into smaller circular structures called kivas, which were usually {{convert|12 to 15|feet}} across. These Mesa Verde-style kivas included a feature from earlier times called a [[sipapu]], which is a hole dug in the north of the chamber and symbolizes the Ancestral Puebloan's place of emergence from the underworld.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=30\u201331}} At this time, Mesa Verdeans began to move away from the post and mud [[jacal]]-style buildings that marked the Pueblo I Period toward masonry construction, which had been utilized in the region as early as 700, but was not widespread until the 11th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nThe expansion of Chacoan influence in the Mesa Verde area left its most visible mark in the form of Chaco-style masonry great houses that became the focal point of many Mesa Verdean villages after 1075.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}} Far View House, the largest of these, is considered a classic Chaco \"outlier,\" on which construction likely began between 1075 and 1125, although some archaeologists argue that it was begun as early as 1020.<ref name=ChacoMeridian>Lekson, Stephen.

As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=385\u201386, 398\u201399}}\n\nThe Chacoan system brought large quantities of imported goods to Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, including pottery, shells, and turquoise, but by the late 12th century, as the system collapsed, the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined, and Mesa Verde became isolated from the surrounding region.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=36}} For approximately six hundred years, most Mesa Verdean farmers had lived in small, mesa-top homesteads of one or two families. They were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water. This practice continued into the mid- to late 12th century, but by the start of the 13th century they began living in canyon locations that were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nMesa Verdean villages thrived during the mid-Pueblo III Era, when architects constructed massive, multi-story buildings, and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs. Structures built during this period have been described as \"among the world's greatest archaeological treasures\".{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=39}} Pueblo III masonry buildings were typically occupied for approximately fifty years, more than double the usable lifespan of the Pueblo II jacal structures. Others were continuously inhabited for two hundred years or more. Architectural innovations such as towers and multi-walled structures also appear during the Pueblo III Era. Mesa Verde's population remained fairly stable during the 12th century drought.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=42\u201344}} At the start of the 13th century, approximately 22,000 people lived there.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|p=385}} The area saw moderate population increases during the following decades, and dramatic ones from 1225 to 1260.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Most of the people in the region lived in the plains west of the mesa at locations such as [[Yellow Jacket Pueblo]], near Cortez, Colorado.{{sfn|Lekson|2015|p=105}} Others colonized canyon rims and slopes in multi-family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled.{{sfn|Kantner|2004|pp=161\u201366}} By 1260, the majority of Mesa Verdeans lived in large pueblos that housed several families and more than one hundred people.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nThe 13th century saw 69 years of below average rainfall in the Mesa Verde region, and after 1270 the area suffered from especially cold temperatures. [[Dendrochronology]] indicates that the last tree felled for construction on the mesa was cut in 1281.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=40, 46}} There was a major decline in [[ceramic]] imports to the region during this time, but local production remained steady.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=218}} Despite challenging conditions, the Puebloans continued to farm the area until a severely dry period from 1276 to 1299 ended seven hundred years of continuous human occupation at Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=3\u20134}} Archaeologists refer to this period as the \"Great Drought\".{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=140}} The last inhabitants of the mesa left the area {{circa|1285}}.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=46}}\n\n====Warfare====\n[[File:Oak Tree House by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone cliff dwelling|Oak Tree House]]\nDuring the Pueblo III period (1150 to 1300), Mesa Verdeans built numerous stone masonry towers that likely served as defensive structures. They often incorporated hidden tunnels connecting the towers to associated kivas.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=128}} Warfare was conducted using the same tools the Mesa Verdeans used for hunting game, including bows and arrows, stone axes, and wooden clubs and spears. They also crafted hide and basket shields that were used only during battles.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=131}} Periodic warfare occurred on the mesa throughout the 13th century.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Civic leaders in the region likely attained power and prestige by distributing food during times of drought. This system probably broke down during the \"Great Drought\", leading to intense warfare between competing clans.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|pp=140\u201341}} Increasing economic and social uncertainty during the century's final decades led to widespread conflict. Evidence of partly burned villages and post-mortem trauma have been uncovered, and the residents of one village appear to have been the victims of a site-wide massacre.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=386, 398}}\n\nEvidence of violence and [[cannibalism]] has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=37}}{{efn|The earliest known evidence for large-scale violence in the region was uncovered in southeastern Utah. Future Mesa Verde rediscoverer, [[Richard Wetherill]], then leading the [[Hyde Exploring Expedition]], located the site, now called \"Cave 7\", in which the bodies of nearly 100 men, women, and children were found. They date to the late Basketmaker II period (200 BC to 500 AD). Evidence of defensive structures, such as palisades and stockades, dating to the 7th and 11th centuries have been uncovered near ancient Mesa Verdean farmsteads.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=127}}}} While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Evidence of the attacks was discovered by members of the [[Crow Canyon Archaeological Center]] during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to {{circa|1280}}, and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=127}} Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were [[Scalping|scalped]], dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|pp=132\u201333}} The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=134}}\n\n====Migration====\nThe Mesa Verde region saw unusually cold and dry conditions during the beginning of the 13th century. This might have driven emigration to Mesa Verde from less hospitable locations. The added population stressed the mesa's environment, further straining an agricultural society that was suffering from drought.{{sfn|Kohler|2006|p=73}} The region's bimodal precipitation pattern, which brought rainfall during spring and summer and snowfall during autumn and winter, began to fail post-1250.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=140}} After 1260, there was a rapid depopulation of Mesa Verde, as \"tens of thousands of people\" emigrated or died from starvation.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Many smaller communities in the Four Corners region were also abandoned during this period.{{sfn|Casey|1993|p=220}}{{sfn|Watson|1961|p=156}} The Ancestral Puebloans had a long history of migration in the face of environmental instability, but the depopulation of Mesa Verde at the end of the 13th century was different in that the region was almost completely emptied, and no descendants returned to build permanent settlements.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=45}} While drought, resource depletion, and overpopulation all contributed to instability during the last two centuries of Ancestral Puebloan occupation, their overdependence on maize crops is considered the \"fatal flaw\" of their subsistence strategy.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=135}}{{efn|When the Spanish first settled in the area in 1598, they proposed that the Utes and Navajo had driven the Ancestral Puebloans away from Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=141}} In 1891, Gustaf Nordenski\u00f6ld proposed that the Mesa Verdeans had been driven away from the area by hostile intruders. In the early 20th century, Jesse Walter Fewkes theorized that climate change had adversely affected water supplies in the region, which led to widespread crop failure and the rapid depopulation of the area. The last two theories remain at the foreground of the archaeological investigation of Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=139}}}}\n\nThe vacating Mesa Verdeans left almost no direct evidence of their migration, but they left behind household goods, including cooking utensils, tools, and clothing, which gave archaeologists the impression that the emigration was haphazard or hurried. An estimated 20,000 people lived in the region during the 13th century, but by the start of the 14th century the area was nearly uninhabited.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|pp=139-41}}{{efn|Contemporary Native Americans do not describe the region as abandoned, but rather view it as a stage in the area's ongoing indigenous culture.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=139}}}} Many emigrants relocated to southern Arizona and New Mexico.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=74}} Although the rate of settlement is unclear, increases in sparsely populated areas, such as [[Chama River (Rio Grande)|Rio Chama]], [[Pajarito Plateau]], and Santa Fe, correspond directly with the period of migration from Mesa Verde. Archaeologists believe the Mesa Verdeans who settled in the areas near the Rio Grande, where Mesa Verde black-on-white pottery became widespread during the 14th century, were likely related to the households they joined and not unwelcome intruders. Archaeologists view this migration as a continuation, versus a dissolution, of Ancestral Puebloan society and culture.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=395\u201398}} Many others relocated to the banks of the [[Little Colorado River]], in western New Mexico and eastern Arizona.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=144}} While archaeologists tend to focus on the [[Human migration|\"push\"]] factors that drove the Mesa Verdeans away from the region, there were also several environmental \"pull factors\", such as warmer temperatures, better farming conditions, plentiful timber, and [[bison]] herds, which incentivized relocation to the area near the Rio Grande.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|pp=144\u201345}} In addition to numerous settlements along the Rio Grande, contemporary descendants of the Mesa Verdeans live in pueblos at [[Acoma Pueblo|Acomo]], [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zuni]], [[Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico|Jemez]], and [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]].{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=139}}{{efn|During this time, the entirety of the Zuni people are believed to have migrated to western New Mexico. Archaeological evidence suggests that another large group of Mesa Verdeans migrated approximately {{convert|200|miles}} to southwestern New Mexico, where they built structures that are now known as Pinnacle Ruin.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=142}}}}\n\n====Organization====\nAlthough Chaco Canyon might have exerted regional control over Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, most archaeologists view the Mesa Verde region as a collection of smaller communities based on central sites and related outliers that were never fully integrated into a larger civic structure.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=77}} Several ancient roads, averaging {{convert|15 to 45|feet}} wide and lined with earthen [[berm]]s, have been identified in the region. Most appear to connect communities and shrines; others encircle great house sites. The extent of the network is unclear, but no roads have been discovered leading to the Chacoan [[Great North Road (Ancestral Puebloans)|Great North Road]], or directly connecting Mesa Verde and Chacoan sites.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=79}}\n\nAncestral Puebloan shrines, called ''[[Herradura (Ancestral Puebloans)|herradura]]s'', have been identified near road segments in the region. Their purpose is unclear, but several C-shaped herraduras have been excavated, and they are thought to have been \"directional shrines\" used to indicate the location of great houses.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=80}}{{efn|Similar structures are used by modern Pueblo people.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=80}}}}\n\n====Architecture====\n[[File:Cyark elevation fire temple.jpg|left|thumb|Section view of Kiva A in Mesa Verde's Fire Temple, cut from laser scan data collected by a [[CyArk]]/[[National Park Service]] partnership. Since Fire Temple was at least partially built to conform to the dimensions of the cliff alcove in which it was built, it is neither round in form nor truly subterranean like other structures generally defined as [[kiva]]s.]]\nMesa Verde is best known for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock overhangs along the [[canyon]] walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard [[sandstone]], held together and plastered with [[adobe]] mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=13, 47\u201359}}\n\nPueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in ''U,'' ''E'' and ''L'' shapes.  The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration. Towers were built near kivas and likely used for lookouts. Pottery became more versatile, including pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants. Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt-retaining dams, also emerged during this period.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=9\u201313, 24}}\nStyles for these sandstone/mortar constructions, both surface and cliff dwellings, included T-shaped windows and doors. This has been taken by some archaeologists, including Stephen H. Lekson, as evidence of the continuing reach of the Chacoan system.{{sfn|Lekson|2015|pp=158, 175\u201380}} Other researchers see these elements as part of a more generalized Puebloan style or spiritual significance rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system.<ref>Phillips, David A., Jr., 2000, [http://www.unm.edu/~dap/meridian/meridian.html \"The Chaco Meridian: A skeptical analysis\"] paper presented to the 65th annual meeting of the Society of American Archaeology, Philadelphia.</ref>\n\nWhile much of the construction in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and [[Pit house#American Southwest|pit-houses]], the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction.{{sfn|Kantner|2004|pp=161\u201366}}\n\n====Astronomy====\n[[File:Sun Temple by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone ruin|The Sun Temple at Mesa Verde]]\nMesa Verdeans used astronomical observations to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural features in the landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the [[cardinal direction]]s, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along the path of the sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=83}}\n\nThe temple is D-shaped, and its alignment is 10.7 degrees off true east-west.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=90}} Its location and orientation indicate that its builders understood the cycles of both the sun and the moon.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=89}} It is aligned to the major [[lunar standstill]], which occurs once every 18.6 years, and the sunset during the [[winter solstice]], which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform at the south end of Cliff Palace, across Fewkes Canyon. At the bottom of the canyon is the Sun Temple fire pit, which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice. Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans.{{sfn|Malville|2006|pp=85, 90\u201391}}{{efn|Painted wavy lines in the square tower at Cliff Palace average 18.6 marks each, suggesting that people recorded four of these events there.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=91}} Jesse Walter Fewkes named the building Sun Temple after finding rock art in the southwest corner of the site depicting the sun.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=90}}}}\n\n====Agriculture and water-control systems====\n[[File:Mesa verde far view procession 6.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A color picture of a long masonry wall|Far View Reservoir]]\nStarting in the 6th century, the farmers living in central Mesa Verde cultivated corn, beans, squash, and gourds. The combination of corn and beans provided the Mesa Verdeans with the amino acids of a [[complete protein]]. When conditions were good, {{convert|3 or 4|acres}} of land would provide enough food for a family of three or four individuals for one year, providing they supplemented with game and wild plants. As Mesa Verdeans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple, the success or failure of crop yields factored heavily into their lives. The mesa tilts slightly to the south, which increased its exposure to the sun.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=1\u20134}} Before the introduction of pottery, foods were baked, roasted, and parched. Hot rocks dropped into containers could bring water to a brief boil, but because beans must be boiled for an hour or more their use was not widespread until after pottery had disseminated throughout the region. With the increased availability of ceramics after 600, beans became much easier to cook. This provided a high quality protein that reduced reliance on hunting. It also aided corn cultivation, as [[legumes]] add much needed nutrients to soils they are grown in, which likely increased corn yields.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=102\u201303}}\n\nMost Mesa Verdeans practiced [[Dryland farming|dry farming]], which relied on rain to water their crops, but others utilized runoff, springs, [[Seep (hydrology)|seeps]], and natural collection pools. Starting in the 9th century, they dug and maintained reservoirs that caught runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt; some crops were watered by hand.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=33\u201334}} Archaeologists believe that prior to the 13th century, springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources, but as Mesa Verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited to members of the surrounding community.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=78}}\n\nBetween 750 and 800, Mesa Verdeans began constructing two large water containment structures in canyon bottoms&nbsp;\u2013 the Morefield and Box Elder reservoirs. Soon afterward, work began on two more: the Far View and Sagebrush reservoirs, which were approximately {{convert|90|feet}} across and constructed on the mesa top. The reservoirs lie on an east-west line that runs for approximately {{convert|6|miles}}, which suggests builders followed a centralized plan for the system. In 2004, the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] designated these four structures as [[National Civil Engineering Historic Landmark]]s.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=123\u201324}} A 2014 geospatial analyses suggested that neither collection nor retention of water was possible in the Far View Reservoir. This interpretation views the structure as a ceremonial space with procession roads in an adaptation of Chacoan culture.{{sfn|Benson et al.|2014|pp=164\u201379}}\n\n====Hunting and foraging====\n[[File:Ancestral Puebloan bone awls by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of three long bone tools|Ancestral Puebloan bone awls]]\nMesa Verdeans typically harvested local small game, but sometimes organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their main sources of animal protein came from [[mule deer]] and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk.{{sfn|Adams|2006|p=6}} They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop.{{sfn|Kohler|2006|p=72}} Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as [[Stitching awl|awls]] and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.{{sfn|Adams|2006|p=6}}\n\nMesa Verdeans supplemented their diet by gathering the seeds and fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected pi\u00f1on nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, [[tomatillo]], [[Descurainia sophia|tansy mustard]], [[Sphaeralcea|globe mallow]], sunflower seeds, and [[yucca]], as well as various species of grass and cacti. [[Opuntia|Prickly pear]] fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used [[sagebrush]] and [[Cercocarpus|mountain mahogany]], along with pi\u00f1on and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=4\u20136}} Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their [[midden]] piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, {{circa|700}}, Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=83}}\n\n====Pottery====\n{{Multiple image| align = left| direction = vertical| width = 175| header = |image1=Mesa Verde black-on-white mug, San Juan Anasazi, Whiskers Ruin, Utah, 1200-1300 AD, ceramic, paint - Natural History Museum of Utah - DSC07407.JPG|alt1=A color picture of a black-on-white pottery vessel|caption1=Mesa Verde black-on-white|image2=Mesa Verde Pueblo II corrugated jars.jpg|alt2=A black and white picture of several large ceramic vessels|caption2=Mesa Verde corrugated jars}}\nScholars are divided as to whether pottery was invented in the Four Corners region or introduced from the south. Specimens of shallow, unfired clay bowls found at [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]] indicate the innovation might have been derived from using clay bowls to parch seeds. Repeated uses rendered these bowls hard and impervious to water, which might represent the first fired pottery in the region. An alternate theory suggests that pottery originated in the [[Mogollon Rim]] area to the south, where brown-paste bowls were used during the first few centuries of the [[common era]].{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=101}} Others believe pottery was introduced to Mesa Verde from Mexico, {{circa|300}} CE.{{sfn|Lang|2006|p=61}} There is no evidence of ancient pottery markets in the region, but archaeologists believe that local potters exchanged decorative wares between families. Cooking pots made with crushed [[igneous rock]] [[Ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Tempers|tempers]] from places like [[Ute Mountain]] were more resilient and desirable, and Puebloans from throughout the region traded for them.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=104\u201306}}\n\n[[Neutron activation analysis]] indicates that much of the black-on-white pottery found at Mesa Verde was produced locally. [[Cretaceous]] clays from both the [[Dakota Formation|Dakota]] and [[Menefee Formation]]s were used in black-on-white wares, and Mancos Formation clays for corrugated jars.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|pp=231, 234, 237}}{{efn|Mancos shale was the most commonly used clay in the region, particularly for non-decorated gray wares.{{sfn|Lang|2006|p=61}}}} Evidence that pottery of both types moved between several locations around the region suggests interaction between groups of ancient potters, or they might have shared a common source of raw materials.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|pp=231, 234, 237}} The Mesa Verde black-on-white pottery was produced at three locations: Sand Canyon, Castle Rock, and Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=238}} Archeological evidence indicates that nearly every household had at least one member who worked as a potter. Trench kilns were constructed away from pueblos and closer to sources of firewood. Their sizes vary, but the larger ones were up to {{convert|24|feet}} long and thought to have been shared kilns that served several families. Designs were added to ceramic vessels with a Yucca-leaf brush and paints made from iron, [[manganese]], [[Cleome|beeplant]], and tansy mustard.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=103\u201305}}\n\nMost of the pottery found in 9th century pueblos was sized for individuals or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast\u2013sized vessels were produced.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=106}} Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that was easier to hold on to than regular gray wares, which were smooth.{{sfn|Lang|2006|p=62}} By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=103}} Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=106\u201307}} Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=238}} Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=103}}\n\n====Rock art and murals====\n[[File:Petroglyph Point at Mesa Verde National Park by RO.JPG|right|thumb|alt=A color picture of some petroglyphs on a tan sandstone cliff face|Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point; the glyphs represent (top; from right to left) the Eagle, Mountain Sheep, Parrot, Horned Toad, and Mountain Lion clans, and the Ancestral Puebloans (bottom).{{sfn|National Park Service|1986|pp=10\u201311}}]]\nRock art is found throughout the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s in the rock art of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=81}} As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=132}} Modern Hopi have interpreted the [[petroglyph]]s at Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people.{{sfn|National Park Service|1986|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nStarting during the late Pueblo II period (1020) and continuing through Pueblo III (1300), the Ancestral Puebloans of the Mesa Verde region created plaster [[mural]]s in their great houses, particularly in their kivas. The murals contained both painted and inscribed images depicting animals, people, and designs used in textiles and pottery dating back as far as Basketmaker III, {{circa|500}}. Others depict triangles and mounds thought to represent mountains and hills in the surrounding landscape. The murals were typically located on the face of the kiva bench and usually encircled the room.

This resulted in Mesa Verde National Park elevations ranging from about {{convert|6000|to|8572|ft|m}}, the highest elevation at Park Point.  The terrain in the park is now a transition zone between the low desert plateaus and the [[Rocky Mountains]].{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=9\u201313, 24}}\n\n==Geology==\nAlthough the area's first Spanish explorers named the feature ''Mesa Verde'', the term is a misnomer, as true mesas are almost perfectly flat. Because Mesa Verde is slanted to the south, the proper geological term is [[cuesta]], not mesa. The park is made up of several smaller cuestas located between canyons. Mesa Verde's slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area's cliff dwellings.{{sfn|National Park Service (h)}}\n\nIn the late Cretaceous Period, the [[Mancos Shale]] was deposited on top of the [[Dakota Sandstone]], which is the rock formation that can be found under much of Colorado. The beds of the Mancos Shale are \"fine-grained sand-stones, mudstones, and shales\" which accumulated in the deep water of the Cretaceous Sea. It has a high clay content which causes it to expand when wet leading to sliding of the terrain. On top of this shale, there are three formations in the Mesaverde group which reflect the changes in depositional environment in the area over time. The first is the [[Point Lookout Sandstone]], which is named for the Point Lookout feature in the park (elevation 8427 feet). This sandstone, which formed in the marine environment of shallow water when the Cretaceous sea was receding, is \"massive, fine-grained, cross-bedded, and very resistant\", in its layers reflecting waves and currents that were present during the time of its formation. Its sediments are approximately 400 feet thick, and its upper layers feature fossiliferous invertebrates.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91\u2013102}}\n\nNext is the Menefee Formation, the middle formation whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional environment and the organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91\u2013102}}\n\nThe Cliff House Sandstone is the area's youngest rock layer. It was formed after the Cretaceous sea had completely receded and as a result has a high sand content from beaches, dunes, etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces. Like the Point Lookout Sandstone, it is about 400 feet thick. It contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells, fish teeth, and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea. The shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the Ancestral Puebloans constructed their dwellings.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91\u2013102}}\n\nContinuing through the Cretaceous period and into the early [[Tertiary]], there was uplifting in the area of the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the [[La Plata Mountains]], which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91\u2013102}}\n\n==Rediscovery==\n[[File:SpruceTreeHouse.JPG|left|thumb|Spruce Tree House]]\nMexican-Spanish missionaries and explorers [[Dominguez\u2013Escalante Expedition|Francisco Atanasio Dom\u00ednguez and Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]], seeking a route from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] to California, faithfully recorded their travels in 1776.

After there had become an interest in land in western Colorado, a new treaty in 1873 left the Ute with a strip of land in southwestern Colorado between the border with New Mexico and 15 miles north.  Most of Mesa Verde lies within this strip of land. The Ute wintered in the warm, deep canyons and found sanctuary there and the high plateaus of Mesa Verde. Believing the cliff dwellings to be sacred ancestral sites, they did not live in the ancient dwellings.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=77}}\n\nOccasional trappers and prospectors visited, with one prospector, John Moss, making his observations known in 1873.{{sfn|Reynolds|Reynolds|2006|p=}} The following year, Moss led eminent photographer [[William Henry Jackson]] through Mancos Canyon, at the base of Mesa Verde.

Conflicts over who laid claim to the land surrounding the ruins came to fruition in 1911, when the US government wanted to secure more land for the park that was owned by the Ute Indians. The Utes were reluctant to agree to the land swap proposed by the government, noting that the land they were seeking was the best land the tribe owned. Frederick Abbott, working with Indian Office official James McLaughlin, proclaimed to be an ally to the Ute in negotiations. Abbott later claimed that the \"government was stronger than the Utes,\" saying that when the government finds \"old ruins on land that it wants to take for public purposes, it has the right to take it ...\" Feeling they were left with no other options, the Utes reluctantly agreed to trade the 10,000 acres on Chapin Mesa for 19,500 acres on Ute Mountain.\n\nThe Utes continued to battle the Bureau of Indian Affairs to prevent more Ute land from being incorporated into the park. In 1935, the BIA attempted to gain back some the land traded in 1911. Additionally, superintendent [[Jesse L. Nusbaum]] later confessed that the Ute Mountain land traded for Chapin Mesa in 1911 belonged to the tribe anyway, meaning the government had traded land that never belonged to them in the first place.{{sfn|Keller|1998|pp=30\u201342}}\n\nOther issues unrelated to land disputes emerged as a result of park activities. In the 1920s, the park began offering \"Indian ceremony\" performances that gained popularity among visiting tourists; however, the ceremonies did not actually reflect the rites of the Ancient Puebloans who lived in the cliff dwellings nor the rites of the modern Ute. Navajo day laborers performed these rituals, resulting in \"the wrong Indians doing the wrong dance on ... the wrong land.\" In addition to the inaccuracy of the ceremonies, a question of whether Navajo dancers were paid fairly also resulted in questions regarding the lack of local American Indians being employed in other capacities in the park. Additionally, the park offered little financial benefits to the Ute Mountain Ute despite their land swap making much of the park possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indian Country, God's Country: Native Americans and the National Parks|last=Burnham|first=Philip|publisher=Island Press|year=2000|isbn=155963667X|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=62\u201366}}</ref>\n\n===Services===\n[[File:Mesa Verde park ranger.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A color picture of a man wearing a green and brown National Park Service uniform|Park Ranger leading a tour at Mesa Verde National Park]]\nThe entrance to Mesa Verde National Park is on [[U.S. Route 160]], approximately {{convert|9|mi}} east of the community of [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]] and {{convert|7|mi}} west of Mancos, Colorado.<ref name=NPS-TripPlanner/> The park covers {{convert|52485|acre}}<ref name=\"area\">{{NPS area|year=2011|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref> It contains 4,372 documented sites, including more than 600 cliff dwellings.<ref>{{harvnb|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|p=380}}: 4,372 documented sites; {{harvnb|Nordby|2006|p=111}}: 600 cliff dwellings.</ref> It is the largest archaeological preserve in the US.<ref name=aramark/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-5-places-to-learn-on-vacation-pueblo-colorado,0,758178.photo |title=Archeological adventure|work=Chicago Tribune|date= |accessdate=June 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928063432/http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-5-places-to-learn-on-vacation-pueblo-colorado,0,758178.photo |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It protects some of the most important and best-preserved archaeological sites in the country.{{sfn|National Park Service (a)}} The park initiated the Archaeological Site Conservation Program in 1995.

They were named: Chapin V (1996), Bircher and Pony (2000), Long Mesa (2002), and the Balcony House Complex fires (2003), which were five fires that began on the same day. The Chapin V and Pony fires destroyed two rock art sites, and the Long Mesa fire nearly destroyed the museum&nbsp;\u2013 the first one ever built in the National Park System&nbsp;\u2013 and Spruce Tree House, the third largest cliff dwelling in the park.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=119}}\n\nPrior to the fires of 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had surveyed approximately ninety percent of the park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed&nbsp;\u2013 most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods.{{sfn|Bell|2006|pp=120\u201321}} In February 2008, the [[Colorado Historical Society]] decided to invest a part of its $7&nbsp;million budget into a [[culturally modified trees]] project in the national park.<ref>''State Historical Fund awards more than $7M in grants'', Denver Business Journal, Feb 14, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Ute Mountain Tribal Park===\n{{main|Ute Mountain Tribal Park}}\nThe [[Ute Mountain Tribal Park]], adjoining Mesa Verde National Park to the east of the mountains, is approximately {{convert|125000|acre}} along the [[Mancos River]].  Hundreds of surface sites, cliff dwellings, petroglyphs, and wall paintings of Ancestral Puebloan and [[Ute people|Ute]] cultures are preserved in the park.

Its 45 rooms and 2 kivas would have been cold during the winter. Visitors on ranger-guided tours enter by climbing a 32-foot ladder and a crawling through a 12-foot tunnel.  The exit, a series of toe-holds in a cleft of the cliff, was believed to be the only entry and exit route for the cliff dwellers, which made the small village easy to defend and secure.  One log was dated at 1278, so it was likely built not long before the Mesa Verde people migrated out of the area.{{sfn|Casey|1993|pp=225\u201326}}{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=55\u201356}} It was officially excavated in 1910 by [[Jesse L.

The cliff dwelling features 150 rooms, a kiva, a tower, and a central plaza.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=220}} Its rooms are not clustered like typical cliff dwellings. Stones were used without shaping for fit and stability. Two overhead ledges contain storage space for grain. One ledge seems to include an overlook with small holes in the wall to see the rest of the village below. A spring is accessible within several hundred feet, and seeps are located in the rear of the village.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=57}}\n\n===Mug, Oak Tree, Spruce Tree, and Square Tower houses===\nMug House is located on Wetherill Mesa; it contains 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir.

The variety of projectile points found in the region indicates they were influenced by surrounding areas, including the [[Great Basin]], the [[San Juan Basin]], and the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. Later, [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic]] people established semi-permanent rock shelters in and around the [[mesa]]. By 1000 BC, the [[Basketmaker culture]] emerged from the local Archaic population, and by 750 AD the Ancestral Puebloans had developed from the Basketmaker culture.\n\nThe Mesa Verdeans survived using a combination of hunting, gathering, and subsistence farming of crops such as corn, beans, and squash. They built the mesa's first [[pueblo]]s sometime after 650, and by the end of the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico, including [[Chama River (Rio Grande)|Rio Chama]], [[Pajarito Plateau]], and Santa Fe.\n\n==Inhabitants==\n\n===Paleo-Indians===\n[[File:Glyptodon old drawing.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A painting of two people hunting a large animal|Paleo-Indians hunting a [[Glyptodontidae|glyptodont]], by [[Heinrich Harder]] {{circa|1920}}]]\nThe first occupants of the [[Mesa Verde region]], which spans from southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico, were nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]] who arrived in the area {{circa|9500}} BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Charles|2006|pp=9\u201310}}: Paleo-Indians; {{harvnb|Lekson|2015|p=105}}: southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico.</ref> They followed herds of big game and camped near rivers and streams, many of which dried up as the glaciers that once covered parts of the [[San Juan Mountains]] receded. The earliest Paleo-Indians were the [[Clovis culture]] and [[Folsom tradition]], defined largely by how they fashioned [[projectile point]]s. Although they left evidence of their presence throughout the region, there is little indication that they lived in central Mesa Verde during this time.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAfter 9600 BC, the area's environment grew warmer and drier, a change that brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers {{circa|7500 BC}}, though it is unclear whether they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the [[Spear-thrower|atlatl]] during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance at a time when most of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.{{sfn|Charles|2006|p=10}}\n\n===Archaic===\n[[File:Barrier Canyon style, Sego Canyon.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of some Archaic pictographs|Archaic [[Pictogram|pictographs]], {{circa|2500}} BC, Sego Canyon, Utah]]\n6000 BC marks the beginning of the [[Archaic period in North America]]. Archaeologists differ as to the origin of the Mesa Verde Archaic population; some believe they developed exclusively from local Paleo-Indians, called the Foothills Mountain Complex, but others suggest that the variety of projectile points found in Mesa Verde indicates influence from surrounding areas, including the [[Great Basin]], the [[San Juan Basin]], and the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. The Archaic people probably developed locally, but were also influenced by contact, trade, and intermarriage with immigrants from these outlying areas.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe early Archaic people living near Mesa Verde utilized the atlatl and harvested a wider variety of plants and animals than the Paleo-Indians had while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. They inhabited the outlying areas of the Mesa Verde region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rock shelters and [[rock art]], and left evidence of animal processing and [[chert]] [[knapping]]. Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa Verde, whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled with spring rains, provided relatively plentiful amounts of water.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nBy the late Archaic, more people were living in semi-permanent rock shelters that preserved perishable goods such as baskets, sandals, and mats. They started to make a variety of twig figurines that usually resembled sheep or deer. The late Archaic is marked by increased trade in exotic materials such as [[obsidian]] and [[turquoise]]. Marine shells and [[abalone]] from the Pacific coast made their way to Mesa Verde from Arizona, and the Archaic people worked them into necklaces and pendants. Rock art flourished, and people lived in rudimentary houses made of mud and wood. Their early attempts at plant domestication eventually developed into the sustained agriculture that marked the end of the Archaic period, {{circa|1000}}.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=11\u201312}}\n\n===Basketmaker culture===\n[[File:Zion National Park Basketmaker II basket specifimen from AD 1 to 700.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A color picture of a woven basket|Basketmaker II basket, {{circa|1 to 500}}]]\nWith the introduction of corn to the Mesa Verde region {{circa|1000}} BC and the trend away from nomadism toward permanent [[pit-house|pithouse]] settlements, the Archaic Mesa Verdeans transitioned into what archaeologists call the [[Basketmaker culture]]. [[Late Basketmaker II Era|Basketmaker II]] people are characterized by their combination of foraging and farming skills, use of the [[Spear-thrower|atlatl]], and creation of finely woven baskets in the absence of earthen pottery. By 300, corn had become the preeminent staple of the Basketmaker II people's diet, which relied less and less on wild food sources and more on domesticated crops.{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=12\u201313}}{{efn|Corn was introduced to the Great Sage Plain, the regions north and west of Mesa Verde, from Mexico.{{sfn|Naranjo|2006|p=54}}}}\n\nIn addition to the fine basketry for which they were named, Basketmaker II people fashioned a variety of household items from plant and animal materials, including sandals, robes, pouches, mats, and blankets. They also made clay pipes and gaming pieces. Basketmaker men were relatively short and muscular, averaging less than {{convert|5.5|feet}} tall. Their skeletal remains reveal signs of hard labor and extensive travel, including degenerative joint disease, healed fractures, and moderate anemia associated with iron deficiency. They buried their dead near or amongst their settlements, and often included luxury items as gifts, which might indicate differences in relative social status. Basketmaker II people are also known for their distinctive rock art, which can be found throughout Mesa Verde. They depicted animals and people, in both abstract and realistic forms, in single works and more elaborate panels. A common subject was the hunchbacked flute player that the [[Hopi]] call [[Kokopelli]].{{sfn|Charles|2006|pp=14\u201315}}\n[[File:Basket of Basketmaker Pueblo people.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A color picture of a weaved basket|Basketmaker III basket, {{circa|450 to 750}}]]\nBy 500 AD, atlatls were being supplanted by the bow and arrow and baskets by pottery, marking the end of the Basketmaker II Era and the beginning of the [[Basketmaker III Era]].<ref>{{harvnb|Charles|2006|pp=14\u201315}}: end of Basketmaker II; {{harvnb|Wilshusen|2006|p=19}} beginning of Basketmaker III.</ref> Ceramic vessels were a major improvement over [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]-lined baskets, gourds, and animal hide containers, which had been the primary water storage containers in the region. Pottery also protected seeds against mold, insects, and rodents. By 600, Mesa Verdeans were using clay pots to cook soups and stews.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=102}} Year-round settlements first appear around this time. The population of the San Juan Basin increased markedly after 575, when there were very few Basketmaker III sites in Mesa Verde; by the early 7th century, there were many such sites in the mesa. For the next 150 years, villages typically consisted of small groups of one to three residences. The population of Mesa Verde {{circa|675}} was approximately 1,000 to 1,500 people.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBeans and new varieties of corn were introduced to the region {{circa|700}}.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|p=383}} By 775, some settlements had grown to accommodate more than one hundred people; the construction of large, above-ground storage buildings began around this time. Basketmakers endeavored to store enough food for their family for one year, but also retained residential mobility so they could quickly relocate their dwellings in the event of resource depletion or consistently inadequate crop yields.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=19\u201321}} By the end of the 8th century, the smaller hamlets, which were typically occupied for ten to forty years, had been supplanted by larger ones that saw continuous occupation for as many as two generations.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=383\u201385}} Basketmaker III people established a tradition of holding large ceremonial gatherings near community pit structures.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Ancestral Puebloans===\n{{main|Ancestral Puebloans}}\n\n====Pueblo I: 750 to 900====\n{{main|Pueblo I Period}}\n{{Multiple image| align = left| direction = vertical| width = 250| header = |image1= Ancestral Puebloan sites.png|alt1=A color map of the Four Corners area of the United States showing major Ancestral Puebloan settlements|caption1=Major Ancestral Puebloan settlements in the San Juan Basin|image2=Pueblo I protokiva at Mesa Verde by RO.JPG|alt2=A color picture of a square subterranean domicile|caption2=Pueblo I protokiva on Chapin Mesa, Mesa Verde National Park}}\n750 marks the end of the Basketmaker III Era and the beginning of the Pueblo I period. The transition is characterized by major changes in the design and construction of buildings and the organization of household activities. Pueblo I people doubled their capacity for food storage from one year to two and built interconnected, year-round residences called [[pueblo]]s. Many household activities that had previously been reserved for subterranean pithouses were moved to these above-ground dwellings. This altered the function of pithouses from all-purpose spaces to ones used primarily for community ceremonies, although they continued to house large extended families, particularly during winter months.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=23\u201324}} During the late 8th century, Mesa Verdeans began building square pit structures that archaeologists call proto[[kiva]]s. They were typically {{convert|3 or 4|feet}} deep and {{convert|12 to 20|feet}} wide.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nThe first pueblos appeared at Mesa Verde sometime after 650; by 850 more than half of Mesa Verdeans lived in them. As local populations grew, Puebloans found it difficult to survive on hunting, foraging, and gardening, which made them increasingly reliant on domesticated corn. This shift from semi-nomadism to a \"sedentary and communal way of life changed ancestral Pueblo society forever\".{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|p=19}} Within a generation the average number of households in these settlements grew from one to three to fifteen to twenty, with average populations of two hundred people. Population density increased dramatically, with as many as a dozen families occupying roughly the same space that had formerly housed two. This brought increased security against raids and encouraged greater cooperation amongst residents. It also facilitated trade and intermarriage between clans, and by the late 8th century, as Mesa Verde's population was being augmented by settlers from the south, four distinct cultural groups occupied the same villages.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=19, 24\u201325}}\n\nLarge Pueblo I settlements laid claim to the resources found within {{convert|15 to 30|mi2}}. They were typically organized in groups of at least three and spaced about {{convert|1|mile}} apart. By 860, there were approximately 8,000 people living in Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|p=26}} Within the plazas of larger villages, the Pueblo I people dug massive pit structures of {{convert|800|ft2}} that became central gathering places. These structures represent early architectural expressions of what would eventually develop into the [[Pueblo II Era]] [[Great house (pueblo)|great houses]] of [[Chaco Culture National Historical Park|Chaco Canyon]]. Despite robust growth during the early and mid-9th century, unpredictable rainfall and periodic drought led to a dramatic reversal of settlement trends in the area. Many late Pueblo I villages were abandoned after less than forty years of occupation, and by 880 Mesa Verde's population was in steady decline.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=26\u201327}} The beginning of the 10th century saw widespread depopulation of the region, as people emigrated south of the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]] to Chaco Canyon in search of reliable rains for farming.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}} As Mesa Verdeans migrated south, to where many of their ancestors had emigrated two hundred years before, the influence of Chaco Canyon grew, and by 950 Chaco had supplanted Mesa Verde as the region's cultural center.{{sfn|Wilshusen|2006|pp=26\u201327}}\n\n====Pueblo II: 900 to 1150====\n{{main|Pueblo II Period}}\n[[File:Square Tower House by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone ruin under an alcove|Square Tower House]]\nThe Pueblo II Period is marked by the growth and outreach of communities centered around the great houses of Chaco Canyon. Despite their participation in the vast Chacoan system, Mesa Verdeans retained a distinct cultural identity while melding regional innovation with ancient tradition, inspiring further architectural advancements; the 9th century Mesa Verdean pueblos influenced two hundred years of Chacoan great house construction.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}} Droughts during the late 9th century rendered Mesa Verdean dry land farming unreliable, which led to their growing crops only near drainages for the next 150 years. Crop yields returned to healthy levels by the early 11th century.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=3\u20134}} By 1050 the population of the area began to rebound; as agricultural prosperity increased, people immigrated to Mesa Verde from the south. {{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}}\n\nMesa Verdean farmers increasingly relied on masonry reservoirs during the Pueblo II Era. During the 11th century, they built [[check dam]]s and terraces near drainages and slopes in an effort to conserve soil and runoff. These fields offset the danger of crop failures in the larger dry land fields.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=34}} By the mid-10th and early 11th centuries, protokivas had evolved into smaller circular structures called kivas, which were usually {{convert|12 to 15|feet}} across. These Mesa Verde-style kivas included a feature from earlier times called a [[sipapu]], which is a hole dug in the north of the chamber and symbolizes the Ancestral Puebloan's place of emergence from the underworld.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=30\u201331}} At this time, Mesa Verdeans began to move away from the post and mud [[jacal]]-style buildings that marked the Pueblo I Period toward masonry construction, which had been utilized in the region as early as 700, but was not widespread until the 11th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nThe expansion of Chacoan influence in the Mesa Verde area left its most visible mark in the form of Chaco-style masonry great houses that became the focal point of many Mesa Verdean villages after 1075.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}} Far View House, the largest of these, is considered a classic Chaco \"outlier,\" on which construction likely began between 1075 and 1125, although some archaeologists argue that it was begun as early as 1020.<ref name=ChacoMeridian>Lekson, Stephen. ''The Chaco Meridian: One Thousand Years of Political and Religious Power in the Ancient Southwest''. Rowman & Littlefield, 2015</ref> The era's timber and earth unit pueblos were typically inhabited for about twenty years.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=42}} During the early 12th century, the locus of regional control shifted away from Chaco to [[Aztec Ruins National Monument|Aztec]], New Mexico, in the southern Mesa Verde region.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=29}}{{efn|Donna Glowacki refutes this position, suggesting that the people of Aztec never achieved the wide-spread influence of Chaco Canyon. She believes the relationship between Mesa Verde and Aztec was more likely one of competition and conflict, versus religious or social hegemony.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}}}} By 1150, drought had once again stressed the region's inhabitants, leading to a temporary cessation of great house construction at Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=30}}\n\n====Pueblo III: 1150 to 1300====\n{{main|Pueblo III Period}}\n[[File:Cliff Palace.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone ruins, with green trees below and blue sky above|Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=41}}]]\nA severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led to rapid depopulation in many parts of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=385\u201386, 398\u201399}}\n\nThe Chacoan system brought large quantities of imported goods to Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, including pottery, shells, and turquoise, but by the late 12th century, as the system collapsed, the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined, and Mesa Verde became isolated from the surrounding region.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=36}} For approximately six hundred years, most Mesa Verdean farmers had lived in small, mesa-top homesteads of one or two families. They were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water. This practice continued into the mid- to late 12th century, but by the start of the 13th century they began living in canyon locations that were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nMesa Verdean villages thrived during the mid-Pueblo III Era, when architects constructed massive, multi-story buildings, and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs. Structures built during this period have been described as \"among the world's greatest archaeological treasures\".{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=39}} Pueblo III masonry buildings were typically occupied for approximately fifty years, more than double the usable lifespan of the Pueblo II jacal structures. Others were continuously inhabited for two hundred years or more. Architectural innovations such as towers and multi-walled structures also appear during the Pueblo III Era. Mesa Verde's population remained fairly stable during the 12th century drought.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=42\u201344}} At the start of the 13th century, approximately 22,000 people lived there.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|p=385}} The area saw moderate population increases during the following decades, and dramatic ones from 1225 to 1260.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Most of the people in the region lived in the plains west of the mesa at locations such as [[Yellow Jacket Pueblo]], near Cortez, Colorado.{{sfn|Lekson|2015|p=105}} Others colonized canyon rims and slopes in multi-family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled.{{sfn|Kantner|2004|pp=161\u201366}} By 1260, the majority of Mesa Verdeans lived in large pueblos that housed several families and more than one hundred people.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=40\u201341}}\n\nThe 13th century saw 69 years of below average rainfall in the Mesa Verde region, and after 1270 the area suffered from especially cold temperatures. [[Dendrochronology]] indicates that the last tree felled for construction on the mesa was cut in 1281.{{sfn|Varien|2006|pp=40, 46}} There was a major decline in [[ceramic]] imports to the region during this time, but local production remained steady.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=218}} Despite challenging conditions, the Puebloans continued to farm the area until a severely dry period from 1276 to 1299 ended seven hundred years of continuous human occupation at Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=3\u20134}} Archaeologists refer to this period as the \"Great Drought\".{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=140}} The last inhabitants of the mesa left the area {{circa|1285}}.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=46}}\n\n====Warfare====\n[[File:Oak Tree House by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone cliff dwelling|Oak Tree House]]\nDuring the Pueblo III period (1150 to 1300), Mesa Verdeans built numerous stone masonry towers that likely served as defensive structures. They often incorporated hidden tunnels connecting the towers to associated kivas.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=128}} Warfare was conducted using the same tools the Mesa Verdeans used for hunting game, including bows and arrows, stone axes, and wooden clubs and spears. They also crafted hide and basket shields that were used only during battles.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=131}} Periodic warfare occurred on the mesa throughout the 13th century.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Civic leaders in the region likely attained power and prestige by distributing food during times of drought. This system probably broke down during the \"Great Drought\", leading to intense warfare between competing clans.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|pp=140\u201341}} Increasing economic and social uncertainty during the century's final decades led to widespread conflict. Evidence of partly burned villages and post-mortem trauma have been uncovered, and the residents of one village appear to have been the victims of a site-wide massacre.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=386, 398}}\n\nEvidence of violence and [[cannibalism]] has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|p=37}}{{efn|The earliest known evidence for large-scale violence in the region was uncovered in southeastern Utah. Future Mesa Verde rediscoverer, [[Richard Wetherill]], then leading the [[Hyde Exploring Expedition]], located the site, now called \"Cave 7\", in which the bodies of nearly 100 men, women, and children were found. They date to the late Basketmaker II period (200 BC to 500 AD). Evidence of defensive structures, such as palisades and stockades, dating to the 7th and 11th centuries have been uncovered near ancient Mesa Verdean farmsteads.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=127}}}} While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Evidence of the attacks was discovered by members of the [[Crow Canyon Archaeological Center]] during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to {{circa|1280}}, and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=127}} Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were [[Scalping|scalped]], dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|pp=132\u201333}} The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=134}}\n\n====Migration====\nThe Mesa Verde region saw unusually cold and dry conditions during the beginning of the 13th century. This might have driven emigration to Mesa Verde from less hospitable locations. The added population stressed the mesa's environment, further straining an agricultural society that was suffering from drought.{{sfn|Kohler|2006|p=73}} The region's bimodal precipitation pattern, which brought rainfall during spring and summer and snowfall during autumn and winter, began to fail post-1250.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=140}} After 1260, there was a rapid depopulation of Mesa Verde, as \"tens of thousands of people\" emigrated or died from starvation.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=44}} Many smaller communities in the Four Corners region were also abandoned during this period.{{sfn|Casey|1993|p=220}}{{sfn|Watson|1961|p=156}} The Ancestral Puebloans had a long history of migration in the face of environmental instability, but the depopulation of Mesa Verde at the end of the 13th century was different in that the region was almost completely emptied, and no descendants returned to build permanent settlements.{{sfn|Varien|2006|p=45}} While drought, resource depletion, and overpopulation all contributed to instability during the last two centuries of Ancestral Puebloan occupation, their overdependence on maize crops is considered the \"fatal flaw\" of their subsistence strategy.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=135}}{{efn|When the Spanish first settled in the area in 1598, they proposed that the Utes and Navajo had driven the Ancestral Puebloans away from Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=141}} In 1891, Gustaf Nordenski\u00f6ld proposed that the Mesa Verdeans had been driven away from the area by hostile intruders. In the early 20th century, Jesse Walter Fewkes theorized that climate change had adversely affected water supplies in the region, which led to widespread crop failure and the rapid depopulation of the area. The last two theories remain at the foreground of the archaeological investigation of Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=139}}}}\n\nThe vacating Mesa Verdeans left almost no direct evidence of their migration, but they left behind household goods, including cooking utensils, tools, and clothing, which gave archaeologists the impression that the emigration was haphazard or hurried. An estimated 20,000 people lived in the region during the 13th century, but by the start of the 14th century the area was nearly uninhabited.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|pp=139-41}}{{efn|Contemporary Native Americans do not describe the region as abandoned, but rather view it as a stage in the area's ongoing indigenous culture.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=139}}}} Many emigrants relocated to southern Arizona and New Mexico.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=74}} Although the rate of settlement is unclear, increases in sparsely populated areas, such as [[Chama River (Rio Grande)|Rio Chama]], [[Pajarito Plateau]], and Santa Fe, correspond directly with the period of migration from Mesa Verde. Archaeologists believe the Mesa Verdeans who settled in the areas near the Rio Grande, where Mesa Verde black-on-white pottery became widespread during the 14th century, were likely related to the households they joined and not unwelcome intruders. Archaeologists view this migration as a continuation, versus a dissolution, of Ancestral Puebloan society and culture.{{sfn|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|pp=395\u201398}} Many others relocated to the banks of the [[Little Colorado River]], in western New Mexico and eastern Arizona.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=144}} While archaeologists tend to focus on the [[Human migration|\"push\"]] factors that drove the Mesa Verdeans away from the region, there were also several environmental \"pull factors\", such as warmer temperatures, better farming conditions, plentiful timber, and [[bison]] herds, which incentivized relocation to the area near the Rio Grande.{{sfn|Cameron|2006|pp=144\u201345}} In addition to numerous settlements along the Rio Grande, contemporary descendants of the Mesa Verdeans live in pueblos at [[Acoma Pueblo|Acomo]], [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico|Zuni]], [[Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico|Jemez]], and [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]].{{sfn|Cameron|2006|p=139}}{{efn|During this time, the entirety of the Zuni people are believed to have migrated to western New Mexico.

Most appear to connect communities and shrines; others encircle great house sites. The extent of the network is unclear, but no roads have been discovered leading to the Chacoan [[Great North Road (Ancestral Puebloans)|Great North Road]], or directly connecting Mesa Verde and Chacoan sites.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=79}}\n\nAncestral Puebloan shrines, called ''[[Herradura (Ancestral Puebloans)|herradura]]s'', have been identified near road segments in the region. Their purpose is unclear, but several C-shaped herraduras have been excavated, and they are thought to have been \"directional shrines\" used to indicate the location of great houses.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=80}}{{efn|Similar structures are used by modern Pueblo people.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=80}}}}\n\n====Architecture====\n[[File:Cyark elevation fire temple.jpg|left|thumb|Section view of Kiva A in Mesa Verde's Fire Temple, cut from laser scan data collected by a [[CyArk]]/[[National Park Service]] partnership. Since Fire Temple was at least partially built to conform to the dimensions of the cliff alcove in which it was built, it is neither round in form nor truly subterranean like other structures generally defined as [[kiva]]s.]]\nMesa Verde is best known for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock overhangs along the [[canyon]] walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard [[sandstone]], held together and plastered with [[adobe]] mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=13, 47\u201359}}\n\nPueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in ''U,'' ''E'' and ''L'' shapes.  The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration. Towers were built near kivas and likely used for lookouts. Pottery became more versatile, including pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants. Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt-retaining dams, also emerged during this period.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=9\u201313, 24}}\nStyles for these sandstone/mortar constructions, both surface and cliff dwellings, included T-shaped windows and doors. This has been taken by some archaeologists, including Stephen H. Lekson, as evidence of the continuing reach of the Chacoan system.{{sfn|Lekson|2015|pp=158, 175\u201380}} Other researchers see these elements as part of a more generalized Puebloan style or spiritual significance rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system.<ref>Phillips, David A., Jr., 2000, [http://www.unm.edu/~dap/meridian/meridian.html \"The Chaco Meridian: A skeptical analysis\"] paper presented to the 65th annual meeting of the Society of American Archaeology, Philadelphia.</ref>\n\nWhile much of the construction in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and [[Pit house#American Southwest|pit-houses]], the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction.{{sfn|Kantner|2004|pp=161\u201366}}\n\n====Astronomy====\n[[File:Sun Temple by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of a large sandstone ruin|The Sun Temple at Mesa Verde]]\nMesa Verdeans used astronomical observations to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural features in the landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the [[cardinal direction]]s, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along the path of the sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=83}}\n\nThe temple is D-shaped, and its alignment is 10.7 degrees off true east-west.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=90}} Its location and orientation indicate that its builders understood the cycles of both the sun and the moon.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=89}} It is aligned to the major [[lunar standstill]], which occurs once every 18.6 years, and the sunset during the [[winter solstice]], which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform at the south end of Cliff Palace, across Fewkes Canyon. At the bottom of the canyon is the Sun Temple fire pit, which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice. Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans.{{sfn|Malville|2006|pp=85, 90\u201391}}{{efn|Painted wavy lines in the square tower at Cliff Palace average 18.6 marks each, suggesting that people recorded four of these events there.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=91}} Jesse Walter Fewkes named the building Sun Temple after finding rock art in the southwest corner of the site depicting the sun.{{sfn|Malville|2006|p=90}}}}\n\n====Agriculture and water-control systems====\n[[File:Mesa verde far view procession 6.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A color picture of a long masonry wall|Far View Reservoir]]\nStarting in the 6th century, the farmers living in central Mesa Verde cultivated corn, beans, squash, and gourds. The combination of corn and beans provided the Mesa Verdeans with the amino acids of a [[complete protein]]. When conditions were good, {{convert|3 or 4|acres}} of land would provide enough food for a family of three or four individuals for one year, providing they supplemented with game and wild plants. As Mesa Verdeans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple, the success or failure of crop yields factored heavily into their lives. The mesa tilts slightly to the south, which increased its exposure to the sun.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=1\u20134}} Before the introduction of pottery, foods were baked, roasted, and parched. Hot rocks dropped into containers could bring water to a brief boil, but because beans must be boiled for an hour or more their use was not widespread until after pottery had disseminated throughout the region. With the increased availability of ceramics after 600, beans became much easier to cook. This provided a high quality protein that reduced reliance on hunting. It also aided corn cultivation, as [[legumes]] add much needed nutrients to soils they are grown in, which likely increased corn yields.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=102\u201303}}\n\nMost Mesa Verdeans practiced [[Dryland farming|dry farming]], which relied on rain to water their crops, but others utilized runoff, springs, [[Seep (hydrology)|seeps]], and natural collection pools. Starting in the 9th century, they dug and maintained reservoirs that caught runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt; some crops were watered by hand.{{sfn|Lipe|2006|pp=33\u201334}} Archaeologists believe that prior to the 13th century, springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources, but as Mesa Verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited to members of the surrounding community.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=78}}\n\nBetween 750 and 800, Mesa Verdeans began constructing two large water containment structures in canyon bottoms&nbsp;\u2013 the Morefield and Box Elder reservoirs. Soon afterward, work began on two more: the Far View and Sagebrush reservoirs, which were approximately {{convert|90|feet}} across and constructed on the mesa top. The reservoirs lie on an east-west line that runs for approximately {{convert|6|miles}}, which suggests builders followed a centralized plan for the system. In 2004, the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] designated these four structures as [[National Civil Engineering Historic Landmark]]s.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=123\u201324}} A 2014 geospatial analyses suggested that neither collection nor retention of water was possible in the Far View Reservoir. This interpretation views the structure as a ceremonial space with procession roads in an adaptation of Chacoan culture.{{sfn|Benson et al.|2014|pp=164\u201379}}\n\n====Hunting and foraging====\n[[File:Ancestral Puebloan bone awls by RO.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A color picture of three long bone tools|Ancestral Puebloan bone awls]]\nMesa Verdeans typically harvested local small game, but sometimes organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their main sources of animal protein came from [[mule deer]] and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk.{{sfn|Adams|2006|p=6}} They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop.{{sfn|Kohler|2006|p=72}} Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as [[Stitching awl|awls]] and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten.{{sfn|Adams|2006|p=6}}\n\nMesa Verdeans supplemented their diet by gathering the seeds and fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected pi\u00f1on nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, [[tomatillo]], [[Descurainia sophia|tansy mustard]], [[Sphaeralcea|globe mallow]], sunflower seeds, and [[yucca]], as well as various species of grass and cacti. [[Opuntia|Prickly pear]] fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used [[sagebrush]] and [[Cercocarpus|mountain mahogany]], along with pi\u00f1on and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco.{{sfn|Adams|2006|pp=4\u20136}} Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their [[midden]] piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, {{circa|700}}, Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=83}}\n\n====Pottery====\n{{Multiple image| align = left| direction = vertical| width = 175| header = |image1=Mesa Verde black-on-white mug, San Juan Anasazi, Whiskers Ruin, Utah, 1200-1300 AD, ceramic, paint - Natural History Museum of Utah - DSC07407.JPG|alt1=A color picture of a black-on-white pottery vessel|caption1=Mesa Verde black-on-white|image2=Mesa Verde Pueblo II corrugated jars.jpg|alt2=A black and white picture of several large ceramic vessels|caption2=Mesa Verde corrugated jars}}\nScholars are divided as to whether pottery was invented in the Four Corners region or introduced from the south. Specimens of shallow, unfired clay bowls found at [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]] indicate the innovation might have been derived from using clay bowls to parch seeds. Repeated uses rendered these bowls hard and impervious to water, which might represent the first fired pottery in the region. An alternate theory suggests that pottery originated in the [[Mogollon Rim]] area to the south, where brown-paste bowls were used during the first few centuries of the [[common era]].{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=101}} Others believe pottery was introduced to Mesa Verde from Mexico, {{circa|300}} CE.{{sfn|Lang|2006|p=61}} There is no evidence of ancient pottery markets in the region, but archaeologists believe that local potters exchanged decorative wares between families. Cooking pots made with crushed [[igneous rock]] [[Ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Tempers|tempers]] from places like [[Ute Mountain]] were more resilient and desirable, and Puebloans from throughout the region traded for them.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=104\u201306}}\n\n[[Neutron activation analysis]] indicates that much of the black-on-white pottery found at Mesa Verde was produced locally. [[Cretaceous]] clays from both the [[Dakota Formation|Dakota]] and [[Menefee Formation]]s were used in black-on-white wares, and Mancos Formation clays for corrugated jars.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|pp=231, 234, 237}}{{efn|Mancos shale was the most commonly used clay in the region, particularly for non-decorated gray wares.{{sfn|Lang|2006|p=61}}}} Evidence that pottery of both types moved between several locations around the region suggests interaction between groups of ancient potters, or they might have shared a common source of raw materials.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|pp=231, 234, 237}} The Mesa Verde black-on-white pottery was produced at three locations: Sand Canyon, Castle Rock, and Mesa Verde.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=238}} Archeological evidence indicates that nearly every household had at least one member who worked as a potter. Trench kilns were constructed away from pueblos and closer to sources of firewood. Their sizes vary, but the larger ones were up to {{convert|24|feet}} long and thought to have been shared kilns that served several families. Designs were added to ceramic vessels with a Yucca-leaf brush and paints made from iron, [[manganese]], [[Cleome|beeplant]], and tansy mustard.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=103\u201305}}\n\nMost of the pottery found in 9th century pueblos was sized for individuals or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast\u2013sized vessels were produced.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=106}} Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that was easier to hold on to than regular gray wares, which were smooth.{{sfn|Lang|2006|p=62}} By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=103}} Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|pp=106\u201307}} Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles.{{sfn|Glowacki|Neff|Glascock|1998|p=238}} Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.{{sfn|Ortman|2006|p=103}}\n\n====Rock art and murals====\n[[File:Petroglyph Point at Mesa Verde National Park by RO.JPG|right|thumb|alt=A color picture of some petroglyphs on a tan sandstone cliff face|Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point; the glyphs represent (top; from right to left) the Eagle, Mountain Sheep, Parrot, Horned Toad, and Mountain Lion clans, and the Ancestral Puebloans (bottom).{{sfn|National Park Service|1986|pp=10\u201311}}]]\nRock art is found throughout the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s in the rock art of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes.{{sfn|Hurst|Till|2006|p=81}} As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes.{{sfn|Kuckelman|2006|p=132}} Modern Hopi have interpreted the [[petroglyph]]s at Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people.{{sfn|National Park Service|1986|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nStarting during the late Pueblo II period (1020) and continuing through Pueblo III (1300), the Ancestral Puebloans of the Mesa Verde region created plaster [[mural]]s in their great houses, particularly in their kivas. The murals contained both painted and inscribed images depicting animals, people, and designs used in textiles and pottery dating back as far as Basketmaker III, {{circa|500}}. Others depict triangles and mounds thought to represent mountains and hills in the surrounding landscape. The murals were typically located on the face of the kiva bench and usually encircled the room. Geometric patterns that resemble symbols used in pottery and zigzag that represent stitches used in basket making are common motifs. The painted murals include the colors red, green, yellow, white, brown, and blue. The designs were still in use by the Hopi during the 15th and 16th centuries.{{sfn|Cole|2006|pp=93\u201398}}\n\n==Climate==\n\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Mesa Verde National Park has a Warm Summer [[Humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'').

This resulted in Mesa Verde National Park elevations ranging from about {{convert|6000|to|8572|ft|m}}, the highest elevation at Park Point.  The terrain in the park is now a transition zone between the low desert plateaus and the [[Rocky Mountains]].{{sfn|Wenger|1991|pp=9\u201313, 24}}\n\n==Geology==\nAlthough the area's first Spanish explorers named the feature ''Mesa Verde'', the term is a misnomer, as true mesas are almost perfectly flat. Because Mesa Verde is slanted to the south, the proper geological term is [[cuesta]], not mesa. The park is made up of several smaller cuestas located between canyons. Mesa Verde's slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area's cliff dwellings.{{sfn|National Park Service (h)}}\n\nIn the late Cretaceous Period, the [[Mancos Shale]] was deposited on top of the [[Dakota Sandstone]], which is the rock formation that can be found under much of Colorado. The beds of the Mancos Shale are \"fine-grained sand-stones, mudstones, and shales\" which accumulated in the deep water of the Cretaceous Sea. It has a high clay content which causes it to expand when wet leading to sliding of the terrain. On top of this shale, there are three formations in the Mesaverde group which reflect the changes in depositional environment in the area over time. The first is the [[Point Lookout Sandstone]], which is named for the Point Lookout feature in the park (elevation 8427 feet). This sandstone, which formed in the marine environment of shallow water when the Cretaceous sea was receding, is \"massive, fine-grained, cross-bedded, and very resistant\", in its layers reflecting waves and currents that were present during the time of its formation. Its sediments are approximately 400 feet thick, and its upper layers feature fossiliferous invertebrates.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91\u2013102}}\n\nNext is the Menefee Formation, the middle formation whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional environment and the organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91\u2013102}}\n\nThe Cliff House Sandstone is the area's youngest rock layer. It was formed after the Cretaceous sea had completely receded and as a result has a high sand content from beaches, dunes, etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces. Like the Point Lookout Sandstone, it is about 400 feet thick. It contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells, fish teeth, and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea. The shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the Ancestral Puebloans constructed their dwellings.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91\u2013102}}\n\nContinuing through the Cretaceous period and into the early [[Tertiary]], there was uplifting in the area of the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the [[La Plata Mountains]], which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed.{{sfn|Harris|Tuttle|Tuttle|2004|pp=91\u2013102}}\n\n==Rediscovery==\n[[File:SpruceTreeHouse.JPG|left|thumb|Spruce Tree House]]\nMexican-Spanish missionaries and explorers [[Dominguez\u2013Escalante Expedition|Francisco Atanasio Dom\u00ednguez and Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]], seeking a route from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] to California, faithfully recorded their travels in 1776.

After there had become an interest in land in western Colorado, a new treaty in 1873 left the Ute with a strip of land in southwestern Colorado between the border with New Mexico and 15 miles north.  Most of Mesa Verde lies within this strip of land. The Ute wintered in the warm, deep canyons and found sanctuary there and the high plateaus of Mesa Verde. Believing the cliff dwellings to be sacred ancestral sites, they did not live in the ancient dwellings.{{sfn|Wenger|1991|p=77}}\n\nOccasional trappers and prospectors visited, with one prospector, John Moss, making his observations known in 1873.{{sfn|Reynolds|Reynolds|2006|p=}} The following year, Moss led eminent photographer [[William Henry Jackson]] through Mancos Canyon, at the base of Mesa Verde.

In a report to the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], [[Smithsonian Institution]] Ethnologist [[Jesse Walter Fewkes]] described vandalism at Mesa Verde's Cliff Palace:\n{{Quote|Parties of \"curio seekers\" camped on the ruin for several winters, and it is reported that many hundred specimens there have been carried down the mesa and sold to private individuals. Some of these objects are now in museums, but many are forever lost to science. In order to secure this valuable archaeological material, walls were broken down&nbsp;... often simply to let light into the darker rooms; floors were invariably opened and buried kivas mutilated. To facilitate this work and get rid of the dust, great openings were broken through the five walls which form the front of the ruin. Beams were used for firewood to so great an extent that not a single roof now remains. This work of destruction, added to that resulting from erosion due to rain, left Cliff Palace in a sad condition.<ref>[[United States Department of the Interior]], pp. 486-487, 503.</ref>}}\n\nMany artifacts from Mesa Verde are now located in museums and private collections in the US and across the world.

Conflicts over who laid claim to the land surrounding the ruins came to fruition in 1911, when the US government wanted to secure more land for the park that was owned by the Ute Indians. The Utes were reluctant to agree to the land swap proposed by the government, noting that the land they were seeking was the best land the tribe owned. Frederick Abbott, working with Indian Office official James McLaughlin, proclaimed to be an ally to the Ute in negotiations. Abbott later claimed that the \"government was stronger than the Utes,\" saying that when the government finds \"old ruins on land that it wants to take for public purposes, it has the right to take it ...\" Feeling they were left with no other options, the Utes reluctantly agreed to trade the 10,000 acres on Chapin Mesa for 19,500 acres on Ute Mountain.\n\nThe Utes continued to battle the Bureau of Indian Affairs to prevent more Ute land from being incorporated into the park. In 1935, the BIA attempted to gain back some the land traded in 1911. Additionally, superintendent [[Jesse L. Nusbaum]] later confessed that the Ute Mountain land traded for Chapin Mesa in 1911 belonged to the tribe anyway, meaning the government had traded land that never belonged to them in the first place.{{sfn|Keller|1998|pp=30\u201342}}\n\nOther issues unrelated to land disputes emerged as a result of park activities. In the 1920s, the park began offering \"Indian ceremony\" performances that gained popularity among visiting tourists; however, the ceremonies did not actually reflect the rites of the Ancient Puebloans who lived in the cliff dwellings nor the rites of the modern Ute. Navajo day laborers performed these rituals, resulting in \"the wrong Indians doing the wrong dance on ... the wrong land.\" In addition to the inaccuracy of the ceremonies, a question of whether Navajo dancers were paid fairly also resulted in questions regarding the lack of local American Indians being employed in other capacities in the park. Additionally, the park offered little financial benefits to the Ute Mountain Ute despite their land swap making much of the park possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indian Country, God's Country: Native Americans and the National Parks|last=Burnham|first=Philip|publisher=Island Press|year=2000|isbn=155963667X|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=62\u201366}}</ref>\n\n===Services===\n[[File:Mesa Verde park ranger.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A color picture of a man wearing a green and brown National Park Service uniform|Park Ranger leading a tour at Mesa Verde National Park]]\nThe entrance to Mesa Verde National Park is on [[U.S. Route 160]], approximately {{convert|9|mi}} east of the community of [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]] and {{convert|7|mi}} west of Mancos, Colorado.<ref name=NPS-TripPlanner/> The park covers {{convert|52485|acre}}<ref name=\"area\">{{NPS area|year=2011|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref> It contains 4,372 documented sites, including more than 600 cliff dwellings.<ref>{{harvnb|Cordell|Van West|Dean|Muenchrath|2007|p=380}}: 4,372 documented sites; {{harvnb|Nordby|2006|p=111}}: 600 cliff dwellings.</ref> It is the largest archaeological preserve in the US.<ref name=aramark/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-5-places-to-learn-on-vacation-pueblo-colorado,0,758178.photo |title=Archeological adventure|work=Chicago Tribune|date= |accessdate=June 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928063432/http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-5-places-to-learn-on-vacation-pueblo-colorado,0,758178.photo |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> It protects some of the most important and best-preserved archaeological sites in the country.{{sfn|National Park Service (a)}} The park initiated the Archaeological Site Conservation Program in 1995.

The Tashkent University of Information Technologies was founded as the Tashkent Electro Technical Institute of Communication in 1955 and it was the major and only producer of communication engineers for the Central Asian region. Today, it is one of the major universities to nurture [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] talent in Uzbekistan. The university was named after [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarizmi]] by a presidential resolution to further boost its role within the nation and abroad.<ref name=\"tuit-renamed\">{{cite web|url=https://www.uzdaily.com/articles-id-38716.htm|title=TUIT named after Al-Khwarizmi|accessdate=16 March 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Tashkent University of Information Technology.jpg|thumbnail|Tashkent University of Information Technology]]\n\n==History==\nAt the beginning, the institute was situated on the territory of the [[Tashkent Communication Polytechnic]] founded in 1930 (nowadays the Tashkent Vocational College of Communication) and was functioning there until the beginning of the academic year 1961\u20131962. The duties of the head (rector) of the institute were temporarily entrusted to N. B. Matskevich, chief of the Technical School of Communication. In the first academic year, 150 students were admitted to the University only on one specialization: telephone and telegraph communication. So the telephone and telegraph communication (TTC) faculty and four united departments were established. The first graduation of engineers took place in 1960.\n\nIn the academic year of 1957\u201358 the radio and broadcasting faculty (RBF) was opened and the institute began training radio and broadcasting engineers. In 1957 general-technical departments were established to train students in such specializations as telephony, telegraphy, communication lines, telecommunication, and power supply of communication enterprises. Since 1960 such departments as theoretical fundamentals of radio engineering; radio receivers; radio transmitters; broadcasting and television and some others were established.\n\nSince the academic year of 1964\u201365 on the base of TTC faculty the institute began to train students in two specializations: automatic telecommunication and multi-channel telecommunication. The TTC faculty was renamed the Automatic and Multi-Channel Telecommunication faculty (AMCTCF). In academic year 1969\u20131970 two independent faculties \u2013 Automatic Telecommunication (ATC) and Multi-Channel Telecommunication (MCTC) \u2013 were established. Since academic year 1964\u201365 some existing departments were reorganized or new ones established: the theory of linear electric network; the theory of signal transmission and the theory of nonlinear electric network; technical electrodynamics and antenna-feeder devices; measurements in communication engineering; automatic telecommunication; multi-channel telecommunication; transmission of discrete messages and telegraphy, etc.\n\nIn 1957, the institute opened night and correspondence departments with the following specializations: telephone and telegraph communication; radio and broadcasting. Since 1968 the institute has been paying particular attention to training working students \u2014 they  introduced a new position of pro-rector for the night and correspondence departments.\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s, the admittance of students to the daytime department was 400\u2013450 persons; to the night and correspondence departments was 300 persons. Toward the second half of the 1970s, the number of daytime students came to 2000\u20132500 persons and night and correspondence students came to about 2000.\n\nSince the end of the 1950s, some special departments began scientific researches on the basis of economic contracts. For example, the communication lines department made research to determine the specific electro-conductivity of the ground in Central Asia, the department of theoretical fundamentals of radio engineering investigated magnetostrictive sifters. The first research laboratories with independent staff of research officers were established at that time.\n\nIn the 1970s the institute reached the level of training engineers with education quality, which wasn't inferior to other graduates of the same institutes established earlier. The institute became one of the prestigious educational institutions of the Republic with rather big scientific potential and a large number of lecturers with academic status and degrees. At that time the institute began to carry out big state budget and contract researches on developing new means of communication and new ways of signal transmitting, receiving and handling. At the same time the institute researched other adjacent spheres of national economy.\n\nIn 1991 the university opened a post-graduate course on two specialties and a special academic council on defending PhD theses started. Nowadays this post-graduate course prepares highly qualified specialists in five professions.\n\nSince 1993 a special military faculty has been functioning at the university. This faculty prepares communication officers mainly for troops of the Ministry of Defense and other power structures of the Republic Uzbekistan.\n\nSince 1996 the [[Central-Asian]] Telecommunication Training Center for raising the level of engineers' skills has been functioning at the University. This Center uses the grant TASIS TEMPUS under the program of the [[European Union]] Commission. About 100 lecturers and post-graduates raised the level of their skills in training centers of Belgium and Greece under this program. At the University there is also a Center for training women in information and telecommunication technologies established by the Trade and Development Agency and, besides that, there are courses under the [[CISCO]] program (US). All the preparations are being made to organize the joint [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]]\u2013[[India]]n Training Center of Information Technologies. The University has established close friendly and business relationships with many relative higher education institutions of the world.\n\nTwo lyceums are functioning under the patronage of the University: Boarding School Lyceum and Academic Lyceum, each of them trains about 200,250 students. The classrooms of the lyceums are equipped with sufficient computers, including computers connected to the Internet. The library fund of the university has over 300,000 books and it is constantly increasing and renovating. There is also an electronic library connected to the local network of the university and to the Internet.\n\nThe university has a house of students for 700 persons, which has all necessary conditions for living, relaxation and sports. According to the president's decree dated 30 May 2002, the [[Tashkent]] Electro Technical Institute of Communication was reorganized into the Tashkent University of Information Technologies. The teaching staff got the instruction to fulfill their duties more properly and raise the level of education of Bachelors and Masters in information and computer technologies including information security and electronic commerce.\n\nThe Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministry of the Republic dated 2 June 2005 \"About development of the staff training system in the sphere of information technologies\" determined the Tashkent University of Information Technologies as the main educational institution preparing specialists in the sphere of information and communication technologies. There has been made a decision to open regional branches of the University in Nukus, Karshi, Samarkand, Fergana and Urgench.\n\n==Faculties==\nThe university trains Bachelors in 11 directions of education and Masters in 13 specialties.

Central Asia's first (and only) Oriental higher-educational institute, the school began preparing qualified specialists in a number of branches of Oriental studies for Turkestan and neighboring countries. Subjects included [[ethnography]], [[geography]], study of local lore, the [[history]] and [[economy]] of Turkestan and neighboring Oriental countries, [[History of Islam|Islamic history]] and [[Sharia|law]], and eastern languages and literature. Two hundred thirty-four students were accepted in 1918. They were taught [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Pashto|Pushtu]], [[Urdu]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]]; local languages ([[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Tajik language|Tadzhik]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kirghiz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Tatars|Tatar]]), and European languages ([[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]). Other subjects were the [[geography of Afghanistan]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Xinjiang|East and West Turkestan]] and [[Bukhara]]; [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]], [[Persian people|Persian]], [[Tajiks|Tadzhik]], [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]], [[Afghan]] and [[Karakalpaks|Karakalpak]] ethnography, and Central Asian, [[Iran]]ian, [[Afghanistan|Afghan]], [[India]]n and [[ancient history]].\n\nThird-year students were taught specialized subjects, including Turkestan languages, Iranian and Arab philology, and Islamic studies. The institute prepared language and history teachers for local schools. It had 5,300 books and over 200 manuscripts by 1922. The first dean of the Oriental faculty was A. Y. Shmidt.\n\nIt was attached to the [[National University of Uzbekistan]] in accordance with Resolution No. 186 of the Cabinet Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan in July 1991, and was named on the basis of a 26 July 1991 resolution by the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education.\n[[File:The main builting of TSIOS.jpg|thumb|alt=Main entrance, with signs in English and Uzbek|The institute's main building]]\n\n== {{anchor|Faculties}}Faculties and chairs ==\nThe institute has five [[Faculty (division)|faculties]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Faculty of Oriental Philology|Departments of faculty|Chairs of the Faculty of Oriental Philology}}Oriental philology ===\n\nThe faculty was founded for Oriental philology and history by [[Rector (academia)|rector]] orders K/05-36 (24 August 2000) and 01-142 (30 June 2011).

Subjects included [[ethnography]], [[geography]], study of local lore, the [[history]] and [[economy]] of Turkestan and neighboring Oriental countries, [[History of Islam|Islamic history]] and [[Sharia|law]], and eastern languages and literature. Two hundred thirty-four students were accepted in 1918. They were taught [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Pashto|Pushtu]], [[Urdu]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]]; local languages ([[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Tajik language|Tadzhik]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kirghiz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Tatars|Tatar]]), and European languages ([[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]). Other subjects were the [[geography of Afghanistan]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Xinjiang|East and West Turkestan]] and [[Bukhara]]; [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]], [[Persian people|Persian]], [[Tajiks|Tadzhik]], [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]], [[Afghan]] and [[Karakalpaks|Karakalpak]] ethnography, and Central Asian, [[Iran]]ian, [[Afghanistan|Afghan]], [[India]]n and [[ancient history]].\n\nThird-year students were taught specialized subjects, including Turkestan languages, Iranian and Arab philology, and Islamic studies. The institute prepared language and history teachers for local schools. It had 5,300 books and over 200 manuscripts by 1922. The first dean of the Oriental faculty was A. Y. Shmidt.\n\nIt was attached to the [[National University of Uzbekistan]] in accordance with Resolution No. 186 of the Cabinet Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan in July 1991, and was named on the basis of a 26 July 1991 resolution by the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education.\n[[File:The main builting of TSIOS.jpg|thumb|alt=Main entrance, with signs in English and Uzbek|The institute's main building]]\n\n== {{anchor|Faculties}}Faculties and chairs ==\nThe institute has five [[Faculty (division)|faculties]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Faculty of Oriental Philology|Departments of faculty|Chairs of the Faculty of Oriental Philology}}Oriental philology ===\n\nThe faculty was founded for Oriental philology and history by [[Rector (academia)|rector]] orders K/05-36 (24 August 2000) and 01-142 (30 June 2011).
