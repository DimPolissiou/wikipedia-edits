In more scientific terms, there is overshoot when the [[ecological footprint]] of a human population in a geographical area exceeds that place's [[carrying capacity]], damaging the environment faster than it can be repaired by nature, potentially leading to an [[ecological collapse|ecological]] and [[societal collapse]].

Food production further increased with the [[industrial revolution]] as machinery, [[fertilizer]]s, [[herbicide]]s, and [[pesticide]]s were used to increase land under cultivation as well as crop yields.

Most human populations throughout history validate this theory, as does the overall current global population. Populations of [[hunter-gatherer]]s fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food. The world human population began increasing after the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and its increased food supply.<ref>GJ Armelagos, AH Goodman, KH Jacobs Population and environment - 1991 link.springer.com</ref> This was, subsequent to the [[Green Revolution]], followed by even more severely accelerated population growth, which continues today. Often, wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities; however, proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run. Peter Farb, for example, has commented on the paradox that \"intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population.\"<ref>Farb, Peter: 1978, ''Humankind''. Boston, Houghton Mifflin.</ref> Daniel Quinn has also focused on this phenomenon, which he calls the \"[[Food Race]]\" (comparable, in terms of both escalation and potential catastrophe, to the [[nuclear arms race]]).\n\nCritics of this theory point out that, in the modern era, birth rates are lowest in the [[developed nation]]s, which also have the highest access to food. In fact, some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply. The United Nations projects that the population of 51 countries or areas, including Germany, Italy, Japan, and most of the states of the former Soviet Union, is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005.<ref>Rosa, Daniele (2019). \"[http://www.affaritaliani.it/nel-2050-gli-italiani-saranno-20-milioni-meno-secondo-l-onu-612218.html Nel 2050 gli italiani saranno 20 milioni meno secondo l'Onu &#91;Translation: ''In 2050 the Italians will be 20 million less, according to the UN''&#93;]\".

However, the global population as a whole still grows in accordance with the total food supply and many of these wealthier countries are major ''exporters'' of food to poorer populations, so that, \"it is through exports from food-rich to food-poor areas (Allaby, 1984; Pimentel et al., 1999) that the population growth in these food-poor areas is further fueled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/bystrc/pub/pimentel.pdf|title=Human population numbers as a function of food supply|work=Russel Hopfenburg, David Pimentel, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA;2Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA}}\n</ref>\n\nRegardless of criticisms against the theory that population is a function of food availability, the [[world population|human population]] is, on the global scale, undeniably increasing,<ref>[[Daniel Quinn]] (1996).

The depletion of these trophic levels allow the lower trophic level to overpopulate, or populate very rapidly. For example, when the population of catfish is depleting due to overfishing, plankton will then overpopulate because their natural predator is being killed off. This causes an issue called eutrophication. Since the population all consumes oxygen the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels will plummet. The DO levels dropping will cause all the species in that area to have to leave, or they will suffocate.

With the global population at about 7.5 billion, and each human theoretically needing 2 liters of drinking water, there is a demand for 15 billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living (United). Weather patterns, elevation, and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water. Without clean water, good health is not a viable option. Besides drinking, water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life. In addition to drinking water, water is also used for bathing, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets, a variety of cleaning methods, recreation, watering lawns, and farm irrigation.\nIrrigation poses one of the largest problems, because without sufficient water to irrigate crops, the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation. In addition to water needed for crops and food, there is limited land area dedicated to food production, and not much more that is suitable to be added. Arable land, needed to sustain the growing population, is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply. There are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population (Bashford 240). Access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth. No increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict. Only 38% of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture, and there is not room for much more. Although plants produce 54 billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year, when the population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, the plants may not be able to keep up (Biello). Food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded. By trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land, the soil becomes exhausted. Because the soil is exhausted, it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before, and is overall less productive. Therefore, by using resources beyond a sustainable level, the resource become nullified and ineffective, which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource. There must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles.\n<ref>Bashford, Alison. \"Population, Geopolitics, and International Organizations in the Mid Twentieth Century.\" Journal of World History 19.3 (2008): 327\u2013347.

Modern usage of the term [[Lebensraum#Modern usage|\"lebensraum\"]] supports the idea that overpopulation may promote warfare through fear of resource scarcity and increasing numbers of youth lacking the opportunity to engage in peaceful employment (the [[War#Youth bulge|youth bulge theory]]).\n\n====Criticism of this hypothesis====\nThe [[hypothesis]] that population pressure causes increased [[warfare]] has been recently criticized on statistical grounds. Two studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. [[Andrey Korotayev]], in collaboration with [[Peter Turchin]], has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.<ref name=t1>{{cite journal|vauthors=Turchin P, Korotayev A|url=https://www.academia.edu/41550406|title=Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration|journal=[[Social Evolution & History]]|volume=5|issue=2|date=2006|pages=112\u2013147}}</ref>\n\nPopulation and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, and the [[Roman Empire]]. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks).\n\nFurthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.<ref name=t1/><ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Korotayev A, Malkov A, Khaltourina D|url=http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?lang=en&blang=en&page=Book&id=37484|title=Introduction to Social Macrodynamics.

The latter factor stems from the fact that children [[child labor|perform a great deal of work]] in small-scale agricultural societies, and work less in industrial ones; it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions.\n\nMany countries have high population growth rates but lower [[total fertility rate]]s because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age, so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity.\n\"Demographic entrapment\" is a concept developed by Maurice King, Honorary Research Fellow at the [[University of Leeds]], who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its [[carrying capacity]], no possibility of migration, and exports too little to be able to import food.

Some solutions are to be applied on a global planetary level (e.g., via [[United Nations|UN]] resolutions), while some on a country or state government organization level, and some on a family or an individual level. Some of the proposed mitigations aim to help implement new social, cultural, behavioral and political norms to replace or significantly modify current norms.\n\nFor example, in societies like China, the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple. Other societies have implemented social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects. \"The intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost. A variety of print materials (flyers, brochures, fact sheets, stickers) needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship, sporting events, local food markets, schools and at car parks (taxis / bus stands).\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.community.peacecorpsconnect.org/view/514/utilizing-social-marking-and-social-norms-to-addresss-problems-in-the-gambia |title=Utilizing social marketing and social norms to address problems in gambia |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=12 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSuch prompts work to introduce the problem so that new or modified social norms are easier to implement. Certain government policies are making it easier and more socially acceptable to use contraception and abortion methods.

As such proponents of dense city life as a solution can be seen to be ignoring the intrinsic web of connections that allow a densely populated city to exist.  The pollution levels in the world's most dense cities alone can be seen to be self-evident of the amount of environmental destruction that densely populated cities cause.\n\nPaul Ehrlich pointed out in his book \"The Population Bomb\" (1968) and in \"The Annhilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals\" (2015) that dense cities create severely toxic environments, especially through the pollution of water sources.  Cities and their expansion are also harmful to migrating birds and other species, which face the threat of starvation due to the clearing of their natural habitat for human habitation.\n\nIt may be that the rhetoric supporting city densification is a means of avoiding dealing with the actual problem of over population to begin with and rather than treating city densification as a symptom of the root problem, it has been promoted by the same interests that have profited from population increase e.g. property developers, the banking system, which invests in property development, industry, municipal councils <ref>Ehrlic, Population Bomb 1968 p.152-p.53</ref> seeking to increase their tax base and governments seeking permanent economic growth and expansion at any cost disregarding the impact it might have on the environment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/03/05/news/david-suzuki-fires-death-zone-trudeau-weaver-and-broken-system|title=David Suzuki fires off from the 'death zone' at Trudeau, Weaver and a broken system|date=March 5, 2018|website=National Observer|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Graph gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Afghanistanpop.svg | [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] shows a classic youth bulge.\nImage:Angola population pyramid 2005.png | [[Demographics of Angola|Angola]] shows the same, even more pronounced.\nImage:China population pyramid 2005.png| [[Demographics of the People's Republic of China|China]] had an extreme youth bulge until the 1960s, when it sharply curbed partly as an effect of the [[one-child policy]].\nImage:Uspop.svg | Compare the population pyramid of the USA which was bulging until the 1960s and has steadily slimmed since.\nFile:LibyaPopulation2011.jpg|A population pyramid based on the 2011 Libyan population.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Accelerating change]] (population growth is a factor)\n* [[Antinatalism]]\n* [[Behavioral sink]], a rat over-population experiment\n* [[Demographic trap]]\n* [[Demographics of the world]]\n* [[Earth system science]]\n* [[Ethnic bioweapon]]\n* [[Eugenics]]\n* [[Fertility and intelligence]]\n* [[Gaia hypothesis]]\n* [[Global catastrophic risk]]\n* [[Global issue]]\n* [[Human migration]]\n* [[Human population planning]]\n* [[Malthusianism]]\n* [[Malthusian trap]]\n* [[Overexploitation]]\n* [[Overshoot (population)]]\n* [[People smuggling]]\n* [[Planetary boundaries]]\n* [[Population ageing]]\n* [[Reserve army of labour]]\n* [[Societal collapse]]\n* [[Tragedy of the commons]]\n* [[Urbanization]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prb.org/urbanization-an-environmental-force-to-be-reckoned-with/|title=Urbanization: An Environmental Force to be Reckoned With}}</ref>\n* [[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]]\n\n===Lists===\n* [[List of countries and dependencies by population]]\n* [[List of organisations campaigning for population stabilisation]]\n* [[List of people who have expressed views relating to overpopulation as a problem]]\n* [[List of population concern organizations]]\n\n===In documentary and art films===\n* ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]''\n* ''[[What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire]]''\n\n===In fiction===\n* [[:Category:Overpopulation fiction|Overpopulation fiction (category)]]\n\n===Other===\n* [[Overpopulation in domestic pets]]\n* [[Political demography]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* Michael E.

Most human populations throughout history validate this theory, as does the overall current global population. Populations of [[hunter-gatherer]]s fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food. The world human population began increasing after the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and its increased food supply.<ref>GJ Armelagos, AH Goodman, KH Jacobs Population and environment - 1991 link.springer.com</ref> This was, subsequent to the [[Green Revolution]], followed by even more severely accelerated population growth, which continues today. Often, wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities; however, proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run. Peter Farb, for example, has commented on the paradox that \"intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population.\"<ref>Farb, Peter: 1978, ''Humankind''.

The depletion of these trophic levels allow the lower trophic level to overpopulate, or populate very rapidly. For example, when the population of catfish is depleting due to overfishing, plankton will then overpopulate because their natural predator is being killed off. This causes an issue called eutrophication. Since the population all consumes oxygen the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels will plummet. The DO levels dropping will cause all the species in that area to have to leave, or they will suffocate. This along with climate change, and ocean acidification can cause the collapse of an ecosystem.\n\n===Depletion and destruction of resources===\n[[File:World energy consumption, 1970-2025, EIA.png|thumb|World energy consumption and predictions, 1970\u20132025.]]\nFurther environmental impacts that overpopulation may cause include [[depletion of natural resources]], especially [[fossil fuels]].<ref>Hubbert, M.K.

With the global population at about 7.5 billion, and each human theoretically needing 2 liters of drinking water, there is a demand for 15 billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living (United). Weather patterns, elevation, and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water. Without clean water, good health is not a viable option. Besides drinking, water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life. In addition to drinking water, water is also used for bathing, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets, a variety of cleaning methods, recreation, watering lawns, and farm irrigation.\nIrrigation poses one of the largest problems, because without sufficient water to irrigate crops, the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation. In addition to water needed for crops and food, there is limited land area dedicated to food production, and not much more that is suitable to be added. Arable land, needed to sustain the growing population, is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply. There are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population (Bashford 240). Access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth. No increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict. Only 38% of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture, and there is not room for much more. Although plants produce 54 billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year, when the population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, the plants may not be able to keep up (Biello). Food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded. By trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land, the soil becomes exhausted. Because the soil is exhausted, it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before, and is overall less productive. Therefore, by using resources beyond a sustainable level, the resource become nullified and ineffective, which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource. There must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles.\n<ref>Bashford, Alison. \"Population, Geopolitics, and International Organizations in the Mid Twentieth Century.\" Journal of World History 19.3 (2008): 327\u2013347.

This leads to somewhat lower costs in places like Beijing, [[Bangkok]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and, of course, coastal cities like [[Tripoli]].\" Thus while the study is generally positive about the technology for affluent areas that are proximate to oceans, it concludes that \"Desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions, but not for places that are poor, deep in the interior of a continent, or at high elevation.

Modern usage of the term [[Lebensraum#Modern usage|\"lebensraum\"]] supports the idea that overpopulation may promote warfare through fear of resource scarcity and increasing numbers of youth lacking the opportunity to engage in peaceful employment (the [[War#Youth bulge|youth bulge theory]]).\n\n====Criticism of this hypothesis====\nThe [[hypothesis]] that population pressure causes increased [[warfare]] has been recently criticized on statistical grounds. Two studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. [[Andrey Korotayev]], in collaboration with [[Peter Turchin]], has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.<ref name=t1>{{cite journal|vauthors=Turchin P, Korotayev A|url=https://www.academia.edu/41550406|title=Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration|journal=[[Social Evolution & History]]|volume=5|issue=2|date=2006|pages=112\u2013147}}</ref>\n\nPopulation and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, and the [[Roman Empire]]. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks).\n\nFurthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.<ref name=t1/><ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Korotayev A, Malkov A, Khaltourina D|url=http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?lang=en&blang=en&page=Book&id=37484|title=Introduction to Social Macrodynamics.

The latter factor stems from the fact that children [[child labor|perform a great deal of work]] in small-scale agricultural societies, and work less in industrial ones; it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions.\n\nMany countries have high population growth rates but lower [[total fertility rate]]s because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age, so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity.\n\"Demographic entrapment\" is a concept developed by Maurice King, Honorary Research Fellow at the [[University of Leeds]], who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its [[carrying capacity]], no possibility of migration, and exports too little to be able to import food.

Some solutions are to be applied on a global planetary level (e.g., via [[United Nations|UN]] resolutions), while some on a country or state government organization level, and some on a family or an individual level. Some of the proposed mitigations aim to help implement new social, cultural, behavioral and political norms to replace or significantly modify current norms.\n\nFor example, in societies like China, the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple. Other societies have implemented social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects. \"The intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost. A variety of print materials (flyers, brochures, fact sheets, stickers) needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship, sporting events, local food markets, schools and at car parks (taxis / bus stands).\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.community.peacecorpsconnect.org/view/514/utilizing-social-marking-and-social-norms-to-addresss-problems-in-the-gambia |title=Utilizing social marketing and social norms to address problems in gambia |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=12 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSuch prompts work to introduce the problem so that new or modified social norms are easier to implement.

As such proponents of dense city life as a solution can be seen to be ignoring the intrinsic web of connections that allow a densely populated city to exist.  The pollution levels in the world's most dense cities alone can be seen to be self-evident of the amount of environmental destruction that densely populated cities cause.\n\nPaul Ehrlich pointed out in his book \"The Population Bomb\" (1968) and in \"The Annhilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals\" (2015) that dense cities create severely toxic environments, especially through the pollution of water sources.  Cities and their expansion are also harmful to migrating birds and other species, which face the threat of starvation due to the clearing of their natural habitat for human habitation.\n\nIt may be that the rhetoric supporting city densification is a means of avoiding dealing with the actual problem of over population to begin with and rather than treating city densification as a symptom of the root problem, it has been promoted by the same interests that have profited from population increase e.g. property developers, the banking system, which invests in property development, industry, municipal councils <ref>Ehrlic, Population Bomb 1968 p.152-p.53</ref> seeking to increase their tax base and governments seeking permanent economic growth and expansion at any cost disregarding the impact it might have on the environment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/03/05/news/david-suzuki-fires-death-zone-trudeau-weaver-and-broken-system|title=David Suzuki fires off from the 'death zone' at Trudeau, Weaver and a broken system|date=March 5, 2018|website=National Observer|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Graph gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Afghanistanpop.svg | [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] shows a classic youth bulge.\nImage:Angola population pyramid 2005.png | [[Demographics of Angola|Angola]] shows the same, even more pronounced.\nImage:China population pyramid 2005.png| [[Demographics of the People's Republic of China|China]] had an extreme youth bulge until the 1960s, when it sharply curbed partly as an effect of the [[one-child policy]].\nImage:Uspop.svg | Compare the population pyramid of the USA which was bulging until the 1960s and has steadily slimmed since.\nFile:LibyaPopulation2011.jpg|A population pyramid based on the 2011 Libyan population.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Accelerating change]] (population growth is a factor)\n* [[Antinatalism]]\n* [[Behavioral sink]], a rat over-population experiment\n* [[Demographic trap]]\n* [[Demographics of the world]]\n* [[Earth system science]]\n* [[Ethnic bioweapon]]\n* [[Eugenics]]\n* [[Fertility and intelligence]]\n* [[Gaia hypothesis]]\n* [[Global catastrophic risk]]\n* [[Global issue]]\n* [[Human migration]]\n* [[Human population planning]]\n* [[Malthusianism]]\n* [[Malthusian trap]]\n* [[Overexploitation]]\n* [[Overshoot (population)]]\n* [[People smuggling]]\n* [[Planetary boundaries]]\n* [[Population ageing]]\n* [[Reserve army of labour]]\n* [[Societal collapse]]\n* [[Tragedy of the commons]]\n* [[Urbanization]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prb.org/urbanization-an-environmental-force-to-be-reckoned-with/|title=Urbanization: An Environmental Force to be Reckoned With}}</ref>\n* [[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]]\n\n===Lists===\n* [[List of countries and dependencies by population]]\n* [[List of organisations campaigning for population stabilisation]]\n* [[List of people who have expressed views relating to overpopulation as a problem]]\n* [[List of population concern organizations]]\n\n===In documentary and art films===\n* ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]''\n* ''[[What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire]]''\n\n===In fiction===\n* [[:Category:Overpopulation fiction|Overpopulation fiction (category)]]\n\n===Other===\n* [[Overpopulation in domestic pets]]\n* [[Political demography]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* Michael E.

[[Christian Potenza]] first announced the season in an interview with [[Tom McGillis]] (the creator of the series), saying that ''Total Drama All-Stars'' would be very similar to ''[[Total Drama Island]]'' and ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', due to the high worldwide ratings of the latter.<ref name=\"mcgillis.interview\" /> That means that this part of the season takes place back at Camp Wawanakwa; in a single location once again, unlike ''[[Total Drama World Tour]]''. This part is also very similar to the previous season, ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'' (both being very similar in terms of length, location, features and cameos).\n\nThis half is an [[all-star]] season which features a return of fourteen of the strongest contestants from both the first and second generation cast.<ref name=\"s5confirmed\" /><ref name=\"animation\">{{cite web|author=Ramin Zahed |url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/total-drama-all-stars-ready-to-shine-on-cn/ |title='Total Drama All-Stars' Ready to Shine on CN |publisher=Animation Magazine |date=August 8, 2013 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> This is the first season to feature characters from two different generations competing together.

At the end of the series, the winning contestant or the last camper to stand on the island will win [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1,000,000. The competition is hosted by Chris McLean ([[Christian Potenza]]), who is assisted by the camp's chef, Chef Hatchet ([[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]]).<ref name=\"tv\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/08/08/total-drama-all-stars-to-premiere-tuesday-september-10-on-cartoon-network/196401/ |title='Total Drama All-Stars' to Premiere Tuesday, September 10 on Cartoon Network - Ratings |publisher=TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com |date=August 8, 2013 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the competition, the fourteen campers are evenly placed into two teams which are themed to the genre of the competition. In each episode, the two teams participate in a challenge, in which one or more campers can win invincibility for their team. The losing team is called to the campfire at night, where they must vote one of their members off the island. The camper with the most votes is eliminated from the competition. At this campfire, McLean passes out marshmallows to the campers who have not been voted off, while the one who does not get a marshmallow is eliminated. That eliminated person must then walk to the island's dock and will be forced off of the island, and told to \"never, ever come back\", according to Chris.\n\nAbout halfway through the competition, the teams are disbanded, after which the challenges continue; the winner of each challenge then only receives invincibility for him or herself, whereupon a camper without invincibility is voted off the island. This process of elimination continues on until two players remains on the island. These two players, are now then subject to a final contest. At the end, a camper wins the competition, while the loser ends up being the runner-up. However, the runner-up is the winner in the other ending of the finale, as there are always two endings to ''[[Total Drama]]'' seasons. This season, along with every other season in the series, is a parody of the reality show ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' while the host, Chris McLean is very similar to ''Survivor'' host [[Jeff Probst]] with the evil persona of [[Fear Factor]]{{'s}} [[Joe Rogan]].<ref name = \"monitor\">{{Citation| author = Aaron Sagers| title = Pop 20: If Facebook were a dinner party| newspaper = The Monitor| issue =| page =| date = September 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island episodes}}\nThe first thirteen episodes is an all-star season using fourteen returning characters from the two previous seasons,<ref name=\"s5confirmed\" /> while the last thirteen episodes consist of a new cast introducing fourteen new characters.<ref name=\"teletoon\" /> Both halves are part of the 26 episodes that Cartoon Network ordered in 2012.<ref name=\"mipcom\">{{cite web|url=http://www.freshtvinc.com/blog/mipcom-news-with-tom-mcgillis|title=MIPCOM News with Tom McGillis|first=Julie|last=Giles|publisher=Freshtvinc.com |date=October 22, 2012|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref> Cartoon Network aired the whole season first starting on September 10, 2013 on Tuesdays at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] in the United States,<ref name=\"usaairdate\" /> with Teletoon airing the season later on January 9, 2014 at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.<ref name=\"tdascandate\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:orange\" rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! style=\"background:orange\" rowspan=\"2\"| Episodes\n! style=\"background:orange\" rowspan=\"2\"| Country\n! style=\"background:orange\" rowspan=\"2\"| Network\n! style=\"background:orange\" colspan=\"2\"| Ep. 1\u201313: ''Total Drama All-Stars''\n! style=\"background:orange\" colspan=\"2\"| Ep. 14\u201326: ''Total Drama Pahkitew Island''\n|-\n! style=\"background:orange\"| Part 1 premiere\n! style=\"background:orange\"| Part 1 finale\n! style=\"background:orange\"| Part 2 premiere\n! style=\"background:orange\"| Part 2 finale\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\"| 5<ref name=\"upfront\" />\n| rowspan=\"4\"| 26<ref name=\"s5fresh\" /><ref name=\"teletoon\" />\n| Australia\n| [[ABC3]]\n| December 12, 2013<ref name=\"abc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/abc3/shows/14898.htm |title=ABC3 - TV Program - Total Drama All Stars |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n| December 30, 2013\n| July 14, 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/abc3/shows/guide/201407/20140714.htm |title=ABC3 TV Shows |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=July 14, 2014 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n| October 6, 2014\n|-\n!

Mike's evil personality is a close reference to [[List of Yu-Gi-Oh! characters#Marik Ishtar / Yami Marik|Yami Marik]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', as both are evil split personalities who reside within a person and eventually take over their host, as well as undergoing a change in hairstyle and voice when assuming control. Mal's name and personality was also inspired by the character, Mal Cobb from the movie, ''[[Inception]].

He is a powerful manipulator. He is described as the villain with good looks. His ruthless, manipulative approach allowed him to plough through the third season and was the winner, however, his actions earned him huge karma and he didn't get to keep his winnings. His big brother and nemesis, Jos\u00e9, has the same personalities as Alejandro himself. Heather is also attracted to him, and vice versa. However, he was first introduced into the season as the Drama Machine, before he was later as Alejandro inside the robot suit. He received a new voice actor, [[Alex House]], in this new season, as his previous actor did not reprise the role for unexplained reasons.

She is a perfectionist who desires to be best at everything, and sees herself as a born leader. She believes in strictly following rules and sees herself as a good citizen, however her desire for success often clashes with her own principles. She can come off as being quite bossy and critical, which leads her to be disliked by many contestants. Her less likable side peaked in ''Total Drama Action'' where she served as the main antagonist. She formerly had a relationship with Duncan but broke up with him after three seasons, and later started a relationship with Scott, which ended in a matter of hours. Voiced by Emilie-Claire Barlow.\n*'''Duncan''' ''(labeled the \"Delinquent\")''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshtvinc.com/blog/total-drama-character-profiles-duncan/ |title=Total Drama Character Profiles - Duncan - Fresh TV |publisher=Freshtvinc.com |date=March 12, 2014 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> is a tough, hardened ex-convict fresh out of [[youth detention center|juvie]]. He spends most of his time trying to looks tough and mean, or pranking others, however deep down he has a huge heart (which he tries very hard to hide). However this season his secret deep is discovered, which results in him being placed on the heroes team. He had a relationship with Gwen through the first 5 episodes, until she broke up with him. Before that he was in a relationship with Courtney, and although they broke up in season 3, he tried to win her back over the course of All-Stars. Voiced by Drew Nelson.\n*'''Gwen''' ''(labeled the \"Loner\")''<ref name=\"tv\" /> is very into [[Goth subculture]] and is Duncan's girlfriend until they broke up.

While Lindsay is the prettiest one on the show and is spoilt silly by her father, she is kind-hearted and is able to make friends with almost everyone. However, her lack of intelligence often leads to her downfall, this season being no exception, where, despite being a fan favorite to make it far, she is the first to be eliminated.

She is a parody of real life Total Drama fans. She is obsessed with every member of the cast, especially Cody whom she has an obsessive crush on. However, due to being deprived of Cody for too long, this season she begins to lose her sanity and starts seeing everyone else as Cody, especially Cameron.

He is a highly-intelligent, but physically-weak boy who spent most of his early life trapped inside a bubble. Initially he was quite timid and cowardly, and was tormented by several bullies on the show, however, he later learns to stand up for himself and prevails against them all. He was the original winner for the previous season, ''Total Drama: Revenge of the Island''. This season, he is quite often mistaken as a previous contestant, Cody, when interacting with Sierra.

He is a super fit, [[National Football League|NFL]]-bound athlete and is one of the finalists of the previous season. However, Lightning is arrogant. He is always talking about himself, dimwitted, and he never supports anyone on his team. He always talks by adding \"sha-\" to the beginning of a word, which makes him annoying for other characters.

He is very mean, sneaky, and a liar who does whatever dirty deed it takes to win. His tactic in Total Drama: Revenge of the Island was to sabotage his own team without getting caught, which caused his teams to lose every single elimination challenge before the merge. He is somewhat of a bully to Cameron. People didn't realize that he was mean until the end of the series. Scott has a very large conflict with a mutated shark called Fang who constantly tries to brutally attack him any chance he gets for taking possession of one of Fang's shark teeth in Season 4. As a result, by the time of the Season 4 finale, Scott was hated and seen as a villain by every castmate including Chris. In Season 5, Scott returned as a member of the Villainous Vultures, serving as the comic relief of the season. He later gets into a relationship with Courtney, but soon ends it. He has orange hair, blue eyes, freckles, rosy cheeks, and long muscular arms. He wears a white tank top, long dark blue ankle-length pants, a dark grey belt with a silver buckle, and brown shoes.

In fact, he believes the world has already succumbed to a [[zombie apocalypse]] and signed up to ''Total Drama'' as he believed residing on an island would increase his chances of survival.

His character is a close reference to the main character of the movie, ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (with his name also mixed with ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]''), while his appearance and personality is similar to that of Jude Lizowski from ''[[6teen]]'' (another one of Fresh TV's shows).

Despite their similar looks, both sisters have very different personalities; one acts nice but is selfish in reality, while another is genuinely nice.

She was in love with the fact that in [[Total Drama World Tour]], everyone had to sing in every episode. She is despised by Sugar even though she doesn't know that she hates her. She had a crush on Dave after he helped her put her shoe back on her foot after it fell in the water after a challenge and said that was a true fairytale moment.

At the end of the series, the winning contestant or the last camper to stand on the island will win [[Canadian dollar|C$]]1,000,000. The competition is hosted by Chris McLean ([[Christian Potenza]]), who is assisted by the camp's chef, Chef Hatchet ([[Cl\u00e9 Bennett]]).<ref name=\"tv\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/08/08/total-drama-all-stars-to-premiere-tuesday-september-10-on-cartoon-network/196401/ |title='Total Drama All-Stars' to Premiere Tuesday, September 10 on Cartoon Network - Ratings |publisher=TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com |date=August 8, 2013 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the competition, the fourteen campers are evenly placed into two teams which are themed to the genre of the competition. In each episode, the two teams participate in a challenge, in which one or more campers can win invincibility for their team. The losing team is called to the campfire at night, where they must vote one of their members off the island. The camper with the most votes is eliminated from the competition. At this campfire, McLean passes out marshmallows to the campers who have not been voted off, while the one who does not get a marshmallow is eliminated. That eliminated person must then walk to the island's dock and will be forced off of the island, and told to \"never, ever come back\", according to Chris.\n\nAbout halfway through the competition, the teams are disbanded, after which the challenges continue; the winner of each challenge then only receives invincibility for him or herself, whereupon a camper without invincibility is voted off the island. This process of elimination continues on until two players remains on the island. These two players, are now then subject to a final contest.

Mike is the only character in the whole series to have multiple voices in the same season all with the same voice actor. The animators had to illustrate five different faces and personalities in the character's body, making Mike the most complicated and diverse character in the series. [[Cory Doran]] had to record six different types of voices for Mike. In ''Total Drama All-Stars'', the character Mike serves as the season's protagonist, while his evil alternate personality, Mal (short for \"The Malevolent One\"), serves as the main antagonist. Mike's evil personality is a close reference to [[List of Yu-Gi-Oh! characters#Marik Ishtar / Yami Marik|Yami Marik]] from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', as both are evil split personalities who reside within a person and eventually take over their host, as well as undergoing a change in hairstyle and voice when assuming control. Mal's name and personality was also inspired by the character, Mal Cobb from the movie, ''[[Inception]].

He is a powerful manipulator. He is described as the villain with good looks. His ruthless, manipulative approach allowed him to plough through the third season and was the winner, however, his actions earned him huge karma and he didn't get to keep his winnings. His big brother and nemesis, Jos\u00e9, has the same personalities as Alejandro himself. Heather is also attracted to him, and vice versa. However, he was first introduced into the season as the Drama Machine, before he was later as Alejandro inside the robot suit. He received a new voice actor, [[Alex House]], in this new season, as his previous actor did not reprise the role for unexplained reasons.

She is a perfectionist who desires to be best at everything, and sees herself as a born leader. She believes in strictly following rules and sees herself as a good citizen, however her desire for success often clashes with her own principles. She can come off as being quite bossy and critical, which leads her to be disliked by many contestants. Her less likable side peaked in ''Total Drama Action'' where she served as the main antagonist. She formerly had a relationship with Duncan but broke up with him after three seasons, and later started a relationship with Scott, which ended in a matter of hours. Voiced by Emilie-Claire Barlow.\n*'''Duncan''' ''(labeled the \"Delinquent\")''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshtvinc.com/blog/total-drama-character-profiles-duncan/ |title=Total Drama Character Profiles - Duncan - Fresh TV |publisher=Freshtvinc.com |date=March 12, 2014 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> is a tough, hardened ex-convict fresh out of [[youth detention center|juvie]]. He spends most of his time trying to looks tough and mean, or pranking others, however deep down he has a huge heart (which he tries very hard to hide). However this season his secret deep is discovered, which results in him being placed on the heroes team. He had a relationship with Gwen through the first 5 episodes, until she broke up with him. Before that he was in a relationship with Courtney, and although they broke up in season 3, he tried to win her back over the course of All-Stars. Voiced by Drew Nelson.\n*'''Gwen''' ''(labeled the \"Loner\")''<ref name=\"tv\" /> is very into [[Goth subculture]] and is Duncan's girlfriend until they broke up. She is desperately trying to make-up with Courtney for her betrayal and prove she's her friend and not a villain (with mixed results).

While Lindsay is the prettiest one on the show and is spoilt silly by her father, she is kind-hearted and is able to make friends with almost everyone. However, her lack of intelligence often leads to her downfall, this season being no exception, where, despite being a fan favorite to make it far, she is the first to be eliminated.

She is a parody of real life Total Drama fans. She is obsessed with every member of the cast, especially Cody whom she has an obsessive crush on. However, due to being deprived of Cody for too long, this season she begins to lose her sanity and starts seeing everyone else as Cody, especially Cameron.

He is a highly-intelligent, but physically-weak boy who spent most of his early life trapped inside a bubble. Initially he was quite timid and cowardly, and was tormented by several bullies on the show, however, he later learns to stand up for himself and prevails against them all. He was the original winner for the previous season, ''Total Drama: Revenge of the Island''. This season, he is quite often mistaken as a previous contestant, Cody, when interacting with Sierra. Voiced by Kevin Duhaney.\n*'''Jo''' ''(labeled the \"Take-No-Prisoners Machine\")''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshtvinc.com/blog/total-drama-character-profiles-jo/ |title=Total Drama Character Profiles - Jo - Fresh TV |publisher=Freshtvinc.com |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> is based off [[Jane Lynch]] from ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' when she was sixteen.

He is a super fit, [[National Football League|NFL]]-bound athlete and is one of the finalists of the previous season. However, Lightning is arrogant. He is always talking about himself, dimwitted, and he never supports anyone on his team. He always talks by adding \"sha-\" to the beginning of a word, which makes him annoying for other characters. Voiced by Tyrone Savage.\n*'''Sam''' ''(labeled the \"Nice Guy Gamer\")''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshtvinc.com/blog/total-drama-character-profiles-sam/ |title=Total Drama Character Profiles - Sam - Fresh TV |publisher=Freshtvinc.com |date=February 5, 2014 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> is a [[Seth Rogen]]-type of character who spends most of his time playing video games. He thinks the whole world around him is a large video game, and references various real-life elements to his games. Voiced by Brian Froud.\n*'''Scott''' ''(labeled the \"The Devious\")''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshtvinc.com/blog/total-drama-character-profiles-scott/ |title=Total Drama Character Profiles - Scott - Fresh TV |publisher=Freshtvinc.com |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=February 27, 2015}}</ref> is a devious and sneaky farm-boy, serving as the main antagonist of ''Total Drama: Revenge of the Island''. He is very mean, sneaky, and a liar who does whatever dirty deed it takes to win. His tactic in Total Drama: Revenge of the Island was to sabotage his own team without getting caught, which caused his teams to lose every single elimination challenge before the merge. He is somewhat of a bully to Cameron. People didn't realize that he was mean until the end of the series. Scott has a very large conflict with a mutated shark called Fang who constantly tries to brutally attack him any chance he gets for taking possession of one of Fang's shark teeth in Season 4. As a result, by the time of the Season 4 finale, Scott was hated and seen as a villain by every castmate including Chris. In Season 5, Scott returned as a member of the Villainous Vultures, serving as the comic relief of the season. He later gets into a relationship with Courtney, but soon ends it. He has orange hair, blue eyes, freckles, rosy cheeks, and long muscular arms. He wears a white tank top, long dark blue ankle-length pants, a dark grey belt with a silver buckle, and brown shoes. Voiced by James Wallis.\n{{hidden end}}\nOut of all the fourteen contestants, half are male and half are female.

Growing up he did too much zombie stuff leading him to be paranoid about zombies. In fact, he believes the world has already succumbed to a [[zombie apocalypse]] and signed up to ''Total Drama'' as he believed residing on an island would increase his chances of survival. He becomes involved with a relationship with Jasmine. His character is a close reference to the main character of the movie, ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (with his name also mixed with ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]''), while his appearance and personality is similar to that of Jude Lizowski from ''[[6teen]]'' (another one of Fresh TV's shows). Later, this was shown is the United States. Shawn won. He got Jasmine mad because he did not believe in her dream. So to get back with her he shares the money with her and uses his half to make a zombie bunker. Voiced by Zachary Bennett.\n*'''Sky''', known as ''the athlete'',<ref name=\"tdpi.voices\" /> is a kind, athletic, sports girl. She is the first female winner to win in Canada, the country of origin, although she only won in the English version. She is a natural-born leader and pulls the team through many challenges. Dave has a crush on her, which Sky originally did not share, however over time the feeling became mutual. Despite this Sky still values winning the competition over a relationship, the two are currently on uneasy terms. In the first episode it's possible that she is fluent in Cree as she rightly translated the team names.

Despite their similar looks, both sisters have very different personalities; one acts nice but is selfish in reality, while another is genuinely nice. They do not get along well with each other, since Amy was born 17 minutes before Samey. Amy believes she is the smarter one because of this, and thinks Samey is doing everything wrong. Because of this, Amy [[Sibling abuse|domestically abuses]] Samey and even attempts to [[Sororicide|kill]] her once in the premiere. Both voiced by Bryn McAuley.\n*'''Beardo''', known as the ''human soundboard'',<ref name=\"tdpi.voices\" /> is a close reference to [[Reggie Watts]] and [[Michael Winslow]].

Voiced by Bruce Dow.\n*'''Rodney''', known as the ''country boy'',<ref name=\"tdpi.voices\" /> is a gentle giant and muscular farm-boy with a huge heart and rosy cheeks. He's very shy, quiet, cute, sweet and handsome, and is usually seen blushing. He also doesn't talk very much.

Voiced by Rochelle Wilson.\n*'''Topher''', known as the ''Chris wannabe'',<ref name=\"tdpi.voices\" /> is Chris McLean's No. 1 Fan, and wishes to be just like him, down to his sadistic nature.

In the  end they fought each other over [[Tilottama]], a beautiful [[Apsara]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/sunda|title=Sunda, \u015aunda, Shunda: 6 definitions|last=www.wisdomlib.org|website=www.wisdomlib.org|access-date=2018-06-04|date=29 June 2012}}</ref> The story of Sunda and Upasunda is found in the [[Mahabharata]], Book I: Adi Parva. It is not clear however, whether the [[eponym]]ous ''Sunda'' was derived from this Hindu myth.\n\nIt seems that by the 10th century, the name ''Sunda'' was used by foreigners, possibly by early Indian explorers, Malay Srivijayan traders and colonizer, also Javanese neighbours, as a toponym to identify the Western parts of Java. The [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat inscription]] dated from 854 Saka (932 CE) confirmed this. The name is then used by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] to identify  their western neighbour, also rival and enemy, as mentioned in [[Horren inscription]] (c. 11th century) from Kediri.\n\nAn early 13th century Chinese account reported the pepper port of ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), which probably refer to the port of Banten or Sunda Kalapa. By the 15th to 16th century, after the consolidation of the kingdom by [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], the name ''Sunda'' has shifted from a possibly eponymous toponymy, into a name that identify a kingdom and its people. Thus subsequently gave birth, name and identity to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Sundanese people]].\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:KITLV 87649 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Batoetoelis at Buitenzorg - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|[[Batutulis inscription]] (dated 1533), in [[Bogor]], commemorate the great King of Sunda [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]] (rule 1482-1521).]]\nKnowledge of the kingdom among [[Sundanese people]] has been kept alive through Sundanese ''[[Pantun Sunda|Pantun]]'' oral tradition, the chant of poetic verses about the golden age of Sunda Pajajaran, and the legend of [[Prabu Siliwangi]], the most popular king of Sunda.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rFvsBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi#v=onepage&q=Pantun%20Sunda%20Siliwangi&f=false|title=Java Essay: The History and Culture of a Southern Country|last=Iguchi|first=Masatoshi|date=2017-01-25|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784628857|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=chJvAAAAMAAJ&q=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi|title=Kebudayaan Sunda: Zaman Pajajaran|last=Ekajati|first=Edi Suhardi|date=2005|publisher=Pustaka Jaya|isbn=9789794193341|language=id}}</ref>\n\nSeveral stone inscriptions mention the kingdom, such as [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat]], [[Jayabupati inscription|Jayabupati]], [[Kawali inscription|Kawali]], and [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]].

However, currently the Wangsakerta manuscripts are generally discounted as a valid historical source among historians, since this controversial manuscript is suspected as a fraud containing [[pseudohistory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lubis|first=Nina H.|date=2012-08-03|title=Kontroversi Tentang Naskah Wangsakerta|url=https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jurnal-humaniora/article/view/741|journal=Humaniora|language=id|volume=14|issue=1|pages=20\u201326|doi=10.22146/jh.v14i1.741|issn=2302-9269|doi-broken-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radarcirebon.com/mengungkap-kontroversi-naskah-wangsakerta-2.html|title=Mengungkap Kontroversi Naskah Wangsakerta - Radar Cirebon|date=2013-12-14|work=Radar Cirebon|access-date=2018-06-03|language=id-ID}}</ref>\n\n===Local account===\nThe earliest reference to the name \"Sunda\" being used to identify a kingdom is the [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]] dated 854 Saka (932 AD). The inscription was in old [[Javanese script]], but the language used was [[Old Malay]]. It translates as follows:\n\n{{quotation|This memorial stone is to remark the saying of Rakryan Juru Pangambat (Royal Hunter), in 854 Saka, that the order of government is returned to the power of king of Sunda.}}\n\nThe inscription chandrasengkala ([[chronogram]]) written 458 Saka, however some historians suggested that the year of the inscription must be read backward as 854 Saka (932 AD) because the Sunda kingdom could not have existed in 536 AD, in the era of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara (358-669 AD).\n\nAnother reference to the kingdom is the [[Jayabupati inscription]] which consists of 40 lines written on four pieces of stone found on the Cicatih river bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]]. The inscription is written in old [[Javanese script]]. The four inscriptions are now stored at the National Museum in Jakarta, under the codes D 73 (Cicatih), D 96, D 97 and D 98. The contents of the inscriptions (according to Pleyte):\n\n{{quotation|Peace and well-being. In the year of Saka 952 (1030 AD), Kartika month on the 12th day on the light part, Hariang day, Kaliwon, first day, Wuku Tambir.

Whoever breaks the law will be punished by these supranatural beings, die in horrible way like their brain being sucked, blood being drunk, intestines being destroyed, and chest is split in two. O being known by thee.., all the spirits.}}\n\nThe date of the Jayabupati inscription may be 11 October 1030. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years, from 952 to 964 saka (1030 - 1042 AD). The inscription has an East Javanese style in lettering, language, and style, and mentions the current king by name.\n\nCopperplate letters dating to the 15th century, including royal instructions, also imply the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. The copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of collecting taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nKebantenan II inscription (Sunda Sembawa I) copperplate inscription announces Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482\u20131521), the king staying in Pakuan, approving an already delineated sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') put at the disposal of the ''wiku'' (priests), which must not be split as it houses facilities for worship, which belong to the king. Kebantenan III inscription (Sunda Sembawa II) copperplate announces the king of Sunda's sanctions of holy construction in Sunda Sembawa. The Kebantenan IV (Gunung Samaya) inscription says that Sri Baduga Maharaja, who ruled in Pakuan, sanctioned a sacred place (''tanah devasana'') at Gunung (mount) Samya (Rancamaya), the mentions a similar sacred estate to the one described in the Kebantenan II inscription.\n\nThe primary source that contains information about the daily life of late 15th to early 16th century Sunda Kingdom was found in [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript. The names of places, culture and customs, was described in great detail, it is one of the important specimen of Old [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] literature. The main character is Prince Jaya Pakuan alias Bujangga Manik, a Sundanese Hindu hermit, who, though a prince at the court of [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], preferred to live a life of a man of religion. As a hermit he made two journeys from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] to central and eastern Java and back, the second one including a visit to [[Bali]]. After his return he practised asceticism on a mountain in western Java, where his bodily existence came to an end.<ref name=\"Noorduyn 2006 437\">{{cite book | last =Noorduyn | first =J. | publisher= KITLV Press | title = Three Old Sundanese poems | year =2006| page =437\n}}</ref>  The manuscript dated from pre-Islamic Sunda.

Hirt and W. W. Rockhill, there are Chinese sources concerning the Sunda Kingdom. At the time of the Southern Sung Dynasty, the inspector of trade with foreign countries, [[Chau Ju-kua]], collected reports from sailors and merchants who had visited foreign countries. His report on far countries, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written from 1178 to 1225 AD, mentions the deepwater harbour of Sin-t\u2019o (Sunda). Chu-fan-chi reported that:\n\n{{quotation|All along the shores, people are dwelling.

Both men and women wrap round their loins a piece of cotton, and in cutting their hair they only leave it half an inch long. The [[Black pepper|pepper]] grown on the hills (of this country) is small-grained, but heavy and superior to that of [[Tuban|Ta-pan]] (eastern Java). The country produces pumpkins, sugar cane, [[bottle gourd]], beans and [[egg plant]]s. As, however, there is no regular government in this country, the people are given to brigandage, on which account foreign traders rarely go there.}}\n\nAccording to this source, the kingdom of Sunda produced high quality black pepper. The kingdom located in the western parts of Java near [[Sunda Strait]], corresponds to today Banten, Jakarta and west part of West Java province. According to this source, the port of Sunda was under [[Srivijaya]] mandala domination. Port of Sunda was highly possible refer to [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]] instead of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]. Its capital is located 10 kilometres inland southward in [[Banten Girang]] near Mount [[Pulosari]].\n \nThe Chinese book \u201cshun-feng hsiang-sung\" from about 1430 AD relates:\n\n{{quotation|In this voyage eastward from Sunda, along the north coast of Java, ships steered 97 1/2o for three watches to make [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]; they then followed the coast (past Tanjung Indramayu), finally steering 187 1/2o for four watches to reach Cirebon. Ships from Banten proceeded eastward along the north coast of Java, past [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]], past Indramayu head, past Cirebon.}}\n\nAccording to this source the port of Sunda was located west of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]] and later identified as [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]].\n\n===European account===\n[[File:Java-Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old map of Java still thought that land of Sunda in the west is separated with the rest of Java island. Here the capital of Sunda is called ''Daio'' which refer to Dayeuh Pakuan Pajajaran]]\nEuropean explorers, mainly Portuguese based in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], also reported the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] (1513) mentioned a Western Java kingdom that had established trade relation with them as ... ''Reg\u00f1o de \u00c7umda'' ..., which means \"The Kingdom of Sunda\".

It is not sure however, whether it was actually a continuous polity or not, nor whether its rulers belongs to a single continuous lineage of dynasty or not. This is because the scarcity of evidences, historical records and archaeological findings that plausibly connected to this kingdom.\n\nThe earlier period is unclear, and quite speculative at its best. Much owed to only two manuscripts dated from much later period, the [[Carita Parahyangan]] and Wangsakerta manuscripts. The history of later period however, after late 14th century, is quite clear. Especially after the reign of King Wastu Kancana and Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja). This is contributed mainly to the availability of historical sources, including numbers of foreign reports, especially Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]]; several stone inscriptions especially [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]]; and native primary historical manuscripts of [[Bujangga Manik]] and [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]].\n\n====Formation and growth====\nAccording to the Wangsakerta manuscript, King Tarusbawa from Sunda Sambawa, a vassal kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]], succeeded his father-in-law as the 13th king of Tarumanagara. Tarumanagara's prestige and power had been declining, likely due to a series of invasions from [[Srivijaya]]. Wishing to restore the glory of King Purnawarman, who reigned from the Purasaba (capital city) of Sundapura, in 670 AD Tarusbawa renamed Tarumanagara to the Sunda Kingdom. This event is confirmed by a Chinese source mentioning Tarumanagara's last envoy was in 669 AD. Tarusbawa sent his emissary to the Chinese Emperor at the time to advise him of his ascension to the throne in 669 AD. He was crowned on the ninth of the month of Jesta, in 591 Saka, which corresponds to 18 May 669 AD.\n\n====Separation of Galuh and Sunda Kingdom====\n[[File:Sunda-Galuh.gif|thumb|right|[[Citarum River]] separates Sunda and Galuh]] According to the Wangsakerta manuscript, Wretikandayun, the lord of another former vassal kingdom of Tarumanagara, [[Galuh Kingdom]], used the establishment of the Sunda Kingdom as an excuse to split eastern Taruma from Tarusbawa's Sunda. Since the crown prince of Galuh was the son-in-law of [[Queen Shima]] of [[Kalingga]], a Hindu kingdom in central Java, Wretikandayun, supported by Kalingga, demanded that the remnant of what was known as Tarumanagara's territory be divided into two kingdoms. Finding himself in an unfortunate position and unwilling to risk a civil war, King Tarusbawa granted Wretikandayun's demand. In 670 AD, Tarumanagara was divided into two kingdoms: the Sunda Kingdom in the west, and the Galuh Kingdom in the east, separated by the Tarum (Citarum) River.\n\n====Sanna and Purbasora====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple a shrine for Shiva, dated from the 8th century Galuh Kingdom.]]\nWretikandayun, the King of Galuh has two sons; Sempakwaja and Mandiminyak. Despite being the eldest son, Sempakwaja was not chosen as the successor because he was toothless, a shameful physical defect considered unsuitable for a king at that time. Thus, his younger brother, Mandiminyak (r. 702-709) inherited the Galuh throne from Wretikandayun instead. Sempakwaja then established a rural principality of Galunggung Kingdom. \n\nSempakwaja has a son named Purbasora, while King Mandiminyak also has a son named Sena or Bratasena. However, there was a circulating rumours in the palace; that actually instead of cousins; Purbasora and Sena were actually brothers. This was because Prince Sena was the result of a forbidden affair between Mandiminyak and his own sister in-law; the beautiful wife of Sempakwaja.\n\nAfter the death of Mandiminyak, Prince Bratasena or Sena (r. 709-716), ascends as the new king; as the third monarch of Galuh. According to Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts; King Sena of Galuh married to Princess Sannaha of Kalingga in Central Java, and they had Sanjaya as their son and heir. In an attempt to nurture a good relations with the neighboring Sunda Kingdom, King Sena established a friendship with King Tarusbawa of Sunda. This friendship encouraged Tarusbawa to take Sanjaya as his son-in-law.\n\nPurbasora, son of Batara Danghyang Guru Sempakwaja of the Galunggung Kingdom, also grandson of Wretikandayun, the founder of Galuh, deeply resent the reign of his cousin; King Sena. This was because he felt that instead of Sena that had a doubtful scandalous origin, he is more deserving to the throne of Galuh. With the aid of his father-in-law, King Indraprahasta, from a kingdom near present-day [[Cirebon]], Purbasora rebelled, launched his coup and usurped Sena as the king of Galuh in 716. Defeated, Sena fled to [[Kalingga]], the kingdom of his wife's grandmother, Queen Shima.\n\nSince the crown prince of Sunda died before King Tarusbawa, Princess Tejakencana (the daughter of the crown prince) was hailed as the heiress of Sunda. She married Rakeyan Jamri, son of Bratasena (the third king of Galuh Kingdom and a son of Wretikandayun) and Princess Sanaha (from [[Kalingga]]). In 723, Jamri succeeded Tarusbawa as the second king of Sunda. As the lord of Sunda, he was known as Prabu Harisdarma and laterwhen he ascended the throne of Galuh he was known as [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]].\n\n====Sanjaya and Balangantrang====\n[[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of Sena, determined to take revenge to Purbasora's rebellion. He requested aid from King Tarusbawa of Sunda, a friend of Sena. His wish was realised when he became the king of Sunda, reigning on behalf of his wife.\n\nHe prepared a special force, which he placed in the Gunung Sawal area with the help of Rabuyut Sawal, also a dear friend of Sena. This special force was led by Sanjaya, while the Sunda army was led by Patih Anggada. The raid was launched at nightfall. Almost all of Purbasora's family was wiped out, except for Bimaraksa, Purbasora's son-in-law; the minister of Galuh escaped with a handful of guards.\n\nBimaraksa, also known as Ki Balangantrang, was the Senapati (army general) of the kingdom. Balangantrang was also the grandson of Wretikandayun, as a child of his second son, Resi Guru Jantaka or Rahyang Kidul, and was also considered unfit to succeed Wretikandayun because he suffered from a [[hernia]]. Balangantrang hid in the village of G\u00e8g\u00e8r Sunten and raised anti-Sanjaya forces. He was supported by the kings of Kuningan and also by the remnants of the Indraprahasta army. Indraphrasta was annihilated by Sanjaya as revenge for helping Purbasora to oust Sena.\n\nSena asked Sanjaya to honour all of the Galuh royal family, except Purbasora. Sanjaya himself was not interested in ruling Galuh. He merely attacked it to fulfill his father's wish to take revenge on Purbasora's family. After defeating Purbasora, Sanjaya asked his granduncle, Sempakwaja, in Galunggung to order Demunawan, the younger brother of Purbasora, to reign in Galuh. But Sempakwaja declined, fearing this to be Sanjaya's trick to annihilate Demunawan.\n\nSanjaya himself could not find Balangantrang, so he accepted the Galuh throne. Realizing that he was unwelcomed at the Galuh court, and also that he was a Sunda king who must reside in Pakuan, he put Premana Dikusuma, grandson of Purbasora, in charge of Galuh. Premana Dikusuma at that time was a vassal king. At the age of 43 (born in 683 AD), he was already known as Rsi or an ascetic monk, because of his passion for learning and spiritual teaching since a young age, he is also known as Bagawat Sajalajaya.\n\nSanjaya also had legitimate right to Kalingga's throne (from his grandmother's side). Thus in 732 AD he chose to live in [[Kalingga]] (in the northern part of central Java) and later established the [[Mataram Kingdom]] and [[Sanjaya Dynasty]]. In 732 he gave his right to western Java to his son from Tejakencana, Prince Tamperan (Rakeyan Panaraban). Rakeyan was a half-brother of Rakai Panangkaran, Sanjaya's son from Sudiwara (daughter of Dewasinga, king of southern Kalingga).\n\n====Reunification of Sunda and Galuh====\nThe [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kingdoms of Sunda and Galuh coexisted under a strange and complex relationship; occasionally united under one ruler, and at other times as separated kingdoms under different rulers, albeit allied or related.\nThe two kingdoms united as the Sunda Kingdom under the following kings:\n* Sanjaya (723 \u2013 732 AD) with the capital city in Kawali Galuh (present-day [[Ciamis]] city)\n* Tamperan or Rakeyan Panaraban (in 732 - 739 AD) with the capital in Kawali Galuh\n* Wuwus (819 \u2013 891 AD) with the capital city in Pakuan (present-day [[Bogor]] City)\n* Darmaraksa (891 \u2013 895 AD) with the capital in Pakuan\n* Prabu Guru Darmasiksa with the capital city in Sawunggalah (present-day [[Kuningan]] city)\n* Rakeyan Jayadarma resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ragasuci (1297\u20131303 AD) resided in Saunggalah\n* Prabu Citraganda (1303\u20131311 AD) resided in Pakuan\n* Prabu Lingga Dewata (1311\u20131333 AD) perhaps resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ajiguna Wisesa (1333\u20131340 AD) resided in Kawali.\n* Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana (1340\u20131357 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Mangkubumi Suradipati/Prabu Bunisora (1357\u20131371 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Raja Wastu/Niskala Wastu Kancana (1371\u20131475 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482 to 1521 AD) resided in Pakuan\n\n====Rakryan Juru Pangambat====\nAccording to [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]], dated from 854 Saka (932 CE), discovered in Kebon Kopi village, [[Bogor]], a noble which also a skilled hunter named Juru Pangambat, declared that the authority (order) is returned to the king of Sunda.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|381}} This inscription was written in [[Kawi alphabet]], however curiously the language being used is [[Old Malay]]. Archaeologist [[F. D. K. Bosch]], that had studied the inscription, proposed that the use of Old Malay suggests [[Srivijaya]]n influence on Western Java. French historian, Claude Guillot from [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] proposed that this was a declaration of independence (possibly from Srivijaya) of the Kingdom of Sunda.\n\n====Jayabupati====\n[[File:Sanghyang Tapak inscription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]]]]\nAccording to [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]], dated from 952 saka (1030 CE) found in Cicatih River bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]], Maharaja Sri Jayabupati established a sacred sanctuary of Sanghyang Tapak. Strangely the style of the inscriptions reveal an East Javanese style of script. Not only letters, language, and style, but the noble name of the king is similar to royal names in [[Dharmawangsa]]'s court of East Javanese [[Medang kingdom]]. This has led to suggestions that Sunda Kingdom at this time probably was under the influence of East Java, possibly a vassal. Or probably Jayabupati consciously subscribed to Javanese culture among Sundanese population.\n\nSri Jayabupati in [[Carita Parahyangan]] is mentioned as Prabu Detya Maharaja. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years (952-964) Saka (1030-1042). The 11th century [[Horren inscription]] of Southern Kediri, reported that ''\u00e7atru Sunda'' (enemy from Sunda) had invaded and menacing villages in East Java. It was not clear however, which Sundanese faction has committed such [[brigandage]] as far east to Kediri, nor whether Sri Jayabupati was responsible for this.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nAfter Sri Jayabupati, there is no stone inscription discovered mentioning the next ruler. There is no tangible evidence discovered from the period between 11th to 14th century. Most of our current knowledge about this period came from Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts.\n\nThe Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] source, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written circa 1200, [[Chou Ju-kua]] identified the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the [[Indonesian archipelago]] as [[Srivijaya]] and Java ([[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]). According to this source, in the early 13th Century, [[Srivijaya]] still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source describes the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (''rumah panggung''). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country.<ref>{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973 | location =Yogyakarta| pages =60 }}</ref> It was uncertain which port of Sunda was referred to by Chou Ju-kua, it probably referred to the port of [[Banten (town)|Banten]], and not Kalapa. It seems that by early 13th century, the maritime trade was still dominated by Srivijayan mandala based in Sumatra. The port of Sunda still pretty much served as a trading post or colony of Srivijaya. Nevertheless, the Sunda Kingdom in the inland west Java still enjoyed internal autonomy.\n\n====Rakeyan Jayadarma====\nAccording to Pustaka Rajyarajya i Bhumi Nusantara parwa II sarga 3, Rakeyan Jayadarma was the son-in-law of Mahisa Campaka of [[Singhasari]]. During the reign of Prabu Guru Dharmasiksa (1175\u20131297) Prince Jayadharma married Dyah Singamurti, also known as Dyah Lembu Tal. Sangrama Wijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]), the first King of [[Majapahit]], was the son of the Sunda king, Rakeyan Jayadharma. Except for Gajah Mada, who insisted on incorporating the Sunda Kingdom within the Majapahit realm, this is the likely reason why Majapahit kings were reluctant to attack the Sunda Kingdom. There was a sacred alliance between the Sunda Kingdom and the Majapahit Kingdom.\n\n====Golden age====\nThe name \"Sunda\" appeared again in Javanese source. This time the [[Pararaton]] reported that in 1336, during the reign of Majapahit Queen [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]], at the inauguration of his newly appointed position as Patih Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister), [[Gajah Mada]] declared [[Palapa oath]], which stated his foreign policy to unify the archipelago under Majapahit domination. Gajah Mada said ''\"Lamun huwus kalah nusantara isun amukti palapa, lamun kalah ring Gurun, ring Seran, Ta\u00f1jung Pura, ring Haru, ring Pahang, Dompo, ring Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Tumasik, samana isun amukti palapa\"''. Sunda was mentioned as one of kingdoms targeted by Mada's overseas campaign. It seems by early 14th century, Kingdom of Sunda has grown quite prosperous and took part in international maritime trade. Quite significantly, so the kingdom has attracted the interest of Majapahit Prime Minister.\n\n====Maharaja Lingga Buana====\n{{Further|Battle of Bubat}}\nThe [[Carita Parahyangan]] and [[Pararaton]] simply named him as ''Pr\u011bbu Maharaja''. While the Wangsakerta manuscript give a detailed name of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. He resided in Kawali Galuh. He died in the [[Battle of Bubat]], Majapahit, in 1357, fell victim to a [[Stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] crafted by the Majapahit prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]]. The tragedy's prelude came with the intention of [[Hayam Wuruk]], the king of Majapahit, to marry Princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi|Dyah Pitaloka]] (also known as Citraresmi), a daughter of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. Delighted by the prospect to foster an alliance with the most powerful kingdom in the region, the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit, sailing through the Java Sea, to accompany and marry his daughter to Hayam Wuruk. The Sunda party erected the encampment on Bubat square in the northern part of [[Trowulan]], Majapahit capital, and awaited the proper wedding ceremony. Gajah Mada however, saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit overlordship, and insisted that instead of becoming the queen of Majapahit, the princess was to be presented as a concubine for the Majapahit king, as a token of her kingdom's submission. The Sunda king was angered and humiliated by Gajah Mada's demand.\n\nAs a result, there was a skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the [[Majapahit]] army. The Majapahit army decimated the Sunda royal family; almost the entire [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] royal party, including the princess, perished in this tragedy. Tradition mentioned that Princess Dyah Pitaloka committed suicide to defend the honour and pride of her country. After his death, Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana was revered by the Sundanese as Prabu Wangi (lit. king with pleasant fragrance) because of his heroic defence of his honour against Majapahit, and his descendants, the later kings of Sunda, were called Siliwangi (lit. successor of Wangi). The story of the [[Battle of Bubat]] is the main theme of the book [[Kidung Sunda]].\n\n====Niskala Wastu Kancana====\n{{main|Niskala Wastu Kancana}}\n[[File:KITLV 87612 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|One of [[Kawali inscription]]s]]\nKing Niskala Wastu Kancana was the youngest son of Prabu Maharaja and the brother of Princess Pitaloka Citraresmi, both perished in Majapahit. In 1371, Prince Wastu ascended to throne, stylized as Prabu Raja Wastu Kancana. According to [[Kawali inscription]], approximately dated from second half of the 14th century, mentioned that King Prabu Raja Wastu constructed the defensive structures; walls and moats surrounding Kawali city, and renovated Surawisesa palace.<ref name=\"Sejarah Jawa Barat\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dvR7CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA52&dq=Niskala+Wastu+Kancana#v=onepage&q=Niskala%20Wastu%20Kancana&f=false|title=Sejarah Daerah Jawa Barat|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|language=id}}</ref> The construction of moats and other defensive measures, was probably as a response to a perceived foreign threat. Since the relations between Sunda and its eastern neighbour, the powerful \nMajapahit empire, was badly deteriorated after the Bubat incident. Niskala Wastu resided in Kawali palace of Galuh, and ruled for 104 years (1371\u20131475).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|392}} His reign is remembered as a long era of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana was buried in Nusalarang, while his successor Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned ''Prebu Niskala Wastu Kancana surup di Nusalarang ring giri Wanakusumah'', while his successor was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu'''. In Carita Parahyangan, Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana is not mentioned completely, but only referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh). At this point, the Sunda Kingdom capital was still located in Galuh, more precisely in Kawali city.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|391}}\n\n====Ningrat Kancana====\nNiskala Wastu Kancana's son, named as Tohaan di Galuh (Lord of Galuh) in Carita Parahyangan, succeeded him as the king. He was mentioned in Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) inscription as Hyang Ningrat Kancana and in \nBatutulis inscription as Rahyang Dewa Niskala.\n\nThe new king however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\"<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}} The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or non-Hindu (Muslim) woman.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned that Tohaan di Galuh was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu''' died or buried in Gunung Tilu. Gunatiga and Gunung Tilu means \"Three mountains\" which corresponds to Gunung Tilu mountain range located east of the town of [[Kuningan]]. Today, Gunung Tilu marked as the boundary between West Java and [[Central Java]] provinces, located between [[Kuningan Regency]] and [[Brebes Regency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gn.+Tilu/@-7.1188884,108.6816571,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2e6f73efb54d5283:0x8ef28fb8de770294!8m2!3d-7.1188889!4d108.6991667!5m1!1e4|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n====Sri Baduga Maharaja====\n{{main|Sri Baduga Maharaja}}\n[[File:KITLV 87605 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Hindu-Javanese sculpture at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Statue of a Hindu god from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java, dated from Sunda Kingdom.]]\nSang Ratu Jayadewata or also known as Sri Baduga Maharaja, is a grandchild of Prabu Wastu Kancana or Prabu Niskala Wastu. Jayadewata is often linked with a popular character [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]] in the Sundanese oral tradition of [[Pantun]].\n\nKing Jayadewata moved the government seat from [[Kawali]] back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Pakuan]] in 1482. It is not clear however, the reason behind the transfer of capital westward from Kawali to Pakuan Pajajaran. It might be a geopolitical move to secure the capital away from the eastern threat from [[Demak Sultanate|Islamic state of Demak]] in Central Java. As by 1482, according to ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a Cirebon chronicle, Cirebon declared its independence from Sunda and no longer sent tribute to the Sunda court.\n\nBased on Kebantenan copperplate inscription, he established a sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') at Mount Samya (Rancamaya) and ordered that anyone entering was forbidden to disturb this area and forbade the imposition of taxes and other levies because this devasana contained royal facilities for worship. He also announced that holy construction in Sunda Sembawa, which should be cared for and be undisturbed because the area stipulated is the residential area of the wiku (priests).\n\nAccording to [[Batutulis inscription]], Sri Baduga Maharaja built defensive [[moat]]s surrounding [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]; he built \"gugunungan\" (sacred mounds), established huts and sacred Samya forest, reserves for wood destined for offerings, and the Talaga Rena Mahawijaya Lake. Certainly, there was a good road to [[Sunda Kalapa]] (present-day Jakarta Metropolitan city) too, the most important harbour of the Sunda kingdom. At the time of Tome Pir\u00e9s visit to Pakuan, Sri Baduga Maharaja reigned over the Sunda kingdom (1482 to 1521).\n\nThe year of his coronation in 1482 has been mentioned as the birth date of the present-day city of [[Bogor]]. However, there was an important settlement at the site already, and Pakuan had been the capital of the Sunda kingdom under previous kings. The reign of Ratu Jayadewata was hailed as the \"golden age\" of the Sundanese people. The kingdom consolidated its rule and exercised power throughout western part of Java. It also marked the era of great prosperity resulting from efficient agriculture management and the thriving pepper trade in the region. This era of great wealth also marked the beginning of Sunda kingdom's decline.\n\n====Decline====\nDuring the reign of Sang Ratu Jayadewata, there was already a group of Sunda inhabitant that has converted to a new faith ([[Islam]]), as testified by Portuguese account. Tom\u00e9 Pires in 1513 reported, there is a significant numbers of [[Muslim]]s resides in the port of Cimanuk, the easternmost port of Sunda Kingdom, which is the estuarine of [[Cimanuk River]] in present-day town of [[Indramayu]]. According to Portuguese report, the port of Cirebon which  is located just east from Cimanuk, is already a Muslim port by this time, ruled by Javanese.\n\nProbably these new converts were the people referred to in Carita Parahyangan as \"those who felt no peace because have violated (strayed from) ''[[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksa]]''\". Nevertheless, during this time, Islamic influence has not yet penetrated inland into the capital. As mentioned in Carita Parahyangan '' ... mana mo kadatangan ku musuh ganal, musu(h) alit ...'', which means the capital is \"safe from rough/coarse enemy, (as well as) soft/subtle enemy\". The term \"coarse enemy\" refer to actual invading foreign army, while \"subtle enemy\" refer to the propagation of a new faith or new religion that might upset the established spiritual order of the kingdom.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|394}}\n\nThe Kingdom of Sunda anxiously watched the growing influence of the expansive Islamic [[Sultanate of Demak]] that finally succeed to destroy [[Kediri (city)|Daha]], the remnant of Hindu [[Majapahit]] court, in 1517. As a result of this event, only [[Blambangan]] in the eastern edge of Java, and Sunda in the western part remained Hindu kingdoms in Java. Meanwhile, in the land of Sunda, Muslim influences start to penetrated the kingdom.\n\n====Rise of Muslim States, Cirebon and Banten====\n[[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, written circa the second half of 15th century (1450\u20131500) reported that the eastern boundary of Sunda Kingdom realm with its Javanese neighbour was the Cipamali river in present-day [[Brebes Regency]]. However, the Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]] in 1513 reported that the eastern border of Sunda Kingdom is located in the port of ''Chemano'' (Cimanuk), the estuarine of [[Manuk River]], which today corresponds to the town of [[Indramayu]]. Portuguese source also reported the presence of Muslim inhabitant and traders in Cimanuk. This means between 1450 and 1513 the Sunda kingdom has lost control on the area surrounding [[Cirebon]]; between Brebes and Indramayu. This signify the coastal Muslim Javanese push westward into once a traditional Sundanese area, as [[Demak Sultanate]] was responsible as the patron that led to the rise of Cirebon Sultanate.\n\nThe detail of Sunda Kingdom and its relations with the rise of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon Sultanate]], mostly were taken from the account of ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a manuscript of Cirebon chronicle explaining the advent of this Sultanate, which also claimed Cirebon as the rightful successor of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAccording to Purwaka Caruban Nagari, Sunda [[King Siliwangi]] married Nyai Subang Larang, daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati, which corresponds with the port of [[Cirebon]]. They had three children; Prince Walangsungsang born in 1423, Princess Rara Santang born in 1426, and Prince Kian Santang (Raden Sangara) born in 1428.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\"/> Although Prince Walangsungsang was the first-born son of Sunda King, the prince did not earned the right as a crown prince of Sunda Kingdom. This was because his mother, Nyai Subang Larang was not the ''prameswari'' ([[queen consort]]). Another reason was probably because of his conversion to Islam, probably influenced by his mother, Subang Larang whom was a Muslim woman. In 16th century West Java, the state's religion was Hinduism, [[Sunda Wiwitan]] (Sundanese ancestral religion) and Buddhism. It was his half brother, King Siliwangi's son from his third wife Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, who was chosen as crown prince.\n\nWalangsungsang, assisted by Ki Gedheng Danusela, established a new settlement called Dukuh Alang-alang on 8 April 1445. After Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang's death in 1447, Walangsungsang appointed as the ruler of the town and established a court and assumed a new title as Prince Cakrabuana. King Siliwangi sent his envoy Tumenggung Jagabaya and Raja Sengara (Cakrabuana's younger brother), to bestow Prince Carkrabuana with the title Tumenggung Sri Mangana. Cirebon grew into a thriving port, yet Cakrabuana still loyal to his father and sent tribute to the main court of Sunda. At that time Cirebon was still the vassal of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAfter his Resignation in 1479 CE, Cakrabuana was succeeded by his nephew, Sharif Hidayatullah (1448-1568), the son of Nyai Rara Santang (Syarifah Mudaim) and Sharif Abdullah of Egypt. He married his cousin, Nyi Mas Pakungwati daughter of Cakrabuana. He is popularly known with his posthumously name, [[Sunan Gunung Jati]]. In 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost one of its important ports, [[Cirebon]]. On 2 April 1482, Sunan Gunungjati, the ruler of [[Cirebon]] (and also the grandson of King Siliwangi), stated that Cirebon will no longer send tribute to [[Pajajaran]], which marked the proclamation of the [[Sultanate of Cirebon]] as independence from Sunda Pajajaran.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.cirebonkab.go.id/sekilas-kab-cirebon/sejarah-kabupaten-cirebon\n |title      = Sejarah Kabupaten Cirebon\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Cirebon Regency\n |accessdate = 16 January 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThe character described in Purwaka Caruban Nagari, as [[King Siliwangi]], both timeline and storyline, matched the historic character of Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana, referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh) in \nCarita Parahyangan. Tohaan di Galuh was the son and heir of Niskala Wastu Kancana. Ningrat Kancana however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\" The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or even non-Hindu (Muslim) woman. It is possible that the outsider forbidden woman mentioned here was Nyai Subang Larang, a Muslim woman daughter of port master of Muara Jati (Cirebon).\n\nThe pressure from coastal Javan Islamic states drove the king of Sunda, [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], to seek assistance from the Portuguese at [[Malacca]]. In 1512 and again in 1521, he sent his son, the crown prince Prabu Surawisesa also known as Ratu Sang Hyang (the Portuguese record it as Samian) to Malacca to request the Portuguese to sign a peace treaty, to trade in pepper and to build a fort at his main port of Sunda Kalapa.\n\nSunan Gunung Jati's son later also established the [[Sultanate of Banten]], which later become a menace for Hindu Sunda kingdom.\n\n====Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa====\nAfter Sri Baduga Maharaja's death in 1521, the succeeding kings, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa, also known as Ratu Sang Hyang whom the Portuguese called Ratu Samian, faced the threat of [[the Sultanate of Cirebon]] and [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] expanding nearer his kingdom. Under this threat, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa, who reigned from 1521 to 1535, concluded the treaty with [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese from Malacca]] to establish a warehouse and fortress at [[Sunda Kelapa]] in return for protection against the menace of these Islamic Sultanates.\n\n====Sunda\u2013Portuguese Treaty 1522====\n{{Main|Luso-Sundanese padr\u00e3o}}\nBy 1522, the Portuguese were ready to form a coalition with the King of Sunda to get access to his lucrative pepper trade. The commander of the fortress of Malacca at that time was Jorge de Albuquerque. He sent a ship, the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, under Captain Henrique Leme, to Sunda Kalapa with valuable gifts for the king of Sunda. Two written sources describe the concluding of the treaty in detail, the original Portuguese document of 1522 with the text of the treaty and the signatories of the witnesses, and a report on that event by [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] in his book ''Da \u00c1sia'', printed after 1777/78.\n\nAccording to these sources, the king welcomed them warmly upon their arrival. The crown prince had succeeded his father and was now King Prabu Surawisesa, although Barros called him King Sami\u00e3o. This Sunda ruler agreed to an arrangement of friendship with the King of Portugal and granted a fortress at the mouth of the Ciliwung River where the Portuguese could load as many ships as they wished with pepper. In addition, he pledged, dating from the start of construction on the fortress, each year he would donate one thousand sacks of pepper to the Portuguese king. The contract document was drafted into two copies and signed. On the said day in 1522, Henrique Leme of Portuguese and his entourage together with deputies of the King of Sunda, erected a commemoration stone, called [[Padr\u00e3o]], at the mouth of the Ciliwung River.\n\n====The fall of Sunda Kelapa====\nThis trade and defence treaty with the Portuguese, the [[Luso Sundanese Treaty]], was fallen apart tremendously due to Portuguese failure to deliver their promise to construct the fortress in Kalapa. The delay was caused by troubles in [[Portuguese Goa]] in [[India]]. To make things worse, [[Fatahillah]], a military general sent from Demak, managed to capture the [[Sunda Kalapa]] harbour just before the Portuguese returned.\n\nThe army of Paletehan or Fatahillah, also called Fadillah Khan (1487\u20131570), comprising around 1452 troops from the Cirebon-Demak alliance, conquered Sunda Kalapa. The Sunda military commander and his troops stationed in the port were all fallen. The harbour chief and his family, the royal minister, and all of the people working in the harbour were slaughtered. Most of the city was helplessly destroyed and razed, as the Sundanese reinforcements sent from Pakuan realised that their forces were too weak and retreated. Sunda Kingdom has lost its most important port, thus subsequently Sunda Kalapa Harbour was renamed [[Jayakarta]] or Jakarta by its Muslim conqueror.\n\nThirty Portuguese sailors, shipwrecked by storms, swam to the beach at Kalapa only to be killed by Fadillah Khan's men. The Portuguese recognised the political leadership had changed when they were not allowed to set foot on the land. As they were too weak for a battle, they set sail back to Malacca. The next year, a second attempt failed because of striking sailors angry at not having been paid.\n\n====Ongoing battles====\nThe failure to rely on Portuguese assistance has led Sunda Kingdom to fend for their own survival by themselves. Carita Parahyangan mentioned that during his 14 years of reign (1521\u20131535), King Sang Hyang (Surawisesa) has fought in 15 battles. Unbeatable, all in which he managed to repel the series of invading Muslim forces from Cirebon and Demak. He fought in Kalapa, Tanjung, Ancol Kiji, Wahanten Girang, Simpang, Gunung Batu, Saung Agung, Rumbut, Gunung, Gunung Banjar, Padang, Panggoakan, Muntur, Hanum, Pagerwesi, and Medangkahyangan.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}}\n\nThe war between Cirebon-Demak forces and the Sunda kingdom lasted for almost five years. The king lost around 1000 of his men. During this war, after Sunda Kalapa, Sunda Kingdom also lost another important port, the port of Banten to their Cirebon-Demak Muslim nemesis. [[Sunan Gunungjati]] (Syarif Hidayatullah) of Cirebon crowned his son, [[Maulana Hasanuddin of Banten|Hasanudin]], as the king of Banten under the auspices of the Sultan of Demak who, in turn, offered Hasanudin his sister's hand in marriage. Thus, a new dynasty was born at the same time as a new kingdom was created. Banten was established as the capital of this new sultanate, held as a [[province]] under [[Sultanate of Cirebon]].<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Guillot\n  | first =Claude\n  | publisher= Gramedia Book Publishing Division\n  | title = The Sultanate of Banten\n  | year =1990\n| page =18\n| url =\n| accessdate =  }}</ref> Finally, in 1531, a peace treaty was concluded between King Surawisesa of Sunda and Syarif Hidayatullah of Cirebon.\n\nIn an apparent sorrow after the tremendous defeat and the loss of his two most important ports, Prabu Surawisesa established the [[Batutulis inscription]] in 1533 AD to commemorate his late father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/kesedihan-di-balik-prasasti-batutulis-cw9x|title=Kesedihan di Balik Prasasti Batutulis - Tirto.ID|last=Teguh|first=Irfan|website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref> This action was probably an attempt to spiritually appeal for ancestral guidance, assistance and protection against the powerful Muslim enemy that now loomed by the gates. Because of ongoing battles, he often could not stay in his palace in [[Pakuan Pajajaran]].\n\n====Ratu Dewata====\nPrabu Ratu Dewata also known as Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata, was the successor of Prabu Surawisesa, however he was not his son. The reign of Prabu Ratu Dewata between 1535 and 1543 was known as a chaotic and difficult one full of hardship, as Islamic forces from Cirebon and Banten tried for multiple times to capture the Dayeuh Pakuan capital.\n\n====The period of chaos and terror====\nDuring Ratu Dewata reign, the Carita Parahyangan reported several calamities befell the kingdom; there was a sudden attack, a lot of enemies razed the city, thus a mass combat erupted in the grand yard (''[[alun-alun]]'').<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}} In this battle, the noble princes; Tohaan Serendet and Tohaan Ratu Sanghyang were killed. The chaos has widespread across the kingdom, the attack also occurred in Ciranjang and Sumedang. Another horrifying terror was the assassins of unknown origin slaughtering the [[rishi]]s, hermits and Hindu priests that resides in the mandalas (hermitage sanctuaries). It was reported that the Hindu priests and hermits of mandala Jayagiri, a sacred sanctuary established by the late King Jayadewata, were captured and drowned into the sea.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|400}} It is highly possible that the attack was launched by Muslim states of Banten or Cirebon.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|395}} This was a devastating attack straight to the spiritual core of the Sundanese Hindu community.\n  \nUnable to control the kingdom, instead of fulfilling his duty by maintaining the law and order, Prabu Ratu Dewata retreated himself to become a ''Raja Pandita'' (priestly king), submitted himself deeply into religious rituals as an apparently desperate appeal for gods' salvation.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Sunda Kingdom were already isolated and confined to inland, as one by one Sunda's ports were captured by Islamic forces of Banten and Cirebon.\n\n====Last kings and the fall of Sunda kingdom====\n[[File:Bird\u2019s-eye View of the City of Bantam de Bry.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Banten (town)|Port of Banten]] in the 16th century. The Islamic [[Banten Sultanate|Sultanate of Banten]] was responsible for the demise of Hindu Sunda Kingdom, and supplant it as the dominant polity in western parts of Java on the following centuries.]]\nSeries of last Sunda kings were notoriously known as incompetent rulers. The successor of Ratu Dewata, King Ratu Sakti reigned from 1543 to 1551, was known as a ruthless king, whom indulge himself with women and sensual pleasure.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nThe next successor that ruled from 1551 to 1567, King Nilakendra, also known as Tohaan di Majaya, is also an incompetent ruler. Instead of fulfill his duty as a king, he renovate and beautify the palace. Squander kingdom's fortune by indulging himself in luxury, binge drinking and parties.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nBecause of ongoing battles, ironically Tohaan di Majaya could not stay in his newly renovated palace. The last kings of Sunda could no longer reside in Pakuan Pajajaran, since in 1550s Hasanuddin, sultan of [[The Sultanate of Banten|Banten]] has launched a successful attack to Dayeuh Pakuan, captured and razed the capital. The surviving Sunda royalties, nobles and common people fled the fallen city, heading to mountainous wilderness. To disable the authority of Sunda royal institution, Sultan of Banten seize the sacred stone of ''Palangka Sriman Sriwacana'', and took it as a prized plunder to his capital, the port city of Banten. According to tradition, this sacred stone slab is an essential requirement for enthronement ceremony, thus disabling the surviving house of Sunda royals to properly crowned their new king.\n\nFrom 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, also known as Prabu Surya Kencana, the kingdom declined substantially. In Carita Parahyangan, his name is Nusiya Mulya. He ruled further inland in Pulasari, Pandeglang, or precisely in Kaduhejo village, Menes Subdistrict, at the slope of Mount Palasari. The kingdom helplessly fallen apart, the royal government can not be maintained anymore, particularly after 1576 due to constant pressure from Banten, and finally collapsed completely in 1579. Thereafter, [[the Sultanate of Banten]] took over most of the former Sunda Kingdom's territory, thus ultimately put an end to a millennium of Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilization of West Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Java has turned more and more Islamic. Only the kingdom of [[Blambangan Kingdom|Blambangan]] on the eastern edge was the last surviving Hindu kingdom in Java, well until its demise in early 18th century.\n\n==Capital==\nThroughout Sunda's history, the centre of cultural and political power often oscillated between Western [[Priangan]] region; initially identified as \"Sunda\", and Eastern Priangan region; traditionally identified as \"Galuh\". The two traditional sites are located in and around modern [[Bogor]] city and the town of [[Ciamis]]. Two most important capitals are [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], the capital of Sunda; and [[Kawali]], the capital of Galuh.\n\n===Kawali===\n{{Main|Kawali}}\n[[File:KITLV 87620 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Hindu Brahmin's ritual objects, including bronze bell and holy water container from Kawali, the historic capital of Galuh Kingdom.]]\nThe capital of Galuh Kingdom of eastern [[Priangan]] region, has moved for several times. In older period, the capital was located around the Karang Kamulyan site by the banks of [[Ci Tanduy|Citanduy]] river. By early 14th century, the capital was moved further northwest upstream, in the area now known as [[Astana Gede inscription|Astana Gede]], near the current town of Kawali, [[Ciamis Regency]]. The city was located on eastern slope of Mount Sawal near the source of the Citanduy river. A [[Kawali inscription]] was discovered here. According to tradition, the keraton in Kawali is called ''Surawisesa'', expanded and renovated by King [[Niskala Wastu Kancana]]. Kawali served as the capital of the kingdom for several generations until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the government back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\n===Pakuan Pajajaran===\n{{Main|Pakuan Pajajaran}}\n[[File:Pakuanpajajaran.jpg|thumb|right|Location of Pakuan Pajajaran copied from book \"Kabudayaan Sunda Zaman Pajajaran\" Part 2\", 2005]]\nAfter the fall of [[Tarumanagara]] in the 7th century, King Tarusbawa built a new capital city inland near the source of the Cipakancilan river in present-day [[Bogor]]. According to [[Carita Parahyangan]], a manuscript from the 15th or 16th century, King Tarusbawa was only mentioned as ''Tohaan'' (Lord/King) of Sunda. He was the ancestor of a series of Sunda kings that reigned until 723. Pakuan served as the capital of Sunda during the reign of several kings, and the court shifted to Kawali until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the court from Kawali back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\nThe city was permanently settled since at least the 10th century, but not gaining major political importance until King [[Sri Baduga Maharaja|Jayadewata]] established it as the royal capital of Sunda kingdom in the 15th century. In 1513, the city was visited by its first European visitor, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], the Portuguese envoy.<ref name=\"Zahorka\">{{cite book | title = The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with the Royal Center of Bogor | first = Herwig | last = Zahorka | publisher = Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka | location = Jakarta | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xSRwAAAAMAAJ&q}}</ref>{{rp|40}} According to his report, the city of ''Daio'' (''Dayeuh'' is a Sundanese term for \"capital city\") was great city, with population around 50,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|404}}\n\nThe tradition hailed that King Jayadewata ruled justly from his beautiful ''Kadatwan'' (palace) called ''Sri Bima Punta Narayana Madura Suradipati'' at Pakuan Pajajaran, and his reign is celebrated as the golden age for Sundanese people.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}}\n\nAfter the reign of King Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja), Pakuan Pajajaran served as the royal capital for several generations. ''Dayeuh'' Pakuan Pajajaran served as the capital of Sunda Kingdom approximately for almost a hundred years (1482 \u2013 1579), until it was razed and destroyed by the [[Sultanate of Banten]] in 1579.\n\nBecause Pakuan, the capital city of the Sunda kingdom laid between two parallel rivers, Ciliwung and Cisadane, it was called ''Pajajaran'' (lit. place laid between two parallel things) or [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]. Although primary local and European historical records referred to the kingdom in the western part of [[Java island]] as the Sunda Kingdom, the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], especially after the establishment of [[the Sultanate of Banten]] and [[The Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], referred to the kingdom (minus the coastal sultanates) as \"Pakuan Pajajaran\" Kingdom, or simply as Pakuan Kingdom or Pajajaran Kingdom. The later name \u2013 Pajajaran \u2013 is more familiar for people residing in West Java and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] of [[Sultanate of Mataram|Mataram]] region (current [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Solo, Central Java|Solo]]).\n\n==Government and economy==\n===Administration===\n[[File:Makuta Binokasih.jpg|thumb|upright|''Makuta Binokasih Sanghyang Pak\u00e9'', the royal crown of Sunda kingdom. After the fall of Pajajaran to Banten, the crown was evacuated to [[Kingdom of Sumedang Larang|Sumedang Larang]] and become their regalia.]]\nIn many historical sources, including manuscripts, inscriptions, as well as foreign historical accounts from  \nChina and Portuguese reports, all refer to \"Sunda\" as a [[Realm|kingdom]]. On the other hand, the term \"Pakuan\" and \"Pajajaran\" or \"Dayeuh\" refer to its capital which corresponds to the modern city of Bogor. The tangible evidence on the existence of a kingdom as an administrative social structure, was found in [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] dated 952 Saka (1030 CE), that mentioned ''Prahajyan Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (Sunda Kingdom), with Sri Jayabhupati claimed as ''haji ri Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (the king of Sunda).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|402}}\n\nAccording to Tom\u00e9 Pires report (1513), the Sunda kingdom is ruled by a paramount ''raja'' (king or monarch), and the right of throne inheritance descended from a father to his son. However, in the case when a king did not produce a male heir, the successor is elected from the lesser kings, the rulers of regional towns or provinces.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|403}} These lesser kings is called ''Tohaan'' (lord) that acts as local governor, and mostly are related to the king, which means they belongs in the same dynasty.\n\nMuch of  our current knowledge on detailed social order and the bureaucracy structure of the kingdom, is owed to the Sundanese manuscript of [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]], compiled around 1518.\n{{quotation|\n| quote  = ''...nihan sinangguh dasa prebakti ngaranya.

As mentioned in some fragments of this manuscript:<br/> \n''\"..., ti Kandangwesi pamwat siya ka Pakwan...\"'' (\"... from Kandangwesi the tribute was sent to Pakuan\"), <br/> \n''\"..., anaking sang Prebu Rama, Resi samadaya sarerea siya marek ka Pakwan unggal tahun...\"'' (\"... my son the chief of the village, the ''[[rishi]]s'' together all paid a visit to Pakuan every years\").<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|405}}\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Leuit os 080815-2283 srna.jpg|thumb|upright|A Sundanese woman retrieving rice from a [[leuit]], Sundanese economy mainly rely on rice agriculture]]\nThe economy of Sunda kingdom relied on [[agriculture]], especially [[rice]] cultivation; this is reflected in [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] culture and the annual ceremonies of crop seeding and ''Seren Taun'' rice harvest festival. The harvest ceremony also allowed the king's official to collect [[tax]] in the form of rice that can be stored in the state's ''[[Leuit]]'' (rice [[barn]]).\n\nAccording to Siksakanda ng Karesian, Sundanese farmers during the era of Sunda Kingdom did recognize ''sawah'' or the [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]]. However, the widespread rice cultivation system applied in the kingdom seems to be the ''ladang'' or the [[Upland rice|dry-field rice]] which is a much simpler form of cultivation that doesn't require an elaborate social structure to support it. This is corresponds with the geography and topography of West Java which dominated by the central [[Parahyangan]] Plateau, in contrast with Central and East Java that consists of river valleys between volcanoes. As the result, compared to Central and East Java, West Java at that time was more sparsely populated, consists of settlements, villages or hamlet quite isolated deep within highland valleys, which render direct administrative control from the kingdom's central government rather difficult.\n\nThe kingdom was also well known as the world's main producer of high quality [[black pepper|pepper]]. The kingdom participated in spice trade network in the archipelago. The ports of Sunda participated in international trades in the region.\n\nIn [[Suma Oriental]], written in 1512-1515, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], a Portuguese explorer report about the ports of Sunda:\n{{quotation|First the king of ''\u00c7umda'' (Sunda) with his great city of ''Dayo'', the town and lands and port of ''Bantam'', the port of ''Pomdam'' (Pontang), the port of ''Cheguide'' (Cigede), the port of ''Tamgaram'' (Tangerang), the port of ''Calapa'' ([[Sunda Kalapa|Kelapa]]), and the port of ''Chemano'' (Chi Manuk or Cimanuk), this is Sunda, because the river of Chi Manuk is the limit of both kingdoms.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |p = 166 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nAnother Portuguese explorer, Diogo do Couto, wrote that the Sunda kingdom is thriving and abundant; it lies between Java and Sumatra, separated from the latter by the  [[Sunda Strait]]. Many islands lie along the coast of this kingdom within the strait, for nearly the space of forty leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}}; the strait's widest point is about twenty-five and narrowest point only twelve leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}} broad. Bantam is about the midpoint. All the islands are well timbered, but have little water. A small one called Macar, at the entrance of Sunda Strait, is said to have much gold.\n\nHe also noted that the principal ports of the Sunda kingdom were Banten, Ache, Chacatara (Jakarta), which annually receive twenty sommas, ships from Chienheo, China, to ship the eight thousand ''bahars'', which are equal to 3,000,000&nbsp;kg<!--unless some unit other than 100 kg was called a quintal here, was \"thirty thousand quintals--> of pepper the kingdom produced.\n\nBantam is situated at 6\u00b0 south latitude, in the middle of a bay, three leagues from point to point. The town is eight hundred and fifty fathoms{{vague|English fathoms, or something else?|date=January 2010}} in length, and the seaport extends about 400. A river capable of admitting junks and galleys flows through the middle of the town: a small branch of this river admits boats and small craft.\n\nThere is a brick fort, the walls of which are seven palms thick{{vague|human palms or palm trees?|date=July 2012}}, with wooden bulwarks, armed with two tiers of artillery. The anchorage is good, with a muddy or sandy bottom and a depth from two to six fathoms.\n\n==Culture and society==\n===Religion===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=320|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=KITLV 87602 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|image2=KITLV 87603 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest at Telaga near Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|footer=Hindu ritual objects; bells, small statue, [[trishula]] and ornament of ritual staff made of bronze, from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java. These objects was belongs to Brahmin Hindu priest, Hinduism was a dominant faith in Sunda Kingdom.}}\n\n[[Hinduism]] was one of the earliest religious influences established in West Java since the era of [[Tarumanagara]], circa early 5th century CE. In fact, West Java was one of the earliest place in Indonesia that being Indianized, also sparked the historic period of Indonesian history by producing the earliest inscription in Java. As Tarumanagara's successor, Sunda Kingdom has inherited this Hindu civilization influences.\n \nThe culture of the people in Sunda kingdom blends [[Hinduism]] with [[Sunda Wiwitan]]; a native [[shamanism]] belief, and also a traces of [[Buddhism]] is observeable. Several intact prehistoric [[megalithic]] sites, such as Cipari site in [[Kuningan]] and the Pangguyangan [[menhir]] and stepped pyramid in Cisolok, [[Sukabumi]], suggest that native shamanic [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] beliefs coexisted with Hinduism and Buddhism. The native belief, Sunda Wiwitan, persists today as a way of life for the [[Baduy people|Baduy]] or Kanekes people who resist Islam and other foreign influences.\n\nThe [[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple in Leles, [[Garut]], dated from the 8th century, was dedicated to [[Shiva]] and built during the Galuh kingdom. Buddhist influence came to West Java through the [[Srivijaya]] conquest, as the empire dominated West Java until the 11th century. The brick [[stupas]] in [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] indicate Buddhist influence in West Java, while nearby [[Cibuaya]] sites show Hindu influence.\n\nThe manuscript [[Carita Parahyangan]] clearly demonstrate [[Hinduism]] spirituality within the Sunda Kingdom society. This manuscript is opened with a legendary character named Sang Resi Guru that had a son named Rajaputra. Comprehensively the manuscript was written by Hindu scholar which demonstrate Hindu frame of references.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}} The Hindu pantheon, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara, Rudra, Sadasiva, Yama, Varuna, Kuvera, Indra and Besravaka, were also mentioned in ancient Sundanese manuscript of [[Sewakadharma]] or also known as ''Serat Dewabuda'', dated 1357 Saka or 1435 CE.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}}\n\nThe Sundanese manuscript of spiritual guidance, the [[Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]] also demonstrate Hinduism religious outlook and frame of references, although it seems already mixed with some sorts of Buddhism spirituality. ''\" ... ini na lakukeuneun, talatah sang sadu jati.

Sunda kingdom period, circa 14th century.]]\nThe culture of Sunda kingdom centred on agricultural activity, especially [[rice]] cultivation. [[Dewi Sri|Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]] or Sanghyang Asri, the goddess of rice, is revered as the main deity or the highest goddess within Sundanese [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The priest was concerning about the religious ceremonies and the king and his subjects participated in annual ceremonies and festivals such as the blessing of the rice seeds ceremonies and harvest festival. The annual ''[[Seren Taun]]'' rice harvest festival is still practised today in traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] communities.\n\nAccording to the [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, the courtly culture of Sunda [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]] and its nobles' etiquette in Pakuan Pajajaran was sophisticated. However no traces of the palace or buildings survived in the former capital, probably because their wood construction decayed over the centuries.\n\nThe [[Portugal|Portuguese]] source provide a glimpse of the culture and customs of the Sunda kingdom. In his report \u201c[[Suma Oriental]] (1512\u20131515)\u201d [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] wrote:\n\n{{quotation|Sunda kingdom is very rich. The land of Sunda has as much as four thousands horses which come there from Priaman (Sumatera) and other islands to be sold. It has up to forty elephants; these are for the king\u2019s array. An inferior gold, of six carats, is found. There is abundance tamarinds which serve the native for vinegar.\n\nThe city where the king is most of the year is the great city of Dayo. The city has well-built houses of the palm leaf and wood. They say that the king\u2019s house has three hundred and thirty wooden pillars as thick as a wine cask, and five fathoms (8 m) high, and beautiful timber work on the top of the pillars, and a very well-built house. The city is two days journey from the chief port, which is called [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]].\n\nThe people of the sea coast get along well with the merchants in the land. They are accustomed to trade. These people of Sunda very often come to Malacca to trade. They bring cargo lancharas, ships of a hundred and fifty tons. Sunda has up to six junks and many lancharas of the sunda kind, with masts like a crane, and steps between each so that they are easy to navigate.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe people of Sunda are said to be truthful. They, with great city of Dayo, the town and lands and port of Bantam, the port of Pontang, the port of Cheguide, the port of Tangaram, the Port of Tangaram, the port of Calapa, the port of chi Manuk. are justly governed. The king is a great sportsman and hunter. The kingdom descends from father to son. The women are handsome, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes. There are monasteries of convents for the women, into which the nobles put their daughters, when they cannot match them in marriage according to their wishes. The married women, when their husband die, must, as point of honour, die with them, and if they should be afraid of death they put into the convents. The inhabitants are not very warlike, much addicted to their idolatries. They are fond of rich arms, ornamented with gold and inlaid work. Their krises are gilt, and also the point of their lances.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\n[[File:Padrao sunda kelapa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Luso Sundanese padr\u00e3o|''Padr\u00e3o'' of Sunda Kalapa]] (1522), a stone pillar with a [[cross]] of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] commemorating a treaty between [[Portugal|Portuguese Kingdom]] and Hindu Sunda Kingdom, at [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].]]\nThe Kingdom is commonly thought as the successor of [[Tarumanagara]] which also flourished in the same location of Western Java. It seems that in its early history, around 10th to 11th century, Sunda Kingdom was stuck in between two competing mandalas; the Malay Srivijaya in Sumatra in the west and its Javanese neighbouring kingdom in the east.\n\nIn early of its history, the kingdom seems served as the vassal of [[Srivijaya]]n mandala. By the 10th century, the kingdom seems to break loose, liberated from Srivijayan mandala as stated by [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Rakryan Juru Pangambat inscription]] (932 CE). However, according to the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] book ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'',<ref>[[Friedrich Hirth]] and [[W.W.

The popular hero, King [[Sanjaya of Mataram]] known as the Javanese Mataram King mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732), was also mentioned in Sundanese manuscript Carita Parahyangan; as having his root in Sunda Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] (1030) shows Javanese cultural influence, as the style of script, letters, language, and the title of the king is similar to royal names in East Javanese Medang court. However, the relations might be not quite harmonious, as according to 11th century East Javanese [[Horren inscription]], mentioned ''\u00e7atru Sunda'', which means the village of Horren was attacked by \"the enemy (from) Sunda\".<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nThe relations between Sundanese and Javanese kingdoms descended to a new low, when a disastrous incident took place in [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat square in Majapahit]] in 1357, killing all of Sundanese royal party, including the Sunda king Prabu Maharaja and Princess Tohaan [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]].

The example is ''suvarna'' (lit:\"good color\") used to describe gold. ''Sunda'' is also another name for Hindu God [[Vishnu]]. In Sanskrit, the term ''Sundara'' (masculine) or ''Sundari'' (feminine) means \"beautiful\" or \"excellence\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&script=ia&tran_input=Sunda&direct=au|title=Sunda, Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|last=Glashoff|first=Klaus|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| url         = http://www.sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=sunda&lang=sans&action=Search\n| title       = Sunda in Sanskrit Dictionary\n| accessdate  = 20 November 2014\n| publisher   = Sanskrit Dictionary\n}}\n</ref> The term ''Sunda'' also means bright, light, purity, cleanness and white.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |title       = Watak Budaya Sunda\n |access-date  = 24 October 2011\n |last        = Kurnia\n |first       = Iwan\n |date        = 14 August 2007\n |publisher   = Kasundaan.org\n |language    = Indonesian\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831145939/http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |archive-date = 31 August 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe name ''Sunda'' is also known in Hindu mythology of [[Sunda and Upasunda]], as one of the powerful [[Asura]] brothers that received the boon of invulnerability from [[Brahma]]. The powerful Asura brothers then set out to conquering the world, and menacing the Gods. In the  end they fought each other over [[Tilottama]], a beautiful [[Apsara]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/sunda|title=Sunda, \u015aunda, Shunda: 6 definitions|last=www.wisdomlib.org|website=www.wisdomlib.org|access-date=2018-06-04|date=29 June 2012}}</ref> The story of Sunda and Upasunda is found in the [[Mahabharata]], Book I: Adi Parva. It is not clear however, whether the [[eponym]]ous ''Sunda'' was derived from this Hindu myth.\n\nIt seems that by the 10th century, the name ''Sunda'' was used by foreigners, possibly by early Indian explorers, Malay Srivijayan traders and colonizer, also Javanese neighbours, as a toponym to identify the Western parts of Java. The [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat inscription]] dated from 854 Saka (932 CE) confirmed this. The name is then used by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] to identify  their western neighbour, also rival and enemy, as mentioned in [[Horren inscription]] (c. 11th century) from Kediri.\n\nAn early 13th century Chinese account reported the pepper port of ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), which probably refer to the port of Banten or Sunda Kalapa. By the 15th to 16th century, after the consolidation of the kingdom by [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], the name ''Sunda'' has shifted from a possibly eponymous toponymy, into a name that identify a kingdom and its people. Thus subsequently gave birth, name and identity to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Sundanese people]].\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:KITLV 87649 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Batoetoelis at Buitenzorg - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|[[Batutulis inscription]] (dated 1533), in [[Bogor]], commemorate the great King of Sunda [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]] (rule 1482-1521).]]\nKnowledge of the kingdom among [[Sundanese people]] has been kept alive through Sundanese ''[[Pantun Sunda|Pantun]]'' oral tradition, the chant of poetic verses about the golden age of Sunda Pajajaran, and the legend of [[Prabu Siliwangi]], the most popular king of Sunda.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rFvsBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi#v=onepage&q=Pantun%20Sunda%20Siliwangi&f=false|title=Java Essay: The History and Culture of a Southern Country|last=Iguchi|first=Masatoshi|date=2017-01-25|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784628857|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=chJvAAAAMAAJ&q=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi|title=Kebudayaan Sunda: Zaman Pajajaran|last=Ekajati|first=Edi Suhardi|date=2005|publisher=Pustaka Jaya|isbn=9789794193341|language=id}}</ref>\n\nSeveral stone inscriptions mention the kingdom, such as [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat]], [[Jayabupati inscription|Jayabupati]], [[Kawali inscription|Kawali]], and [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]].

However, currently the Wangsakerta manuscripts are generally discounted as a valid historical source among historians, since this controversial manuscript is suspected as a fraud containing [[pseudohistory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lubis|first=Nina H.|date=2012-08-03|title=Kontroversi Tentang Naskah Wangsakerta|url=https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jurnal-humaniora/article/view/741|journal=Humaniora|language=id|volume=14|issue=1|pages=20\u201326|doi=10.22146/jh.v14i1.741|issn=2302-9269|doi-broken-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radarcirebon.com/mengungkap-kontroversi-naskah-wangsakerta-2.html|title=Mengungkap Kontroversi Naskah Wangsakerta - Radar Cirebon|date=2013-12-14|work=Radar Cirebon|access-date=2018-06-03|language=id-ID}}</ref>\n\n===Local account===\nThe earliest reference to the name \"Sunda\" being used to identify a kingdom is the [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]] dated 854 Saka (932 AD). The inscription was in old [[Javanese script]], but the language used was [[Old Malay]]. It translates as follows:\n\n{{quotation|This memorial stone is to remark the saying of Rakryan Juru Pangambat (Royal Hunter), in 854 Saka, that the order of government is returned to the power of king of Sunda.}}\n\nThe inscription chandrasengkala ([[chronogram]]) written 458 Saka, however some historians suggested that the year of the inscription must be read backward as 854 Saka (932 AD) because the Sunda kingdom could not have existed in 536 AD, in the era of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara (358-669 AD).\n\nAnother reference to the kingdom is the [[Jayabupati inscription]] which consists of 40 lines written on four pieces of stone found on the Cicatih river bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]]. The inscription is written in old [[Javanese script]]. The four inscriptions are now stored at the National Museum in Jakarta, under the codes D 73 (Cicatih), D 96, D 97 and D 98. The contents of the inscriptions (according to Pleyte):\n\n{{quotation|Peace and well-being.

Whoever breaks the law will be punished by these supranatural beings, die in horrible way like their brain being sucked, blood being drunk, intestines being destroyed, and chest is split in two. O being known by thee.., all the spirits.}}\n\nThe date of the Jayabupati inscription may be 11 October 1030. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years, from 952 to 964 saka (1030 - 1042 AD). The inscription has an East Javanese style in lettering, language, and style, and mentions the current king by name.\n\nCopperplate letters dating to the 15th century, including royal instructions, also imply the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. The copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of collecting taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nKebantenan II inscription (Sunda Sembawa I) copperplate inscription announces Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482\u20131521), the king staying in Pakuan, approving an already delineated sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') put at the disposal of the ''wiku'' (priests), which must not be split as it houses facilities for worship, which belong to the king. Kebantenan III inscription (Sunda Sembawa II) copperplate announces the king of Sunda's sanctions of holy construction in Sunda Sembawa. The Kebantenan IV (Gunung Samaya) inscription says that Sri Baduga Maharaja, who ruled in Pakuan, sanctioned a sacred place (''tanah devasana'') at Gunung (mount) Samya (Rancamaya), the mentions a similar sacred estate to the one described in the Kebantenan II inscription.\n\nThe primary source that contains information about the daily life of late 15th to early 16th century Sunda Kingdom was found in [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript. The names of places, culture and customs, was described in great detail, it is one of the important specimen of Old [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] literature. The main character is Prince Jaya Pakuan alias Bujangga Manik, a Sundanese Hindu hermit, who, though a prince at the court of [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], preferred to live a life of a man of religion. As a hermit he made two journeys from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] to central and eastern Java and back, the second one including a visit to [[Bali]]. After his return he practised asceticism on a mountain in western Java, where his bodily existence came to an end.<ref name=\"Noorduyn 2006 437\">{{cite book | last =Noorduyn | first =J. | publisher= KITLV Press | title = Three Old Sundanese poems | year =2006| page =437\n}}</ref>  The manuscript dated from pre-Islamic Sunda.

Hirt and W. W. Rockhill, there are Chinese sources concerning the Sunda Kingdom. At the time of the Southern Sung Dynasty, the inspector of trade with foreign countries, [[Chau Ju-kua]], collected reports from sailors and merchants who had visited foreign countries. His report on far countries, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written from 1178 to 1225 AD, mentions the deepwater harbour of Sin-t\u2019o (Sunda). Chu-fan-chi reported that:\n\n{{quotation|All along the shores, people are dwelling.

Both men and women wrap round their loins a piece of cotton, and in cutting their hair they only leave it half an inch long. The [[Black pepper|pepper]] grown on the hills (of this country) is small-grained, but heavy and superior to that of [[Tuban|Ta-pan]] (eastern Java). The country produces pumpkins, sugar cane, [[bottle gourd]], beans and [[egg plant]]s. As, however, there is no regular government in this country, the people are given to brigandage, on which account foreign traders rarely go there.}}\n\nAccording to this source, the kingdom of Sunda produced high quality black pepper. The kingdom located in the western parts of Java near [[Sunda Strait]], corresponds to today Banten, Jakarta and west part of West Java province. According to this source, the port of Sunda was under [[Srivijaya]] mandala domination. Port of Sunda was highly possible refer to [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]] instead of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]. Its capital is located 10 kilometres inland southward in [[Banten Girang]] near Mount [[Pulosari]].\n \nThe Chinese book \u201cshun-feng hsiang-sung\" from about 1430 AD relates:\n\n{{quotation|In this voyage eastward from Sunda, along the north coast of Java, ships steered 97 1/2o for three watches to make [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]; they then followed the coast (past Tanjung Indramayu), finally steering 187 1/2o for four watches to reach Cirebon. Ships from Banten proceeded eastward along the north coast of Java, past [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]], past Indramayu head, past Cirebon.}}\n\nAccording to this source the port of Sunda was located west of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]] and later identified as [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]].\n\n===European account===\n[[File:Java-Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old map of Java still thought that land of Sunda in the west is separated with the rest of Java island. Here the capital of Sunda is called ''Daio'' which refer to Dayeuh Pakuan Pajajaran]]\nEuropean explorers, mainly Portuguese based in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], also reported the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] (1513) mentioned a Western Java kingdom that had established trade relation with them as ... ''Reg\u00f1o de \u00c7umda'' ..., which means \"The Kingdom of Sunda\".

It is not sure however, whether it was actually a continuous polity or not, nor whether its rulers belongs to a single continuous lineage of dynasty or not. This is because the scarcity of evidences, historical records and archaeological findings that plausibly connected to this kingdom.\n\nThe earlier period is unclear, and quite speculative at its best. Much owed to only two manuscripts dated from much later period, the [[Carita Parahyangan]] and Wangsakerta manuscripts. The history of later period however, after late 14th century, is quite clear. Especially after the reign of King Wastu Kancana and Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja). This is contributed mainly to the availability of historical sources, including numbers of foreign reports, especially Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]]; several stone inscriptions especially [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]]; and native primary historical manuscripts of [[Bujangga Manik]] and [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]].\n\n====Formation and growth====\nAccording to the Wangsakerta manuscript, King Tarusbawa from Sunda Sambawa, a vassal kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]], succeeded his father-in-law as the 13th king of Tarumanagara. Tarumanagara's prestige and power had been declining, likely due to a series of invasions from [[Srivijaya]]. Wishing to restore the glory of King Purnawarman, who reigned from the Purasaba (capital city) of Sundapura, in 670 AD Tarusbawa renamed Tarumanagara to the Sunda Kingdom. This event is confirmed by a Chinese source mentioning Tarumanagara's last envoy was in 669 AD. Tarusbawa sent his emissary to the Chinese Emperor at the time to advise him of his ascension to the throne in 669 AD. He was crowned on the ninth of the month of Jesta, in 591 Saka, which corresponds to 18 May 669 AD.\n\n====Separation of Galuh and Sunda Kingdom====\n[[File:Sunda-Galuh.gif|thumb|right|[[Citarum River]] separates Sunda and Galuh]] According to the Wangsakerta manuscript, Wretikandayun, the lord of another former vassal kingdom of Tarumanagara, [[Galuh Kingdom]], used the establishment of the Sunda Kingdom as an excuse to split eastern Taruma from Tarusbawa's Sunda. Since the crown prince of Galuh was the son-in-law of [[Queen Shima]] of [[Kalingga]], a Hindu kingdom in central Java, Wretikandayun, supported by Kalingga, demanded that the remnant of what was known as Tarumanagara's territory be divided into two kingdoms. Finding himself in an unfortunate position and unwilling to risk a civil war, King Tarusbawa granted Wretikandayun's demand. In 670 AD, Tarumanagara was divided into two kingdoms: the Sunda Kingdom in the west, and the Galuh Kingdom in the east, separated by the Tarum (Citarum) River.\n\n====Sanna and Purbasora====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple a shrine for Shiva, dated from the 8th century Galuh Kingdom.]]\nWretikandayun, the King of Galuh has two sons; Sempakwaja and Mandiminyak. Despite being the eldest son, Sempakwaja was not chosen as the successor because he was toothless, a shameful physical defect considered unsuitable for a king at that time. Thus, his younger brother, Mandiminyak (r. 702-709) inherited the Galuh throne from Wretikandayun instead. Sempakwaja then established a rural principality of Galunggung Kingdom. \n\nSempakwaja has a son named Purbasora, while King Mandiminyak also has a son named Sena or Bratasena. However, there was a circulating rumours in the palace; that actually instead of cousins; Purbasora and Sena were actually brothers. This was because Prince Sena was the result of a forbidden affair between Mandiminyak and his own sister in-law; the beautiful wife of Sempakwaja.\n\nAfter the death of Mandiminyak, Prince Bratasena or Sena (r. 709-716), ascends as the new king; as the third monarch of Galuh. According to Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts; King Sena of Galuh married to Princess Sannaha of Kalingga in Central Java, and they had Sanjaya as their son and heir. In an attempt to nurture a good relations with the neighboring Sunda Kingdom, King Sena established a friendship with King Tarusbawa of Sunda. This friendship encouraged Tarusbawa to take Sanjaya as his son-in-law.\n\nPurbasora, son of Batara Danghyang Guru Sempakwaja of the Galunggung Kingdom, also grandson of Wretikandayun, the founder of Galuh, deeply resent the reign of his cousin; King Sena. This was because he felt that instead of Sena that had a doubtful scandalous origin, he is more deserving to the throne of Galuh. With the aid of his father-in-law, King Indraprahasta, from a kingdom near present-day [[Cirebon]], Purbasora rebelled, launched his coup and usurped Sena as the king of Galuh in 716. Defeated, Sena fled to [[Kalingga]], the kingdom of his wife's grandmother, Queen Shima.\n\nSince the crown prince of Sunda died before King Tarusbawa, Princess Tejakencana (the daughter of the crown prince) was hailed as the heiress of Sunda. She married Rakeyan Jamri, son of Bratasena (the third king of Galuh Kingdom and a son of Wretikandayun) and Princess Sanaha (from [[Kalingga]]). In 723, Jamri succeeded Tarusbawa as the second king of Sunda. As the lord of Sunda, he was known as Prabu Harisdarma and laterwhen he ascended the throne of Galuh he was known as [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]].\n\n====Sanjaya and Balangantrang====\n[[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of Sena, determined to take revenge to Purbasora's rebellion. He requested aid from King Tarusbawa of Sunda, a friend of Sena. His wish was realised when he became the king of Sunda, reigning on behalf of his wife.\n\nHe prepared a special force, which he placed in the Gunung Sawal area with the help of Rabuyut Sawal, also a dear friend of Sena. This special force was led by Sanjaya, while the Sunda army was led by Patih Anggada. The raid was launched at nightfall. Almost all of Purbasora's family was wiped out, except for Bimaraksa, Purbasora's son-in-law; the minister of Galuh escaped with a handful of guards.\n\nBimaraksa, also known as Ki Balangantrang, was the Senapati (army general) of the kingdom. Balangantrang was also the grandson of Wretikandayun, as a child of his second son, Resi Guru Jantaka or Rahyang Kidul, and was also considered unfit to succeed Wretikandayun because he suffered from a [[hernia]]. Balangantrang hid in the village of G\u00e8g\u00e8r Sunten and raised anti-Sanjaya forces. He was supported by the kings of Kuningan and also by the remnants of the Indraprahasta army. Indraphrasta was annihilated by Sanjaya as revenge for helping Purbasora to oust Sena.\n\nSena asked Sanjaya to honour all of the Galuh royal family, except Purbasora. Sanjaya himself was not interested in ruling Galuh. He merely attacked it to fulfill his father's wish to take revenge on Purbasora's family. After defeating Purbasora, Sanjaya asked his granduncle, Sempakwaja, in Galunggung to order Demunawan, the younger brother of Purbasora, to reign in Galuh. But Sempakwaja declined, fearing this to be Sanjaya's trick to annihilate Demunawan.\n\nSanjaya himself could not find Balangantrang, so he accepted the Galuh throne. Realizing that he was unwelcomed at the Galuh court, and also that he was a Sunda king who must reside in Pakuan, he put Premana Dikusuma, grandson of Purbasora, in charge of Galuh. Premana Dikusuma at that time was a vassal king. At the age of 43 (born in 683 AD), he was already known as Rsi or an ascetic monk, because of his passion for learning and spiritual teaching since a young age, he is also known as Bagawat Sajalajaya.\n\nSanjaya also had legitimate right to Kalingga's throne (from his grandmother's side). Thus in 732 AD he chose to live in [[Kalingga]] (in the northern part of central Java) and later established the [[Mataram Kingdom]] and [[Sanjaya Dynasty]]. In 732 he gave his right to western Java to his son from Tejakencana, Prince Tamperan (Rakeyan Panaraban). Rakeyan was a half-brother of Rakai Panangkaran, Sanjaya's son from Sudiwara (daughter of Dewasinga, king of southern Kalingga).\n\n====Reunification of Sunda and Galuh====\nThe [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kingdoms of Sunda and Galuh coexisted under a strange and complex relationship; occasionally united under one ruler, and at other times as separated kingdoms under different rulers, albeit allied or related.\nThe two kingdoms united as the Sunda Kingdom under the following kings:\n* Sanjaya (723 \u2013 732 AD) with the capital city in Kawali Galuh (present-day [[Ciamis]] city)\n* Tamperan or Rakeyan Panaraban (in 732 - 739 AD) with the capital in Kawali Galuh\n* Wuwus (819 \u2013 891 AD) with the capital city in Pakuan (present-day [[Bogor]] City)\n* Darmaraksa (891 \u2013 895 AD) with the capital in Pakuan\n* Prabu Guru Darmasiksa with the capital city in Sawunggalah (present-day [[Kuningan]] city)\n* Rakeyan Jayadarma resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ragasuci (1297\u20131303 AD) resided in Saunggalah\n* Prabu Citraganda (1303\u20131311 AD) resided in Pakuan\n* Prabu Lingga Dewata (1311\u20131333 AD) perhaps resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ajiguna Wisesa (1333\u20131340 AD) resided in Kawali.\n* Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana (1340\u20131357 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Mangkubumi Suradipati/Prabu Bunisora (1357\u20131371 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Raja Wastu/Niskala Wastu Kancana (1371\u20131475 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482 to 1521 AD) resided in Pakuan\n\n====Rakryan Juru Pangambat====\nAccording to [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]], dated from 854 Saka (932 CE), discovered in Kebon Kopi village, [[Bogor]], a noble which also a skilled hunter named Juru Pangambat, declared that the authority (order) is returned to the king of Sunda.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|381}} This inscription was written in [[Kawi alphabet]], however curiously the language being used is [[Old Malay]]. Archaeologist [[F. D. K. Bosch]], that had studied the inscription, proposed that the use of Old Malay suggests [[Srivijaya]]n influence on Western Java. French historian, Claude Guillot from [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] proposed that this was a declaration of independence (possibly from Srivijaya) of the Kingdom of Sunda.\n\n====Jayabupati====\n[[File:Sanghyang Tapak inscription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]]]]\nAccording to [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]], dated from 952 saka (1030 CE) found in Cicatih River bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]], Maharaja Sri Jayabupati established a sacred sanctuary of Sanghyang Tapak. Strangely the style of the inscriptions reveal an East Javanese style of script. Not only letters, language, and style, but the noble name of the king is similar to royal names in [[Dharmawangsa]]'s court of East Javanese [[Medang kingdom]]. This has led to suggestions that Sunda Kingdom at this time probably was under the influence of East Java, possibly a vassal. Or probably Jayabupati consciously subscribed to Javanese culture among Sundanese population.\n\nSri Jayabupati in [[Carita Parahyangan]] is mentioned as Prabu Detya Maharaja. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years (952-964) Saka (1030-1042). The 11th century [[Horren inscription]] of Southern Kediri, reported that ''\u00e7atru Sunda'' (enemy from Sunda) had invaded and menacing villages in East Java. It was not clear however, which Sundanese faction has committed such [[brigandage]] as far east to Kediri, nor whether Sri Jayabupati was responsible for this.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nAfter Sri Jayabupati, there is no stone inscription discovered mentioning the next ruler. There is no tangible evidence discovered from the period between 11th to 14th century. Most of our current knowledge about this period came from Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts.\n\nThe Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] source, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written circa 1200, [[Chou Ju-kua]] identified the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the [[Indonesian archipelago]] as [[Srivijaya]] and Java ([[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]). According to this source, in the early 13th Century, [[Srivijaya]] still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source describes the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (''rumah panggung''). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country.<ref>{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973 | location =Yogyakarta| pages =60 }}</ref> It was uncertain which port of Sunda was referred to by Chou Ju-kua, it probably referred to the port of [[Banten (town)|Banten]], and not Kalapa. It seems that by early 13th century, the maritime trade was still dominated by Srivijayan mandala based in Sumatra. The port of Sunda still pretty much served as a trading post or colony of Srivijaya. Nevertheless, the Sunda Kingdom in the inland west Java still enjoyed internal autonomy.\n\n====Rakeyan Jayadarma====\nAccording to Pustaka Rajyarajya i Bhumi Nusantara parwa II sarga 3, Rakeyan Jayadarma was the son-in-law of Mahisa Campaka of [[Singhasari]]. During the reign of Prabu Guru Dharmasiksa (1175\u20131297) Prince Jayadharma married Dyah Singamurti, also known as Dyah Lembu Tal. Sangrama Wijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]), the first King of [[Majapahit]], was the son of the Sunda king, Rakeyan Jayadharma. Except for Gajah Mada, who insisted on incorporating the Sunda Kingdom within the Majapahit realm, this is the likely reason why Majapahit kings were reluctant to attack the Sunda Kingdom. There was a sacred alliance between the Sunda Kingdom and the Majapahit Kingdom.\n\n====Golden age====\nThe name \"Sunda\" appeared again in Javanese source. This time the [[Pararaton]] reported that in 1336, during the reign of Majapahit Queen [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]], at the inauguration of his newly appointed position as Patih Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister), [[Gajah Mada]] declared [[Palapa oath]], which stated his foreign policy to unify the archipelago under Majapahit domination. Gajah Mada said ''\"Lamun huwus kalah nusantara isun amukti palapa, lamun kalah ring Gurun, ring Seran, Ta\u00f1jung Pura, ring Haru, ring Pahang, Dompo, ring Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Tumasik, samana isun amukti palapa\"''. Sunda was mentioned as one of kingdoms targeted by Mada's overseas campaign. It seems by early 14th century, Kingdom of Sunda has grown quite prosperous and took part in international maritime trade. Quite significantly, so the kingdom has attracted the interest of Majapahit Prime Minister.\n\n====Maharaja Lingga Buana====\n{{Further|Battle of Bubat}}\nThe [[Carita Parahyangan]] and [[Pararaton]] simply named him as ''Pr\u011bbu Maharaja''. While the Wangsakerta manuscript give a detailed name of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. He resided in Kawali Galuh. He died in the [[Battle of Bubat]], Majapahit, in 1357, fell victim to a [[Stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] crafted by the Majapahit prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]]. The tragedy's prelude came with the intention of [[Hayam Wuruk]], the king of Majapahit, to marry Princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi|Dyah Pitaloka]] (also known as Citraresmi), a daughter of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. Delighted by the prospect to foster an alliance with the most powerful kingdom in the region, the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit, sailing through the Java Sea, to accompany and marry his daughter to Hayam Wuruk. The Sunda party erected the encampment on Bubat square in the northern part of [[Trowulan]], Majapahit capital, and awaited the proper wedding ceremony. Gajah Mada however, saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit overlordship, and insisted that instead of becoming the queen of Majapahit, the princess was to be presented as a concubine for the Majapahit king, as a token of her kingdom's submission. The Sunda king was angered and humiliated by Gajah Mada's demand.\n\nAs a result, there was a skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the [[Majapahit]] army. The Majapahit army decimated the Sunda royal family; almost the entire [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] royal party, including the princess, perished in this tragedy. Tradition mentioned that Princess Dyah Pitaloka committed suicide to defend the honour and pride of her country. After his death, Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana was revered by the Sundanese as Prabu Wangi (lit. king with pleasant fragrance) because of his heroic defence of his honour against Majapahit, and his descendants, the later kings of Sunda, were called Siliwangi (lit. successor of Wangi). The story of the [[Battle of Bubat]] is the main theme of the book [[Kidung Sunda]].\n\n====Niskala Wastu Kancana====\n{{main|Niskala Wastu Kancana}}\n[[File:KITLV 87612 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|One of [[Kawali inscription]]s]]\nKing Niskala Wastu Kancana was the youngest son of Prabu Maharaja and the brother of Princess Pitaloka Citraresmi, both perished in Majapahit. In 1371, Prince Wastu ascended to throne, stylized as Prabu Raja Wastu Kancana. According to [[Kawali inscription]], approximately dated from second half of the 14th century, mentioned that King Prabu Raja Wastu constructed the defensive structures; walls and moats surrounding Kawali city, and renovated Surawisesa palace.<ref name=\"Sejarah Jawa Barat\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dvR7CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA52&dq=Niskala+Wastu+Kancana#v=onepage&q=Niskala%20Wastu%20Kancana&f=false|title=Sejarah Daerah Jawa Barat|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|language=id}}</ref> The construction of moats and other defensive measures, was probably as a response to a perceived foreign threat. Since the relations between Sunda and its eastern neighbour, the powerful \nMajapahit empire, was badly deteriorated after the Bubat incident. Niskala Wastu resided in Kawali palace of Galuh, and ruled for 104 years (1371\u20131475).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|392}} His reign is remembered as a long era of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana was buried in Nusalarang, while his successor Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned ''Prebu Niskala Wastu Kancana surup di Nusalarang ring giri Wanakusumah'', while his successor was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu'''. In Carita Parahyangan, Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana is not mentioned completely, but only referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh). At this point, the Sunda Kingdom capital was still located in Galuh, more precisely in Kawali city.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|391}}\n\n====Ningrat Kancana====\nNiskala Wastu Kancana's son, named as Tohaan di Galuh (Lord of Galuh) in Carita Parahyangan, succeeded him as the king. He was mentioned in Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) inscription as Hyang Ningrat Kancana and in \nBatutulis inscription as Rahyang Dewa Niskala.\n\nThe new king however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\"<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}} The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or non-Hindu (Muslim) woman.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned that Tohaan di Galuh was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu''' died or buried in Gunung Tilu. Gunatiga and Gunung Tilu means \"Three mountains\" which corresponds to Gunung Tilu mountain range located east of the town of [[Kuningan]]. Today, Gunung Tilu marked as the boundary between West Java and [[Central Java]] provinces, located between [[Kuningan Regency]] and [[Brebes Regency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gn.+Tilu/@-7.1188884,108.6816571,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2e6f73efb54d5283:0x8ef28fb8de770294!8m2!3d-7.1188889!4d108.6991667!5m1!1e4|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n====Sri Baduga Maharaja====\n{{main|Sri Baduga Maharaja}}\n[[File:KITLV 87605 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Hindu-Javanese sculpture at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Statue of a Hindu god from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java, dated from Sunda Kingdom.]]\nSang Ratu Jayadewata or also known as Sri Baduga Maharaja, is a grandchild of Prabu Wastu Kancana or Prabu Niskala Wastu. Jayadewata is often linked with a popular character [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]] in the Sundanese oral tradition of [[Pantun]].\n\nKing Jayadewata moved the government seat from [[Kawali]] back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Pakuan]] in 1482. It is not clear however, the reason behind the transfer of capital westward from Kawali to Pakuan Pajajaran. It might be a geopolitical move to secure the capital away from the eastern threat from [[Demak Sultanate|Islamic state of Demak]] in Central Java. As by 1482, according to ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a Cirebon chronicle, Cirebon declared its independence from Sunda and no longer sent tribute to the Sunda court.\n\nBased on Kebantenan copperplate inscription, he established a sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') at Mount Samya (Rancamaya) and ordered that anyone entering was forbidden to disturb this area and forbade the imposition of taxes and other levies because this devasana contained royal facilities for worship. He also announced that holy construction in Sunda Sembawa, which should be cared for and be undisturbed because the area stipulated is the residential area of the wiku (priests).\n\nAccording to [[Batutulis inscription]], Sri Baduga Maharaja built defensive [[moat]]s surrounding [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]; he built \"gugunungan\" (sacred mounds), established huts and sacred Samya forest, reserves for wood destined for offerings, and the Talaga Rena Mahawijaya Lake. Certainly, there was a good road to [[Sunda Kalapa]] (present-day Jakarta Metropolitan city) too, the most important harbour of the Sunda kingdom. At the time of Tome Pir\u00e9s visit to Pakuan, Sri Baduga Maharaja reigned over the Sunda kingdom (1482 to 1521).\n\nThe year of his coronation in 1482 has been mentioned as the birth date of the present-day city of [[Bogor]]. However, there was an important settlement at the site already, and Pakuan had been the capital of the Sunda kingdom under previous kings. The reign of Ratu Jayadewata was hailed as the \"golden age\" of the Sundanese people. The kingdom consolidated its rule and exercised power throughout western part of Java. It also marked the era of great prosperity resulting from efficient agriculture management and the thriving pepper trade in the region. This era of great wealth also marked the beginning of Sunda kingdom's decline.\n\n====Decline====\nDuring the reign of Sang Ratu Jayadewata, there was already a group of Sunda inhabitant that has converted to a new faith ([[Islam]]), as testified by Portuguese account. Tom\u00e9 Pires in 1513 reported, there is a significant numbers of [[Muslim]]s resides in the port of Cimanuk, the easternmost port of Sunda Kingdom, which is the estuarine of [[Cimanuk River]] in present-day town of [[Indramayu]]. According to Portuguese report, the port of Cirebon which  is located just east from Cimanuk, is already a Muslim port by this time, ruled by Javanese.\n\nProbably these new converts were the people referred to in Carita Parahyangan as \"those who felt no peace because have violated (strayed from) ''[[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksa]]''\". Nevertheless, during this time, Islamic influence has not yet penetrated inland into the capital. As mentioned in Carita Parahyangan '' ... mana mo kadatangan ku musuh ganal, musu(h) alit ...'', which means the capital is \"safe from rough/coarse enemy, (as well as) soft/subtle enemy\". The term \"coarse enemy\" refer to actual invading foreign army, while \"subtle enemy\" refer to the propagation of a new faith or new religion that might upset the established spiritual order of the kingdom.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|394}}\n\nThe Kingdom of Sunda anxiously watched the growing influence of the expansive Islamic [[Sultanate of Demak]] that finally succeed to destroy [[Kediri (city)|Daha]], the remnant of Hindu [[Majapahit]] court, in 1517. As a result of this event, only [[Blambangan]] in the eastern edge of Java, and Sunda in the western part remained Hindu kingdoms in Java. Meanwhile, in the land of Sunda, Muslim influences start to penetrated the kingdom.\n\n====Rise of Muslim States, Cirebon and Banten====\n[[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, written circa the second half of 15th century (1450\u20131500) reported that the eastern boundary of Sunda Kingdom realm with its Javanese neighbour was the Cipamali river in present-day [[Brebes Regency]]. However, the Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]] in 1513 reported that the eastern border of Sunda Kingdom is located in the port of ''Chemano'' (Cimanuk), the estuarine of [[Manuk River]], which today corresponds to the town of [[Indramayu]]. Portuguese source also reported the presence of Muslim inhabitant and traders in Cimanuk. This means between 1450 and 1513 the Sunda kingdom has lost control on the area surrounding [[Cirebon]]; between Brebes and Indramayu. This signify the coastal Muslim Javanese push westward into once a traditional Sundanese area, as [[Demak Sultanate]] was responsible as the patron that led to the rise of Cirebon Sultanate.\n\nThe detail of Sunda Kingdom and its relations with the rise of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon Sultanate]], mostly were taken from the account of ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a manuscript of Cirebon chronicle explaining the advent of this Sultanate, which also claimed Cirebon as the rightful successor of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAccording to Purwaka Caruban Nagari, Sunda [[King Siliwangi]] married Nyai Subang Larang, daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati, which corresponds with the port of [[Cirebon]]. They had three children; Prince Walangsungsang born in 1423, Princess Rara Santang born in 1426, and Prince Kian Santang (Raden Sangara) born in 1428.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\"/> Although Prince Walangsungsang was the first-born son of Sunda King, the prince did not earned the right as a crown prince of Sunda Kingdom. This was because his mother, Nyai Subang Larang was not the ''prameswari'' ([[queen consort]]). Another reason was probably because of his conversion to Islam, probably influenced by his mother, Subang Larang whom was a Muslim woman. In 16th century West Java, the state's religion was Hinduism, [[Sunda Wiwitan]] (Sundanese ancestral religion) and Buddhism. It was his half brother, King Siliwangi's son from his third wife Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, who was chosen as crown prince.\n\nWalangsungsang, assisted by Ki Gedheng Danusela, established a new settlement called Dukuh Alang-alang on 8 April 1445. After Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang's death in 1447, Walangsungsang appointed as the ruler of the town and established a court and assumed a new title as Prince Cakrabuana. King Siliwangi sent his envoy Tumenggung Jagabaya and Raja Sengara (Cakrabuana's younger brother), to bestow Prince Carkrabuana with the title Tumenggung Sri Mangana. Cirebon grew into a thriving port, yet Cakrabuana still loyal to his father and sent tribute to the main court of Sunda. At that time Cirebon was still the vassal of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAfter his Resignation in 1479 CE, Cakrabuana was succeeded by his nephew, Sharif Hidayatullah (1448-1568), the son of Nyai Rara Santang (Syarifah Mudaim) and Sharif Abdullah of Egypt. He married his cousin, Nyi Mas Pakungwati daughter of Cakrabuana. He is popularly known with his posthumously name, [[Sunan Gunung Jati]]. In 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost one of its important ports, [[Cirebon]]. On 2 April 1482, Sunan Gunungjati, the ruler of [[Cirebon]] (and also the grandson of King Siliwangi), stated that Cirebon will no longer send tribute to [[Pajajaran]], which marked the proclamation of the [[Sultanate of Cirebon]] as independence from Sunda Pajajaran.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.cirebonkab.go.id/sekilas-kab-cirebon/sejarah-kabupaten-cirebon\n |title      = Sejarah Kabupaten Cirebon\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Cirebon Regency\n |accessdate = 16 January 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThe character described in Purwaka Caruban Nagari, as [[King Siliwangi]], both timeline and storyline, matched the historic character of Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana, referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh) in \nCarita Parahyangan. Tohaan di Galuh was the son and heir of Niskala Wastu Kancana. Ningrat Kancana however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\" The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or even non-Hindu (Muslim) woman. It is possible that the outsider forbidden woman mentioned here was Nyai Subang Larang, a Muslim woman daughter of port master of Muara Jati (Cirebon).\n\nThe pressure from coastal Javan Islamic states drove the king of Sunda, [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], to seek assistance from the Portuguese at [[Malacca]]. In 1512 and again in 1521, he sent his son, the crown prince Prabu Surawisesa also known as Ratu Sang Hyang (the Portuguese record it as Samian) to Malacca to request the Portuguese to sign a peace treaty, to trade in pepper and to build a fort at his main port of Sunda Kalapa.\n\nSunan Gunung Jati's son later also established the [[Sultanate of Banten]], which later become a menace for Hindu Sunda kingdom.\n\n====Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa====\nAfter Sri Baduga Maharaja's death in 1521, the succeeding kings, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa, also known as Ratu Sang Hyang whom the Portuguese called Ratu Samian, faced the threat of [[the Sultanate of Cirebon]] and [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] expanding nearer his kingdom. Under this threat, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa, who reigned from 1521 to 1535, concluded the treaty with [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese from Malacca]] to establish a warehouse and fortress at [[Sunda Kelapa]] in return for protection against the menace of these Islamic Sultanates.\n\n====Sunda\u2013Portuguese Treaty 1522====\n{{Main|Luso-Sundanese padr\u00e3o}}\nBy 1522, the Portuguese were ready to form a coalition with the King of Sunda to get access to his lucrative pepper trade. The commander of the fortress of Malacca at that time was Jorge de Albuquerque. He sent a ship, the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, under Captain Henrique Leme, to Sunda Kalapa with valuable gifts for the king of Sunda. Two written sources describe the concluding of the treaty in detail, the original Portuguese document of 1522 with the text of the treaty and the signatories of the witnesses, and a report on that event by [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] in his book ''Da \u00c1sia'', printed after 1777/78.\n\nAccording to these sources, the king welcomed them warmly upon their arrival. The crown prince had succeeded his father and was now King Prabu Surawisesa, although Barros called him King Sami\u00e3o. This Sunda ruler agreed to an arrangement of friendship with the King of Portugal and granted a fortress at the mouth of the Ciliwung River where the Portuguese could load as many ships as they wished with pepper. In addition, he pledged, dating from the start of construction on the fortress, each year he would donate one thousand sacks of pepper to the Portuguese king. The contract document was drafted into two copies and signed. On the said day in 1522, Henrique Leme of Portuguese and his entourage together with deputies of the King of Sunda, erected a commemoration stone, called [[Padr\u00e3o]], at the mouth of the Ciliwung River.\n\n====The fall of Sunda Kelapa====\nThis trade and defence treaty with the Portuguese, the [[Luso Sundanese Treaty]], was fallen apart tremendously due to Portuguese failure to deliver their promise to construct the fortress in Kalapa. The delay was caused by troubles in [[Portuguese Goa]] in [[India]]. To make things worse, [[Fatahillah]], a military general sent from Demak, managed to capture the [[Sunda Kalapa]] harbour just before the Portuguese returned.\n\nThe army of Paletehan or Fatahillah, also called Fadillah Khan (1487\u20131570), comprising around 1452 troops from the Cirebon-Demak alliance, conquered Sunda Kalapa. The Sunda military commander and his troops stationed in the port were all fallen. The harbour chief and his family, the royal minister, and all of the people working in the harbour were slaughtered. Most of the city was helplessly destroyed and razed, as the Sundanese reinforcements sent from Pakuan realised that their forces were too weak and retreated. Sunda Kingdom has lost its most important port, thus subsequently Sunda Kalapa Harbour was renamed [[Jayakarta]] or Jakarta by its Muslim conqueror.\n\nThirty Portuguese sailors, shipwrecked by storms, swam to the beach at Kalapa only to be killed by Fadillah Khan's men. The Portuguese recognised the political leadership had changed when they were not allowed to set foot on the land. As they were too weak for a battle, they set sail back to Malacca. The next year, a second attempt failed because of striking sailors angry at not having been paid.\n\n====Ongoing battles====\nThe failure to rely on Portuguese assistance has led Sunda Kingdom to fend for their own survival by themselves. Carita Parahyangan mentioned that during his 14 years of reign (1521\u20131535), King Sang Hyang (Surawisesa) has fought in 15 battles. Unbeatable, all in which he managed to repel the series of invading Muslim forces from Cirebon and Demak. He fought in Kalapa, Tanjung, Ancol Kiji, Wahanten Girang, Simpang, Gunung Batu, Saung Agung, Rumbut, Gunung, Gunung Banjar, Padang, Panggoakan, Muntur, Hanum, Pagerwesi, and Medangkahyangan.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}}\n\nThe war between Cirebon-Demak forces and the Sunda kingdom lasted for almost five years. The king lost around 1000 of his men. During this war, after Sunda Kalapa, Sunda Kingdom also lost another important port, the port of Banten to their Cirebon-Demak Muslim nemesis. [[Sunan Gunungjati]] (Syarif Hidayatullah) of Cirebon crowned his son, [[Maulana Hasanuddin of Banten|Hasanudin]], as the king of Banten under the auspices of the Sultan of Demak who, in turn, offered Hasanudin his sister's hand in marriage. Thus, a new dynasty was born at the same time as a new kingdom was created. Banten was established as the capital of this new sultanate, held as a [[province]] under [[Sultanate of Cirebon]].<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Guillot\n  | first =Claude\n  | publisher= Gramedia Book Publishing Division\n  | title = The Sultanate of Banten\n  | year =1990\n| page =18\n| url =\n| accessdate =  }}</ref> Finally, in 1531, a peace treaty was concluded between King Surawisesa of Sunda and Syarif Hidayatullah of Cirebon.\n\nIn an apparent sorrow after the tremendous defeat and the loss of his two most important ports, Prabu Surawisesa established the [[Batutulis inscription]] in 1533 AD to commemorate his late father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/kesedihan-di-balik-prasasti-batutulis-cw9x|title=Kesedihan di Balik Prasasti Batutulis - Tirto.ID|last=Teguh|first=Irfan|website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref> This action was probably an attempt to spiritually appeal for ancestral guidance, assistance and protection against the powerful Muslim enemy that now loomed by the gates. Because of ongoing battles, he often could not stay in his palace in [[Pakuan Pajajaran]].\n\n====Ratu Dewata====\nPrabu Ratu Dewata also known as Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata, was the successor of Prabu Surawisesa, however he was not his son. The reign of Prabu Ratu Dewata between 1535 and 1543 was known as a chaotic and difficult one full of hardship, as Islamic forces from Cirebon and Banten tried for multiple times to capture the Dayeuh Pakuan capital.\n\n====The period of chaos and terror====\nDuring Ratu Dewata reign, the Carita Parahyangan reported several calamities befell the kingdom; there was a sudden attack, a lot of enemies razed the city, thus a mass combat erupted in the grand yard (''[[alun-alun]]'').<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}} In this battle, the noble princes; Tohaan Serendet and Tohaan Ratu Sanghyang were killed. The chaos has widespread across the kingdom, the attack also occurred in Ciranjang and Sumedang. Another horrifying terror was the assassins of unknown origin slaughtering the [[rishi]]s, hermits and Hindu priests that resides in the mandalas (hermitage sanctuaries). It was reported that the Hindu priests and hermits of mandala Jayagiri, a sacred sanctuary established by the late King Jayadewata, were captured and drowned into the sea.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|400}} It is highly possible that the attack was launched by Muslim states of Banten or Cirebon.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|395}} This was a devastating attack straight to the spiritual core of the Sundanese Hindu community.\n  \nUnable to control the kingdom, instead of fulfilling his duty by maintaining the law and order, Prabu Ratu Dewata retreated himself to become a ''Raja Pandita'' (priestly king), submitted himself deeply into religious rituals as an apparently desperate appeal for gods' salvation.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Sunda Kingdom were already isolated and confined to inland, as one by one Sunda's ports were captured by Islamic forces of Banten and Cirebon.\n\n====Last kings and the fall of Sunda kingdom====\n[[File:Bird\u2019s-eye View of the City of Bantam de Bry.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Banten (town)|Port of Banten]] in the 16th century.

The successor of Ratu Dewata, King Ratu Sakti reigned from 1543 to 1551, was known as a ruthless king, whom indulge himself with women and sensual pleasure.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nThe next successor that ruled from 1551 to 1567, King Nilakendra, also known as Tohaan di Majaya, is also an incompetent ruler. Instead of fulfill his duty as a king, he renovate and beautify the palace. Squander kingdom's fortune by indulging himself in luxury, binge drinking and parties.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nBecause of ongoing battles, ironically Tohaan di Majaya could not stay in his newly renovated palace. The last kings of Sunda could no longer reside in Pakuan Pajajaran, since in 1550s Hasanuddin, sultan of [[The Sultanate of Banten|Banten]] has launched a successful attack to Dayeuh Pakuan, captured and razed the capital. The surviving Sunda royalties, nobles and common people fled the fallen city, heading to mountainous wilderness. To disable the authority of Sunda royal institution, Sultan of Banten seize the sacred stone of ''Palangka Sriman Sriwacana'', and took it as a prized plunder to his capital, the port city of Banten. According to tradition, this sacred stone slab is an essential requirement for enthronement ceremony, thus disabling the surviving house of Sunda royals to properly crowned their new king.\n\nFrom 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, also known as Prabu Surya Kencana, the kingdom declined substantially. In Carita Parahyangan, his name is Nusiya Mulya. He ruled further inland in Pulasari, Pandeglang, or precisely in Kaduhejo village, Menes Subdistrict, at the slope of Mount Palasari. The kingdom helplessly fallen apart, the royal government can not be maintained anymore, particularly after 1576 due to constant pressure from Banten, and finally collapsed completely in 1579. Thereafter, [[the Sultanate of Banten]] took over most of the former Sunda Kingdom's territory, thus ultimately put an end to a millennium of Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilization of West Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Java has turned more and more Islamic. Only the kingdom of [[Blambangan Kingdom|Blambangan]] on the eastern edge was the last surviving Hindu kingdom in Java, well until its demise in early 18th century.\n\n==Capital==\nThroughout Sunda's history, the centre of cultural and political power often oscillated between Western [[Priangan]] region; initially identified as \"Sunda\", and Eastern Priangan region; traditionally identified as \"Galuh\". The two traditional sites are located in and around modern [[Bogor]] city and the town of [[Ciamis]]. Two most important capitals are [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], the capital of Sunda; and [[Kawali]], the capital of Galuh.\n\n===Kawali===\n{{Main|Kawali}}\n[[File:KITLV 87620 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Hindu Brahmin's ritual objects, including bronze bell and holy water container from Kawali, the historic capital of Galuh Kingdom.]]\nThe capital of Galuh Kingdom of eastern [[Priangan]] region, has moved for several times. In older period, the capital was located around the Karang Kamulyan site by the banks of [[Ci Tanduy|Citanduy]] river. By early 14th century, the capital was moved further northwest upstream, in the area now known as [[Astana Gede inscription|Astana Gede]], near the current town of Kawali, [[Ciamis Regency]]. The city was located on eastern slope of Mount Sawal near the source of the Citanduy river. A [[Kawali inscription]] was discovered here. According to tradition, the keraton in Kawali is called ''Surawisesa'', expanded and renovated by King [[Niskala Wastu Kancana]]. Kawali served as the capital of the kingdom for several generations until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the government back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\n===Pakuan Pajajaran===\n{{Main|Pakuan Pajajaran}}\n[[File:Pakuanpajajaran.jpg|thumb|right|Location of Pakuan Pajajaran copied from book \"Kabudayaan Sunda Zaman Pajajaran\" Part 2\", 2005]]\nAfter the fall of [[Tarumanagara]] in the 7th century, King Tarusbawa built a new capital city inland near the source of the Cipakancilan river in present-day [[Bogor]]. According to [[Carita Parahyangan]], a manuscript from the 15th or 16th century, King Tarusbawa was only mentioned as ''Tohaan'' (Lord/King) of Sunda. He was the ancestor of a series of Sunda kings that reigned until 723. Pakuan served as the capital of Sunda during the reign of several kings, and the court shifted to Kawali until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the court from Kawali back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\nThe city was permanently settled since at least the 10th century, but not gaining major political importance until King [[Sri Baduga Maharaja|Jayadewata]] established it as the royal capital of Sunda kingdom in the 15th century. In 1513, the city was visited by its first European visitor, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], the Portuguese envoy.<ref name=\"Zahorka\">{{cite book | title = The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with the Royal Center of Bogor | first = Herwig | last = Zahorka | publisher = Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka | location = Jakarta | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xSRwAAAAMAAJ&q}}</ref>{{rp|40}} According to his report, the city of ''Daio'' (''Dayeuh'' is a Sundanese term for \"capital city\") was great city, with population around 50,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|404}}\n\nThe tradition hailed that King Jayadewata ruled justly from his beautiful ''Kadatwan'' (palace) called ''Sri Bima Punta Narayana Madura Suradipati'' at Pakuan Pajajaran, and his reign is celebrated as the golden age for Sundanese people.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}}\n\nAfter the reign of King Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja), Pakuan Pajajaran served as the royal capital for several generations.

Although primary local and European historical records referred to the kingdom in the western part of [[Java island]] as the Sunda Kingdom, the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], especially after the establishment of [[the Sultanate of Banten]] and [[The Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], referred to the kingdom (minus the coastal sultanates) as \"Pakuan Pajajaran\" Kingdom, or simply as Pakuan Kingdom or Pajajaran Kingdom.

The tangible evidence on the existence of a kingdom as an administrative social structure, was found in [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] dated 952 Saka (1030 CE), that mentioned ''Prahajyan Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (Sunda Kingdom), with Sri Jayabhupati claimed as ''haji ri Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (the king of Sunda).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|402}}\n\nAccording to Tom\u00e9 Pires report (1513), the Sunda kingdom is ruled by a paramount ''raja'' (king or monarch), and the right of throne inheritance descended from a father to his son. However, in the case when a king did not produce a male heir, the successor is elected from the lesser kings, the rulers of regional towns or provinces.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|403}} These lesser kings is called ''Tohaan'' (lord) that acts as local governor, and mostly are related to the king, which means they belongs in the same dynasty.\n\nMuch of  our current knowledge on detailed social order and the bureaucracy structure of the kingdom, is owed to the Sundanese manuscript of [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]], compiled around 1518.\n{{quotation|\n| quote  = ''...nihan sinangguh dasa prebakti ngaranya.

As mentioned in some fragments of this manuscript:<br/> \n''\"..., ti Kandangwesi pamwat siya ka Pakwan...\"'' (\"... from Kandangwesi the tribute was sent to Pakuan\"), <br/> \n''\"..., anaking sang Prebu Rama, Resi samadaya sarerea siya marek ka Pakwan unggal tahun...\"'' (\"... my son the chief of the village, the ''[[rishi]]s'' together all paid a visit to Pakuan every years\").<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|405}}\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Leuit os 080815-2283 srna.jpg|thumb|upright|A Sundanese woman retrieving rice from a [[leuit]], Sundanese economy mainly rely on rice agriculture]]\nThe economy of Sunda kingdom relied on [[agriculture]], especially [[rice]] cultivation; this is reflected in [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] culture and the annual ceremonies of crop seeding and ''Seren Taun'' rice harvest festival. The harvest ceremony also allowed the king's official to collect [[tax]] in the form of rice that can be stored in the state's ''[[Leuit]]'' (rice [[barn]]).\n\nAccording to Siksakanda ng Karesian, Sundanese farmers during the era of Sunda Kingdom did recognize ''sawah'' or the [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]]. However, the widespread rice cultivation system applied in the kingdom seems to be the ''ladang'' or the [[Upland rice|dry-field rice]] which is a much simpler form of cultivation that doesn't require an elaborate social structure to support it. This is corresponds with the geography and topography of West Java which dominated by the central [[Parahyangan]] Plateau, in contrast with Central and East Java that consists of river valleys between volcanoes. As the result, compared to Central and East Java, West Java at that time was more sparsely populated, consists of settlements, villages or hamlet quite isolated deep within highland valleys, which render direct administrative control from the kingdom's central government rather difficult.\n\nThe kingdom was also well known as the world's main producer of high quality [[black pepper|pepper]]. The kingdom participated in spice trade network in the archipelago. The ports of Sunda participated in international trades in the region.\n\nIn [[Suma Oriental]], written in 1512-1515, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], a Portuguese explorer report about the ports of Sunda:\n{{quotation|First the king of ''\u00c7umda'' (Sunda) with his great city of ''Dayo'', the town and lands and port of ''Bantam'', the port of ''Pomdam'' (Pontang), the port of ''Cheguide'' (Cigede), the port of ''Tamgaram'' (Tangerang), the port of ''Calapa'' ([[Sunda Kalapa|Kelapa]]), and the port of ''Chemano'' (Chi Manuk or Cimanuk), this is Sunda, because the river of Chi Manuk is the limit of both kingdoms.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |p = 166 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nAnother Portuguese explorer, Diogo do Couto, wrote that the Sunda kingdom is thriving and abundant; it lies between Java and Sumatra, separated from the latter by the  [[Sunda Strait]]. Many islands lie along the coast of this kingdom within the strait, for nearly the space of forty leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}}; the strait's widest point is about twenty-five and narrowest point only twelve leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}} broad. Bantam is about the midpoint. All the islands are well timbered, but have little water. A small one called Macar, at the entrance of Sunda Strait, is said to have much gold.\n\nHe also noted that the principal ports of the Sunda kingdom were Banten, Ache, Chacatara (Jakarta), which annually receive twenty sommas, ships from Chienheo, China, to ship the eight thousand ''bahars'', which are equal to 3,000,000&nbsp;kg<!--unless some unit other than 100 kg was called a quintal here, was \"thirty thousand quintals--> of pepper the kingdom produced.\n\nBantam is situated at 6\u00b0 south latitude, in the middle of a bay, three leagues from point to point. The town is eight hundred and fifty fathoms{{vague|English fathoms, or something else?|date=January 2010}} in length, and the seaport extends about 400. A river capable of admitting junks and galleys flows through the middle of the town: a small branch of this river admits boats and small craft.\n\nThere is a brick fort, the walls of which are seven palms thick{{vague|human palms or palm trees?|date=July 2012}}, with wooden bulwarks, armed with two tiers of artillery. The anchorage is good, with a muddy or sandy bottom and a depth from two to six fathoms.\n\n==Culture and society==\n===Religion===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=320|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=KITLV 87602 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|image2=KITLV 87603 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest at Telaga near Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|footer=Hindu ritual objects; bells, small statue, [[trishula]] and ornament of ritual staff made of bronze, from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java. These objects was belongs to Brahmin Hindu priest, Hinduism was a dominant faith in Sunda Kingdom.}}\n\n[[Hinduism]] was one of the earliest religious influences established in West Java since the era of [[Tarumanagara]], circa early 5th century CE. In fact, West Java was one of the earliest place in Indonesia that being Indianized, also sparked the historic period of Indonesian history by producing the earliest inscription in Java. As Tarumanagara's successor, Sunda Kingdom has inherited this Hindu civilization influences.\n \nThe culture of the people in Sunda kingdom blends [[Hinduism]] with [[Sunda Wiwitan]]; a native [[shamanism]] belief, and also a traces of [[Buddhism]] is observeable. Several intact prehistoric [[megalithic]] sites, such as Cipari site in [[Kuningan]] and the Pangguyangan [[menhir]] and stepped pyramid in Cisolok, [[Sukabumi]], suggest that native shamanic [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] beliefs coexisted with Hinduism and Buddhism. The native belief, Sunda Wiwitan, persists today as a way of life for the [[Baduy people|Baduy]] or Kanekes people who resist Islam and other foreign influences.\n\nThe [[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple in Leles, [[Garut]], dated from the 8th century, was dedicated to [[Shiva]] and built during the Galuh kingdom. Buddhist influence came to West Java through the [[Srivijaya]] conquest, as the empire dominated West Java until the 11th century. The brick [[stupas]] in [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] indicate Buddhist influence in West Java, while nearby [[Cibuaya]] sites show Hindu influence.\n\nThe manuscript [[Carita Parahyangan]] clearly demonstrate [[Hinduism]] spirituality within the Sunda Kingdom society. This manuscript is opened with a legendary character named Sang Resi Guru that had a son named Rajaputra. Comprehensively the manuscript was written by Hindu scholar which demonstrate Hindu frame of references.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}} The Hindu pantheon, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara, Rudra, Sadasiva, Yama, Varuna, Kuvera, Indra and Besravaka, were also mentioned in ancient Sundanese manuscript of [[Sewakadharma]] or also known as ''Serat Dewabuda'', dated 1357 Saka or 1435 CE.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}}\n\nThe Sundanese manuscript of spiritual guidance, the [[Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]] also demonstrate Hinduism religious outlook and frame of references, although it seems already mixed with some sorts of Buddhism spirituality. ''\" ... ini na lakukeuneun, talatah sang sadu jati.

Sunda kingdom period, circa 14th century.]]\nThe culture of Sunda kingdom centred on agricultural activity, especially [[rice]] cultivation. [[Dewi Sri|Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]] or Sanghyang Asri, the goddess of rice, is revered as the main deity or the highest goddess within Sundanese [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The priest was concerning about the religious ceremonies and the king and his subjects participated in annual ceremonies and festivals such as the blessing of the rice seeds ceremonies and harvest festival. The annual ''[[Seren Taun]]'' rice harvest festival is still practised today in traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] communities.\n\nAccording to the [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, the courtly culture of Sunda [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]] and its nobles' etiquette in Pakuan Pajajaran was sophisticated. However no traces of the palace or buildings survived in the former capital, probably because their wood construction decayed over the centuries.\n\nThe [[Portugal|Portuguese]] source provide a glimpse of the culture and customs of the Sunda kingdom. In his report \u201c[[Suma Oriental]] (1512\u20131515)\u201d [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] wrote:\n\n{{quotation|Sunda kingdom is very rich. The land of Sunda has as much as four thousands horses which come there from Priaman (Sumatera) and other islands to be sold. It has up to forty elephants; these are for the king\u2019s array. An inferior gold, of six carats, is found. There is abundance tamarinds which serve the native for vinegar.\n\nThe city where the king is most of the year is the great city of Dayo. The city has well-built houses of the palm leaf and wood. They say that the king\u2019s house has three hundred and thirty wooden pillars as thick as a wine cask, and five fathoms (8 m) high, and beautiful timber work on the top of the pillars, and a very well-built house. The city is two days journey from the chief port, which is called [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]].\n\nThe people of the sea coast get along well with the merchants in the land. They are accustomed to trade. These people of Sunda very often come to Malacca to trade. They bring cargo lancharas, ships of a hundred and fifty tons. Sunda has up to six junks and many lancharas of the sunda kind, with masts like a crane, and steps between each so that they are easy to navigate.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe people of Sunda are said to be truthful. They, with great city of Dayo, the town and lands and port of Bantam, the port of Pontang, the port of Cheguide, the port of Tangaram, the Port of Tangaram, the port of Calapa, the port of chi Manuk. are justly governed. The king is a great sportsman and hunter. The kingdom descends from father to son. The women are handsome, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes. There are monasteries of convents for the women, into which the nobles put their daughters, when they cannot match them in marriage according to their wishes. The married women, when their husband die, must, as point of honour, die with them, and if they should be afraid of death they put into the convents. The inhabitants are not very warlike, much addicted to their idolatries. They are fond of rich arms, ornamented with gold and inlaid work. Their krises are gilt, and also the point of their lances.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\n[[File:Padrao sunda kelapa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Luso Sundanese padr\u00e3o|''Padr\u00e3o'' of Sunda Kalapa]] (1522), a stone pillar with a [[cross]] of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] commemorating a treaty between [[Portugal|Portuguese Kingdom]] and Hindu Sunda Kingdom, at [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].]]\nThe Kingdom is commonly thought as the successor of [[Tarumanagara]] which also flourished in the same location of Western Java. It seems that in its early history, around 10th to 11th century, Sunda Kingdom was stuck in between two competing mandalas; the Malay Srivijaya in Sumatra in the west and its Javanese neighbouring kingdom in the east.\n\nIn early of its history, the kingdom seems served as the vassal of [[Srivijaya]]n mandala. By the 10th century, the kingdom seems to break loose, liberated from Srivijayan mandala as stated by [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Rakryan Juru Pangambat inscription]] (932 CE). However, according to the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] book ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'',<ref>[[Friedrich Hirth]] and [[W.W.

The popular hero, King [[Sanjaya of Mataram]] known as the Javanese Mataram King mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732), was also mentioned in Sundanese manuscript Carita Parahyangan; as having his root in Sunda Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] (1030) shows Javanese cultural influence, as the style of script, letters, language, and the title of the king is similar to royal names in East Javanese Medang court. However, the relations might be not quite harmonious, as according to 11th century East Javanese [[Horren inscription]], mentioned ''\u00e7atru Sunda'', which means the village of Horren was attacked by \"the enemy (from) Sunda\".<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nThe relations between Sundanese and Javanese kingdoms descended to a new low, when a disastrous incident took place in [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat square in Majapahit]] in 1357, killing all of Sundanese royal party, including the Sunda king Prabu Maharaja and Princess Tohaan [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]].

Several films and TV series are also based on the Saur Sepuh story.\n# '''[[Prabu Siliwangi]]''' (1988), a film directed by Sofyan Sharna, about the fictionalised lifestory of [[King Siliwangi]].\n# '''[[Prabu Siliwangi]]''' (2009), a novel written by E Rokajat Asura, also about King Siliwangi.\n# '''Dyah Pitaloka''' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, about Sundanese Princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]], focussed around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].

The population was 38,120 at the 2010 census. Woburn is located {{convert|9|mi}} north of [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].\n\n== History ==\nWoburn was first settled in 1640 near Horn Pond, a primary source of the [[Mystic River]], and was officially incorporated in 1642. At that time the area included present day towns of Woburn, Winchester, Burlington, and parts of [[Stoneham, Massachusetts|Stoneham]] and Wilmington.  In 1740 [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]] separated from Woburn. In 1799 [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]] separated from Woburn; in 1850 [[Winchester, Massachusetts|Winchester]] did so, too.\n\nWoburn got its name from [[Woburn, Bedfordshire]].  Woburn played host to the first religious ordination in the Americas on Nov. 22, 1642. [[Rev. Thomas Carter]] was sworn in by many of the most prominent men of New England including [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]], minister of the First Church of Boston, [[Richard Mather]] minister of the First Church of Dorchester, and Capt. [[Edward Johnson (founder of Woburn, MA)|Edward Johnson]] co-founder of the church and town of Woburn. Johnson is regarded as \"the father of Woburn.\"  He served as the first town clerk, represented the town in the Massachusetts General Court, made the first map of Massachusetts, and wrote the first history of the colony.<ref>Johnson, Edward Francis, ''Captain Edward Johnson of Woburn, Massachusetts and Some of his Descendants,'' Press of David Clapp & Son, Boston, MA, 1905.</ref>\n\n[[File:Woburn, Mass., 1883 LOC 78695092.jpg|thumb|[[Perspective map]] of Woburn from 1883, J. Lyth engraver]]\nThe first organizational Town Meeting was held on April 13, 1644 and the first town officers were chosen. Town Selectmen were Edward Johnson, [[Edward Convers]], John Mousall, William Learned, Ezekiel Richardson, Samuel Richardson and James Thompson. William Learned was also selected as Constable. Michael Bacon, Ralph Hill, Thomas Richardson were chosen as Surveyors of Highways. (The History of Woburn, 1868)\n\nDeacon [[Edward Convers]] was also one of the founders of Woburn.  He was one of its first selectmen, and built the first house and first mill in Woburn.  He was very active in town affairs and was a large landowner, miller and surveyor.<ref>Richardson, Doug.

During the mid to late 1970s, the local community became concerned over the high incidence of childhood leukemia and other illnesses, particularly in the Pine Street area of east Woburn. After high levels of chemical contamination were found in City of Woburn's Wells G and H in 1979, some members of the community suspected that the unusually high incidence of [[leukemia]], [[cancer]], and a wide variety of other health problems were linked to the possible exposure to volatile organic chemicals in the groundwater pumped from wells G and H.\n\nIn May 1982, a number of citizens whose children had developed or died from leukemia filed [[Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.|a civil lawsuit]] against two corporations, [[W. R. Grace and Company]] and [[Beatrice Foods]]. Grace's subsidiary, Cryovac, and Beatrice were suspected of contaminating the groundwater by improperly disposing of [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE), [[Tetrachloroethylene|perchloroethylene]] (perc or PCE) and other industrial solvents at their facilities in Woburn near wells G and H.\n\nIn a controversial decision over what many considered a bungled trial (Judge Walter Jay Skinner ruled that the jurors should answer questions that they and many others considered confusing), Beatrice was acquitted and Grace only paid $8 million, a third of which went to  the lawyers and lawyer fees. A [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] report later found Beatrice and Grace responsible for the contamination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ce547.groups.et.byu.net/woburn/briefhistory.php|title=Brief History|website=ce547.groups.et.byu.net|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110921000725/http://ce547.groups.et.byu.net/woburn/briefhistory.php|archivedate=21 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2005/05/11/judge_walter_skinner_77_oversaw_woburn_grace_case/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Tom | last=Long | title=Judge Walter Skinner, 77; oversaw Woburn-Grace case | date=11 May 2005 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423081718/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2005/05/11/judge_walter_skinner_77_oversaw_woburn_grace_case/ | archivedate=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\nA book titled ''[[A Civil Action]]'' was written about the case by [[Jonathan Harr]].<ref>Harr, Jonathan (1996).

It features moderately cold Winters, but not usually as bad as the ones around The Great Lakes Regions or Southern Canada, or even Northern New England. Nonetheless, it features occasional 'arctic blasts' which can easily drop the temperature below zero. Spring generally starts out cool, around 45-50 degrees, often with snow still on the ground. However, it quickly begins to rapidly warm to around 75 degrees by the time Summer begins. Summers are generally warm or hot & often accompanied with humidity, though not nearly as bad as cities in The Midwest & Mid-Atlantic, and even Rhode Island. Temperatures often top in the 80s, but when an Atlantic low comes, temperatures may fail to rise out of the 60s. High pressure from The Gulf of Mexico, occasionally brings much hotter conditions with temperatures sometimes topping near 100, though this is fairly rare and only happens so often. Falls are generally crisp, but start out warm with temperature highs around 70 & lows around 50. Quickly things cool, and it feels & looks like Winter with temperatures around 40 usually towards the end. Like most of the region, temperatures can vary widely in the span of a day. \n*[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=387691&cityname=Woburn%2C+Massachusetts%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Woburn, Massachusetts Travel Weather Averages]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|align= left\n|1790|1727\n|1800|1228\n|1810|1219\n|1820|1519\n|1830|1977\n|1840|2993\n|1850|3956\n|1860|6287\n|1870|8560\n|1880|10931\n|1890|13499\n|1900|14254\n|1910|15308\n|1920|16574\n|1930|19434\n|1940|19751\n|1950|20492\n|1960|31214\n|1970|37406\n|1980|36626\n|1990|35943\n|2000|37258\n|2010|38120\n|2018|40397\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref></center>\n|footnote=* = population estimate.  {{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}<ref name=\"1950_Census_Urban_populations_since_1790\">{{cite journal|title=1950 Census of Population|volume=1: Number of Inhabitants|at=Section 6, Pages 21-7 through 21-09, Massachusetts Table 4.

The population was 38,120 at the 2010 census. Woburn is located {{convert|9|mi}} north of [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].\n\n== History ==\nWoburn was first settled in 1640 near Horn Pond, a primary source of the [[Mystic River]], and was officially incorporated in 1642. At that time the area included present day towns of Woburn, Winchester, Burlington, and parts of [[Stoneham, Massachusetts|Stoneham]] and Wilmington.  In 1740 [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]] separated from Woburn. In 1799 [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]] separated from Woburn; in 1850 [[Winchester, Massachusetts|Winchester]] did so, too.\n\nWoburn got its name from [[Woburn, Bedfordshire]].  Woburn played host to the first religious ordination in the Americas on Nov. 22, 1642. [[Rev. Thomas Carter]] was sworn in by many of the most prominent men of New England including [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]], minister of the First Church of Boston, [[Richard Mather]] minister of the First Church of Dorchester, and Capt. [[Edward Johnson (founder of Woburn, MA)|Edward Johnson]] co-founder of the church and town of Woburn. Johnson is regarded as \"the father of Woburn.\"  He served as the first town clerk, represented the town in the Massachusetts General Court, made the first map of Massachusetts, and wrote the first history of the colony.<ref>Johnson, Edward Francis, ''Captain Edward Johnson of Woburn, Massachusetts and Some of his Descendants,'' Press of David Clapp & Son, Boston, MA, 1905.</ref>\n\n[[File:Woburn, Mass., 1883 LOC 78695092.jpg|thumb|[[Perspective map]] of Woburn from 1883, J. Lyth engraver]]\nThe first organizational Town Meeting was held on April 13, 1644 and the first town officers were chosen. Town Selectmen were Edward Johnson, [[Edward Convers]], John Mousall, William Learned, Ezekiel Richardson, Samuel Richardson and James Thompson. William Learned was also selected as Constable. Michael Bacon, Ralph Hill, Thomas Richardson were chosen as Surveyors of Highways. (The History of Woburn, 1868)\n\nDeacon [[Edward Convers]] was also one of the founders of Woburn.  He was one of its first selectmen, and built the first house and first mill in Woburn.  He was very active in town affairs and was a large landowner, miller and surveyor.<ref>Richardson, Doug.

During the mid to late 1970s, the local community became concerned over the high incidence of childhood leukemia and other illnesses, particularly in the Pine Street area of east Woburn. After high levels of chemical contamination were found in City of Woburn's Wells G and H in 1979, some members of the community suspected that the unusually high incidence of [[leukemia]], [[cancer]], and a wide variety of other health problems were linked to the possible exposure to volatile organic chemicals in the groundwater pumped from wells G and H.\n\nIn May 1982, a number of citizens whose children had developed or died from leukemia filed [[Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.|a civil lawsuit]] against two corporations, [[W. R. Grace and Company]] and [[Beatrice Foods]]. Grace's subsidiary, Cryovac, and Beatrice were suspected of contaminating the groundwater by improperly disposing of [[trichloroethylene]] (TCE), [[Tetrachloroethylene|perchloroethylene]] (perc or PCE) and other industrial solvents at their facilities in Woburn near wells G and H.\n\nIn a controversial decision over what many considered a bungled trial (Judge Walter Jay Skinner ruled that the jurors should answer questions that they and many others considered confusing), Beatrice was acquitted and Grace only paid $8 million, a third of which went to  the lawyers and lawyer fees. A [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] report later found Beatrice and Grace responsible for the contamination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ce547.groups.et.byu.net/woburn/briefhistory.php|title=Brief History|website=ce547.groups.et.byu.net|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110921000725/http://ce547.groups.et.byu.net/woburn/briefhistory.php|archivedate=21 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2005/05/11/judge_walter_skinner_77_oversaw_woburn_grace_case/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Tom | last=Long | title=Judge Walter Skinner, 77; oversaw Woburn-Grace case | date=11 May 2005 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423081718/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2005/05/11/judge_walter_skinner_77_oversaw_woburn_grace_case/ | archivedate=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\nA book titled ''[[A Civil Action]]'' was written about the case by [[Jonathan Harr]].<ref>Harr, Jonathan (1996). A civil action. Vintage Books, New York, 502 p. {{ISBN|0-394-56349-2}}.</ref> In 1998 the book was turned into a movie starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Robert Duvall]], also titled ''[[A Civil Action (film)|A Civil Action]]''.

It features moderately cold Winters, but not usually as bad as the ones around The Great Lakes Regions or Southern Canada, or even Northern New England. Nonetheless, it features occasional 'arctic blasts' which can easily drop the temperature below zero. Spring generally starts out cool, around 45-50 degrees, often with snow still on the ground. However, it quickly begins to rapidly warm to around 75 degrees by the time Summer begins. Summers are generally warm or hot & often accompanied with humidity, though not nearly as bad as cities in The Midwest & Mid-Atlantic, and even Rhode Island. Temperatures often top in the 80s, but when an Atlantic low comes, temperatures may fail to rise out of the 60s. High pressure from The Gulf of Mexico, occasionally brings much hotter conditions with temperatures sometimes topping near 100, though this is fairly rare and only happens so often. Falls are generally crisp, but start out warm with temperature highs around 70 & lows around 50. Quickly things cool, and it feels & looks like Winter with temperatures around 40 usually towards the end. Like most of the region, temperatures can vary widely in the span of a day. \n*[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weatherall.php3?s=387691&cityname=Woburn%2C+Massachusetts%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Woburn, Massachusetts Travel Weather Averages]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type= USA\n|align= left\n|1790|1727\n|1800|1228\n|1810|1219\n|1820|1519\n|1830|1977\n|1840|2993\n|1850|3956\n|1860|6287\n|1870|8560\n|1880|10931\n|1890|13499\n|1900|14254\n|1910|15308\n|1920|16574\n|1930|19434\n|1940|19751\n|1950|20492\n|1960|31214\n|1970|37406\n|1980|36626\n|1990|35943\n|2000|37258\n|2010|38120\n|2018|40397\n|source=<center>U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref></center>\n|footnote=* = population estimate.  {{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}<ref name=\"1950_Census_Urban_populations_since_1790\">{{cite journal|title=1950 Census of Population|volume=1: Number of Inhabitants|at=Section 6, Pages 21-7 through 21-09, Massachusetts Table 4.
