Shortly after takeoff at about 9:15pm, the helicopter struck the side of a mountain.<ref>http://kaernten.orf.at/news/stories/2795622/ (German)</ref> Arch died of a broken neck, a passenger survived the crash. Arch was accompanied in the helicopter by the mountain hut's owner Reinhard B., a 62-year-old German who ran the Alpine hut which Arch had delivered supplies to. The German was seriously injured in the crash but survived.\n\nHannes Arch was buried at a funeral attended by his closest relatives in Trofaiach on 13 September 2016.\n\n== Red Bull X-Alps ==\nHannes made his mark on the paragliding scene inventing the grueling international competition known as the [[Red Bull X-Alps]], taking the world's most elite paragliding pilots across the Alps from Austria to Monaco entirely by air or foot in a race against the clock.

Shortly after takeoff at about 9:15pm, the helicopter struck the side of a mountain.<ref>http://kaernten.orf.at/news/stories/2795622/ (German)</ref> Arch died of a broken neck, a passenger survived the crash. Arch was accompanied in the helicopter by the mountain hut's owner Reinhard B., a 62-year-old German who ran the Alpine hut which Arch had delivered supplies to. The German was seriously injured in the crash but survived.\n\nHannes Arch was buried at a funeral attended by his closest relatives in Trofaiach on 13 September 2016.\n\n== Red Bull X-Alps ==\nHannes made his mark on the paragliding scene inventing the grueling international competition known as the [[Red Bull X-Alps]], taking the world's most elite paragliding pilots across the Alps from Austria to Monaco entirely by air or foot in a race against the clock. The event quickly gained a reputation as one of the world's toughest adventure races.\n\n==Red Bull Air Race Results==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n! colspan=16 align=center|{{Flagicon|Austria}} Hannes Arch<br />at the [[Red Bull Air Race World Series]]\n|-\n!width=\"2%\"|Year\n!width=\"2%\"| 1\n!width=\"2%\"| 2\n!width=\"2%\"| 3\n!width=\"2%\"| 4\n!width=\"2%\"| 5\n!width=\"2%\"| 6\n!width=\"2%\"| 7\n!width=\"2%\"| 8\n!width=\"2%\"| 9\n!width=\"2%\"| 10\n!width=\"2%\"| 11\n!width=\"2%\"| 12\n!width=\"2%\"|Points\n!width=\"2%\"|Wins\n!width=\"2%\"|Rank\n|- align=center\n!
