Akanksha finds a [[diary]] in her flat in Barcelona, and out of curiosity, she starts reading the book, which unfolds the romantic drama between Sanju Reddy ([[Allu Arjun]]) and Komali Shankaraabharanam ([[Amala Paul]]). Akanksha gets engaged in [[Paris]] with her father's henchman Shawar Ali ([[Shawar Ali]]). Incidentally, she runs into Sanju and gets to know him. Sanju is an [[engineering|engineer]]-turned-lead [[guitar]]ist of a music band, and makes his living through stage and [[street performance]]s.\n\nAs narrated in the diary, Komali comes from an orthodox [[Telugu Brahmin]] family. She is interested in classical music and ends up learning the [[violin]] at a musical school in Barcelona under [[fiddle]] professor, Brahma ([[Brahmanandam]]). In a twist of fate, she falls in love with Sanju and gets approval for their inter-caste marriage, from their parents in [[India]]. Komali unknowingly gets caught after a video footage that she accidentally shot while Shawar Ali kills the Spanish ambassador (Damien Mavis), in the process of money laundering. Sanju saves Komali from these henchmen, on a couple of occasions; this is where the story in the diary ends abruptly. Out of curiosity, Akanksha starts questioning Sanju about their love story and in the process ends up with disturbing facts.\n\nOn continuous asking by Akanksha, Sanju tells her that Komali is dead. It is then shown in flashback that for fixing the marriage of Sanju and Komali, their parents had come to [[Spain]]. It was at that time that Komali is kidnapped by Shawar Ali's brother ([[Subbaraju]]), and when Sanju comes to save her, Komali is murdered by Shawar Ali's brother. In a fit of rage, Sanju bashes up the whole gang, and Shawar Ali's brother goes into a [[coma]]. On hearing this, Akanksha feels pity for Sanju and falls in love with him. She also tries to bring him out of the memory of Komali but in vain.\n\nMeanwhile, Akanksha spots Komali crossing a street. Akanksha runs to Sanju to tell him about Komali, and at that time, Sanju gets surrounded by Shawar Ali's men. Sanju, while bashing up Shawar Ali's men, tells Akanksha that it was his plan to trap her in his love to avenge the death of his and Komali's parents at the hands of Shawar Ali. It is then shown in flashback that after beating up Subbaraju, Sanju had taken Komali's body to the hospital, from where Sanju's father ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]) calls up the Central Minister to arrest Shawar Ali in Spain after watching the video footage. The minister then calls up Shawar Ali to finish off this trouble in order to save himself. Shawar Ali then goes the hospital and kills Sanju's and Komali's parents and shoots Sanju and Komali, and they are presumed dead. However, Sanju and Komali do not die. It is then revealed that Sanju has been waiting all this time to get his revenge, and has made Akanksha his pawn in this game and it was he who faxed their photo in order to make Shawar Ali jealous so that Shawar Ali will come himself to kill Sanju. Later, it is revealed that Komali is not dead and that they both wanted to avenge their parents' death. Sanju and Komali live happily, while Akanksha lives alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Allu Arjun]] as Sanjay Reddy a.k.a.

Akanksha finds a [[diary]] in her flat in Barcelona, and out of curiosity, she starts reading the book, which unfolds the romantic drama between Sanju Reddy ([[Allu Arjun]]) and Komali Shankaraabharanam ([[Amala Paul]]). Akanksha gets engaged in [[Paris]] with her father's henchman Shawar Ali ([[Shawar Ali]]). Incidentally, she runs into Sanju and gets to know him. Sanju is an [[engineering|engineer]]-turned-lead [[guitar]]ist of a music band, and makes his living through stage and [[street performance]]s.\n\nAs narrated in the diary, Komali comes from an orthodox [[Telugu Brahmin]] family. She is interested in classical music and ends up learning the [[violin]] at a musical school in Barcelona under [[fiddle]] professor, Brahma ([[Brahmanandam]]). In a twist of fate, she falls in love with Sanju and gets approval for their inter-caste marriage, from their parents in [[India]]. Komali unknowingly gets caught after a video footage that she accidentally shot while Shawar Ali kills the Spanish ambassador (Damien Mavis), in the process of money laundering. Sanju saves Komali from these henchmen, on a couple of occasions; this is where the story in the diary ends abruptly. Out of curiosity, Akanksha starts questioning Sanju about their love story and in the process ends up with disturbing facts.\n\nOn continuous asking by Akanksha, Sanju tells her that Komali is dead. It is then shown in flashback that for fixing the marriage of Sanju and Komali, their parents had come to [[Spain]]. It was at that time that Komali is kidnapped by Shawar Ali's brother ([[Subbaraju]]), and when Sanju comes to save her, Komali is murdered by Shawar Ali's brother. In a fit of rage, Sanju bashes up the whole gang, and Shawar Ali's brother goes into a [[coma]]. On hearing this, Akanksha feels pity for Sanju and falls in love with him. She also tries to bring him out of the memory of Komali but in vain.\n\nMeanwhile, Akanksha spots Komali crossing a street. Akanksha runs to Sanju to tell him about Komali, and at that time, Sanju gets surrounded by Shawar Ali's men. Sanju, while bashing up Shawar Ali's men, tells Akanksha that it was his plan to trap her in his love to avenge the death of his and Komali's parents at the hands of Shawar Ali. It is then shown in flashback that after beating up Subbaraju, Sanju had taken Komali's body to the hospital, from where Sanju's father ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]) calls up the Central Minister to arrest Shawar Ali in Spain after watching the video footage. The minister then calls up Shawar Ali to finish off this trouble in order to save himself. Shawar Ali then goes the hospital and kills Sanju's and Komali's parents and shoots Sanju and Komali, and they are presumed dead. However, Sanju and Komali do not die. It is then revealed that Sanju has been waiting all this time to get his revenge, and has made Akanksha his pawn in this game and it was he who faxed their photo in order to make Shawar Ali jealous so that Shawar Ali will come himself to kill Sanju. Later, it is revealed that Komali is not dead and that they both wanted to avenge their parents' death. Sanju and Komali live happily, while Akanksha lives alone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Allu Arjun]] as Sanjay Reddy aka Sanju, an engineer-turned-lead guitarist\n* [[Amala Paul]] as Komali Shankarabharanam, an orthodox Telugu Brahmin who falls in love with Sanju\n* [[Catherine Tresa]] as Akanksha, a psychology student who finds a diary about Sanju and Komali\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as [[Fiddle]] Brahma, a professor who teaches the violin to Komali\n* [[Ali (actor)|Ali]] as Gudivada Krishna\n* [[Shawar Ali]] as Shawar Ali, a money launderer and Akanksha's father's henchman who kills Sanju's and Komali's parents\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Sanju's father\n* [[Pragathi (actress)|Pragathi]] as Sumathi, Sanju's mother\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Komali's father\n* [[Tulasi (actress)|Tulasi]] as Komali's mother\n* [[Subbaraju]] as Shawar Ali's brother who kidnaps Komali and later gets into a coma\n* [[Rao Ramesh]] as Akanksha's father and the Central Minister\n* [[Mamilla Shailaja Priya]] as Akanksha's mother\n* [[Srinivasa Reddy]] as Sanju's musical gang member\n* [[Khayyum]] as Sanju's musical gang member\n* Damien Mavis as Spanish Ambassador\n* Steven Dasz as Henchman\n* Kaajal Vashisht\n* Devshi Khanduri in [[item number]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Production==\nIn September, [[Amala Paul]] was selected to play one of the female lead.

The team was bought on January 28, 2005 by the [[SoftBank Corporation]].\n\nThe team was formerly known as the '''Nankai Hawks''' and was based in [[Osaka]]. In 1988, [[Daiei]] bought the team from [[Osaka]]'s [[Nankai Electric Railway]] Co., and its headquarters were moved to Fukuoka (which had been without NPB baseball since the [[Saitama Seibu Lions|Lions]] departed in 1979). The '''Fukuoka Daiei Hawks''' won the [[Pacific League]] championship in 1999, 2000 and 2003 and won the [[Japan Series]] in [[1999 Japan Series|1999]] and [[2003 Japan Series|2003]], and as the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks won the Japan Series in [[2011 Japan Series|2011]], [[2014 Japan Series|2014]], [[2015 Japan Series|2015]], [[2017 Japan Series|2017]], [[2018 Japan Series|2018]], and [[2019 Japan Series|2019]].\n\n==History==\n{{for|a list of the team's records by season|Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks seasons}}\n\n===Nankai Electric Railway Company ownership (1938\u20131988)===\nThe franchise's original name was '''Nankai''' when it joined the [[Japanese Baseball League]] (JBL) in 1938, with the name originating with the [[Nankai Electric Railway|Nankai Electric Railway Co.]], which owned the team at the time. The team's name was changed to '''Kinki Nippon'''<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kinki_Nihon \"Kinki Nihon,\"] Baseball-Reference.com. Accessed March 11, 2015.</ref> in mid-1944 as it received partial sponsorship from [[Kinki Nippon Railway]]. After the 1945 hiatus in the JBL due to the [[Pacific War|Greater East Asia War]], in 1946 the team's name was changed to '''Kinki Great Ring'''<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kinki_Great_Ring \"Kinki Great Ring,\"] Baseball-Reference.com. Accessed March 11, 2015.</ref> and the team won the JBL championship. Throughout the name changes the club underwent between 1938 and 1946, [[Nankai Electric Railway]] Co. (in one form or another) maintained ownership of the franchise.\n\nIn mid-1947, Nankai settled upon its current moniker. The '''{{nihongo|Nankai Hawks|\u5357\u6d77\u30db\u30fc\u30af\u30b9}}'''.

On September 1 of that year Murakami became the first Japanese player to play in [[Major League Baseball]]<ref name=\"murakami\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/news/mlb_news_story.jsp?article_id=sf_20011220_murakami_news&team_id=sf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020818134206/http://www.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/news/mlb_news_story.jsp?article_id=sf_20011220_murakami_news&team_id=sf |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 18, 2002 |title=Where have you gone, Masanori Murakami? |accessdate=November 13, 2008 |publisher=[[Major League Baseball]] |date=December 24, 2001 |author=Kleinberg, Alexander }}</ref>  when he appeared on the mound for the [[San Francisco Giants]]. Disputes over the rights to his contract eventually led to the 1967 United States \u2013 Japanese Player Contract Agreement. Murakami returned to the Hawks in 1966, playing for them through 1974. He contributed to the team's Pacific League championship in 1973, their last under Nankai's ownership.\n\nThe team fell on hard times between 1978 and 1988, finishing no better than 4th place out of the 6 teams in the Pacific League in any year in the period. The team witnessed its fan base diminish as a result of the prolonged period of poor play, with attendance dropping and the club dealing with reduced profits.\n\nThe change in the club's financial performance led Nankai Electric Railway to question the value of maintaining ownership, even after considering the value the team represented as an advertising tool. The company's board of directors and union leadership put pressure on Den Kawakatsu, then-president of Nankai Railway and primary owner of the team, to sell the team, which he refused to do. However, Mr. Kawakatsu, who represented the most ardent supporter of Nankai's ownership of the Hawks, died early in the 1988 season, and the team was sold to the [[Daiei|Daiei Corporation]] to become the '''Fukuoka Daiei Hawks''' after the 1988 season.\n\n[[Katsuya Nomura]], [[Mutsuo Minagawa]], [[Hiromitsu Kadota]], and [[Chusuke Kizuka]] are among the more notable franchise players that were active during the Nankai era.\n\n===Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (1988\u20132004)===\nAfter the franchise was acquired by department store chain Daiei, Inc., the Hawks were flush with new funds and a new home city in Fukuoka, the capital of the eponymous prefecture on Kyushu Island, and were no longer competing with the [[Hanshin Tigers]], [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]] or even the by-then rechristened [[Orix Braves]] (later the Orix Blue Wave, now the Orix Buffaloes) for attention in the Osaka area. The city had been without professional baseball since the departure of the Crown Lighter Lions (today's Saitama Seibu Lions) in 1978. However, in spite of those efforts of the new ownership, the Hawks still were usually in the cellar of the Pacific League, and continued to be at the bottom half of the league until 1997.\n\nThe Hawks front office adopted a strategy of drafting and developing younger players, supplemented by free agent signings, a policy overseen by team president Ryuzo Setoyama and his aides. Setoyama's most brilliant moves were the hiring of home run king [[Sadaharu Oh]] in 1995 to take the reins of manager, a title he would hold until 2008 before he moved into the general manager's position. Oh replaced then-manager Rikuo Nemoto, who was named team president and held that position until his death in 1999.  Also tapped was Akira Ishikawa, a little-known former player, who was tasked with bringing in talented amateurs. He brought in the likes of current [[Hanshin Tigers]] catcher [[Kenji Johjima]], [[Kazumi Saitoh]], [[Nobuhiko Matsunaka]], future [[Chicago White Sox]] and current [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] infielder [[Tadahito Iguchi]], shortstop [[Munenori Kawasaki]], and future team captain [[Hiroki Kokubo]].\n\nSupplementing the amateur signings were some free-agent acquisitions, most of them former Seibu stars from their 1980s championship teams.  Among them were infielder [[Hiromichi Ishige]], immensely popular outfielder (and Hawks manager from 2008\u20132014, replacing Oh in that capacity) [[Koji Akiyama]], and ace left-handed pitcher and current manager [[Kimiyasu Kudoh]].\n\nThese moves (and a few unpopular cost-cutting measures) helped to make the Hawks gradually more competitive with each passing year, and in 1999, the team finally broke through.  That season, Daiei made their first [[Japan Series]] appearance since 1973 (and first as a Fukuoka team), and defeated the [[Chunichi Dragons]] in five games, giving them their first championship since 1964.  Kudoh was dominant in his Game 1 start (complete game, 13 strikeouts), and Akiyama was named Series MVP.\n\nThe following year, the Hawks again made the Japan Series, but this time lost to the powerful [[Yomiuri Giants]] in six games.  Despite the shaky financial ground that Daiei was on thanks to their rampant expansion in bubble-era Japan, the team continued to be competitive.  The team won their second Japan Series in five years, defeating the popular [[Hanshin Tigers]] in seven games in the [[2003 Japan Series]], an exciting series in which the home team won every game.\n\n====Home run record controversy====\nIn 2001, American [[Tuffy Rhodes|Karl \"Tuffy\" Rhodes]], playing for the [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]], hit 55 home runs with several games left, equaling Hawks' manager [[Sadaharu Oh]]'s single-season home run record.  The Buffaloes played a weekend series against the Oh-managed Hawks late in the season, and Rhodes was intentionally walked during each at-bat of the series.  Video footage showed Hawks' catcher Kenji Johjima grinning as he caught the intentional balls.  Oh denied any involvement and Hawks battery coach Yoshiharu Wakana stated that the pitchers acted on his orders, saying, \"It would be distasteful to see a foreign player break Oh's record.\"  Rhodes completed the season with 55 home runs.  League commissioner Hiromori Kawashima denounced the Hawks' behavior as \"unsportsmanlike\".  Hawks pitcher [[Keisaburo Tanoue]] went on record saying that he wanted to throw strikes to Rhodes and felt bad about the situation.<ref>Roah, Jeff, [http://tokyoq.com/weekly_updates/tutt/tutt011012.html \"tokyo under the tracks: It's Never Too Late to Insert an Asterisk\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113212440/http://tokyoq.com/weekly_updates/tutt/tutt011012.html |date=2009-01-13 }}, Tokyo Q, October 12, 2001.</ref><ref name=\"search.japantimes.co.jp\">Whiting, Robert, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20081031j3.html Equaling Oh's HR record proved difficult]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', October 31, 2008, p. 12.</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Venezuelan [[Alex Cabrera]] hit 55 home runs with five games left in the season, with several of those to be played against Oh's Hawks.  Oh told his pitchers to throw strikes to Cabrera, but most of them ignored his order and threw balls well away from the plate.  After the game, Oh stated, \"If you're going to break the record, you should do it by more than one.  Do it by a lot.\"<ref name=\"search.japantimes.co.jp\"/>  In the wake of the most recent incident involving Cabrera, [[ESPN]] listed Oh's single-season home run record as #2 on its list of \"The Phoniest Records in Sports\".<ref>Merron, Jeff, [http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/story?page=phonyrecords-030225 \"The Phoniest Records in Sports\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040621155959/http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/story?page=phonyrecords-030225 |date=June 21, 2004 }}, ESPN.com, February 28, 2003.</ref>\n\n===Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks (2005\u2013present)===\n[[Daiei Inc]] had been under financial pressure to sell its 60% stake in the team over the previous few years, with reports in 2003 suggesting the company would sell the team and the [[Fukuoka Dome]].  Daiei attempted to hold on to the team and held discussions with its primary lenders, including [[UFJ Bank]], to see if it could find a way to retain the team, but ultimately the sale went through to SoftBank in January 2005.\n\nThe Hawks continued their winning ways after the sale of the team to [[SoftBank]]. Following the sale, the Hawks represented one of the richest teams in Japan, with a player core still intact from the last years of the Daiei era. Particularly strong was the team's starting pitching behind Saitoh, [[Tsuyoshi Wada]], [[Nagisa Arakaki]], and [[Toshiya Sugiuchi]].  In 2005, the Hawks finished in first place during the regular season, but fell to the eventual [[Japan Series]] champions, the [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] in the second stage of the [[Climax Series]].  In 2006, a dramatic pennant race led to an even more exciting playoff run that ended in the Sapporo Dome at the hands of the eventual Japan Series Champions, the [[Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters]].  Team manager Sadaharu Oh missed most of the [[2006 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2006 season]] due to stomach cancer.\n\nThe Hawks' [[2007 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2007 season]] was plagued by injuries and general ineffectiveness and inconsistency, leading to another 3rd-place finish and first-stage exit in the playoffs at the hands of the Marines. In [[2008 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2008]], though various injuries still affected the Hawks' bench (especially the bullpen), the club claimed its first Interleague title in June, winning a tiebreaker against the [[Hanshin Tigers]]. However, injuries caught up with them in the final month of the season, and the Hawks finished in last place with a 54\u201374\u20132 record.  The finish represented their worst since 1996. Oh announced his retirement at the end of the season, and former Hawk and fan favorite [[Koji Akiyama]] was named as his successor.\n\nIn [[2009 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2009]], the team cracked the playoffs once again on the backs of breakout seasons from surging starting pitcher [[D. J. Houlton]], outfielder [[Yuya Hasegawa]], Rookie of the Year [[Tadashi Settsu]] and another stellar season from ace Sugiuchi.  However, the team still was unable to get out of the first stage, as the [[Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles]] ousted the Hawks in a 2-game sweep.\n\n====Team of the 2010s====\nThe Hawks finally reclaimed the Pacific League regular season title in [[2010 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2010]] after a seven-year wait. The title came after a see-saw season in which the team recovered several times after extended losing streaks. Starting pitcher Wada, back from injury through much of the previous two seasons, was, along with fellow ace Sugiuchi, at his best. Wada set career highs in wins and games started.  The reliable \"SBM\" relieving trio of Settsu, [[Brian Falkenborg]], and Mahara limited opponent offenses late in games.  The bullpen also benefited from the emergence of [[Keisuke Kattoh]] and [[Masahiko Morifuku]], with the latter blossoming in the second half of the season.\n\nThe Hawks offense was largely composed of role players who seemed to take turns having big games and off days, and it was the team's speed that drove the team as the Hawks led the league in stolen bases in the regular season with 148, well ahead of their nearest challenger, who had 116. [[Yuichi Honda]] and Kawasaki combined to steal 89 bases.  However, despite putting forward a strong group, the Hawks failed to make it to the [[Japan Series]], losing to the [[Lotte Marines]] in six games in the Climax Series despite having a 3\u20131 series lead.\n\nSoftBank won the Pacific League again in 2011, with a dominating season on all fronts.  The offense was bolstered further by the acquisition of former [[Yokohama BayStars]] outfielder [[Seiichi Uchikawa]], who led the league in batting in 2011.  Pitching from Sugiuchi, Wada and an excellent bounce-back season from Houlton also helped propel the team to the best record in NPB.  After sweeping the [[Saitama Seibu Lions]] in the Pacific League Climax Series, the Hawks took on the [[Chunichi Dragons]] to win the Japan Series, a rematch of the 1999 Japan Series.  The Dragons pushed SoftBank to the full seven games, but the Hawks shut out the Dragons 3\u20130 in the seventh game to win their first Japan Series since 2003.\n\nThe 2012 season started with losses for the Hawks. During the off season, they lost their star starters [[Tsuyoshi Wada]] (to the [[Baltimore Orioles]]), [[Toshiya Sugiuchi]] and [[D.J. Houlton]] (to [[Yomiuri Giants]]) through free agency. All star shortstop [[Munenori Kawasaki]] also left the team for the [[Seattle Mariners]]. Closer [[Takahiro Mahara]] would sit out the season through injury. To compensate for these losses, the team acquired outfielder [[Wily Mo Pe\u00f1a]] and starter [[Brad Penny]] from MLB, in addition to starter [[Kazuyuki Hoashi]] from [[Seibu Lions]]. However, of the 3 major signings, only  Pe\u00f1a made regular contributions. Hoashi and Penny made two starts combined in 2012, as Hoashi missed almost the entire season with an injury and Penny was released.\n\nThe team had to deal with their off season losses to their pitching staff from within the organization. Settsu was elevated to the team's ace, while young pitchers such as [[Kenji Otonari]] and [[Hiroki Yamada (baseball)|Hiroki Yamada]] were given bigger roles. [[Nagisa Arakaki]] returned from long term injury to join the rotation.  However, new closer Falkenborg had to sit out most of the season through injury, eventually handing over the role to Morifuku. Arakaki could not regain his former numbers. In the end, the losses could not be mitigated. The team could only finish third in the Pacific League regular season and eventually lost out to the [[Nippon Ham Fighters]] in the P.L. Climax Series Final Stage. The bright spark of the season came from rookie starter [[Shota Takeda]], who went 8-1 with an ERA of 1.07.\n\nIn 2014 the Hawks won the [[2014 Japan Series|Japan Series]] in five games over the [[Hanshin Tigers]]. Manager Koji Akiyama retired after the season, and the team named his former teammate Kimiyasu Kudoh to succeed him.  Under Kudoh's stewardship, SoftBank won for a second consecutive season in [[2015 Japan Series|2015]] again in five games, this time over the [[Yakult Swallows]]. Outfielder [[Yuki Yanagita]] won the Pacific League MVP and the batting title.{{cn|date=October 2017}} It marked the first time since the Seibu Lions won three in a row from 1990 to 1992 that a team had won consecutive Japan Series championships. \n\nAfter falling to the [[Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters]] in 2016, the Hawks won the [[2017 Japan Series]] in six games over the [[Yokohama DeNA BayStars]], in a series where the Hawks led 3-0, but were almost pushed to a 7th game.<ref>{{cite

2017|accessdate=October 24, 2017}}</ref>\nThe following year the Hawks also won the [[2018 Japan Series]] against the [[Hiroshima Carp]] in six games, making it back to back titles for a 2nd time, and four out of the last five; the next year, they became the first team to win three straight Japan Series titles since the Seibu Lions did it from 1990 to 1992 by sweeping the Yomiuri Giants.\n\n==Players of note==\n===Current coaching staff===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center;\"\n|-  style=\"background:#f7c500;

Disputes over the rights to his contract eventually led to the 1967 United States \u2013 Japanese Player Contract Agreement. Murakami returned to the Hawks in 1966, playing for them through 1974. He contributed to the team's Pacific League championship in 1973, their last under Nankai's ownership.\n\nThe team fell on hard times between 1978 and 1988, finishing no better than 4th place out of the 6 teams in the Pacific League in any year in the period. The team witnessed its fan base diminish as a result of the prolonged period of poor play, with attendance dropping and the club dealing with reduced profits.\n\nThe change in the club's financial performance led Nankai Electric Railway to question the value of maintaining ownership, even after considering the value the team represented as an advertising tool. The company's board of directors and union leadership put pressure on Den Kawakatsu, then-president of Nankai Railway and primary owner of the team, to sell the team, which he refused to do. However, Mr. Kawakatsu, who represented the most ardent supporter of Nankai's ownership of the Hawks, died early in the 1988 season, and the team was sold to the [[Daiei|Daiei Corporation]] to become the '''Fukuoka Daiei Hawks''' after the 1988 season.\n\n[[Katsuya Nomura]], [[Mutsuo Minagawa]], [[Hiromitsu Kadota]], and [[Chusuke Kizuka]] are among the more notable franchise players that were active during the Nankai era.\n\n===Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (1988\u20132004)===\nAfter the franchise was acquired by department store chain Daiei, Inc., the Hawks were flush with new funds and a new home city in Fukuoka, the capital of the eponymous prefecture on Kyushu Island, and were no longer competing with the [[Hanshin Tigers]], [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]] or even the by-then rechristened [[Orix Braves]] (later the Orix Blue Wave, now the Orix Buffaloes) for attention in the Osaka area. The city had been without professional baseball since the departure of the Crown Lighter Lions (today's Saitama Seibu Lions) in 1978. However, in spite of those efforts of the new ownership, the Hawks still were usually in the cellar of the Pacific League, and continued to be at the bottom half of the league until 1997.\n\nThe Hawks front office adopted a strategy of drafting and developing younger players, supplemented by free agent signings, a policy overseen by team president Ryuzo Setoyama and his aides. Setoyama's most brilliant moves were the hiring of home run king [[Sadaharu Oh]] in 1995 to take the reins of manager, a title he would hold until 2008 before he moved into the general manager's position. Oh replaced then-manager Rikuo Nemoto, who was named team president and held that position until his death in 1999.  Also tapped was Akira Ishikawa, a little-known former player, who was tasked with bringing in talented amateurs. He brought in the likes of current [[Hanshin Tigers]] catcher [[Kenji Johjima]], [[Kazumi Saitoh]], [[Nobuhiko Matsunaka]], future [[Chicago White Sox]] and current [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] infielder [[Tadahito Iguchi]], shortstop [[Munenori Kawasaki]], and future team captain [[Hiroki Kokubo]].\n\nSupplementing the amateur signings were some free-agent acquisitions, most of them former Seibu stars from their 1980s championship teams.  Among them were infielder [[Hiromichi Ishige]], immensely popular outfielder (and Hawks manager from 2008\u20132014, replacing Oh in that capacity) [[Koji Akiyama]], and ace left-handed pitcher and current manager [[Kimiyasu Kudoh]].\n\nThese moves (and a few unpopular cost-cutting measures) helped to make the Hawks gradually more competitive with each passing year, and in 1999, the team finally broke through.  That season, Daiei made their first [[Japan Series]] appearance since 1973 (and first as a Fukuoka team), and defeated the [[Chunichi Dragons]] in five games, giving them their first championship since 1964.  Kudoh was dominant in his Game 1 start (complete game, 13 strikeouts), and Akiyama was named Series MVP.\n\nThe following year, the Hawks again made the Japan Series, but this time lost to the powerful [[Yomiuri Giants]] in six games.  Despite the shaky financial ground that Daiei was on thanks to their rampant expansion in bubble-era Japan, the team continued to be competitive.  The team won their second Japan Series in five years, defeating the popular [[Hanshin Tigers]] in seven games in the [[2003 Japan Series]], an exciting series in which the home team won every game.\n\n====Home run record controversy====\nIn 2001, American [[Tuffy Rhodes|Karl \"Tuffy\" Rhodes]], playing for the [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]], hit 55 home runs with several games left, equaling Hawks' manager [[Sadaharu Oh]]'s single-season home run record.  The Buffaloes played a weekend series against the Oh-managed Hawks late in the season, and Rhodes was intentionally walked during each at-bat of the series.  Video footage showed Hawks' catcher Kenji Johjima grinning as he caught the intentional balls.  Oh denied any involvement and Hawks battery coach Yoshiharu Wakana stated that the pitchers acted on his orders, saying, \"It would be distasteful to see a foreign player break Oh's record.\"  Rhodes completed the season with 55 home runs.  League commissioner Hiromori Kawashima denounced the Hawks' behavior as \"unsportsmanlike\".  Hawks pitcher [[Keisaburo Tanoue]] went on record saying that he wanted to throw strikes to Rhodes and felt bad about the situation.<ref>Roah, Jeff, [http://tokyoq.com/weekly_updates/tutt/tutt011012.html \"tokyo under the tracks: It's Never Too Late to Insert an Asterisk\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113212440/http://tokyoq.com/weekly_updates/tutt/tutt011012.html |date=2009-01-13 }}, Tokyo Q, October 12, 2001.</ref><ref name=\"search.japantimes.co.jp\">Whiting, Robert, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sb20081031j3.html Equaling Oh's HR record proved difficult]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', October 31, 2008, p. 12.</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Venezuelan [[Alex Cabrera]] hit 55 home runs with five games left in the season, with several of those to be played against Oh's Hawks.  Oh told his pitchers to throw strikes to Cabrera, but most of them ignored his order and threw balls well away from the plate.  After the game, Oh stated, \"If you're going to break the record, you should do it by more than one.  Do it by a lot.\"<ref name=\"search.japantimes.co.jp\"/>  In the wake of the most recent incident involving Cabrera, [[ESPN]] listed Oh's single-season home run record as #2 on its list of \"The Phoniest Records in Sports\".<ref>Merron, Jeff, [http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/story?page=phonyrecords-030225 \"The Phoniest Records in Sports\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040621155959/http://sports.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/story?page=phonyrecords-030225 |date=June 21, 2004 }}, ESPN.com, February 28, 2003.</ref>\n\n===Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks (2005\u2013present)===\n[[Daiei Inc]] had been under financial pressure to sell its 60% stake in the team over the previous few years, with reports in 2003 suggesting the company would sell the team and the [[Fukuoka Dome]].  Daiei attempted to hold on to the team and held discussions with its primary lenders, including [[UFJ Bank]], to see if it could find a way to retain the team, but ultimately the sale went through to SoftBank in January 2005.\n\nThe Hawks continued their winning ways after the sale of the team to [[SoftBank]]. Following the sale, the Hawks represented one of the richest teams in Japan, with a player core still intact from the last years of the Daiei era. Particularly strong was the team's starting pitching behind Saitoh, [[Tsuyoshi Wada]], [[Nagisa Arakaki]], and [[Toshiya Sugiuchi]].  In 2005, the Hawks finished in first place during the regular season, but fell to the eventual [[Japan Series]] champions, the [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] in the second stage of the [[Climax Series]].  In 2006, a dramatic pennant race led to an even more exciting playoff run that ended in the Sapporo Dome at the hands of the eventual Japan Series Champions, the [[Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters]].  Team manager Sadaharu Oh missed most of the [[2006 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2006 season]] due to stomach cancer.\n\nThe Hawks' [[2007 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2007 season]] was plagued by injuries and general ineffectiveness and inconsistency, leading to another 3rd-place finish and first-stage exit in the playoffs at the hands of the Marines. In [[2008 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2008]], though various injuries still affected the Hawks' bench (especially the bullpen), the club claimed its first Interleague title in June, winning a tiebreaker against the [[Hanshin Tigers]]. However, injuries caught up with them in the final month of the season, and the Hawks finished in last place with a 54\u201374\u20132 record.  The finish represented their worst since 1996. Oh announced his retirement at the end of the season, and former Hawk and fan favorite [[Koji Akiyama]] was named as his successor.\n\nIn [[2009 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2009]], the team cracked the playoffs once again on the backs of breakout seasons from surging starting pitcher [[D. J. Houlton]], outfielder [[Yuya Hasegawa]], Rookie of the Year [[Tadashi Settsu]] and another stellar season from ace Sugiuchi.  However, the team still was unable to get out of the first stage, as the [[Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles]] ousted the Hawks in a 2-game sweep.\n\n====Team of the 2010s====\nThe Hawks finally reclaimed the Pacific League regular season title in [[2010 Nippon Professional Baseball season|2010]] after a seven-year wait. The title came after a see-saw season in which the team recovered several times after extended losing streaks. Starting pitcher Wada, back from injury through much of the previous two seasons, was, along with fellow ace Sugiuchi, at his best. Wada set career highs in wins and games started.  The reliable \"SBM\" relieving trio of Settsu, [[Brian Falkenborg]], and Mahara limited opponent offenses late in games.  The bullpen also benefited from the emergence of [[Keisuke Kattoh]] and [[Masahiko Morifuku]], with the latter blossoming in the second half of the season.\n\nThe Hawks offense was largely composed of role players who seemed to take turns having big games and off days, and it was the team's speed that drove the team as the Hawks led the league in stolen bases in the regular season with 148, well ahead of their nearest challenger, who had 116. [[Yuichi Honda]] and Kawasaki combined to steal 89 bases.  However, despite putting forward a strong group, the Hawks failed to make it to the [[Japan Series]], losing to the [[Lotte Marines]] in six games in the Climax Series despite having a 3\u20131 series lead.\n\nSoftBank won the Pacific League again in 2011, with a dominating season on all fronts.  The offense was bolstered further by the acquisition of former [[Yokohama BayStars]] outfielder [[Seiichi Uchikawa]], who led the league in batting in 2011.  Pitching from Sugiuchi, Wada and an excellent bounce-back season from Houlton also helped propel the team to the best record in NPB.  After sweeping the [[Saitama Seibu Lions]] in the Pacific League Climax Series, the Hawks took on the [[Chunichi Dragons]] to win the Japan Series, a rematch of the 1999 Japan Series.  The Dragons pushed SoftBank to the full seven games, but the Hawks shut out the Dragons 3\u20130 in the seventh game to win their first Japan Series since 2003.\n\nThe 2012 season started with losses for the Hawks. During the off season, they lost their star starters [[Tsuyoshi Wada]] (to the [[Baltimore Orioles]]), [[Toshiya Sugiuchi]] and [[D.J. Houlton]] (to [[Yomiuri Giants]]) through free agency. All star shortstop [[Munenori Kawasaki]] also left the team for the [[Seattle Mariners]]. Closer [[Takahiro Mahara]] would sit out the season through injury. To compensate for these losses, the team acquired outfielder [[Wily Mo Pe\u00f1a]] and starter [[Brad Penny]] from MLB, in addition to starter [[Kazuyuki Hoashi]] from [[Seibu Lions]]. However, of the 3 major signings, only  Pe\u00f1a made regular contributions. Hoashi and Penny made two starts combined in 2012, as Hoashi missed almost the entire season with an injury and Penny was released.\n\nThe team had to deal with their off season losses to their pitching staff from within the organization. Settsu was elevated to the team's ace, while young pitchers such as [[Kenji Otonari]] and [[Hiroki Yamada (baseball)|Hiroki Yamada]] were given bigger roles. [[Nagisa Arakaki]] returned from long term injury to join the rotation.  However, new closer Falkenborg had to sit out most of the season through injury, eventually handing over the role to Morifuku. Arakaki could not regain his former numbers. In the end, the losses could not be mitigated. The team could only finish third in the Pacific League regular season and eventually lost out to the [[Nippon Ham Fighters]] in the P.L. Climax Series Final Stage. The bright spark of the season came from rookie starter [[Shota Takeda]], who went 8-1 with an ERA of 1.07.\n\nIn 2014 the Hawks won the [[2014 Japan Series|Japan Series]] in five games over the [[Hanshin Tigers]]. Manager Koji Akiyama retired after the season, and the team named his former teammate Kimiyasu Kudoh to succeed him.  Under Kudoh's stewardship, SoftBank won for a second consecutive season in [[2015 Japan Series|2015]] again in five games, this time over the [[Yakult Swallows]]. Outfielder [[Yuki Yanagita]] won the Pacific League MVP and the batting title.{{cn|date=October 2017}} It marked the first time since the Seibu Lions won three in a row from 1990 to 1992 that a team had won consecutive Japan Series championships. \n\nAfter falling to the [[Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters]] in 2016, the Hawks won the [[2017 Japan Series]] in six games over the [[Yokohama DeNA BayStars]], in a series where the Hawks led 3-0, but were almost pushed to a 7th game.<ref>{{cite

2017|accessdate=October 24, 2017}}</ref>\nThe following year the Hawks also won the [[2018 Japan Series]] against the [[Hiroshima Carp]] in six games, making it back to back titles for a 2nd time, and four out of the last five; the next year, they became the first team to win three straight Japan Series titles since the Seibu Lions did it from 1990 to 1992 by sweeping the Yomiuri Giants.\n\n==Players of note==\n===Current coaching staff===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center;\"\n|-  style=\"background:#f7c500;

The first printed recipe book, ''Melce\u00fct`t Tab\u00e2hhin'', was published in 1844. It includes a recipe for a dish called ''[[Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi]]'', which is similar to ''mant\u0131'' but is not served with garlic yoghurt sauce. The first English-language Ottoman cookbook and a third cookbook printed in 1880 includes this same recipe. Another 1880 cookbook does have a recipe for ''mant\u0131'', but instead of a dumpling, it is a dish composed of layered dough served with mincemeat and garlic yogurt. This book also includes a recipe of ''piruhi''\u2014a cheese filled version of the ''tatar bore\u011fi'' recipe.<ref name=\"McWilliams\" />\n\n== In Central Asian cuisines ==\nManti in [[Central Asian cuisine]]s are usually larger in size. They are steamed in a multi-level metal steamer called ''mantovarka'', ''mantyshnitsa'' ([[Russian language|Russian]] terms for manti cooker), ''manti-[[Kazan (cookware)|kazan]]'' or ''manti-kaskan'' (manti pot). It consists of layered pans with holes that are placed over a stock pot filled with water.  Steaming is the main method of cooking manti; if boiled or fried, they are considered another type of dumpling, such as [[pelmeni]]. \n\nIn [[Kazakh cuisine]], the manti filling is normally ground lamb (sometimes beef or [[horse meat]]), spiced with black pepper, sometimes with the addition of chopped pumpkin or squash. This is considered to be a traditional Uyghur recipe. Manti are served topped with butter, sour cream or an [[onion sauce]] or [[garlic sauce]]. When sold as street food in [[Kazakhstan]], manti are typically presented sprinkled with hot red pepper powder.\n\nIn [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbek]], [[Tajik cuisine|Tajik]] and [[Kyrgyz cuisine|Kyrgyz]] cuisines, manti are usually made of one (or a combination) of the following ingredients: lamb, beef, cabbage, potato or pumpkin, with fat often added to meat manti.  Manti are usually topped with butter and may be served with sour cream, different types of ketchup, or freshly sliced onions (sprinkled with vinegar and black pepper).  A sauce made by mixing [[vinegar]] and [[chilli powder]] is also common.  In [[Uzbekistan]], manti are also called ''kaskoni.''<ref name=\"IBP\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifYCAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 | title=Uzbekistan Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments | publisher=Int'l Business Publications | year=2013 | pages=56\u201357 | isbn=978-1438775883}}</ref>\n\nThe same style of cooking manti is traditional for [[Tatar cuisine|Tatar]], Bashkir and other cuisines of the [[Turkic peoples]] living in the vast area from [[Idel-Ural]] to the [[Far East]].

The mantu are also typically topped with a very small amount of tomato-based sauce which can include split peas, red kidney beans and/or some saut\u00e9ed [[ground meat]].

Manti are more common among western ([[Cilician]]) Armenians, while among eastern Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis, similar dumplings called [[khinkali]] are more prevalent.\n\nA popular type of Turkish manti is known as ''Kayseri mant\u0131s\u0131'', originally from [[Kayseri]], an Anatolian city. ''Kayseri mant\u0131s\u0131'' is tiny and served with yoghurt, melted butter (flavored with [[Aleppo pepper]]) and seasoning including dry mint and Aleppo pepper flakes.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-307-55856-5| last = Roden| first = Claudia| title = The New Book of Middle Eastern Food| date = 2008-12-24}}</ref> It can also be served with the water or chicken broth it was boiled in, and often in Kayseri it is consumed as a soup prior to the main dish. In Kayseri, when a couple is engaged to be married, the mother of the groom visits the bride's house and during this visit the bride should prepare manti for her prospective mother-in-law. The smaller the manti dumplings are, the more skillful the bride is considered to be in the kitchen. Traditionally the dumplings prepared for the prospective mother-in law are supposed to be so small that 40 of them can be fit into one spoon. Manti may be made from shredded meat of quail, chicken or goose in some regions of Turkey, while ''bo\u015f mant\u0131'' (\"empty dumpling\") lack filling entirely.\n\nTurkish cuisine includes also other dumplings similar to manti, such as ''[[hingel]]'' and ''[[Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi]]''. These are typically larger than ''Kayseri mant\u0131s\u0131''.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.lezzet.com.tr/yemek-tarifleri/hamurisi-tarifleri/borek-tarifleri/tatar-boregi-510297 | title=Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi | website=Lezzet | access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| last = YA\u015e\u0130N| first = Mehmet| title = Leblebi diyar\u0131 \u00c7orum| accessdate = 2018-11-08| url = http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/leblebi-diyari-corum-8516282}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly small dumplings are also found in other Turkic cuisines but they are not considered to be a type of manti.

These are made of minced meat with onions. It is served in a sauce consisting of yogurt and garlic. There is also a separate dish called ''mantije'', which is made of the same ingredients, but the pastry balls are put together with no free space in between and baked. After the baking yogurt is poured on top.

The first English-language Ottoman cookbook and a third cookbook printed in 1880 includes this same recipe.

It consists of layered pans with holes that are placed over a stock pot filled with water.  Steaming is the main method of cooking manti; if boiled or fried, they are considered another type of dumpling, such as [[pelmeni]]. \n\nIn [[Kazakh cuisine]], the manti filling is normally ground lamb (sometimes beef or [[horse meat]]), spiced with black pepper, sometimes with the addition of chopped pumpkin or squash. This is considered to be a traditional Uyghur recipe. Manti are served topped with butter, sour cream or an [[onion sauce]] or [[garlic sauce]]. When sold as street food in [[Kazakhstan]], manti are typically presented sprinkled with hot red pepper powder.\n\nIn [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbek]], [[Tajik cuisine|Tajik]] and [[Kyrgyz cuisine|Kyrgyz]] cuisines, manti are usually made of one (or a combination) of the following ingredients: lamb, beef, cabbage, potato or pumpkin, with fat often added to meat manti.  Manti are usually topped with butter and may be served with sour cream, different types of ketchup, or freshly sliced onions (sprinkled with vinegar and black pepper).  A sauce made by mixing [[vinegar]] and [[chilli powder]] is also common.  In [[Uzbekistan]], manti are also called ''kaskoni.''<ref name=\"IBP\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifYCAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 | title=Uzbekistan Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments | publisher=Int'l Business Publications | year=2013 | pages=56\u201357 | isbn=978-1438775883}}</ref>\n\nThe same style of cooking manti is traditional for [[Tatar cuisine|Tatar]], Bashkir and other cuisines of the [[Turkic peoples]] living in the vast area from [[Idel-Ural]] to the [[Far East]].

Manti are more common among western ([[Cilician]]) Armenians, while among eastern Armenians, Georgians and Azerbaijanis, similar dumplings called [[khinkali]] are more prevalent.\n\nA popular type of Turkish manti is known as ''Kayseri mant\u0131s\u0131'', originally from [[Kayseri]], an Anatolian city. ''Kayseri mant\u0131s\u0131'' is tiny and served with yoghurt, melted butter (flavored with [[Aleppo pepper]]) and seasoning including dry mint and Aleppo pepper flakes.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-307-55856-5| last = Roden| first = Claudia| title = The New Book of Middle Eastern Food| date = 2008-12-24}}</ref> It can also be served with the water or chicken broth it was boiled in, and often in Kayseri it is consumed as a soup prior to the main dish. In Kayseri, when a couple is engaged to be married, the mother of the groom visits the bride's house and during this visit the bride should prepare manti for her prospective mother-in-law. The smaller the manti dumplings are, the more skillful the bride is considered to be in the kitchen. Traditionally the dumplings prepared for the prospective mother-in law are supposed to be so small that 40 of them can be fit into one spoon. Manti may be made from shredded meat of quail, chicken or goose in some regions of Turkey, while ''bo\u015f mant\u0131'' (\"empty dumpling\") lack filling entirely.\n\nTurkish cuisine includes also other dumplings similar to manti, such as ''[[hingel]]'' and ''[[Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi]]''. These are typically larger than ''Kayseri mant\u0131s\u0131''.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.lezzet.com.tr/yemek-tarifleri/hamurisi-tarifleri/borek-tarifleri/tatar-boregi-510297 | title=Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi | website=Lezzet | access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| last = YA\u015e\u0130N| first = Mehmet| title = Leblebi diyar\u0131 \u00c7orum| accessdate = 2018-11-08| url = http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/leblebi-diyari-corum-8516282}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly small dumplings are also found in other Turkic cuisines but they are not considered to be a type of manti. Examples are ''[[dushbara]]'' in [[Azerbaijani cuisine]] and ''[[chuchvara]]'' in [[Uzbek cuisine]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Manti.jpg|Baked [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]] manti\nFile:Mant\u0131 in \u00c7ankaya - Ankara.jpg|[[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] ''mant\u0131'' with melted butter, garlic-yogurt sauce and [[Aleppo pepper]]\nFile:Kayseri Mant\u0131s\u0131.jpg|Turkish woman preparing ''Kayseri mant\u0131s\u0131'' on a tray\n</gallery>\n\n== In Bosnian cuisine ==\nIn [[Bosnian cuisine]], the name ''klepe'' or ''kulaci'' is used. These are made of minced meat with onions. It is served in a sauce consisting of yogurt and garlic. There is also a separate dish called ''mantije'', which is made of the same ingredients, but the pastry balls are put together with no free space in between and baked. After the baking yogurt is poured on top. This second type is considered to be a [[pita]] or [[b\u00f6rek|burek]] rather than manti, and is primarily made in the region of [[Sand\u017eak]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n* [[Manj\u016b]], a Japanese confection which also originated from Chinese mantou\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://abasayyoh.com/pages/84 Uzbek Manti] from ''Aba Sayyoh''\n\n{{Cuisine of Turkey}}\n{{Jewish cuisine}}\n{{Dumplings}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manti (Dumpling)}}\n\n[[Category:Dumplings]]\n[[Category:Afghan cuisine]]\n[[Category:Armenian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Jewish cuisine]]\n[[Category:Kurdish cuisine]]\n[[Category:Hazaragi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Kazakhstani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Kyrgyz cuisine]]\n[[Category:Pashtun cuisine]]\n[[Category:Saudi Arabian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Tajik cuisine]]\n[[Category:Tatar cuisine]]\n[[Category:Turkish cuisine]]\n[[Category:Uyghur cuisine]]\n[[Category:Uzbekistani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Soviet cuisine]]\n[[Category:Turkish words and phrases]]\n", "name_user": "Off-shell", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manti_(food)"}
