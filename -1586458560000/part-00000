He is one of the highest-ranking salesmen as well as assistant TO the regional manager (disputed)<ref name=\"traveling\">\"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesman]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: [[Universal Studios]].</ref> at the paper distribution company [[Dunder Mifflin]]. Additionally, he is a bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation owner, and an owner of the business park in which Dunder Mifflin exists. He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow salesman [[Jim Halpert]]. He is also known for his romantic relationship with [[Angela Martin]], head of the accounting department. He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but often serves as a second or third in command as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. While Dwight was regional manager in the last few episodes of the series, he named himself the assistant to the assistant regional manager (A.A.R.M). Dwight was also the Vice President of Special Projects Development for the Sabre Corporation, which was the parent company of Dunder Mifflin at the time, but was soon replaced by [[Todd Packer]], who was almost immediately terminated. In the final season, Dwight is finally offered the position of permanent Regional Manager.\n\n== Casting ==\n{{further|Rainn Wilson}}\n[[File:Rainn Wilson 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rainn Wilson]] portrays Dwight Schrute]]\n\nDwight Schrute is portrayed by American actor [[Rainn Wilson]]. In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, [[Seth Rogen]] said he auditioned for the role. The character is based on [[Gareth Keenan]] of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|original British version of the show]], who was played by actor [[Mackenzie Crook]].\n\nAll original series characters were adapted for the U.S. version. Unlike [[Steve Carell]], Wilson watched every episode of the original British series, and was a fan before he auditioned for the U.S. version.<ref name=\"Wilson\">Wilson, Rainn (Actor). 2005. \"Pilot\" [Commentary track], ''The Office'' Season One (U.S./NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Wilson had originally auditioned for [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]], a performance he described as a \"terrible [[Ricky Gervais|Gervais]] impersonation\";<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> however, the casting directors liked his audition as Dwight much more, and hired him for the role. Wilson based Dwight's hairstyle on the style he himself had when at the age of sixteen.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> In an interview, he said that he went to a [[barber]] to get \"the worst haircut possible\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Diane | last=Holloway | title=The Dwight stuff | url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/0220dwight-ON.html | publisher=Cox News Service | date=2006-01-20 | accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>\n\n== Character information ==\nWhen the series begins, Dwight Schrute is a competent salesman, despite lacking general knowledge, at the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch of the [[paper]] distribution company, [[Dunder Mifflin]]. Dwight formally held the title of \"Assistant to the Regional Manager\",<ref name=\"pilot\">\"[[Pilot (The Office)|Pilot]]\" because of his admiration for his boss, Michael Scott, ''The Office'' Season One (US/NBC Version), 2005, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> but constantly refers to himself as \"Assistant Regional Manager\", attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott.  (Michael privately makes him Assistant Manager in \"[[The Fight (The Office)|The Fight]]\", tells him that no record/mention will be kept of the \"title change only\", then never acknowledges it again.)  Dwight craves authority over his co-workers, and relishes any minor task that Michael or anyone else will give him.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Although Dwight acts superior to many individuals and is often resourceful in crises, he is shown to actually be quite gullible, ignorant, and na\u00efve.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> For this reason, he is easily tricked and pranked by his desk-mate and fellow salesman, Jim Halpert.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/careers/2008/03/13/jim-halpert-and-the-first-job-trap.html |title= Jim Halpert and the First-Job Trap |accessdate=2008-07-12 |last= Wolgemuth |first= Liz |coauthors= |date= March 13, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[U.S. News]]}}</ref>\nDwight often speaks in a halting, intense manner, even in casual conversations.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> At the office, his most recurring business wear is a [[mustard (color)|mustard]]-colored, short-sleeved collared [[shirt]], with a dark [[necktie]] and, usually, a brown suit jacket. He often uses [[one-upmanship]] to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to please Michael, but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the toys on Michael's desk in a manner that made Michael happy, unbeknownst to Michael.\n\nDwight is a former [[auxiliary police|volunteer sheriff deputy]],<ref name=\"test\"/> but has to step down after breaking his pledge in order to help his boss, Michael illegally pass a drug test by giving him his pee in the episode \"Drug Testing\". He is also a [[notary public]]; this creates difficulties when Angela desires to send him a notarized letter regarding their break-up. He resides on his family's [[beet]] [[farm]], alongside his [[cousin]], [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Mose Schrute|Mose]] (played by producer/writer [[Michael Schur]]). Dwight has affinities for [[paintball]], ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', [[ping pong]], [[survivalism]], [[G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b|Goju Ryu]] karate<ref name=\"fight\">\"[[The Fight (The Office)|The Fight]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> and [[weapon]]s. He also has a preference to ride in the back seat of [[cars]] behind the driver, because it is the safest location in a car. He takes Karate very seriously, gaining a black belt in season 9. He was also \"Senpai\" to the Sensei of the Dojo in which he took part in.  He is also faster than a Black Pepper snake, known as a [[speckled kingsnake]].  \n\nIn \"[[Whistleblower (The Office)|Whistleblower]]\", encouraged to invest in [[real estate]] by former [[CEO]] and owner of Dunder Mifflin-Sabre, [[Jo Bennett]], Dwight decides to purchase the industrial park building. He has shown entrepreneurial traits, like converting the building lobby into a coffee shop in \"[[Nepotism (The Office)|Nepotism]]\", converting an empty room in the office building into a state-of-the-art [[gym]] in \"[[Mrs. California]]\", and organizing a barn maze before [[Halloween]], where kids can pay admission to play, in \"[[WUPHF.com]]\".  He also owns a plot of land on the light side of the moon, given to him by Andy Bernard in season 8.\n\nIn an episode commentary on the [[The Office (U.S. season 1)|season one]] [[DVD]], Wilson refers to Dwight as a \"[[fascist]] [[nerd]]\". In a feature on the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|season three]] DVD, Wilson describes Dwight as \"someone who does not hate the system, but has a deep and abiding love for it\".<ref name=\"season 3\">\"[[The Office (U.S. season 3)|The Office season three]]\", ([[DVD]]) (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nAll throughout the series Dwight drives a maroon 1987 Pontiac Trans Am, until the finale where he owns an orange 2013 Dodge Challenger SRT.\n\n=== Family and childhood ===\nIn \"[[Lecture Circuit]]\", Dwight claims to remember his own [[birth]], including his father, Dwight Schrute II, delivering him from the [[womb]], and his mother biting off the [[umbilical cord]].<ref name=\"lecture circuit\">\"[[Lecture Circuit]]\", ''The Office'' Season Five (US/NBC Version), 2009, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Grief Counseling (The Office)|Grief Counseling]]\", Dwight states that he was a twin, but he \"resorbed\" his twin while still in his mother's womb (this occurrence is called [[absorbed twin|twin embolization syndrome]]), causing him to believe that he now has \"the strength of a grown man and a little baby\". He also claims to have been born weighing {{convert|13|lb|5|oz|kg|abbr=on}}, rendering his mother incapable of walking for three months and two days,<ref>\"[[Grief Counseling (The Office)|Grief Counseling]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> and in \"[[Baby Shower]]\", he claims to have performed his own [[circumcision]]. In \"[[Viewing Party]]\", he informs [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] and [[Pam Beesly|Pam Beesly]] that, in the Schrute family, the youngest child raises the other children.\n\nLittle is known about Dwight's parents, except that his father used to take him [[hunting]], cheated in [[game]]s, made him and his siblings biscuits for breakfast every morning, and that he battled [[obesity]], high [[blood pressure]], and high [[cholesterol]].\n\nDwight's maternal grandfather, whose surname is Manheim (according to Dwight's web log on [[NBC|NBC.com]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nbcuni.com/DwightsBlog/2006/11/how_to_work_well_with_others.php |title=Dwight Schrute's \"Schrute-Space\"- \"HOW TO WORK WELL WITH OTHERS\" |accessdate=2008-07-06 |date=November 16, 2006 |publisher=[[NBC]].com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724091703/http://blogs.nbcuni.com/DwightsBlog/2006/11/how_to_work_well_with_others.php |archivedate=2008-07-24 }}</ref> fought in the [[Second World War]].

In \"[[Dunder Mifflin Infinity]]\", Dwight tells the documentary film crew that his grandfather is (at the time of the episode) 103 years old, and is still \"puttering around down in [[Argentina]]\", implying that his grandfather was one of the members of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Ratlines (World War II)|who fled into South America]]. Dwight attempted to visit him once, but his travel visa was protested by the [[Shoah Foundation]].<ref name=\"dmi\">\"[[Dunder Mifflin Infinity]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Take Your Daughter to Work Day (The Office)|Take Your Daughter to Work Day]]\", Michael refers to Dwight's grandmother as a \"[[Nazi]] war criminal\".<ref name=\"daughter\">\"[[Take Your Daughter to Work Day (The Office)|Take Your Daughter to Work Day]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Dwight's father and grandfather are also named Dwight Schrute; however, his [[Amish]] great-grandfather was named Dwide Schrude. In \"[[Casino Night]]\", Dwight reveals that the [[tuxedo]] he is wearing is the one that his grandfather was buried in. In a deleted scene from \"[[The Surplus (The Office)|The Surplus]]\", Dwight tells Angela that his family came to the [[United States of America|United States]] on a [[U-boat]]. It is revealed in \"[[Money (The Office)|Money]]\" that it is a tradition in the Schrute family that when a male has [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] with a woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild [[oats]] that are left on his doorstep by his parents. Dwight also speaks High German, but his knowledge of it is \"pre-industrial and mostly [[religious]]\", as might be expected if the language was learned exclusively in an Amish church or context.\n \nDwight was [[Amish#Shunning|shunned]] by his family from the age of four until his sixth birthday, for forgetting to save the excess oil from a can of [[tuna]].<ref name=\"safety\">\"[[Safety Training]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> He lost a grade school [[spelling bee]] to Raj Patel by misspelling the word \"failure\", in front of the entire school.<ref name=\"speech\">\"[[Dwight's Speech]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In seventh grade, Dwight played the invented role of \"Mutey the Mailman\" in a production of ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' He explains that there were not enough roles for all of the children, so they made up roles.<ref>\"[[The Client (The Office)|The Client]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nDwight lives in a nine-[[bedroom]], one-[[bathroom]] farmhouse (with the single bathroom located under the porch, as revealed in \"[[Office Olympics]]\") on his family's {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[beet]] farm, with his cousin Mose.

In \"[[Garden Party (The Office)|Garden Party]]\", Andy throws a [[garden party]] at Schrute Farms in order to impress new CEO [[Robert California]], and at the end of the episode, Robert also discusses the possibility of holding his birthday party at the farm.\n\nAccording to one of Dwight's web logs on NBC.com's \"Schrute-Space\", he had an uncle, named Gunther, a [[goat]] farmer, who fled the Allied invasion of Germany and married a [[Finnish people|Finnish]] woman, with whom he had 17 children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.nbc.com/DwightsBlog/2006/09/10-week/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917010738/http://blog.nbc.com/DwightsBlog/2006/09/10-week/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 17, 2007 |title=\"Dwight Schrute's  Schrute Space\"- \"THE FALL IS HERE AND SO ARE WE\" |accessdate=2008-07-06 |date=September 12, 2006 |publisher=[[NBC]].com }}</ref> He also had an Uncle Girt, who revealed that the Schrute family has an ongoing hatred of [[Harry S.

In the episode \"[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]\", he mentioned the movie ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' as being his favorite film. He hints at belief in fictional creatures such as [[Android (robot)|androids]], [[zombies]] and [[vampires]] (though curiously, despite having claimed in \"[[Business School (The Office)|Business School]]\", to have shot a [[werewolf]] (that was actually his neighbor's dog), he says in one of his blog entries that he does not believe in them; however, he may have simply been denying claims of werewolves at Schrute Farms in order to prevent potential visitors from being frightened away).<ref name=\"NBC.com\"/> He enjoys, and is shown to be skilled at, playing [[table tennis]], and states that many of his heroes are table tennis players.<ref name=\"deposition\">\"[[The Deposition (The Office)|The Deposition]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> His musical tastes vary, but [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] seems to be a recurring theme.<ref name=\"traveling\"/> His personal musical talents are not lacking, as he plays [[guitar]] and [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], and sings, as well.<ref name=\"daughter\"/> He has a fascination with cars; he usually checks a car's suspension, especially [[muscle cars]]. He drives a 1987 [[Pontiac Trans Am]] though in the \"[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]\" he's driving a 2013 [[Dodge Challenger]]. His technological talents are limited, but he shows a passion for the online role playing game ''[[Second Life]]'', in which the only differences between himself and his [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] is that his avatar has the last name 'Shelford' and the ability to [[flight|fly]],<ref name=\"launch\"/> and in [[Spooked (The Office)|\"Spooked\"]], he plays [[StarCraft]] while dressed in a Halloween costume of [[Sarah Kerrigan]]. He also shows an interest in [[trains]], as he is restoring a turn-of-the-century [[steam engine]] in his [[slaughterhouse]], during \"[[The Meeting (The Office)|The Meeting]]\", which has him bonding with [[Toby Flenderson]], as they share the same interest. In \"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\", it is revealed that Dwight does not know who [[Justin Bieber]] is, asking Jim \"Who is Justice Beaver?\", leaving Jim to answer \"A crime-fighting [[beaver]].\"\n\nDwight owns an impressive array of weaponry. In addition to [[Laser Tag]] and [[paintball]] equipment, he has a [[crossbow]] range at his farm (\"[[Office Olympics]]\") and, when he was named official Security Supervisor of the Scranton branch,<ref name=\"test\"/> hinted that he might bring a [[Bo (weapon)|bo staff]] to work. He maintained a hidden arsenal of weapons around the office, including [[pepper spray]], [[Nunchaku|nunchucks]], [[Shuriken|throwing stars]], a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]], a [[boomerang]], [[handcuffs]], a [[Club (weapon)|nightstick]], a pair of [[brass knuckles]] and a [[Jian|Chinese sword]], all of which were confiscated by Toby.<ref name=\"negotiation\">\"[[The Negotiation]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Dwight also claimed to have sat at his desk for an entire day with a [[spud gun]], without any difficulty from Security.<ref name=\"test\"/> Dwight also uses a real [[gun]], a [[Colt Anaconda]], fired within city limits, to start off the race in \"[[Fun Run]]\".<ref name=\"fun run\">\"[[Fun Run]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Branch Wars]]\", he produces a disturbing number of [[Molotov cocktail]]s for a [[underwear|panty]] raid on [[Utica, New York|Utica]]. In \"[[Survivor Man]]\", it is revealed that Dwight still has numerous [[knives]] (and other weapons) hidden on himself (as in \"[[Stress Relief (The Office)|Stress Relief]]\", there is a knife strapped to his leg) or strategically positioned throughout the office (such as \"Mr. A Knife\" in a filing cabinet, twin sais behind a water cooler, a [[sword]] in a ceiling tile, a [[blowgun|blow dart]] in a bathroom stall, and a [[compound bow]] under a couch), and that he owns a .22 [[rifle]] with [[Telescopic sight|scope]]. Also, in this episode, it is shown that Dwight has extensive knowledge of how to survive in the [[wilderness]], being able to provide himself with food, and, by observing Michael, from a distance, through the scope of his center-fire rifle, he stops Michael from poisoning himself, although it is not clear whether the [[mushrooms]] Michael started to ingest were actually poisonous.<ref name=\"survivor\">\"[[Survivor Man]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version) He also keeps a refle, 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nDwight is vocal about his views on justice, which is reflected in his television viewing habits, as he enjoys watching and has great admiration for [[Judith Sheindlin|Judge Judy]], as well as [[Vic Mackey]] on ''[[The Shield]]''. In \"[[The Negotiation]]\", [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] attacks Jim, because he kissed Roy's [[fiancee]], Pam, but Dwight intercepts the attack with [[pepper spray]].<ref name=\"negotiation\"/> Throughout the episode, Jim attempts to show his appreciation, but Dwight refuses to accept his gifts, simply stating \"[[Citizens]] do not accept prizes for being citizens\".<ref name=\"negotiation\"/> In [[Drug Testing (The Office episode)|\"Drug Testing\"]], Dwight finds half of a [[Cannabis (drug)|joint]] in the parking lot, which incites him to carry out a severe, and thorough, investigation.<ref name=\"test\"/> When he discovers that Michael might have been exposed to illegal drugs at a concert, he substitutes his own [[urine]] during the mandatory drug test.<ref name=\"test\"/> Dwight then resigns from his volunteer position at the Sheriff's Department, because he feels that he is no longer worthy of working there. In \"[[Frame Toby]]\", Dwight states that he is skilled at framing people, as well as [[animals]], revealing that he once framed a [[raccoon]] for opening a [[Christmas]] gift, and a [[bear]] for eating out of the [[garbage]], although he had made it obvious to the [[police]] that he wanted Toby to be imprisoned.<ref name=\"test\"/>  In the episode \"[[Women's Appreciation]]\", he is quoted as saying \"Better a thousand innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.\"\n\nIn \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", Dwight states that he does not like to smile, as showing one's teeth is a submission signal in [[primates]], and that whenever someone smiles at him, \"all [he] sees is a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] begging for its life.\" Dwight owns many exotic pets including [[piranha|piranhas]], [[frogs]], an [[arctic wolf]], a [[raccoon]], a porcupine named Henrietta, and an [[opossum]], although the wolf escaped due to poor restraints and he flushed his piranhas down the toilet. He also has an interest in [[bear]]s, and is ready to debate the habits and characteristics of different species of bears. He also has expressed a surprisingly large affection towards baby otters, as shown in the cold opening of [[Whistleblower (The Office)|\"Whistleblower\"]].\n\nIn \"[[Costume Contest]]\", Dwight claims to be able to sit on a fence, and that he is even able to sleep on one, stating that \"The trick is to do it face down, with the post in your mouth\".\n\nIt is revealed in the \"[[Suit Warehouse]]\" episode that as a child Dwight collected cat feces.\n\n== Relationships ==\nIn \"[[Drug Testing (The Office)|Drug Testing]]\", Dwight states that he likes his co-workers, \"with four exceptions\", leaving it up to the audience to make educated guesses about whom these four exceptions are. The four are most likely [[Jim Halpert]], [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]], [[Meredith Palmer]] and [[Toby Flenderson]], due to Michael's hatred of him. However, it is also probable that [[Phyllis Lapin-Vance]] could be one of the exceptions, as, on many occasions, she and Dwight are shown to have a strained relationship. [[Kelly Kapoor]] is likewise a viable choice as her ditsy nature contrasts Dwight's overly serious character, as we see later in the same episode during Dwight's interrogation of Kelly. This theory is also reinforced by Angela's hatred of Kelly and the influence Angela may hold as Dwight's girlfriend at the time. Pam Beesly is also a possible exception as she is often an accomplice to Jim's pranks against Dwight.\n\n=== Angela Martin ===\nTowards the middle of season 2, Dwight develops a secret relationship with Angela Martin. Pam begins to suspect a relationship between the two, in \"[[E-mail Surveillance]]\", by observing their interactions, suspicions which are strengthened in \"[[The Injury]]\" and \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", and confirmed by \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\", where Angela confides in Pam about her relationship, using code names.<ref name=\"traveling\"/> In \"[[Michael's Birthday]]\", Ryan discovers the relationship between the two when he overhears a coded conversation between them in the kitchen, while in \"The Negotiation\" Jim discovers the relationship while coming out of the office bathroom after quitting time, to find Dwight and Angela kissing (he then tells the documentary crew that, with his silence, the debt he feels to Dwight is repaid).<ref name=\"negotiation\"/>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Fun Run]]\", Angela asks Dwight to care for her sick cat, Sprinkles. Instead of caring for the feline, Dwight feels he should [[Animal euthanasia|kill it as a waste of resources]], and then tells Angela Sprinkles was dead when he arrived.<ref name=\"fun run\"/> When he lets the truth slip out shortly after, Angela terminates their relationship. Jim, on a visit to Dwight's beet farm, finds Dwight sitting alone at night, contemplating Angela's [[cherub]] [[figurine]] and moaning in anguish.<ref name=\"money\"/>\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 4)|fourth season]] finale \"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\", Dwight is obviously hurt when Angela's boyfriend, Andy, proposes to her. However, in the final scene of the episode, Phyllis catches Dwight [[having sex]] with Angela in the office.<ref name=\"toby\">\"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 5)|fifth season]] premiere, \"[[Weight Loss (The Office)|Weight Loss]]\", Dwight and Angela have resumed a covert relationship, using a storage room in the warehouse to have sex. In \"[[Crime Aid]]\", Andy and Angela set a date for their wedding. After some advice from Phyllis, Dwight gives Angela an ultimatum: call off the engagement, or he will no longer be with her. She chooses to marry Andy. When Andy learns about Angela's affair with Dwight, [[The Duel (The Office)|a duel]] between Dwight and Andy takes place, but both realize that Angela has been lying to them, and break up with her. For quite some time afterwards, Dwight and Angela avoid each other.\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 6)|season 6]] episode \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\", Dwight, witnessing Jim and Pam talk to customers about their unborn child, decides that he wants a child, and asks Angela to be the mother. They sign an elaborate contract, including eating guidelines for Angela to follow when she is [[pregnant]], and how the baby will be raised. While Angela is excited by the reconciliation, Dwight doesn't share her romantic feelings. When Dwight develops an interest in Pam's friend Isabel, he tells Angela to forget about the contract; this infuriates Angela and she sues him in small-claims court. When an arbitrator tells them that the contract is valid and would involve a $30,000 settlement (because it would be illegal to force Dwight and Angela to procreate), Dwight cuts a deal with Angela for five sessions of sex. He then proceeds to abuse his genitals in an effort to sterilize himself and fends off Angela's efforts to be romantic.\n\nIn [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|Season 7]], after Angela meets a [[state senator]] who she finds much more personable than Dwight, she voids the pact in [[WUPHF.com]].\n\nIn \"[[Jury Duty (The Office)|Jury Duty]]\", it is revealed that, a month before her wedding to the state senator, [[List of characters from The Office (U.S. TV series)#Robert Lipton|Robert Lipton]], Dwight and Angela had sex, as Robert was not fulfilling Angela's sexual needs, so Dwight believes that he is the baby's biological father.<ref>\"[[Jury Duty (The Office)|Jury Duty]]\"</ref> In \"[[New Guys]]\", it is revealed that he is not the father.\n\nIn season 9, they become close again first when Dwight finds out that Robert is cheating on Angela with Oscar, and later in \"[[Moving On (The Office)|Moving On]]\" when Angela helps him take care of his elderly aunt. They share a kiss, but afterwards both say that she should remain faithful to her husband.  After inheriting his aunt's beet farm, Dwight starts a relationship with neighboring [[Brussels sprout]] farmer Esther Bruegger ([[Nora Kirkpatrick]]).  When Dwight seems to be getting serious with Esther and the Senator has publicly dumped Angela, Angela breaks down and admits to [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] that she still loves Dwight.  On the day that he intends to ask Esther to marry him, Dwight instead proposes to Angela.  She says yes, finally admitting that he is the father of her son Phillip. (\"[[A.A.R.M.]]\")\n\n=== Michael Scott===\nDwight holds a high level of respect for Michael, viewing him as a model for success, and often participating with Michael's ill-conceived schemes.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> However, he betrays Michael numerous times, such as when he goes over Michael's head to vie for the manager's job in \"[[The Coup (The Office)|The Coup]]\". Despite this, Michael frequently dismisses Dwight and often appears embarrassed by his antics; for much of the series, he also refuses to promote Dwight from \"Assistant to the Regional Manager\" to \"Assistant Regional Manager\". In later seasons, Dwight was shown to return the favor, such as Dwight telling Michael that he would have a better career if he'd taken a job at Home Depot. Several times throughout the series, however, it is revealed that Michael does care about Dwight's feelings, and the two sometimes share bonding moments. In \"[[Training Day (The Office)|Training Day]]\", Dwight is unhappy when the open branch manager position goes to [[Deangelo Vickers]], and when he learns that Michael did not recommend him for the job, as he led him to believe, he snubs Michael and goes to a meeting Vickers has called, leaving Michael standing outside, by himself. In \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\", Dwight is still frustrated with Michael, but his hostility turns into heartfelt appreciation as Michael hands him the recommendation letter. At first, the letter does not seem to impress him, but, as he reads through, he realizes that Michael really does respect him. They are later seen engaging in a friendly paintball fight, and Dwight's loyalty to Michael is once again restored. After Michael left, Dwight did not have the same respect for Deangelo and Andy that Dwight previously had for Michael, implying that Dwight truly respects and values Michael. In a deleted scene from \"Finale\", Dwight stated that Michael sent him his \"World's Best Boss\" mug when he became Regional Manager.\n\nIn the episode \"Finale\", as Jim explains that the \"Bestest Mench\" (best man) in Dwight's wedding must be older than him, Dwight is disappointed. The camera then pans over to reveal that Michael returned, much to Dwight's surprise and delight, and Jim has arranged for him to fill in as best man. Michael watches as his \"family\" is sitting together, and is last seen dancing with Dwight.\n\n=== Jim Halpert===\nDwight is frequently the victim of practical jokes by co-workers Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly, including putting his desk supplies in the snack machine, putting his stapler into jello, and moving his desk into the men's restroom, although it appears that he remains oblivious to Pam's involvement; these pranks tend to exploit his stubborn and gullible nature. Dwight's frustration with Jim's pranks reaches a crisis point in \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", when Dwight threatens to quit unless Jim is transferred.<ref name=\"conflict\">\"[[Conflict Resolution]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Dwight occasionally pulls successful pranks on Jim in turn, most prominently in \"[[Classy Christmas]]\" where he subjects Jim to a barrage of pranks revolving around snowballs. Professionally, Dwight wins the 2005 Salesman of the Year Award, although, this is likely due to, at least in part, his theft of Jim's largest client.<ref name=\"speech\"/>\n\nDuring \"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\", Dwight tells Ryan he regrets that he and Jim never got along. In \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\", Dwight quits and hugs Jim as a farewell which surprises Jim as he does not know that Dwight quit. Later, Jim is irritated when Andy replaces Dwight and even says that he misses Dwight. Earlier in the same episode, Jim and Dwight make an incredibly efficient sales team, functioning well as a duo and thinking similarly in their tactics. The two were paired together when they began as traveling salesmen at the company. In [[Company Picnic]] the two embrace in celebration after Dwight sets Jim up to score the final point in volleyball. Dwight plans to demote Jim from the Assistant Regional Manager spot, and make him miserable, during \"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\".<ref name=\"job\">\"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nDwight's relationship with Jim mellows somewhat in later seasons, and they, at times, cooperate effectively on sales calls or running the office in Michael's absence, sometimes even socializing together. Jim often supports Dwight when he is genuinely hurt or in danger (such as in \"[[Money (The Office)|Money]]\" and \"[[Last Day in Florida]]\") and occasionally compliments his successes (such as in \"[[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager]]\"). However, when Jim is promoted to co-manager, Dwight's enmity returns to full force, and he conducts an ongoing campaign to depose Jim, who eventually resumes his old job as sales representative in \"[[Manager and Salesman]]\".\n\nJim and Dwight team up in \"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\" to remove [[Todd Packer]] after he returns to the Dunder Mifflin offices and takes Dwight's desk. The two at first cannot agree on a plan, but eventually trick Packer into thinking he has got a job offer in Tallahassee.<ref>\"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\"</ref>\n\nDuring \"[[After Hours (The Office)|After Hours]]\", Jim enlists Dwight into trying to get Kathy, an unwanted female suitor, out of his room by tricking Dwight into thinking that he has bedbugs. This prompts Dwight to overreact, first by stripping down to ward off bugs and then spraying Jim's bed with cleaning chemicals. However, the ploy works when Kathy exits the room. Jim and Dwight are then shown sharing ice cream and a friendly smile in Dwight's room, while watching TV on his bed, where it is implied Jim will have to stay the night due to the chemicals in his own room, as earlier Dwight suggested Jim stay with Kathy. In \"[[Last Day in Florida]]\", Robert California confides to Jim that he's going to terminate Dwight's plans to launch the Sabre store, effectively terminating Dwight's job altogether. Jim tries to let Dwight know, who dismisses his warnings as nothing more than just another prank and insults Jim throughout the day, including in front of the other Sabre staff. At Pam's insistence, Jim tries to tell Dwight one more time before he's dismissed, just as Dwight is about to accept what he thinks is his promotion in the board room. However, Jim physically attacks Dwight just before he goes in, and the two had a wrestling match to which Jim finally concedes. When Dwight steps in, he sees that Packer, who has stolen Dwight's promotion in the meantime, takes the fall and is promptly fired by Robert in the meeting. Defeated, Dwight walks out of the boardroom and lends Jim a hand up and returns to Scranton. When Kelly sees Dwight, she mentions that she thought Dwight was staying in Florida, prompting Jim to distract her with a compliment.\n\nDuring season 9's \"[[Dwight Christmas]]\", Dwight is convinced by Jim to hold a traditional Christmas party in the style of his family. Jim must leave before the party is over and Dwight is noticeably emotionally upset when Jim must leave. Later, when Jim returns, Dwight embraces him in a hug. Soon after, in \"[[Suit Warehouse]]\", Dwight absent-mindedly says \"love you\" at the end of a phone conversation with Jim, much to his embarrassment and the bemusement of his coworkers.\n\nIn \"[[Livin' the Dream]]\", the 3rd-to-last episode of the series, Jim suggests to [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] that Dwight deserves to replace [[Andy Bernard]] as Regional Manager because Dwight loves paper more than anyone else. David agrees and Dwight is promoted to Regional Manager at the end of the episode as a result; Dwight subsequently appoints Jim to fill his old position, Assistant to the Regional Manager.\n\nIn the final episode of the series, \"[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]\", Dwight asks Jim to be the best man at his wedding.  Jim throws Dwight a commendable bachelor party rife with surprises (which Jim refers to as \"pranks\").  Before the wedding Jim informs Dwight that, under Schrute tradition, he is not allowed to be best man as he is younger than him.  Jim surprises him with the arrival of [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]]. The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man.  Later in the episode Jim and Pam tell Dwight they are quitting so Jim can rejoin his sports marketing firm now based in Austin, but Dwight fires them instead so he can give them hefty [[severance package]]s.\n\n=== Pam Beesly===\nAlthough she is often involved in Jim's pranks on Dwight, Dwight has, at certain times, displayed a curious sense of protectiveness towards her. In \"[[Back from Vacation]]\" and \"[[Diwali (The Office)|Diwali]]\", he comforts a tearful Pam, and in \"[[China (The Office)|China]]\", he secretly allows Pam to [[Face (sociological concept)|save face]] when she feels vulnerable about her job abilities. In \"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\", Dwight offers Pam the position of \"Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager\", and following Jim's advice concerning any offers from Dwight to be involved in something secret, she accepts. Though Jim presumably meant this as the opening move of a prank, Pam instead uses it as a bonding opportunity between her and Dwight.\n\nThe two briefly become best friends while he suffers a [[concussion]] in \"[[The Injury]]\". In the season 6 episode \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\", Dwight shows more signs of his begrudging friendship with Jim and Pam during Pam's pregnancy. In the episode, he is sent to the Helperts' house to retrieve Pam's [[iPod]], while they are at the hospital. Instead of finding the iPod and bringing it back to her, Dwight completely rebuilds and repaints their kitchen, after discovering [[mold]]. He also advises Pam on how to keep her daughter, Cece, from crying, during \"[[Viewing Party]]\", by relating his child rearing experiences. Dwight's odd friendship with Pam is explored again in \"[[Doomsday (The Office)|Doomsday]]\". At this point, Pam is the only one in the office who is able to understand Dwight's inner feelings, as she successfully convinces him to deactivate his doomsday machine. It is implied at the end of the episode that Dwight, despite his outward contempt for his coworkers, feels a sense of responsibility (and possibly even affection) towards them.\n\nIn a talking-head interview, in the episode \"[[Tallahassee (The Office)|Tallahassee]]\", Dwight talks about how first impressions last forever. He recalls that, when he first met Pam, she said something to him that \"slightly rubbed [him] the wrong way\", and while he has since loved working with her, even stating that she is wonderful, due to that first impression, he hates her. In the episode \"The Whale\", Dwight openly tells Pam that he considers her his friend. In the final episode of the series, Dwight refers to Pam as his \"best friend\", and he ensures that she and Jim get a large severance as they leave Dunder Mifflin.\n\n=== Andy Bernard===\nAs a result of the Scranton-Stamford merger, Dwight loses his number two position to Jim and engages in an ongoing battle with new salesman [[Andy Bernard]], to gain Michael's favor for \"third-in-command\". The struggle comes to a climax in \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\".<ref name=\"traveling\"/> In Season 4, Andy and Dwight are shown to work well together as a sales team, but Andy's successful pursuit of Angela, after she broke up with Dwight, was irritating to him. When Andy gets engaged to Angela, Dwight is greatly upset by this, and embarks on an affair with her. This affair culminates in a short-lived fight between Andy and Dwight, when they discover Angela has lied to both of them, about not having had sex with the other. In \"[[Michael Scott Paper Company]],\" they once again find themselves courting the same woman \u2013 [[Erin Hannon]]. However, by the end of the fifth season, Andy and Dwight become friends, and discover they both share a mutual interest in music and hunting.<ref>\"[[Michael Scott Paper Company]]\"</ref>\n\n=== Ryan Howard===\nIn the beginning of the series, Dwight feels threatened by [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]], to whom Michael often assigns personal tasks. He continues to resent Ryan, throughout the second season, often addressing him as \"Temp\",<ref name=\"pilot\"/> even after Ryan took over Jim's position.<ref name=\"dmi\"/> In the beginning of season 2, Dwight's friendship with Michael was slightly torn during \"[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]\", when Michael seems to be viewing Ryan more favorably than Dwight, and in \"[[Performance Review]]\", in which Michael must evaluate Ryan.<ref name=\"review\">\"[[Performance Review]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\", Dwight decides to assist Ryan, during his first sales call, although the two get off to a rough start when Dwight [[Hazing|hazes]] him in a series of bizarre initiation rituals. Soon afterwards, Dwight takes Ryan on his first meeting, which ends in disaster. Ryan then eggs the potential customer's building out of spite, and Dwight develops some respect for him.<ref>\"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\"</ref>\n\nDuring season 4, Dwight, along with Michael, comes to Ryan's rescue when they visit him in [[New York City]], when he gets into a scuffle.\n\nRyan and Dwight later team up again in season 6, when Dwight plans to sabotage Jim's occupation, as branch co-manager.<ref>\"[[Scott's Tots]]\"</ref>\n\n=== Romantic relationships ===\nA subtle running joke throughout the series is Dwight's surprising success with attractive women, with Michael often failing to \"hook up\" at the same time. Despite Dwight's unusual appearance and mannerisms, he manages to attract women, who usually develop stronger feelings for him than vice versa. Michael has even pointed out how socially weird Dwight is acting, only for the woman to brush it off. In \"[[Night Out (The Office)|Night Out]]\", Dwight hooks up with a women's [[basketball]] player, while Michael fails in his attempts with other women. As Michael and Dwight leave the club, the woman calls out for Dwight to call her, which he says to Michael that he will not do. In \"[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]\", Michael and Dwight compete for the attention of Pam's best friend, Isabel. When Dwight starts talking about his farm, Michael tries to explain that no one can connect with his experiences as farmer, only for Isabel to become interested in Dwight's [[horse]]s. Dwight ultimately manages to have sex with her, and she begins to develop deeper feelings for him which he does not return, although it is finally hinted in \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\" that Dwight might have more intimate feelings for her than he originally let on. They meet again at the bar in \"[[Happy Hour (The Office)|Happy Hour]]\", and bond further, kissing at the end of the episode. In a chat at OfficeTally.com, [[Mindy Kaling]] noted that Dwight is not a typical \"nerd\" character, that he is a \"farmer and kind of strapping and tall\", and it generally makes sense that he does well with the opposite sex. In season 9, he begins to date an attractive neighboring farmer named Esther ([[Nora Kirkpatrick]]). He ultimately ends his relationship with her in \"[[A.A.R.M.]]\". In the final episode, Dwight marries [[Angela Martin]].\n\n== Character reception ==\nThe Dwight Schrute character has had a very positive reception, and is often cited as one of the most popular characters on the show. According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' he is one of the \"greatest sidekicks.\"<ref>Ben Schott, ''Schott's Miscellany Calendar 2009'' (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008), March 21.</ref> In [[TV Guide]]'s list of the top 100 characters in television history, Dwight was ranked 85th.  In an [[ABC News]] interview with Rainn Wilson, the interviewer commented that \"Words barely describe Dwight Schrute, the suck-up salesman and assistant to the regional manager of the Scranton branch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company...\"<ref name=\"abc news\">{{cite web |url= http://www.abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3566414&page=1 |title= The Man Behind ''The Office''s' Favorite Suck-Up, Dwight Schrute |accessdate=2008-07-09 |last= Rooney |first= Bryan |coauthors= |date= September 7, 2007 |work= |publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref> and \"Dwight, as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in television comedy.

The review stated:\n\"One of the show\u2019s ironies is that Michael and Dwight, hapless though they might be within the office or in most social settings, are actually top salesmen...Undeterred, or unaware of any of this, Dwight carries on with his dreams of grandeur, even instituting a reward system called \"Schrute Bucks\" for employees who please him during a brief but tyrannical reign as branch manager...Dwight approaches sales with the same militaristic fervor as everything else in his life, and it pays off for him (maybe that's one of the reasons why, when Jim gives Dwight one of Benito Mussolini's speeches to deliver when he accepts a sales award in Season Two, Dwight delivers it so enthusiastically that he gets a standing ovation)...\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review//49085/the-office-season-three |title= ''The Office'': Season Three |accessdate=2008-07-09 |last=Gilstrap |first= Andrew |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref> [[Metalcore]] band [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]] named a song \"Assistant to the Regional Manager,\" alluding to Dwight's position.

Following the episode, fans of the show petitioned NBC to make the bobblehead doll available for purchase on their online store.<ref name=\"bobblehead\"/> NBC responded by creating an initial run of 4,000&nbsp;bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately.<ref name=\"bobblehead\"/> The creator of the show, [[Greg Daniels]], joked about the bobbleheads, saying \"Yes, they are fun, but they also serve a business purpose.

They spend the night there, taking part in table-making demonstrations, beet wine-making, and distributing [[manure]]. That night, however, Jim hears an unnerving moaning sound throughout the night, later shown to be Dwight in his room crying over his breakup with Angela. The TripAdvisor page said:\n\n\"Schrute Farms is the number one beet-related [[agritourism]] destination in Northeastern Pennsylvania. We offer the finest accommodations for the casual traveler and/or radish enthusiast. Come join us and experience majestic Schrute Farms.\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nJim and Pam (\"JandP2\") also posted a review, which can be seen on the reviews page. It read: \"The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff's attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers.\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nAn angry Angela also put a review up, and mentioned the death of her cat as a main cause for the review. It said: \"I have to warn people about the proprietor of Schrute Farms\u2014he may portray himself as a gentleman farmer, but he is not what he seems! He killed my cat, Sprinkles! Who knows what he might do to you or your loved ones...\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nAccording to Dwight, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], while the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was known for having the most deaths, the battle of Schrute Farms was known for having the highest DPA (deaths per acre).  He also claimed it was the northernmost battle during the Civil War. However, in reality, it was actually a safe haven for men who wanted relief from the war to focus on artistic lifestyles. It is insinuated that this was a camp for homosexual soldiers. Melvin Fifer Garris is the only known soldier to write home from Schrute Farms during the Civil War.\n\nA little known fact is that Dwight Schrute actually won his farm in a game of Blackjack.

He is one of the highest-ranking salesmen as well as assistant TO the regional manager (disputed)<ref name=\"traveling\">\"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesman]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: [[Universal Studios]].</ref> at the paper distribution company [[Dunder Mifflin]]. Additionally, he is a bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation owner, and an owner of the business park in which Dunder Mifflin exists. He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow salesman [[Jim Halpert]]. He is also known for his romantic relationship with [[Angela Martin]], head of the accounting department. He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but often serves as a second or third in command as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. While Dwight was regional manager in the last few episodes of the series, he named himself the assistant to the assistant regional manager (A.A.R.M). Dwight was also the Vice President of Special Projects Development for the Sabre Corporation, which was the parent company of Dunder Mifflin at the time, but was soon replaced by [[Todd Packer]], who was almost immediately terminated. In the final season, Dwight is finally offered the position of permanent Regional Manager.\n\n== Casting ==\n{{further|Rainn Wilson}}\n[[File:Rainn Wilson 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rainn Wilson]] portrays Dwight Schrute]]\n\nDwight Schrute is portrayed by American actor [[Rainn Wilson]]. In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, [[Seth Rogen]] said he auditioned for the role. The character is based on [[Gareth Keenan]] of the [[The Office (UK TV series)|original British version of the show]], who was played by actor [[Mackenzie Crook]].\n\nAll original series characters were adapted for the U.S. version. Unlike [[Steve Carell]], Wilson watched every episode of the original British series, and was a fan before he auditioned for the U.S. version.<ref name=\"Wilson\">Wilson, Rainn (Actor). 2005. \"Pilot\" [Commentary track], ''The Office'' Season One (U.S./NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Wilson had originally auditioned for [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]], a performance he described as a \"terrible [[Ricky Gervais|Gervais]] impersonation\";<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> however, the casting directors liked his audition as Dwight much more, and hired him for the role. Wilson based Dwight's hairstyle on the style he himself had when at the age of sixteen.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> In an interview, he said that he went to a [[barber]] to get \"the worst haircut possible\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Diane | last=Holloway | title=The Dwight stuff | url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/tv/articles/0220dwight-ON.html | publisher=Cox News Service | date=2006-01-20 | accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>\n\n== Character information ==\nWhen the series begins, Dwight Schrute is a competent salesman, despite lacking general knowledge, at the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch of the [[paper]] distribution company, [[Dunder Mifflin]]. Dwight formally held the title of \"Assistant to the Regional Manager\",<ref name=\"pilot\">\"[[Pilot (The Office)|Pilot]]\" because of his admiration for his boss, Michael Scott, ''The Office'' Season One (US/NBC Version), 2005, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> but constantly refers to himself as \"Assistant Regional Manager\", attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott.  (Michael privately makes him Assistant Manager in \"[[The Fight (The Office)|The Fight]]\", tells him that no record/mention will be kept of the \"title change only\", then never acknowledges it again.)  Dwight craves authority over his co-workers, and relishes any minor task that Michael or anyone else will give him.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Although Dwight acts superior to many individuals and is often resourceful in crises, he is shown to actually be quite gullible, ignorant, and na\u00efve.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> For this reason, he is easily tricked and pranked by his desk-mate and fellow salesman, Jim Halpert.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/careers/2008/03/13/jim-halpert-and-the-first-job-trap.html |title= Jim Halpert and the First-Job Trap |accessdate=2008-07-12 |last= Wolgemuth |first= Liz |coauthors= |date= March 13, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[U.S. News]]}}</ref>\nDwight often speaks in a halting, intense manner, even in casual conversations.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> At the office, his most recurring business wear is a [[mustard (color)|mustard]]-colored, short-sleeved collared [[shirt]], with a dark [[necktie]] and, usually, a brown suit jacket. He often uses [[one-upmanship]] to better himself over his peers, such as boasting about how he trains specific parts of his body. Dwight will sometimes engage in jokes and games in attempts to please Michael, but often fails to do so, because of Michael's perception of himself as the jokester of the workplace. After Dwight temporarily leaves Dunder Mifflin, it is shown that he had long been watering the office plant and arranging the toys on Michael's desk in a manner that made Michael happy, unbeknownst to Michael.\n\nDwight is a former [[auxiliary police|volunteer sheriff deputy]],<ref name=\"test\"/> but has to step down after breaking his pledge in order to help his boss, Michael illegally pass a drug test by giving him his pee in the episode \"Drug Testing\". He is also a [[notary public]]; this creates difficulties when Angela desires to send him a notarized letter regarding their break-up. He resides on his family's [[beet]] [[farm]], alongside his [[cousin]], [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Mose Schrute|Mose]] (played by producer/writer [[Michael Schur]]). Dwight has affinities for [[paintball]], ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', [[ping pong]], [[survivalism]], [[G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b|Goju Ryu]] karate<ref name=\"fight\">\"[[The Fight (The Office)|The Fight]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> and [[weapon]]s. He also has a preference to ride in the back seat of [[cars]] behind the driver, because it is the safest location in a car. He takes Karate very seriously, gaining a black belt in season 9. He was also \"Senpai\" to the Sensei of the Dojo in which he took part in.  He is also faster than a Black Pepper snake, known as a [[speckled kingsnake]].  \n\nIn \"[[Whistleblower (The Office)|Whistleblower]]\", encouraged to invest in [[real estate]] by former [[CEO]] and owner of Dunder Mifflin-Sabre, [[Jo Bennett]], Dwight decides to purchase the industrial park building. He has shown entrepreneurial traits, like converting the building lobby into a coffee shop in \"[[Nepotism (The Office)|Nepotism]]\", converting an empty room in the office building into a state-of-the-art [[gym]] in \"[[Mrs. California]]\", and organizing a barn maze before [[Halloween]], where kids can pay admission to play, in \"[[WUPHF.com]]\".  He also owns a plot of land on the light side of the moon, given to him by Andy Bernard in season 8.\n\nIn an episode commentary on the [[The Office (U.S. season 1)|season one]] [[DVD]], Wilson refers to Dwight as a \"[[fascist]] [[nerd]]\". In a feature on the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|season three]] DVD, Wilson describes Dwight as \"someone who does not hate the system, but has a deep and abiding love for it\".<ref name=\"season 3\">\"[[The Office (U.S. season 3)|The Office season three]]\", ([[DVD]]) (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nAll throughout the series Dwight drives a maroon 1987 Pontiac Trans Am, until the finale where he owns an orange 2013 Dodge Challenger SRT.\n\n=== Family and childhood ===\nIn \"[[Lecture Circuit]]\", Dwight claims to remember his own [[birth]], including his father, Dwight Schrute II, delivering him from the [[womb]], and his mother biting off the [[umbilical cord]].<ref name=\"lecture circuit\">\"[[Lecture Circuit]]\", ''The Office'' Season Five (US/NBC Version), 2009, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Grief Counseling (The Office)|Grief Counseling]]\", Dwight states that he was a twin, but he \"resorbed\" his twin while still in his mother's womb (this occurrence is called [[absorbed twin|twin embolization syndrome]]), causing him to believe that he now has \"the strength of a grown man and a little baby\". He also claims to have been born weighing {{convert|13|lb|5|oz|kg|abbr=on}}, rendering his mother incapable of walking for three months and two days,<ref>\"[[Grief Counseling (The Office)|Grief Counseling]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> and in \"[[Baby Shower]]\", he claims to have performed his own [[circumcision]].

He hints at belief in fictional creatures such as [[Android (robot)|androids]], [[zombies]] and [[vampires]] (though curiously, despite having claimed in \"[[Business School (The Office)|Business School]]\", to have shot a [[werewolf]] (that was actually his neighbor's dog), he says in one of his blog entries that he does not believe in them; however, he may have simply been denying claims of werewolves at Schrute Farms in order to prevent potential visitors from being frightened away).<ref name=\"NBC.com\"/> He enjoys, and is shown to be skilled at, playing [[table tennis]], and states that many of his heroes are table tennis players.<ref name=\"deposition\">\"[[The Deposition (The Office)|The Deposition]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> His musical tastes vary, but [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] seems to be a recurring theme.<ref name=\"traveling\"/> His personal musical talents are not lacking, as he plays [[guitar]] and [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], and sings, as well.<ref name=\"daughter\"/> He has a fascination with cars; he usually checks a car's suspension, especially [[muscle cars]]. He drives a 1987 [[Pontiac Trans Am]] though in the \"[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]\" he's driving a 2013 [[Dodge Challenger]]. His technological talents are limited, but he shows a passion for the online role playing game ''[[Second Life]]'', in which the only differences between himself and his [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] is that his avatar has the last name 'Shelford' and the ability to [[flight|fly]],<ref name=\"launch\"/> and in [[Spooked (The Office)|\"Spooked\"]], he plays [[StarCraft]] while dressed in a Halloween costume of [[Sarah Kerrigan]]. He also shows an interest in [[trains]], as he is restoring a turn-of-the-century [[steam engine]] in his [[slaughterhouse]], during \"[[The Meeting (The Office)|The Meeting]]\", which has him bonding with [[Toby Flenderson]], as they share the same interest. In \"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\", it is revealed that Dwight does not know who [[Justin Bieber]] is, asking Jim \"Who is Justice Beaver?\", leaving Jim to answer \"A crime-fighting [[beaver]].\"\n\nDwight owns an impressive array of weaponry. In addition to [[Laser Tag]] and [[paintball]] equipment, he has a [[crossbow]] range at his farm (\"[[Office Olympics]]\") and, when he was named official Security Supervisor of the Scranton branch,<ref name=\"test\"/> hinted that he might bring a [[Bo (weapon)|bo staff]] to work. He maintained a hidden arsenal of weapons around the office, including [[pepper spray]], [[Nunchaku|nunchucks]], [[Shuriken|throwing stars]], a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]], a [[boomerang]], [[handcuffs]], a [[Club (weapon)|nightstick]], a pair of [[brass knuckles]] and a [[Jian|Chinese sword]], all of which were confiscated by Toby.<ref name=\"negotiation\">\"[[The Negotiation]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Dwight also claimed to have sat at his desk for an entire day with a [[spud gun]], without any difficulty from Security.<ref name=\"test\"/> Dwight also uses a real [[gun]], a [[Colt Anaconda]], fired within city limits, to start off the race in \"[[Fun Run]]\".<ref name=\"fun run\">\"[[Fun Run]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Branch Wars]]\", he produces a disturbing number of [[Molotov cocktail]]s for a [[underwear|panty]] raid on [[Utica, New York|Utica]]. In \"[[Survivor Man]]\", it is revealed that Dwight still has numerous [[knives]] (and other weapons) hidden on himself (as in \"[[Stress Relief (The Office)|Stress Relief]]\", there is a knife strapped to his leg) or strategically positioned throughout the office (such as \"Mr. A Knife\" in a filing cabinet, twin sais behind a water cooler, a [[sword]] in a ceiling tile, a [[blowgun|blow dart]] in a bathroom stall, and a [[compound bow]] under a couch), and that he owns a .22 [[rifle]] with [[Telescopic sight|scope]]. Also, in this episode, it is shown that Dwight has extensive knowledge of how to survive in the [[wilderness]], being able to provide himself with food, and, by observing Michael, from a distance, through the scope of his center-fire rifle, he stops Michael from poisoning himself, although it is not clear whether the [[mushrooms]] Michael started to ingest were actually poisonous.<ref name=\"survivor\">\"[[Survivor Man]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version) He also keeps a refle, 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nDwight is vocal about his views on justice, which is reflected in his television viewing habits, as he enjoys watching and has great admiration for [[Judith Sheindlin|Judge Judy]], as well as [[Vic Mackey]] on ''[[The Shield]]''. In \"[[The Negotiation]]\", [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] attacks Jim, because he kissed Roy's [[fiancee]], Pam, but Dwight intercepts the attack with [[pepper spray]].<ref name=\"negotiation\"/> Throughout the episode, Jim attempts to show his appreciation, but Dwight refuses to accept his gifts, simply stating \"[[Citizens]] do not accept prizes for being citizens\".<ref name=\"negotiation\"/> In [[Drug Testing (The Office episode)|\"Drug Testing\"]], Dwight finds half of a [[Cannabis (drug)|joint]] in the parking lot, which incites him to carry out a severe, and thorough, investigation.<ref name=\"test\"/> When he discovers that Michael might have been exposed to illegal drugs at a concert, he substitutes his own [[urine]] during the mandatory drug test.<ref name=\"test\"/> Dwight then resigns from his volunteer position at the Sheriff's Department, because he feels that he is no longer worthy of working there. In \"[[Frame Toby]]\", Dwight states that he is skilled at framing people, as well as [[animals]], revealing that he once framed a [[raccoon]] for opening a [[Christmas]] gift, and a [[bear]] for eating out of the [[garbage]], although he had made it obvious to the [[police]] that he wanted Toby to be imprisoned.<ref name=\"test\"/>  In the episode \"[[Women's Appreciation]]\", he is quoted as saying \"Better a thousand innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.\"\n\nIn \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", Dwight states that he does not like to smile, as showing one's teeth is a submission signal in [[primates]], and that whenever someone smiles at him, \"all [he] sees is a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] begging for its life.\" Dwight owns many exotic pets including [[piranhas]], [[frogs]], an [[arctic wolf]], a [[raccoon]], a porcupine named Henrietta, and an [[opossum]], although the wolf escaped due to poor restraints and he flushed his piranhas down the toilet. He also has an interest in [[bear]]s, and is ready to debate the habits and characteristics of different species of bears. He also has expressed a surprisingly large affection towards baby otters, as shown in the cold opening of [[Whistleblower (The Office)|\"Whistleblower\"]].\n\nIn \"[[Costume Contest]]\", Dwight claims to be able to sit on a fence, and that he is even able to sleep on one, stating that \"The trick is to do it face down, with the post in your mouth\".\n\nIt is revealed in the \"[[Suit Warehouse]]\" episode that as a child Dwight collected cat feces.\n\n== Relationships ==\nIn \"[[Drug Testing (The Office)|Drug Testing]]\", Dwight states that he likes his co-workers, \"with four exceptions\", leaving it up to the audience to make educated guesses about whom these four exceptions are. The four are most likely [[Jim Halpert]], [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]], [[Meredith Palmer]] and [[Toby Flenderson]], due to Michael's hatred of him. However, it is also probable that [[Phyllis Lapin-Vance]] could be one of the exceptions, as, on many occasions, she and Dwight are shown to have a strained relationship. [[Kelly Kapoor]] is likewise a viable choice as her ditsy nature contrasts Dwight's overly serious character, as we see later in the same episode during Dwight's interrogation of Kelly. This theory is also reinforced by Angela's hatred of Kelly and the influence Angela may hold as Dwight's girlfriend at the time. Pam Beesly is also a possible exception as she is often an accomplice to Jim's pranks against Dwight.\n\n=== Angela Martin ===\nTowards the middle of season 2, Dwight develops a secret relationship with Angela Martin. Pam begins to suspect a relationship between the two, in \"[[E-mail Surveillance]]\", by observing their interactions, suspicions which are strengthened in \"[[The Injury]]\" and \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", and confirmed by \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\", where Angela confides in Pam about her relationship, using code names.<ref name=\"traveling\"/> In \"[[Michael's Birthday]]\", Ryan discovers the relationship between the two when he overhears a coded conversation between them in the kitchen, while in \"The Negotiation\" Jim discovers the relationship while coming out of the office bathroom after quitting time, to find Dwight and Angela kissing (he then tells the documentary crew that, with his silence, the debt he feels to Dwight is repaid).<ref name=\"negotiation\"/>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Fun Run]]\", Angela asks Dwight to care for her sick cat, Sprinkles. Instead of caring for the feline, Dwight feels he should [[Animal euthanasia|kill it as a waste of resources]], and then tells Angela Sprinkles was dead when he arrived.<ref name=\"fun run\"/> When he lets the truth slip out shortly after, Angela terminates their relationship. Jim, on a visit to Dwight's beet farm, finds Dwight sitting alone at night, contemplating Angela's [[cherub]] [[figurine]] and moaning in anguish.<ref name=\"money\"/>\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 4)|fourth season]] finale \"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\", Dwight is obviously hurt when Angela's boyfriend, Andy, proposes to her. However, in the final scene of the episode, Phyllis catches Dwight [[having sex]] with Angela in the office.<ref name=\"toby\">\"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\", ''The Office'' Season Four (US/NBC Version), 2008, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 5)|fifth season]] premiere, \"[[Weight Loss (The Office)|Weight Loss]]\", Dwight and Angela have resumed a covert relationship, using a storage room in the warehouse to have sex. In \"[[Crime Aid]]\", Andy and Angela set a date for their wedding. After some advice from Phyllis, Dwight gives Angela an ultimatum: call off the engagement, or he will no longer be with her. She chooses to marry Andy. When Andy learns about Angela's affair with Dwight, [[The Duel (The Office)|a duel]] between Dwight and Andy takes place, but both realize that Angela has been lying to them, and break up with her. For quite some time afterwards, Dwight and Angela avoid each other.\n\nIn the [[The Office (U.S. season 6)|season 6]] episode \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\", Dwight, witnessing Jim and Pam talk to customers about their unborn child, decides that he wants a child, and asks Angela to be the mother. They sign an elaborate contract, including eating guidelines for Angela to follow when she is [[pregnant]], and how the baby will be raised. While Angela is excited by the reconciliation, Dwight doesn't share her romantic feelings. When Dwight develops an interest in Pam's friend Isabel, he tells Angela to forget about the contract; this infuriates Angela and she sues him in small-claims court. When an arbitrator tells them that the contract is valid and would involve a $30,000 settlement (because it would be illegal to force Dwight and Angela to procreate), Dwight cuts a deal with Angela for five sessions of sex. He then proceeds to abuse his genitals in an effort to sterilize himself and fends off Angela's efforts to be romantic.\n\nIn [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|Season 7]], after Angela meets a [[state senator]] who she finds much more personable than Dwight, she voids the pact in [[WUPHF.com]].\n\nIn \"[[Jury Duty (The Office)|Jury Duty]]\", it is revealed that, a month before her wedding to the state senator, [[List of characters from The Office (U.S. TV series)#Robert Lipton|Robert Lipton]], Dwight and Angela had sex, as Robert was not fulfilling Angela's sexual needs, so Dwight believes that he is the baby's biological father.<ref>\"[[Jury Duty (The Office)|Jury Duty]]\"</ref> In \"[[New Guys]]\", it is revealed that he is not the father.\n\nIn season 9, they become close again first when Dwight finds out that Robert is cheating on Angela with Oscar, and later in \"[[Moving On (The Office)|Moving On]]\" when Angela helps him take care of his elderly aunt. They share a kiss, but afterwards both say that she should remain faithful to her husband.  After inheriting his aunt's beet farm, Dwight starts a relationship with neighboring [[Brussels sprout]] farmer Esther Bruegger ([[Nora Kirkpatrick]]).  When Dwight seems to be getting serious with Esther and the Senator has publicly dumped Angela, Angela breaks down and admits to [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] that she still loves Dwight.  On the day that he intends to ask Esther to marry him, Dwight instead proposes to Angela.  She says yes, finally admitting that he is the father of her son Phillip. (\"[[A.A.R.M.]]\")\n\n=== Michael Scott===\nDwight holds a high level of respect for Michael, viewing him as a model for success, and often participating with Michael's ill-conceived schemes.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> However, he betrays Michael numerous times, such as when he goes over Michael's head to vie for the manager's job in \"[[The Coup (The Office)|The Coup]]\". Despite this, Michael frequently dismisses Dwight and often appears embarrassed by his antics; for much of the series, he also refuses to promote Dwight from \"Assistant to the Regional Manager\" to \"Assistant Regional Manager\". In later seasons, Dwight was shown to return the favor, such as Dwight telling Michael that he would have a better career if he'd taken a job at Home Depot. Several times throughout the series, however, it is revealed that Michael does care about Dwight's feelings, and the two sometimes share bonding moments. In \"[[Training Day (The Office)|Training Day]]\", Dwight is unhappy when the open branch manager position goes to [[Deangelo Vickers]], and when he learns that Michael did not recommend him for the job, as he led him to believe, he snubs Michael and goes to a meeting Vickers has called, leaving Michael standing outside, by himself. In \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\", Dwight is still frustrated with Michael, but his hostility turns into heartfelt appreciation as Michael hands him the recommendation letter. At first, the letter does not seem to impress him, but, as he reads through, he realizes that Michael really does respect him. They are later seen engaging in a friendly paintball fight, and Dwight's loyalty to Michael is once again restored. After Michael left, Dwight did not have the same respect for Deangelo and Andy that Dwight previously had for Michael, implying that Dwight truly respects and values Michael. In a deleted scene from \"Finale\", Dwight stated that Michael sent him his \"World's Best Boss\" mug when he became Regional Manager.\n\nIn the episode \"Finale\", as Jim explains that the \"Bestest Mench\" (best man) in Dwight's wedding must be older than him, Dwight is disappointed. The camera then pans over to reveal that Michael returned, much to Dwight's surprise and delight, and Jim has arranged for him to fill in as best man. Michael watches as his \"family\" is sitting together, and is last seen dancing with Dwight.\n\n=== Jim Halpert===\nDwight is frequently the victim of practical jokes by co-workers Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly, including putting his desk supplies in the snack machine, putting his stapler into jello, and moving his desk into the men's restroom, although it appears that he remains oblivious to Pam's involvement; these pranks tend to exploit his stubborn and gullible nature. Dwight's frustration with Jim's pranks reaches a crisis point in \"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office)|Conflict Resolution]]\", when Dwight threatens to quit unless Jim is transferred.<ref name=\"conflict\">\"[[Conflict Resolution]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> Dwight occasionally pulls successful pranks on Jim in turn, most prominently in \"[[Classy Christmas]]\" where he subjects Jim to a barrage of pranks revolving around snowballs. Professionally, Dwight wins the 2005 Salesman of the Year Award, although, this is likely due to, at least in part, his theft of Jim's largest client.<ref name=\"speech\"/>\n\nDuring \"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\", Dwight tells Ryan he regrets that he and Jim never got along. In \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\", Dwight quits and hugs Jim as a farewell which surprises Jim as he does not know that Dwight quit. Later, Jim is irritated when Andy replaces Dwight and even says that he misses Dwight. Earlier in the same episode, Jim and Dwight make an incredibly efficient sales team, functioning well as a duo and thinking similarly in their tactics. The two were paired together when they began as traveling salesmen at the company. In [[Company Picnic]] the two embrace in celebration after Dwight sets Jim up to score the final point in volleyball. Dwight plans to demote Jim from the Assistant Regional Manager spot, and make him miserable, during \"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\".<ref name=\"job\">\"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\", ''The Office'' Season Three (US/NBC Version), 2007, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref>\n\nDwight's relationship with Jim mellows somewhat in later seasons, and they, at times, cooperate effectively on sales calls or running the office in Michael's absence, sometimes even socializing together. Jim often supports Dwight when he is genuinely hurt or in danger (such as in \"[[Money (The Office)|Money]]\" and \"[[Last Day in Florida]]\") and occasionally compliments his successes (such as in \"[[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager]]\"). However, when Jim is promoted to co-manager, Dwight's enmity returns to full force, and he conducts an ongoing campaign to depose Jim, who eventually resumes his old job as sales representative in \"[[Manager and Salesman]]\".\n\nJim and Dwight team up in \"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\" to remove [[Todd Packer]] after he returns to the Dunder Mifflin offices and takes Dwight's desk. The two at first cannot agree on a plan, but eventually trick Packer into thinking he has got a job offer in Tallahassee.<ref>\"[[Todd Packer (The Office)|Todd Packer]]\"</ref>\n\nDuring \"[[After Hours (The Office)|After Hours]]\", Jim enlists Dwight into trying to get Kathy, an unwanted female suitor, out of his room by tricking Dwight into thinking that he has bedbugs. This prompts Dwight to overreact, first by stripping down to ward off bugs and then spraying Jim's bed with cleaning chemicals. However, the ploy works when Kathy exits the room. Jim and Dwight are then shown sharing ice cream and a friendly smile in Dwight's room, while watching TV on his bed, where it is implied Jim will have to stay the night due to the chemicals in his own room, as earlier Dwight suggested Jim stay with Kathy. In \"[[Last Day in Florida]]\", Robert California confides to Jim that he's going to terminate Dwight's plans to launch the Sabre store, effectively terminating Dwight's job altogether. Jim tries to let Dwight know, who dismisses his warnings as nothing more than just another prank and insults Jim throughout the day, including in front of the other Sabre staff. At Pam's insistence, Jim tries to tell Dwight one more time before he's dismissed, just as Dwight is about to accept what he thinks is his promotion in the board room. However, Jim physically attacks Dwight just before he goes in, and the two had a wrestling match to which Jim finally concedes. When Dwight steps in, he sees that Packer, who has stolen Dwight's promotion in the meantime, takes the fall and is promptly fired by Robert in the meeting. Defeated, Dwight walks out of the boardroom and lends Jim a hand up and returns to Scranton. When Kelly sees Dwight, she mentions that she thought Dwight was staying in Florida, prompting Jim to distract her with a compliment.\n\nDuring season 9's \"[[Dwight Christmas]]\", Dwight is convinced by Jim to hold a traditional Christmas party in the style of his family. Jim must leave before the party is over and Dwight is noticeably emotionally upset when Jim must leave. Later, when Jim returns, Dwight embraces him in a hug. Soon after, in \"[[Suit Warehouse]]\", Dwight absent-mindedly says \"love you\" at the end of a phone conversation with Jim, much to his embarrassment and the bemusement of his coworkers.\n\nIn \"[[Livin' the Dream]]\", the 3rd-to-last episode of the series, Jim suggests to [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] that Dwight deserves to replace [[Andy Bernard]] as Regional Manager because Dwight loves paper more than anyone else. David agrees and Dwight is promoted to Regional Manager at the end of the episode as a result; Dwight subsequently appoints Jim to fill his old position, Assistant to the Regional Manager.\n\nIn the final episode of the series, \"[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]\", Dwight asks Jim to be the best man at his wedding.  Jim throws Dwight a commendable bachelor party rife with surprises (which Jim refers to as \"pranks\").  Before the wedding Jim informs Dwight that, under Schrute tradition, he is not allowed to be best man as he is younger than him.  Jim surprises him with the arrival of [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]]. The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man.  Later in the episode Jim and Pam tell Dwight they are quitting so Jim can rejoin his sports marketing firm now based in Austin, but Dwight fires them instead so he can give them hefty [[severance package]]s.\n\n=== Pam Beesly===\nAlthough she is often involved in Jim's pranks on Dwight, Dwight has, at certain times, displayed a curious sense of protectiveness towards her. In \"[[Back from Vacation]]\" and \"[[Diwali (The Office)|Diwali]]\", he comforts a tearful Pam, and in \"[[China (The Office)|China]]\", he secretly allows Pam to [[Face (sociological concept)|save face]] when she feels vulnerable about her job abilities. In \"[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]\", Dwight offers Pam the position of \"Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager\", and following Jim's advice concerning any offers from Dwight to be involved in something secret, she accepts. Though Jim presumably meant this as the opening move of a prank, Pam instead uses it as a bonding opportunity between her and Dwight.\n\nThe two briefly become best friends while he suffers a [[concussion]] in \"[[The Injury]]\". In the season 6 episode \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\", Dwight shows more signs of his begrudging friendship with Jim and Pam during Pam's pregnancy. In the episode, he is sent to the Helperts' house to retrieve Pam's [[iPod]], while they are at the hospital. Instead of finding the iPod and bringing it back to her, Dwight completely rebuilds and repaints their kitchen, after discovering [[mold]]. He also advises Pam on how to keep her daughter, Cece, from crying, during \"[[Viewing Party]]\", by relating his child rearing experiences. Dwight's odd friendship with Pam is explored again in \"[[Doomsday (The Office)|Doomsday]]\". At this point, Pam is the only one in the office who is able to understand Dwight's inner feelings, as she successfully convinces him to deactivate his doomsday machine. It is implied at the end of the episode that Dwight, despite his outward contempt for his coworkers, feels a sense of responsibility (and possibly even affection) towards them.\n\nIn a talking-head interview, in the episode \"[[Tallahassee (The Office)|Tallahassee]]\", Dwight talks about how first impressions last forever. He recalls that, when he first met Pam, she said something to him that \"slightly rubbed [him] the wrong way\", and while he has since loved working with her, even stating that she is wonderful, due to that first impression, he hates her. In the episode \"The Whale\", Dwight openly tells Pam that he considers her his friend. In the final episode of the series, Dwight refers to Pam as his \"best friend\", and he ensures that she and Jim get a large severance as they leave Dunder Mifflin.\n\n=== Andy Bernard===\nAs a result of the Scranton-Stamford merger, Dwight loses his number two position to Jim and engages in an ongoing battle with new salesman [[Andy Bernard]], to gain Michael's favor for \"third-in-command\". The struggle comes to a climax in \"[[Traveling Salesmen (The Office)|Traveling Salesmen]]\".<ref name=\"traveling\"/> In Season 4, Andy and Dwight are shown to work well together as a sales team, but Andy's successful pursuit of Angela, after she broke up with Dwight, was irritating to him. When Andy gets engaged to Angela, Dwight is greatly upset by this, and embarks on an affair with her. This affair culminates in a short-lived fight between Andy and Dwight, when they discover Angela has lied to both of them, about not having had sex with the other. In \"[[Michael Scott Paper Company]],\" they once again find themselves courting the same woman \u2013 [[Erin Hannon]]. However, by the end of the fifth season, Andy and Dwight become friends, and discover they both share a mutual interest in music and hunting.<ref>\"[[Michael Scott Paper Company]]\"</ref>\n\n=== Ryan Howard===\nIn the beginning of the series, Dwight feels threatened by [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]], to whom Michael often assigns personal tasks. He continues to resent Ryan, throughout the second season, often addressing him as \"Temp\",<ref name=\"pilot\"/> even after Ryan took over Jim's position.<ref name=\"dmi\"/> In the beginning of season 2, Dwight's friendship with Michael was slightly torn during \"[[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]]\", when Michael seems to be viewing Ryan more favorably than Dwight, and in \"[[Performance Review]]\", in which Michael must evaluate Ryan.<ref name=\"review\">\"[[Performance Review]]\", ''The Office'' Season Two (US/NBC Version), 2006, Los Angeles, CA: Universal Studios.</ref> In \"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\", Dwight decides to assist Ryan, during his first sales call, although the two get off to a rough start when Dwight [[Hazing|hazes]] him in a series of bizarre initiation rituals. Soon afterwards, Dwight takes Ryan on his first meeting, which ends in disaster. Ryan then eggs the potential customer's building out of spite, and Dwight develops some respect for him.<ref>\"[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]\"</ref>\n\nDuring season 4, Dwight, along with Michael, comes to Ryan's rescue when they visit him in [[New York City]], when he gets into a scuffle.\n\nRyan and Dwight later team up again in season 6, when Dwight plans to sabotage Jim's occupation, as branch co-manager.<ref>\"[[Scott's Tots]]\"</ref>\n\n=== Romantic relationships ===\nA subtle running joke throughout the series is Dwight's surprising success with attractive women, with Michael often failing to \"hook up\" at the same time. Despite Dwight's unusual appearance and mannerisms, he manages to attract women, who usually develop stronger feelings for him than vice versa. Michael has even pointed out how socially weird Dwight is acting, only for the woman to brush it off. In \"[[Night Out (The Office)|Night Out]]\", Dwight hooks up with a women's [[basketball]] player, while Michael fails in his attempts with other women. As Michael and Dwight leave the club, the woman calls out for Dwight to call her, which he says to Michael that he will not do. In \"[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]\", Michael and Dwight compete for the attention of Pam's best friend, Isabel. When Dwight starts talking about his farm, Michael tries to explain that no one can connect with his experiences as farmer, only for Isabel to become interested in Dwight's [[horse]]s. Dwight ultimately manages to have sex with her, and she begins to develop deeper feelings for him which he does not return, although it is finally hinted in \"[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]\" that Dwight might have more intimate feelings for her than he originally let on. They meet again at the bar in \"[[Happy Hour (The Office)|Happy Hour]]\", and bond further, kissing at the end of the episode. In a chat at OfficeTally.com, [[Mindy Kaling]] noted that Dwight is not a typical \"nerd\" character, that he is a \"farmer and kind of strapping and tall\", and it generally makes sense that he does well with the opposite sex. In season 9, he begins to date an attractive neighboring farmer named Esther ([[Nora Kirkpatrick]]). He ultimately ends his relationship with her in \"[[A.A.R.M.]]\". In the final episode, Dwight marries [[Angela Martin]].\n\n== Character reception ==\nThe Dwight Schrute character has had a very positive reception, and is often cited as one of the most popular characters on the show. According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' he is one of the \"greatest sidekicks.\"<ref>Ben Schott, ''Schott's Miscellany Calendar 2009'' (New York: Workman Publishing, 2008), March 21.</ref> In [[TV Guide]]'s list of the top 100 characters in television history, Dwight was ranked 85th.  In an [[ABC News]] interview with Rainn Wilson, the interviewer commented that \"Words barely describe Dwight Schrute, the suck-up salesman and assistant to the regional manager of the Scranton branch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company...\"<ref name=\"abc news\">{{cite web |url= http://www.abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3566414&page=1 |title= The Man Behind ''The Office''s' Favorite Suck-Up, Dwight Schrute |accessdate=2008-07-09 |last= Rooney |first= Bryan |coauthors= |date= September 7, 2007 |work= |publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref> and \"Dwight, as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in television comedy.

Following the episode, fans of the show petitioned NBC to make the bobblehead doll available for purchase on their online store.<ref name=\"bobblehead\"/> NBC responded by creating an initial run of 4,000&nbsp;bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately.<ref name=\"bobblehead\"/> The creator of the show, [[Greg Daniels]], joked about the bobbleheads, saying \"Yes, they are fun, but they also serve a business purpose.

They spend the night there, taking part in table-making demonstrations, beet wine-making, and distributing [[manure]]. That night, however, Jim hears an unnerving moaning sound throughout the night, later shown to be Dwight in his room crying over his breakup with Angela. The TripAdvisor page said:\n\n\"Schrute Farms is the number one beet-related [[agritourism]] destination in Northeastern Pennsylvania. We offer the finest accommodations for the casual traveler and/or radish enthusiast. Come join us and experience majestic Schrute Farms.\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nJim and Pam (\"JandP2\") also posted a review, which can be seen on the reviews page. It read: \"The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff's attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers.\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nAn angry Angela also put a review up, and mentioned the death of her cat as a main cause for the review. It said: \"I have to warn people about the proprietor of Schrute Farms\u2014he may portray himself as a gentleman farmer, but he is not what he seems! He killed my cat, Sprinkles! Who knows what he might do to you or your loved ones...\"<ref name=\"trip\"/>\n\nAccording to Dwight, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], while the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was known for having the most deaths, the battle of Schrute Farms was known for having the highest DPA (deaths per acre).  He also claimed it was the northernmost battle during the Civil War. However, in reality, it was actually a safe haven for men who wanted relief from the war to focus on artistic lifestyles. It is insinuated that this was a camp for homosexual soldiers. Melvin Fifer Garris is the only known soldier to write home from Schrute Farms during the Civil War.\n\nA little known fact is that Dwight Schrute actually won his farm in a game of Blackjack.  This is only shown in a deleted scene from the Season 3 DVD set and some may not consider it canon.\n\n=== Vice presidential bid joke ===\n{{externalvideo\n| align = right\n| width =\n| video1 = [http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/#mea=251910 Rainn Wilson on The Tonight Show discussing the \"nomination\"]\n|\n}}\n\nOn the May 7, 2008, episode of ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', [[US Senator]] and  [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] presidential nominee [[John McCain]] joked that Dwight Schrute would be his vice presidential candidate choice.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/05/new-flash-jon-s.html |title= Sneak Peek: Jon Stewart actually presses John McCain on a topic |accessdate=2008-07-07 |last= Reston |first= Maeve |coauthors= |date= May 7, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=167939&title=john-mccain-pt.-2 |title= John McCain Pt. 2 |date= May 7, 2008 |publisher= [[Comedy Central]] | accessdate= 2008-08-10}}</ref> [[Rainn Wilson]] appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on May 14, 2008, and read to [[Jay Leno]] a list of demands from Dwight in exchange for being vice president.<ref name=\"vice\">{{cite web |url= http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/#mea=251910 |title= The Office: Dwight Schrute for VP |accessdate=2008-07-12 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=[[NBC]].com}}</ref> Included in this list was being able to pilot [[Air Force One]] at any time, and only to be addressed as \"Iceman\" while piloting.<ref name=\"vice\"/> He also demanded that [[Jack Bauer]] be immediately promoted to [[United States Secretary of Defense]], his [[bunker]] to include a [[foosball]] table and be [[zombie]]-proof, and that the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] members be armed with [[nunchaku]]s, [[throwing star]]s, and [[flamethrower]]s.<ref name=\"vice\"/> Finally, he demanded a flamethrower, an [[Iron Man]] suit, and that fellow character Michael Scott be an \"ambassador to [[Hawaii]].\"<ref name=\"vice\"/>\n\n===In academic research===\nResearchers at [[Brigham Young University]], [[Stanford]] and [[Northwestern University]] demonstrated that social outsiders, similar to Dwight's character, lead to better group decision making.

Glasses and open bottles of red Fanta are often seen as offerings on the small altars displayed in most Thai homes and shops. They supposedly  represent blood offerings in Thai [[animistic]] beliefs.\n* Green Soda (cream soda) - This flavour is not listed on the packaging. It is just called green soda or {{transl|tha|nam quiew}} (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 - literally means green water).

Glasses and open bottles of red Fanta are often seen as offerings on the small altars displayed in most Thai homes and shops. They supposedly  represent blood offerings in Thai [[animistic]] beliefs.\n* Green Soda (cream soda) - This flavour is not listed on the packaging. It is just called green soda or {{transl|tha|nam quiew}} (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 - literally means green water). The taste is very similar to a green jelly drink that is popular in Thailand and Southeast Asia.\n* Blueberry (2012)\n* Icy Lemon Lime (introduced 2015) Tastes similar to Lucozade.\n* Dang Manao\n\n===Retired editions===\n* Love\n* Blueberry Splash\n* Lime\n* Lychee\n* Mango\n* Pineapple\n* Root Beer\n* Sala berry\n* Watermelon\n\n==Trinidad and Tobago==\nIt is called Fanta [[Cannings Foods Limited|Cannings]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].\n* Banana\n* Cannings Big Red\n* Grape\n* King Orange\n* Roselle\n\n==Tunisia==\n*Apple\n* Lemon\n* Grape\n* Orange\n* Lime\n* Pi\u00f1a Colada\n* Sanguine\n\n==Turkey==\n* Orange\n* Lemon\n* Exotic\n\n===Retired editions===\n* Tangerine\n* Blood Orange\n* Grape\n* Tropical\n\n==Uganda==\n* Orange\n* Berry\n* Fruity\n\n==Ukraine==\n[[Image:Fanta-grapes-ukraine.jpg|82px|right|Grape-flavoured Fanta.]]\n\n* Orange\n* Tangerine (since January 2014)\n* Lemon (since May 2016)\n* Shokata (since 2018)\n\n===Discontinued===\n* Exotic\n* Citrus Blend\n* Wild Berry\n* Lime\n* Apple\n\n==United Arab Emirates==\n* Orange\n* Apple\n* Citrus\n* Strawberry\n* Frozen Grape (Slushy from Burger King)\n* Frozen Exotic (Slushy from Burger King)\n\n===Discontinued===\n* Red Cream Soda\n* Orange Light\n* Blackcurrant\n\n==United Kingdom==\n\n===Normal Variants===\n* Orange (previously called Orangeade and Orange Crush)\n* Lemon (Previously called Lemonade, Lemon Drink and Icy Lemon)\n* Fruit Twist (Orange, Peach and Passionfruit)\n\n===Northern Ireland Only Variants===\n* Exotic <ref name=\"ni-flavors\">{{cite web|url=http://coca-colabottlers.com/productsandpromotion/Fanta/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916130308/http://coca-colabottlers.com/productsandpromotion/Fanta/ |archivedate=2016-09-16 }}</ref>\n* Rock Shandy <ref name=\"ni-flavors\" />\n* Wildberry (exclusive to Northern Ireland & The Republic of Ireland)\n\n===Zero Variants===\n* Zero Orange (Previously called Diet Fanta Low Calorie Orange Crush, Diet Fanta Orange, Fanta Light Orange and Fanta Z Orange)\n* Zero Icy Lemon (Previously called Diet Fanta Lemon, Fanta Light Icy Lemon and Fanta Z Icy Lemon)\n* Zero Fruit Twist (Launched 2015)\n* Zero Grape (Launched in February 2019)\n* Zero Pink Grapefruit\n* Zero Raspberry (Launched in January 2020)\n\n===Only available via Coca-Cola Freestyle machines===\n* Cherry\n* Fruit Punch\n* Grape\n* Lime\n* Peach\n* Raspberry\n* Strawberry\n* Zero Cherry\n* Zero Fruit Punch\n* Zero Lime\n* Zero Peach\n* Zero Raspberry\n* Zero Strawberry\n* Zero Vanilla\n\n===Previous Limited editions===\n* Fanta Beach (Strawberry and Kiwi) (2011-2012)\n* Peach And Apricot (2013-2015)\n* Apple And Sour Cherry (2015-2016)\n* Bloodshot Orange Eyeballs (2008-2009 Halloween Edition)\n* Bloodshot Orange Eyeballs Zero (2008-2009 Halloween Edition)\n* Fruit-Twisty Eels (2008-2009 Halloween Edition)\n*Zero Blood Orange\n* Dark Orange (Limited Edition for Halloween 2019)\n\n===Discontinued===\n* Zero Summer Fruits\n* Zero Apple\n* Apple\n* Zesty Berry (Blackcurrant and Lemon)\n* Apple Splash Low Sugar (Apple, Lime, and Kiwi Fruit flavored with a mixture of Sugar and Sweeteners)\n* Still Orange Citrus -

Despite the warnings she received about the house being haunted, having no other place to go, she decides to move there anyway. Upon her arrival she discovers that the house is occupied illegally by three handsome young men: Aoi, Yukari and Ise. The three immediately warn the unaware Himari that she must leave the house as soon as possible, using the story of the ghosts and curses as well, but she does not give up. Soon, she discovers that it is all true: her home appears to be on the border between the human and the spirit worlds, and she was destined to be the guardian between the two, but her role is already taken by Aoi.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Himari Momochi|\u767e\u5343 \u3072\u307e\u308a|Momochi Himari}}\n:It has been stated in the manga that Himari's parents passed away, most likely when she was very young and has been an orphan ever since. It is unclear if she has any siblings before the incident or how her parents passed on. By having the blood of the Momochi family running in her veins, she is supposed to be the next Omamori-sama or, 'Nue', the guardian of the Momochi House when she receives the will of her family when she turns 16. This would make her the guardian of the Momochi House which is located on the border of the human and spirit world, which would fall under the guardian's protection and monitoring, However, that role has been taken by Aoi and now, she only holds the power to expel anyone from the house if she wishes hard enough due to her bloodline.\n;{{Nihongo|Aoi Nanamori|\u4e03\u5b88 \u8475|Nanamori Aoi}}\n:He is human, but he became the Omamori-sama at the age of 10 while trying to run away from something, he broke the seal and entered in the Momochi house, this forced him to become its guardian. The house has erased all the traces of his existence in the human world, which is why it seems that neither his family nor friends remember him. In the [[Nue]] form, he is a spirit with cat ears, bird feathers and foxtail.\n;{{Nihongo|Yukari|\u7d2b}}\n:He is Aoi's first [[shikigami]], a serving spirit, in his demonic form he has the appearance of a [[Mizuchi]], a water snake. In his past life he was human, wrongly accused of being a demon, given as a sacrifice to the dragon god Ryujin, the god took pity on him and allowed him to be reborn as an [[Ayakashi (y\u014dkai)|Ayakashi]] of his own species. He is very kind and does all the houseworks.\n;{{Nihongo|Ise|\u4f0a\u52e2}}\n:He is Aoi's second shikigami, in his demonic form he has the appearance of a [[Sh\u014dj\u014d]], an orangutan. He is the youngest of his species, for breaking the law by releasing his powers to the human world, the elders of his tribe fitted him with a cursed collar and warned him if he broke the law again, the curse would destroy his body. In order to save a friend, he ended up breaking the law so Aoi made Ise his shikigami to dissolve the curse and save him. Before arriving at the Momochi house, he enjoyed observing humans and sometimes playing pranks on them. Unlike Yukari, he is very grumpy.\n;{{Nihongo|Hakka|\u516b\u6e26}}\n:He is a gatekeeper in the spirit realm, he aspired to become the new Omamori-sama, but the Nue, to keep him at bay, forced him to become one of his shikigami.

Despite the warnings she received about the house being haunted, having no other place to go, she decides to move there anyway. Upon her arrival she discovers that the house is occupied illegally by three handsome young men: Aoi, Yukari and Ise. The three immediately warn the unaware Himari that she must leave the house as soon as possible, using the story of the ghosts and curses as well, but she does not give up. Soon, she discovers that it is all true: her home appears to be on the border between the human and the spirit worlds, and she was destined to be the guardian between the two, but her role is already taken by Aoi.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Himari Momochi|\u767e\u5343 \u3072\u307e\u308a|Momochi Himari}}\n:It has been stated in the manga that Himari's parents passed away, most likely when she was very young and has been an orphan ever since. It is unclear if she has any siblings before the incident or how her parents passed on. By having the blood of the Momochi family running in her veins, she is supposed to be the next Omamori-sama or, 'Nue', the guardian of the Momochi House when she receives the will of her family when she turns 16. This would make her the guardian of the Momochi House which is located on the border of the human and spirit world, which would fall under the guardian's protection and monitoring, However, that role has been taken by Aoi and now, she only holds the power to expel anyone from the house if she wishes hard enough due to her bloodline.\n;{{Nihongo|Aoi Nanamori|\u4e03\u5b88 \u8475|Nanamori Aoi}}\nHe is human, but he became the Omamori-sama at the age of 10 while trying to run away from something, he broke the seal and entered in the Momochi house, this forced him to become its guardian. The house has erased all the traces of his existence in the human world, which is why it seems that neither his family nor friends remember him. In the [[Nue]] form, he is a spirit with cat ears, bird feathers and foxtail.\n;{{Nihongo|Yukari|\u7d2b}}\nHe is Aoi's first [[shikigami]], a serving spirit, in his demonic form he has the appearance of a [[Mizuchi]], a water snake. In his past life he was human, wrongly accused of being a demon, given as a sacrifice to the dragon god Ryujin, the god took pity on him and allowed him to be reborn as an [[Ayakashi (y\u014dkai)|Ayakashi]] of his own species. He is very kind and does all the houseworks.\n;{{Nihongo|Ise|\u4f0a\u52e2}}\nHe is Aoi's second shikigami, in his demonic form he has the appearance of a [[Sh\u014dj\u014d]], an orangutan. He is the youngest of his species, for breaking the law by releasing his powers to the human world, the elders of his tribe fitted him with a cursed collar and warned him if he broke the law again, the curse would destroy his body. In order to save a friend, he ended up breaking the law so Aoi made Ise his shikigami to dissolve the curse and save him. Before arriving at the Momochi house, he enjoyed observing humans and sometimes playing pranks on them. Unlike Yukari, he is very grumpy.\n;{{Nihongo|Hakka|\u516b\u6e26}}\nHe is a gatekeeper in the spirit realm, he aspired to become the new Omamori-sama, but the Nue, to keep him at bay, forced him to become one of his shikigami.

At age 15, he took the [[\u015ar\u0101ma\u1e47era|samanera]] ([[novice]]) vows and was ordained as a [[bhikkhu|monk]] at age 20 under the [[dharma name]] '''Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c'''.

After two years, he went into [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] at the Sac Tu Thien An pagoda near [[Nha Trang]]. In 1932, he was appointed an inspector for the Buddhist Association in Ninh H\u00f2a before becoming the inspector of monks in his home province of Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a.

The last of the 31 new temples that he was responsible for constructing was the [[Avalokite\u015bvara|Quan The Am]] pagoda in the [[Ph\u00fa Nhu\u1eadn District]] of [[Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Province]] on the outskirts of [[Saigon]].<ref name=\"hm2\"/> The street on which the temple stands was later renamed Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c Street in 1975.

They denounced the Di\u1ec7m government and its policy towards Buddhists, demanding that it fulfill its promises of religious equality.<ref name=\"j147\"/> Another monk offered himself, but \u0110\u1ee9c's seniority prevailed.<ref name=\"k297\">{{harvnb|Karnow|1997|p=297}}</ref>\n\nThe act occurred at the intersection{{ref label|b|b|none}} of Phan \u0110\u00ecnh Ph\u00f9ng Boulevard (now Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Chi\u1ec3u Street) and L\u00ea V\u0103n Duy\u1ec7t Street (now C\u00e1ch M\u1ea1ng Th\u00e1ng T\u00e1m Street) ({{Coord|10.7750|106.6868|display=inline|type:event|name=Self-immolation of Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc 1963}}), a few blocks southwest of the [[Independence Palace|Presidential Palace]] (now the Reunification Palace). \u0110\u1ee9c emerged from the car along with two other monks. One placed a cushion on the road while the second opened the trunk and took out a five-gallon petrol can. As the marchers formed a circle around him, \u0110\u1ee9c calmly sat down in the traditional Buddhist meditative [[lotus position]] on the cushion. A colleague emptied the contents of the petrol container over \u0110\u1ee9c's head. \u0110\u1ee9c rotated a string of wooden [[prayer beads]] and recited the words ''{{lang|vi|[[Nianfo|Nam m\u00f4 A Di \u0110\u00e0 Ph\u1eadt]]}}'' (\"Homage to [[Amit\u0101bha]] [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]\") before striking a match and dropping it on himself.

Even some of the [[Republic of Vietnam National Police|policemen]], who had orders to control the gathered crowd, prostrated before him.<ref name=\"k297\"/>\n\nIn English and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], a monk repeated into a microphone: \"A Buddhist priest burns himself to death. A Buddhist priest becomes a martyr.\" After approximately 10 minutes, \u0110\u1ee9c's body was fully immolated and it eventually toppled backwards onto its back. Once the fire subsided, a group of monks covered the smoking corpse with yellow robes, picked it up and tried to fit it into a coffin, but the limbs could not be straightened and one of the arms protruded from the wooden box as he was carried to the nearby X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda in central Saigon.

The police lingered nearby. At around 6:00 pm (18:00), thirty nuns and six monks were arrested for holding a prayer meeting on the street outside X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i.

Di\u1ec7m had scheduled an emergency cabinet meeting at 11:30 on 11 June to discuss the Buddhist crisis which he believed to be winding down. Following \u0110\u1ee9c's death, Di\u1ec7m canceled the meeting and met individually with his ministers. Acting U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam [[William Trueheart]] warned [[Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn]], Di\u1ec7m's Secretary of State, of the desperate need for an agreement, saying that the situation was \"dangerously near breaking point\" and expected Di\u1ec7m would meet the Buddhists' five-point manifesto. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] warned the [[Embassy of the United States, Saigon|Saigon embassy]] that the [[White House]] would publicly announce that it would no longer \"associate itself\" with the regime if this did not occur.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=272}}.</ref> The [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9]] and concessions to the Buddhists were signed on 16 June.<ref name=\"h149\"/>\n\n15 June was set as the date for the funeral, and on that day 4,000 people gathered outside the X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i pagoda, only for the ceremony to be postponed.

Trueheart and embassy official Charles Flowerree felt that the location was selected to show solidarity with the Cambodian government of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]]. South Vietnam and Cambodia had strained relations: in a speech on 22 May, Sihanouk had accused Di\u1ec7m of mistreating Vietnamese and ethnic minority [[Khmer people|Khmer]] Buddhists. The pro-Di\u1ec7m ''[[Times of Vietnam]]'' published an article on 9 June which claimed that Cambodian monks had been encouraging the Buddhist crisis, asserting it was part of a Cambodian plot to extend its neutralist foreign policy into South Vietnam.

He appealed for \"serenity and patriotism\", and announced that stalled negotiations would resume with the Buddhists. He claimed that negotiations had been progressing well and in a time of religious tension emphasized the role of the Roman Catholic philosophy of [[personalism]] in his rule.

Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The [[French Indochina|French colonial]] authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Hu\u1ebf in the 1920s, but he managed to starve himself to death instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style. The practice had also been seen in the Chinese city of [[Harbin]] in 1948 when a monk seated down in the lotus position on a pile of [[sawdust]] and [[soybean]] oil and set fire to himself in protest against the treatment of Buddhism by the communists of [[Mao Zedong]].

Once the fire subsided, a group of monks covered the smoking corpse with yellow robes, picked it up and tried to fit it into a coffin, but the limbs could not be straightened and one of the arms protruded from the wooden box as he was carried to the nearby X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda in central Saigon.

Following \u0110\u1ee9c's death, Di\u1ec7m canceled the meeting and met individually with his ministers. Acting U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam [[William Trueheart]] warned [[Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn]], Di\u1ec7m's Secretary of State, of the desperate need for an agreement, saying that the situation was \"dangerously near breaking point\" and expected Di\u1ec7m would meet the Buddhists' five-point manifesto. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] warned the [[Embassy of the United States, Saigon|Saigon embassy]] that the [[White House]] would publicly announce that it would no longer \"associate itself\" with the regime if this did not occur.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=272}}.</ref> The [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9]] and concessions to the Buddhists were signed on 16 June.<ref name=\"h149\"/>\n\n15 June was set as the date for the funeral, and on that day 4,000 people gathered outside the X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i pagoda, only for the ceremony to be postponed.

Trueheart and embassy official Charles Flowerree felt that the location was selected to show solidarity with the Cambodian government of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]]. South Vietnam and Cambodia had strained relations: in a speech on 22 May, Sihanouk had accused Di\u1ec7m of mistreating Vietnamese and ethnic minority [[Khmer people|Khmer]] Buddhists. The pro-Di\u1ec7m ''[[Times of Vietnam]]'' published an article on 9 June which claimed that Cambodian monks had been encouraging the Buddhist crisis, asserting it was part of a Cambodian plot to extend its neutralist foreign policy into South Vietnam. Flowerree noted that Di\u1ec7m was \"ready and eager to see a fine Cambodian hand in all the organized Buddhist actions\".<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=271}}.</ref>\n\n===Di\u1ec7m reaction===\n[[File:Ngo Dinh Diem - Thumbnail - ARC 542189.png|thumb|[[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]]|alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile.

He appealed for \"serenity and patriotism\", and announced that stalled negotiations would resume with the Buddhists. He claimed that negotiations had been progressing well and in a time of religious tension emphasized the role of the Roman Catholic philosophy of [[personalism]] in his rule. He alleged that extremists had twisted the facts and he asserted that the Buddhists can \"count on the Constitution, in other words, me.\"<ref name=\"j270\"/>\n\nThe ARVN responded to the appeal, putting on a show of solidarity behind Di\u1ec7m to isolate dissident officers. Thirty high-ranking officers headed by General [[L\u00ea V\u0103n T\u1ef5]] declared their resolve to carry out all missions entrusted to the army for the defense of the constitution and the Republic.

Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The [[French Indochina|French colonial]] authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Hu\u1ebf in the 1920s, but he managed to starve himself to death instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style.

One study testing this was done at the University of Virginia by Caroline Kelsey.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kelsey|first=Caroline|last2=Vaish|first2=Amrisha|last3=Grossmann|first3=Tobias|date=2018-12-01|title=Eyes, More Than Other Facial Features, Enhance Real-World Donation Behavior|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-018-9327-1|journal=Human Nature|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=390\u2013401|doi=10.1007/s12110-018-9327-1|issn=1936-4776}}</ref> The study was done at a children's museum where there was a donation box at the front desk. Data was collected from this setting for 28 weeks, testing more than 34,100 people who visited in the span of this time. Each week the sign over the box that usually read \"Donations would be appreciated\" changed to primarily images of eyes or other inanimate objects such as chairs or noses with some wording with it. Throughout each week the number of people who visited the museum was recording along with the total amount of donations made. By the end of the study it was found that patrons donated more under the presence of eyes on the signs rather than other inanimate objects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/10/181015104520.htm|title=People donate more when they sense they are being watched: Study suggests that eyes serve as cues to monitor and elicit charitable behavior|website=ScienceDaily|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\n=== More on studies ===\nOther studies in relation to the watching-eye-effect show that people are more cooperative and aware of themselves when their identity is exposed as opposed to when they are acting anonymously. They act more respectively and appropriately because their reputation is at risk when they are being watched by others or feel that they are being watched.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Even in some studies that insisted to their participants that their actions were anonymous they were still more generous because they felt identified by the eyes.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nSome studies argue that it may not be the effect of these eyes that gives people incentive to be more generous, but the amount of people that are around them that make them feel [[peer pressure]] to conform to more pro-social behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oda|first=Ryo|date=2019-05-28|title=Is the watching-eye effect a fluke?|url=https://lebs.hbesj.org/index.php/lebs/article/view/lebs.2019.68|journal=Letters on Evolutionary Behavioral Science|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=4\u20136|doi=10.5178/lebs.2019.68|issn=1884-927X}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Fake security camera]]\n*[[Evil eye]]\n*[[Situation awareness]]\n*[[Decision-making]]\n*[[Gaze]]\n*[[Subject-expectancy effect]]\n*[[Eye contact]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Psychological effects]]\n[[Category:Cognition]]\n[[Category:Cognitive biases]]\n[[Category:Cognitive psychology]]\n", "name_user": "Emilyjones24", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watching-eye_effect"}
