Typically, each individual piece has a portion of a picture; when assembled, the jigsaw puzzle produces a complete picture. \n\nJigsaw puzzles were originally created by [[painting]] a picture on a flat, rectangular piece of wood, and then cutting that picture into small pieces. Despite it being called a jigsaw, a jigsaw was never actually used to cut it. [[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]], a [[London]] [[cartographer]] and [[engraver]], is credited with commercializing jigsaw puzzles around 1760.<ref name=history>{{cite web|last1=McAdam|first1=Daniel|title=History of Jigsaw Puzzles|url=http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html|publisher=American Jigsaw Puzzle Society |accessdate=13 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001019002453/http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html|archivedate=19 October 2000}}</ref> Jigsaw puzzles have since come to be made primarily of cardboard.\n\nTypical images found on jigsaw puzzles include scenes from [[nature]], [[building]]s, and repetitive designs -- [[castle]]s and [[mountain]]s are common, traditional subjects. However, any kind of picture can be used to make a jigsaw puzzle; artisanal puzzle-makers and companies using technologies to allow one-off or small print run puzzles allow a wide range of subject matter, from [[optical illusions]], unusual art, or personal photographs. Beyond flat two-dimensional puzzles, three-dimensional puzzles have been moving to large-scale production and distribution, including spherical jigsaws and architectural recreations. \n\n\nDuring recent years, a range of [[jigsaw puzzle accessories]] including boards, cases, frames, and roll-up mats have become available that are designed to assist jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts. Completed puzzles can also be attached to a backing with adhesive to be used as artwork.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Spilsbury jigsaw - John Spilsbury, 1766 - BL.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]]'s \"Europe divided into its kingdoms, etc.\" (1766).

Since fretsaws are distinct from [[jigsaw (tool)|jigsaws]], the name appears to be a [[misnomer]].<ref name=history /> [[Cardboard]] jigsaw puzzles appeared during the late 1800s, but were slow to replace the wooden jigsaw due to the manufacturer's belief that cardboard puzzles would be perceived as being of low quality, and the fact that [[profit margins]] on wooden jigsaws were larger.<ref name=history />\n[[File:Close up of Hand Cut Jigsaw Puzzle.JPG|thumb|left|Wooden jigsaw pieces, cut by hand]]\nJigsaw puzzles soared in popularity during the [[Great Depression]], as they provided a cheap, long-lasting, [[recycling|recyclable]] form of entertainment.<ref name=history /><ref name=briefhistory>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Anne, D.|title=Jigsaw Puzzles - A Brief History|url=http://www.mgcpuzzles.com/mgcpuzzles/puzzle%5Fhistory/|website=www.mgcpuzzles.com|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> It was around this time that jigsaws evolved to become more complex and more appealing to adults.<ref name=history /> They were also given away in [[promotion (marketing)|product promotions]], and used in [[advertising]], with customers completing an image of the product being promoted.<ref name=history /><ref name=briefhistory />\n\nDuring the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] stay at home orders, demand for jigsaw puzzles saw a surge, comparable to that of the Great Depression.<ref name=cnbc>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/03/coronavirus-sends-demand-for-jigsaw-puzzles-surging.html\n | title =Demand for jigsaw puzzles is surging as coronavirus keeps millions of Americans indoors \n | last =Miller\n | first =Hannah\n | date =April 5, 2020\n | website =CNBC\n | publisher =\n | access-date =April 16, 2020\n | quote = }}</ref> Massachusetts company Ceaco, one of the largest U.S. producers of jigsaw puzzles and family games had difficulty keeping up with demand.

An enlarged [[photograph]] or printed reproduction of a painting or other two-dimensional [[art]]work is glued onto the cardboard before cutting. This board is then fed into a press. The press forces a set of hardened steel blades of the desired shape through the board until it is fully cut. This procedure is similar to making shaped cookies with a cookie cutter. The forces involved, however, are tremendously greater and a typical 1000-piece puzzle requires a press that can generate upwards of 700 tons of force to push the knives of the puzzle die through the board. A puzzle die is a flat board, often made from plywood, which has slots cut or burned in the same shape as the knives that are used.  These knives are set into the slots and covered in a compressible material, typically foam rubber, which serves to eject the cut puzzle pieces.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, jigsaw puzzles were cut using large hydraulic presses which now cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The cuts gave a very snug fit, but the cost limited jigsaw puzzle manufacture only to large corporations.  Recent roller press design achieve the same effect, at a lower cost.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} \n\nNew technology has enabled laser-cutting of wooden or acrylic jigsaw puzzles. The advantage of cutting with a laser is that the puzzle can be custom cut into any size, any shape, with any size (or any number) of pieces. Many museums have laser cut acrylic puzzles made of some of their more important pieces of art so that children visiting the museum can see the original piece and then assemble a jigsaw puzzle of the image that is also in the same shape as the piece of art. Acrylic is used because the pieces are very durable, waterproof, and can withstand continued use without the image fading, or the pieces wearing out, or becoming frayed. Also, because the print and cut patterns are computer-based, lost pieces can be manufactured without remaking the entire puzzle.\n\nBy the early 1960s, [[Tower Press]] was the world's largest maker of jigsaw puzzles, acquired by [[Waddingtons]] in 1969.<ref name=\"Achievement\">{{cite book|title=Achievement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMkNAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 April 2013|year=1962|publisher=World Trade Magazines Ltd.|page=31}}</ref> Major jigsaw puzzle manufacturers currently include [[Ravensburger]] and [[Tower Press]]. Wooden and specialty jigsaw puzzle manufacturers include [[Artifact Puzzles]]. In addition to large-scale puzzle manufacturers, numerous puzzle makers work in an artisanal style, handcrafting and handcutting jigsaw puzzles.<ref>Charlotte Arneson, [https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/04/jigsaw-puzzles-coronavirus-quarantine.html \"The Perfect Jigsaw for Every Type of Puzzler\"], ''Slate'', April 10, 2020.</ref><ref>Tracee M.

Among those targeted to adults, 300, 500, and 750 piece puzzles are considered \"smaller\". More sophisticated, but still common, jigsaw puzzles come in sizes of 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,500, 8,000, 9,000, 13,200, 18,000, 24,000, 32,000 and 40,000 pieces. \n\nJigsaw puzzles that are geared towards children may have many fewer pieces, typically much larger. For very young children, a puzzle with as few as 4 to 9 \"large\"-size pieces (so not a choking hazard) are common. These are usually made of wood or plastic, to maintain durability, and are able to be cleaned without being damaged.\n\nThe most common layout for a thousand-piece puzzle is 38 pieces by 27 pieces, for a total count of 1,026 pieces. The majority of 500-piece puzzles are 27 pieces by 19 pieces.  A few puzzles are made double-sided, so that they can be solved from either side. This adds a level of complexity, because it cannot be certain that the correct side of the piece is being viewed and assembled with the other pieces.\n\n\"Family puzzles\" come in 100\u2013550 pieces with three different-sized pieces from large to small. The pieces are placed from large to small, going in one direction or towards the middle of the puzzle.  This allows a family of puzzlers of different skill levels and different-sized hands to work on the puzzle at the same time. Companies like [[Springbok Puzzles|Springbok]], [[Cobble Hill Puzzles|Cobble Hill]], [[Ravensburger]], and [[Suns Out]] make this type of specialty puzzle.\n\nThere are also [[dimension|three-dimensional]] jigsaw puzzles. Many of these are made of wood or [[styrofoam]] and require the puzzle to be solved in a certain order; some pieces will not fit in if others are already in place.\nAlso common are ''puzzle boxes'': simple three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles with a small drawer or box in the center for storage.\n\nAnother type of jigsaw puzzle, which is considered a 3-D puzzle, is a [[puzzle globe]].  Like a 2-D puzzle, a globe puzzle is often made of plastic and the assembled pieces form a single layer. But the final form is a three-dimensional shape. Most globe puzzles have designs representing spherical shapes such as the [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and historical globes of the Earth.\n\nThere are also computer versions of jigsaw puzzles, which have the advantages of requiring zero cleanup and no risk of losing any pieces. Many computer-based jigsaw puzzles do not allow pieces to be rotated, so all pieces are displayed in their correct orientation. These puzzles are thus considerably easier than a physical jigsaw puzzle with the same number of pieces. A computer puzzle website can allow users to choose their own puzzle size, cut design, and image, or upload their own images to use as puzzles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Online Jigsaw Puzzles |url=http://www.jigzone.com/ |publisher=Jigzone |accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> An online jigsaw version of [[Trolleholm Castle]] in Sweden may be worked and timed for speed of finishing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trolleholm Castle, Sweden jigsaw puzzle |url=http://thejigsawpuzzles.com/Castles/Trolleholm-Castle-Sweden-jigsaw-puzzle |website=TheJigsawPuzzles.com |accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> The [[New Yorker Magazine]] subscription website preserves images of the magazine's cover illustrations as jigsaw puzzles, which are timed and offer several levels of difficulty.\n\nIn 2016 was introduced a computer version of puzzle globe, the [[immersive panorama jigsaw]], which is based on the use of [[equirectangular]] images taken by 360-degree camera. Despite the physical spherical jigsaw, the player, who resides in the perfect center of the globe, assembles triangular-shaped interlocking pieces around him. When complete, this puzzle produces a full-degree panorama all around the player. An example of immersive jigsaw is [[Sitespot]], which also enriches the gaming experience with the scene soundscape and allows pieces to be displayed rotated.\n\nJigsaw puzzles can vary greatly in price depending on the complexity, number of pieces, and brand. Children's puzzles can be as cheap as around $5.00, while larger puzzles can be closer to $50.00. The most expensive puzzle to date was sold for $27,000 in 2005 at a charitable auction for The Golden Retriever Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-expensive-jigsaw-puzzle-sold-at-auction/ |title=Most expensive jigsaw puzzle sold at auction |website=Guinness World Records |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n\nSeveral word puzzle games use pieces similar to those used in jigsaw puzzles. Examples include [[Alfa-Lek]], [[Jigsaw Words]], [[Nab-It!]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Typ-Dom]], [[Word Jigsaw]], and [[Yottsugo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1028/puzzle |title=Puzzle - Board Game Category - BoardGameGeek |author= |date= |website=boardgamegeek.com |accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n== Puzzle pieces ==\n[[Image:Whimsy.JPG|thumb|A \"whimsy\" piece in a wooden jigsaw puzzle]]\n[[Image:3D Jigsaw Puzzle.jpg|thumb|A 3D jigsaw puzzle]]\nMany puzzles are termed \"fully interlocking\". This means that adjacent pieces are connected in such a way that if one piece is moved horizontally, the other pieces move with it, preserving the connection. Sometimes the connection is tight enough to pick up a solved part by holding one piece.\n\nSome fully interlocking puzzles have pieces all of a similar shape, with rounded tabs out on opposite ends, with corresponding blanks cut into the intervening sides to receive the tabs of adjacent pieces. Other fully interlocking puzzles may have tabs and blanks variously arranged on each piece, but they usually have four sides, and the numbers of tabs and blanks thus add up to four. The uniform-shaped fully interlocking puzzles, sometimes called \"Japanese Style\", are the most difficult, because the differences in shapes between pieces can be very subtle. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nMost jigsaw puzzles are square, rectangular, or round, with edge pieces that have one side that is either straight or smoothly curved to create this shape, plus four corner pieces if the puzzle is square or rectangular. Some jigsaw puzzles have edge pieces that are cut just like all the rest of the interlocking pieces, with no smooth edge, to make them more challenging. Other puzzles are designed so the shape of the whole puzzle forms a figure, such as an animal. The edge pieces may vary more in these cases.<!-- {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} --><!--  No citation is required, as the statement merely follows logically from the preceding one; this is no doubt at least partly responsible for the citation request being ignored for 8 years. -->\n\nThe pieces of spherical jigsaw, like immersive panorama jigsaw, can be triangular shaped, according to the rules of tessellation of the geoid primitive.\n\nThe designer Yuu Asaka created \u201cJigsaw Puzzle 29\u201d which has not four corner pieces but five corner pieces, and is made from pale blue acrylic without a picture. <ref>{{Citation|last=Ramsay|first=Chris|date=2019-03-07|title=Solving The HARDEST JIGSAW PUZZLE!! - LEVEL 10!|publisher=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks3vbiCSmKI}}</ref> It was awarded the Jury Honorable Mention of 2018 Puzzle Design Competition. <ref>{{Citation|year=2018|title=2018 Puzzle Design Competition Results|publisher=International Puzzle Collectors Association|url=https://puzzleworld.org/DesignCompetition/2018/results.htm}}</ref> But many puzzlers had solved it easily, he created \u201cJigsaw Puzzle 19\u201d which composed only with corner pieces as revenge. <ref>{{Citation|author=Valtiel|date=2019-08-21|title=This puzzle composed only with corners|publisher=[[Reddit]]|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ctfc61/this_puzzle_composed_only_with_corners/}}</ref> It was made with transparent green acrylic pieces without a picture. <ref>{{Citation|last=Asaka|first=Yuu|year=2019|title=Yuu Asaka interview|publisher=Akita University of art|url=https://www.akibi.ac.jp/interview/23688.html}}</ref>\n\n== World records ==\n=== Largest commercially available jigsaw puzzles ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Pieces!!Name of puzzle!!Company!!Year!!Size [cm]!!Area [m<sup>2</sup>]\n|-\n|52,110||(No title: collage of animals)||MartinPuzzle||2018||696.0 &times; 201.5||style=\"text-align:right;\" |14.024\n|-\n|51,300||27 Wonders from Around the World||Kodak||2019||868.7 &times; 190.5||style=\"text-align:right;\" |16.53\n|-\n|48,000||Around the World||Grafika||2017||768.0 &times; 204.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |15.667\n|-\n|42,000||La vuelta al Mundo||Educa||2017||749.0 &times; 157.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |11.759\n|-\n|40,320||Making Mickey Magic||Ravensburger||2018||680.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |13.056\n|-\n|40,320||Memorable Disney Moments||Ravensburger||2016||680.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |13.056\n|-\n|33,600||Wild Life||Educa||2014||570.0 &times; 157.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |8.9495\n|-\n|32,256||New York City Window||Ravensburger||2014||544.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |10.445\n|-\n|32,256||Double Retrospect||Ravensburger||2010||544.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |10.445\n|-\n|24,000||Life, The greatest puzzle||Educa||2007||428.0 &times; 157.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |6.720\n|}\nThe world's largest commercially available jigsaw puzzle (Nov. 2018) is produced by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] company MartinPuzzle and contains 52,110 pieces showing a collage of animals.\n\nIn 2016, the German company [[Ravensburger]] released their biggest puzzle.

Puzzle sizes are typically listed on commercially distributed puzzles, but usually just include the total number of pieces in the puzzle, and do not list the count of edge or interior pieces. \n\nPuzzlers therefore calculate the number of border pieces. To calculate B (border pieces) from P (the total piece count), follow this method: \n# List the [[prime factors]] of P. <br />''For example: For a 513-piece jigsaw, the prime factorization tree is 3\u00d73\u00d73\u00d719=513.'' \n# Take the square root of P and round off.  <br />''The square root of 513 is about 22.6, so round to 23.''\n# Look for numbers in the prime factor list within +/- 20 percent of the square root of P. \n## Calculate 20% of the square root of P.  <br />''20% of 23 = 4.6.''\n## Develop the range, +/- 20%, from the square root of P.  <br />''The square root is about 23.  23 +/- 4.6 = 18.4 to 27.6''\n## Compare the range with the factor list. Define this as '''E1'''. <br />''The factor list shows '''19''' in the range.''  \n# Determine the horizontal / vertical dimensions. \n#* Divide P (the total number of pieces) by E1 to determine the horizontal / vertical dimensions, E1xE2. <br />''513 / 19 = 27. This is probably a 19x27 puzzle.''\n#* alternate approach: Take the remaining numbers from the prime factorization tree. <br />''3x3x3 = 27'' \n# Add the four sides and subtract \"4\" to correct for the corner pieces, which would otherwise be counted in both the horizontal and vertical.  <br />''27 + 27 + 19 + 19 -4 = 88. These 88 border pieces include 4 corners, 17 pieces between corners on the short sides, and 25 between corners on the long sides.''\n\nCommon puzzle dimensions: \n* 1000 piece puzzle: 1026 pieces, 126 border pieces\n\n=== Largest-sized jigsaw puzzles ===\nThe world's largest-sized jigsaw puzzle measured {{convert|58435|ft2|abbr=on|order=flip}} with 21,600 pieces, each measuring a Guinness World Records maximum size of 50&nbsp;cm by 50&nbsp;cm.

Typically, each individual piece has a portion of a picture; when assembled, the jigsaw puzzle produces a complete picture. \n\nJigsaw puzzles were originally created by [[painting]] a picture on a flat, rectangular piece of wood, and then cutting that picture into small pieces. Despite it being called a jigsaw, a jigsaw was never actually used to cut it.

However, any kind of picture can be used to make a jigsaw puzzle; artisanal puzzle-makers and companies using technologies to allow one-off or small print run puzzles allow a wide range of subject matter, from [[optical illusions]], unusual art, or personal photographs. Beyond flat two-dimensional puzzles, three-dimensional puzzles have been moving to large-scale production and distribution, including spherical jigsaws and architectural recreations. \n\n\nDuring recent years, a range of [[jigsaw puzzle accessories]] including boards, cases, frames, and roll-up mats have become available that are designed to assist jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts. Completed puzzles can also be attached to a backing with adhesive to be used as artwork.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Spilsbury jigsaw - John Spilsbury, 1766 - BL.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]]'s \"Europe divided into its kingdoms, etc.\" (1766).

An enlarged [[photograph]] or printed reproduction of a painting or other two-dimensional [[art]]work is glued onto the cardboard before cutting. This board is then fed into a press. The press forces a set of hardened steel blades of the desired shape through the board until it is fully cut. This procedure is similar to making shaped cookies with a cookie cutter. The forces involved, however, are tremendously greater and a typical 1000-piece puzzle requires a press that can generate upwards of 700 tons of force to push the knives of the puzzle die through the board. A puzzle die is a flat board, often made from plywood, which has slots cut or burned in the same shape as the knives that are used.  These knives are set into the slots and covered in a compressible material, typically foam rubber, which serves to eject the cut puzzle pieces.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, jigsaw puzzles were cut using large hydraulic presses which now cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The cuts gave a very snug fit, but the cost limited jigsaw puzzle manufacture only to large corporations.  Recent roller press design achieve the same effect, at a lower cost.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} \n\nNew technology has enabled laser-cutting of wooden or acrylic jigsaw puzzles. The advantage of cutting with a laser is that the puzzle can be custom cut into any size, any shape, with any size (or any number) of pieces. Many museums have laser cut acrylic puzzles made of some of their more important pieces of art so that children visiting the museum can see the original piece and then assemble a jigsaw puzzle of the image that is also in the same shape as the piece of art. Acrylic is used because the pieces are very durable, waterproof, and can withstand continued use without the image fading, or the pieces wearing out, or becoming frayed. Also, because the print and cut patterns are computer-based, lost pieces can be manufactured without remaking the entire puzzle.\n\nBy the early 1960s, [[Tower Press]] was the world's largest maker of jigsaw puzzles, acquired by [[Waddingtons]] in 1969.<ref name=\"Achievement\">{{cite book|title=Achievement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMkNAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 April 2013|year=1962|publisher=World Trade Magazines Ltd.|page=31}}</ref> Major jigsaw puzzle manufacturers currently include [[Ravensburger]] and [[Tower Press]]. Wooden and specialty jigsaw puzzle manufacturers include [[Artifact Puzzles]]. In addition to large-scale puzzle manufacturers, numerous puzzle makers work in an artisanal style, handcrafting and handcutting jigsaw puzzles.<ref>Charlotte Arneson, [https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/04/jigsaw-puzzles-coronavirus-quarantine.html \"The Perfect Jigsaw for Every Type of Puzzler\"], ''Slate'', April 10, 2020.</ref><ref>Tracee M.

Among those targeted to adults, 300, 500, and 750 piece puzzles are considered \"smaller\". More sophisticated, but still common, jigsaw puzzles come in sizes of 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,500, 8,000, 9,000, 13,200, 18,000, 24,000, 32,000 and 40,000 pieces. \n\nJigsaw puzzles that are geared towards children may have many fewer pieces, typically much larger. For very young children, a puzzle with as few as 4 to 9 \"large\"-size pieces (so not a choking hazard) are common. These are usually made of wood or plastic, to maintain durability, and are able to be cleaned without being damaged.\n\nThe most common layout for a thousand-piece puzzle is 38 pieces by 27 pieces, for a total count of 1,026 pieces. The majority of 500-piece puzzles are 27 pieces by 19 pieces.  A few puzzles are made double-sided, so that they can be solved from either side. This adds a level of complexity, because it cannot be certain that the correct side of the piece is being viewed and assembled with the other pieces.\n\n\"Family puzzles\" come in 100\u2013550 pieces with three different-sized pieces from large to small. The pieces are placed from large to small, going in one direction or towards the middle of the puzzle.  This allows a family of puzzlers of different skill levels and different-sized hands to work on the puzzle at the same time. Companies like [[Springbok Puzzles|Springbok]], [[Cobble Hill Puzzles|Cobble Hill]], [[Ravensburger]], and [[Suns Out]] make this type of specialty puzzle.\n\nThere are also [[dimension|three-dimensional]] jigsaw puzzles. Many of these are made of wood or [[styrofoam]] and require the puzzle to be solved in a certain order; some pieces will not fit in if others are already in place.\nAlso common are ''puzzle boxes'': simple three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles with a small drawer or box in the center for storage.\n\nAnother type of jigsaw puzzle, which is considered a 3-D puzzle, is a [[puzzle globe]].  Like a 2-D puzzle, a globe puzzle is often made of plastic and the assembled pieces form a single layer. But the final form is a three-dimensional shape. Most globe puzzles have designs representing spherical shapes such as the [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and historical globes of the Earth.\n\nThere are also computer versions of jigsaw puzzles, which have the advantages of requiring zero cleanup and no risk of losing any pieces. Many computer-based jigsaw puzzles do not allow pieces to be rotated, so all pieces are displayed in their correct orientation. These puzzles are thus considerably easier than a physical jigsaw puzzle with the same number of pieces. A computer puzzle website can allow users to choose their own puzzle size, cut design, and image, or upload their own images to use as puzzles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Online Jigsaw Puzzles |url=http://www.jigzone.com/ |publisher=Jigzone |accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> An online jigsaw version of [[Trolleholm Castle]] in Sweden may be worked and timed for speed of finishing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trolleholm Castle, Sweden jigsaw puzzle |url=http://thejigsawpuzzles.com/Castles/Trolleholm-Castle-Sweden-jigsaw-puzzle |website=TheJigsawPuzzles.com |accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> The [[New Yorker Magazine]] subscription website preserves images of the magazine's cover illustrations as jigsaw puzzles, which are timed and offer several levels of difficulty.\n\nIn 2016 was introduced a computer version of puzzle globe, the [[immersive panorama jigsaw]], which is based on the use of [[equirectangular]] images taken by 360-degree camera. Despite the physical spherical jigsaw, the player, who resides in the perfect center of the globe, assembles triangular-shaped interlocking pieces around him. When complete, this puzzle produces a full-degree panorama all around the player. An example of immersive jigsaw is [[Sitespot]], which also enriches the gaming experience with the scene soundscape and allows pieces to be displayed rotated.\n\nJigsaw puzzles can vary greatly in price depending on the complexity, number of pieces, and brand. Children's puzzles can be as cheap as around $5.00, while larger puzzles can be closer to $50.00. The most expensive puzzle to date was sold for $27,000 in 2005 at a charitable auction for The Golden Retriever Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-expensive-jigsaw-puzzle-sold-at-auction/ |title=Most expensive jigsaw puzzle sold at auction |website=Guinness World Records |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n\nSeveral word puzzle games use pieces similar to those used in jigsaw puzzles. Examples include [[Alfa-Lek]], [[Jigsaw Words]], [[Nab-It!]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Typ-Dom]], [[Word Jigsaw]], and [[Yottsugo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1028/puzzle |title=Puzzle - Board Game Category - BoardGameGeek |author= |date= |website=boardgamegeek.com |accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n== Puzzle pieces ==\n[[Image:Whimsy.JPG|thumb|A \"whimsy\" piece in a wooden jigsaw puzzle]]\n[[Image:3D Jigsaw Puzzle.jpg|thumb|A 3D jigsaw puzzle]]\nMany puzzles are termed \"fully interlocking\". This means that adjacent pieces are connected in such a way that if one piece is moved horizontally, the other pieces move with it, preserving the connection. Sometimes the connection is tight enough to pick up a solved part by holding one piece.\n\nSome fully interlocking puzzles have pieces all of a similar shape, with rounded tabs out on opposite ends, with corresponding blanks cut into the intervening sides to receive the tabs of adjacent pieces. Other fully interlocking puzzles may have tabs and blanks variously arranged on each piece, but they usually have four sides, and the numbers of tabs and blanks thus add up to four. The uniform-shaped fully interlocking puzzles, sometimes called \"Japanese Style\", are the most difficult, because the differences in shapes between pieces can be very subtle. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nMost jigsaw puzzles are square, rectangular, or round, with edge pieces that have one side that is either straight or smoothly curved to create this shape, plus four corner pieces if the puzzle is square or rectangular. Some jigsaw puzzles have edge pieces that are cut just like all the rest of the interlocking pieces, with no smooth edge, to make them more challenging. Other puzzles are designed so the shape of the whole puzzle forms a figure, such as an animal. The edge pieces may vary more in these cases.<!-- {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} --><!--  No citation is required, as the statement merely follows logically from the preceding one; this is no doubt at least partly responsible for the citation request being ignored for 8 years. -->\n\nThe pieces of spherical jigsaw, like immersive panorama jigsaw, can be triangular shaped, according to the rules of tessellation of the geoid primitive.\n\nThe designer Yuu Asaka created \u201cJigsaw Puzzle 29\u201d which has not four corner pieces but five corner pieces, and is made from pale blue acrylic without a picture. <ref>{{Citation|last=Ramsay|first=Chris|date=2019-03-07|title=Solving The HARDEST JIGSAW PUZZLE!! - LEVEL 10!|publisher=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks3vbiCSmKI}}</ref> It was awarded the Jury Honorable Mention of 2018 Puzzle Design Competition. <ref>{{Citation|year=2018|title=2018 Puzzle Design Competition Results|publisher=International Puzzle Collectors Association|url=https://puzzleworld.org/DesignCompetition/2018/results.htm}}</ref> But many puzzlers had solved it easily, he created \u201cJigsaw Puzzle 19\u201d which composed only with corner pieces as revenge. <ref>{{Citation|author=Valtiel|date=2019-08-21|title=This puzzle composed only with corners|publisher=[[Reddit]]|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ctfc61/this_puzzle_composed_only_with_corners/}}</ref> It was made with transparent green acrylic pieces without a picture. <ref>{{Citation|last=Asaka|first=Yuu|year=2019|title=Yuu Asaka interview|publisher=Akita University of art|url=https://www.akibi.ac.jp/interview/23688.html}}</ref>\n\n== World records ==\n=== Largest commercially available jigsaw puzzles ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Pieces!!Name of puzzle!!Company!!Year!!Size [cm]!!Area [m<sup>2</sup>]\n|-\n|52,110||(No title: collage of animals)||MartinPuzzle||2018||696.0 &times; 201.5||style=\"text-align:right;\" |14.024\n|-\n|51,300||27 Wonders from Around the World||Kodak||2019||868.7 &times; 190.5||style=\"text-align:right;\" |16.53\n|-\n|48,000||Around the World||Grafika||2017||768.0 &times; 204.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |15.667\n|-\n|42,000||La vuelta al Mundo||Educa||2017||749.0 &times; 157.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |11.759\n|-\n|40,320||Making Mickey Magic||Ravensburger||2018||680.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |13.056\n|-\n|40,320||Memorable Disney Moments||Ravensburger||2016||680.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |13.056\n|-\n|33,600||Wild Life||Educa||2014||570.0 &times; 157.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |8.9495\n|-\n|32,256||New York City Window||Ravensburger||2014||544.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |10.445\n|-\n|32,256||Double Retrospect||Ravensburger||2010||544.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |10.445\n|-\n|24,000||Life, The greatest puzzle||Educa||2007||428.0 &times; 157.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |6.720\n|}\nThe world's largest commercially available jigsaw puzzle (Nov. 2018) is produced by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] company MartinPuzzle and contains 52,110 pieces showing a collage of animals.\n\nIn 2016, the German company [[Ravensburger]] released their biggest puzzle.

Puzzle sizes are typically listed on commercially distributed puzzles, but usually just include the total number of pieces in the puzzle, and do not list the count of edge or interior pieces. \n\nPuzzlers therefore calculate the number of border pieces. To calculate B (border pieces) from P (the total piece count), follow this method: \n# List the [[prime factors]] of P. <br />''For example: For a 513-piece jigsaw, the prime factorization tree is 3\u00d73\u00d73\u00d719=513.'' \n# Take the square root of P and round off.  <br />''The square root of 513 is about 22.6, so round to 23.''\n# Look for numbers in the prime factor list within +/- 20 percent of the square root of P. \n## Calculate 20% of the square root of P.  <br />''20% of 23 = 4.6.''\n## Develop the range, +/- 20%, from the square root of P.  <br />''The square root is about 23.  23 +/- 4.6 = 18.4 to 27.6''\n## Compare the range with the factor list. Define this as '''E1'''. <br />''The factor list shows '''19''' in the range.''  \n# Determine the horizontal / vertical dimensions. \n#* Divide P (the total number of pieces) by E1 to determine the horizontal / vertical dimensions, E1xE2. <br />''513 / 19 = 27. This is probably a 19x27 puzzle.''\n#* alternate approach: Take the remaining numbers from the prime factorization tree. <br />''3x3x3 = 27'' \n# Add the four sides and subtract \"4\" to correct for the corner pieces, which would otherwise be counted in both the horizontal and vertical.  <br />''27 + 27 + 19 + 19 -4 = 88. These 88 border pieces include 4 corners, 17 pieces between corners on the short sides, and 25 between corners on the long sides.''\n\nCommon puzzle dimensions: \n* 1000 piece puzzle: 1026 pieces, 126 border pieces\n\n=== Largest-sized jigsaw puzzles ===\nThe world's largest-sized jigsaw puzzle measured {{convert|58435|ft2|abbr=on|order=flip}} with 21,600 pieces, each measuring a Guinness World Records maximum size of 50&nbsp;cm by 50&nbsp;cm.

In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day. At the time of construction, ''Waratah'' was not equipped with a radio, which was not unusual at the time.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=118|ps=}}\n\nThe sea trials were held on 23 October 1908 on the Firth of Clyde, during which the steamer was able to successfully maintain a mean speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}} over several runs on the measured mile.

The fire was largely brought under control by noon on the same day but continued reigniting until 10 December. The fire was apparently caused by the heat emitted by several reducing and steam valves located on the starboard side of the engine room. While the roof of the engine room was insulated, the starboard side was evidently not. The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel. He was especially concerned with the difficulty of properly loading the steamer to maintain her stability, which resulted in a heated exchange between the owners and the builders following the vessel's return to England.\n\nThe subsequent inquiry into her sinking raised some disputed reports of instability on this voyage.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77352720 |title=THE S.S.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the Chief Officer of the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThe sighting by the ''Clan MacIntyre'' was the final confirmed sighting of the ''Waratah'', there were however several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n\nThat evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

As ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, it was at first thought likely that she had been delayed by a breakdown or mechanical fault, and was still adrift. Fears only started to grow, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

It quickly came to focus on the supposed instability of the ''Waratah''.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=129|ps=}} Evidence was greatly hampered by the lack of any survivors from the ship's final voyage (other than the small number, including Claude Sawyer, who had disembarked in [[Durban]]). Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively, and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n===Paranormal===\nSeveral supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah''. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had during the voyage seen on three occasions in dreams the vision of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" He decided that this vision was a warning, and was one of the reasons why he decided not to continue the voyage on the ''Waratah'' and to get off the ship at Durban.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day. At the time of construction, ''Waratah'' was not equipped with a radio, which was not unusual at the time.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=118|ps=}}\n\nThe sea trials were held on 23 October 1908 on the Firth of Clyde, during which the steamer was able to successfully maintain a mean speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}} over several runs on the measured mile.

The fire was largely brought under control by noon on the same day but continued reigniting until 10 December. The fire was apparently caused by the heat emitted by several reducing and steam valves located on the starboard side of the engine room. While the roof of the engine room was insulated, the starboard side was evidently not. The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel. He was especially concerned with the difficulty of properly loading the steamer to maintain her stability, which resulted in a heated exchange between the owners and the builders following the vessel's return to England.\n\nThe subsequent inquiry into her sinking raised some disputed reports of instability on this voyage.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77352720 |title=THE S.S.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the Chief Officer of the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThe sighting by the ''Clan MacIntyre'' was the final confirmed sighting of the ''Waratah'', there were however several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n\nThat evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Search efforts==\n===Contemporary searches===\nInitially, the non-appearance of the ship did not cause alarm as it was not uncommon for ships to arrive at port days, or occasionally even weeks overdue. As ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, it was at first thought likely that she had been delayed by a breakdown or mechanical fault, and was still adrift. Fears only started to grow, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course, began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

Further attempts to locate the ''Waratah'' took place in 1983, 1989, 1991, 1995 and 1997.

It quickly came to focus on the supposed instability of the ''Waratah''.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=129|ps=}} Evidence was greatly hampered by the lack of any survivors from the ship's final voyage (other than the small number, including Claude Sawyer, who had disembarked in [[Durban]]). Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively, and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S. WARATAH AND HER COMMANDER. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |volume=LI |issue=15,652 |location=South Australia |date=16 December 1908 |accessdate=4 September 2018 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The ship's builders produced calculations to prove that even with a load of coal on her deck (that several witnesses claim she was carrying when she left Durban) she was not top heavy.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry was unable to make any conclusions from this mixed and contradictory evidence. It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n===Paranormal===\nSeveral supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah''. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had during the voyage seen on three occasions in dreams the vision of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" He decided that this vision was a warning, and was one of the reasons why he decided not to continue the voyage on the ''Waratah'' and to get off the ship at Durban.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.
