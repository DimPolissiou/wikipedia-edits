The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs.\" In the same ''Huffington Post'' article, it was reported that following a $7,025 payment from the campaign of [[Paul Ryan]] primary election challenger [[Paul Nehlen]], Hardaway and Richardson made a campaign video and endorsed Nehlen.<ref name=\"huffpo congress\" />\n\n=== Diamond and Silk Act of 2019 ===\nIn June 2019, House Representative [[Steve King]] joined with Diamond and Silk to introduce the Diamond and Silk Act, an anti\u2013[[sanctuary city]] bill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/448489-steve-king-unveils-diamond-and-silk-act-named-for-conservative-youtubers|title=Steve King unveils 'Diamond and Silk Act' named for conservative YouTubers|last=Frazin|first=Rachel|date=2019-06-13|website=TheHill|language=en|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-king-introduces-diamond-and-silk-act-press-conference-2019-6|title=Disgraced Rep.

Both women have stated a reduction in reactions to their posts and videos since that time period, and that followers no longer receive notifications about posts and videos.  As of April 2018, their Facebook page states they have nearly 1.3 million followers.<ref name=\"Facebookpage\" />\n\nDiamond and Silk's censorship claims were uncritically repeated in right-wing media.<ref name=\"cnn facebook\" /> According to CNN, their claims likely influenced an April 2018 congressional hearing which involved Mark Zuckerberg after the [[Cambridge Analytica]] scandal.<ref name=\"cnn facebook\" /> ''Business Insider'' noted that Diamond and Silk were a \"frequent topic\" during that hearing.<ref name=\"businessinsider congress\" /> [[Tennessee]] Republican [[Marsha Blackburn|Representative Marsha Blackburn]] finished her questioning of Zuckerberg by stating, \"Let me tell you something right now, Diamond and Silk is not terrorism\".

More precisely, it states that if ''p'' is a prime number and <math>\\textstyle f(x) \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]</math> is a polynomial with integer coefficients, then either:\n* every coefficient of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is divisible by ''p'', or\n* {{math|''f''(''x'') &equiv; 0 (mod ''p'')}} has at most {{math|deg ''f''(''x'')}} incongruent solutions\n\nwhere {{math|deg ''f''(''x'')}} is the [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}.

To prove (2), note that {{math|'''Z'''/''p''}} is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], which is a standard fact (a quick proof is to note that since {{mvar|p}} is prime, {{math|'''Z'''/''p''}} is a finite [[integral domain]], hence is a field). Another standard fact is that a non-zero polynomial over a field has at most as many roots as its degree; this follows from the [[Polynomial long division|division algorithm]].\n\nFinally, note that two solutions {{math|''f''(''k''{{sub|1}}) &equiv; ''f''(''k''{{sub|2}}) &equiv; 0 (mod ''p'')}} are incongruent if and only if <math> k_1 \\not\\equiv k_2 </math> {{math|(mod ''p'')}}.

If constructing new housing in an area at-risk for displacement accelerates that displacement, then YIMBYs are inherently opposed to the tenant organizations that have opposed them. New housing is generally very expensive; it can be used to house low-income people in two ways: [[inclusionary zoning]] mandates, where a portion of new housing is subsidized, and by filtering, where wealthier people move into the new homes, freeing up the supply of older, cheaper stock.\n\nA peer-reviewed study by Yonah Freemark published in 2019 found that an upzoning in Chicago which rezoned for denser development in a place where development was constrained by other means led to an increase in property values<ref>{{cite journal | last=Freemark | first=Yonah | title=Upzoning Chicago: Impacts of a Zoning Reform on Property Values and Housing Construction | journal=Urban Affairs Review | publisher=SAGE Publications | volume=56 | issue=3 | date=2019-01-29 | issn=1078-0874 | doi=10.1177/1078087418824672 | pages=758\u2013789 |lay-source=Does Upzoning Boost the Housing Supply and Lower Prices?

As such, raising the required BMR percentage in San Francisco in 2016 actually led to a net ''reduction'' in the number of affordable units constructed, as it became less economical to construct projects--a slightly larger percentage of a much smaller number multiplied out to a smaller result.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/yimby/the-25-inclusionary-rate-is-killing-affordable-housing-db143c4abd31 |date=2017-06-11 |access-date=2020-04-09 |title=The 25% inclusionary rate is killing affordable housing}}</ref>\n\nA peer-reviewed study published in ''[[Urban Studies (journal)|Urban Studies]]'' in 2006 said the \"filtering\" process (whereby wealthier households moving into new and desirable development results in vacancies which increases supply and lowers prices) is extremely slow and fails to provide urgently needed affordable housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1080/00420980500533612|title=Filtering, City Change and the Supply of Low-priced Housing in Canada|author=Andrejs Skaburskis|publisher = Urban Studies|date = 2006-03-01|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> \n\nEvan Mast from the [[Upjohn Institute]], in a 2019 working paper, investigated the filtering effect by tracing address history data, finding that migratory chains reach from low-income neighborhoods into new construction: \"building 100 new market-rate units leads 45-70 and 17-39 people to move out of below-median and bottom-quintile income tracts, respectively, with almost all of the effect occurring within five years\".<ref>{{cite report |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3426103 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3426103  |last=Mast |first=Evan |title=The Effect of New Market-Rate Housing Construction on the Low-Income Housing Market |date=2019-07-24 |access-date=2020-04-09 |publisher=Upjohn Institute}}</ref> Another working paper revealed in 2020 by Brian Asquith and Davin Reed, also from the Upjohn Institute, found that new buildings lower rents directly nearby compared to locations without new buildings, because the large supply effect outweighs the amenity effect.<ref>{{cite report | last=Asquith | first=Brian J. | last2=Mast | first2=Evan | last3=Reed | first3=Davin | title=Supply Shock Versus Demand Shock: The Local Effects of New Housing in Low-Income Areas | publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia | year=2020 | issn=2574-0997 | doi=10.21799/frbp.wp.2020.07}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n=== Canada ===\n\nIn [[Toronto]], Canada, a self-styled YIMBY movement was established in 2006 by community members in response to significant development proposals in the [[Queen Street West#Bathurst Street to Gladstone Avenue: West Queen Street West (the Art and Design District)|West Queen West]] area, and a YIMBY festival, launched the same year, has been held annually since.<ref name=\"AutoN1-2\"/><ref name=\"Toronto_Ziedler_interview\"/> The festival's organizer stated that \"YIMBYism is a community mindset that's open to change and development.\"<ref name=Toronto_Ziedler_interview />\n\n=== Sweden ===\n\nYimby is an independent political party network founded in Stockholm in 2007, which advocates physical development, [[densification]] and promotion of urban environment with chapters in [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], and [[Uppsala]].<ref name=\"NextCity_Sweden_YIMBY\"/>{{citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=There appear to be many references, but they are in Swedish.

If constructing new housing in an area at-risk for displacement accelerates that displacement, then YIMBYs are inherently opposed to the tenant organizations that have opposed them. New housing is generally very expensive; it can be used to house low-income people in two ways: [[inclusionary zoning]] mandates, where a portion of new housing is subsidized, and by filtering, where wealthier people move into the new homes, freeing up the supply of older, cheaper stock.\n\nA peer-reviewed study by Yonah Freemark published in 2019 found that an upzoning in Chicago which rezoned for denser development in a place where development was constrained by other means led to an increase in property values<ref>{{cite journal | last=Freemark | first=Yonah | title=Upzoning Chicago: Impacts of a Zoning Reform on Property Values and Housing Construction | journal=Urban Affairs Review | publisher=SAGE Publications | volume=56 | issue=3 | date=2019-01-29 | issn=1078-0874 | doi=10.1177/1078087418824672 | pages=758\u2013789 |lay-source=Does Upzoning Boost the Housing Supply and Lower Prices?

It was first published in paperback by [[Del Rey Books]] in November 1992.<ref>{{isfdb title|id=18956|title=The Venom Trees of Sunga}}</ref> An [[E-book]] edition was published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]'s [[SF Gateway]] imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.<ref>[http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/authors/de-camp-l.-sprague2 Orion Publishing Group's L. Sprague de Camp webpage]</ref><ref>[https://www.amazon.de/Venom-Trees-Sunga-ebook/dp/B005OAIBKM Amazon.com entry for e-book edition]</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe lead character Kirk Salazar, a second-generation Terran colonist on the planet Kukulkan, is near the end of his education to become a biologist, lacking only field research to complete his studies. Interested in the evolutionary background of the dominant native species, the intelligent reptilian Kukulkanians, he focuses on a related animal species whose habitat is the poisonous \"venom trees\" on the remote island of Sunga. To reach his destination he joins a tour group headed for the island, among whom are some family friends worried about their daughter, who has joined a band of Terran cult members there. They discover she has become the cult's leader, and Salazar finds himself caught in the crossfire of a power struggle between the cultists and a Terran logging magnate intent on clear-cutting the venom trees. He is able to save his neck and preserve the habitat of his research subjects by an unorthodox use of his findings, a spectacularly unlikely disguise, and a healthy dose of dumb luck.\n\n==Setting==\nKukulkan, a planet of the star [[Epsilon Eridani]], is inhabited by intelligent [[dinosaur]]-like creatures possessed of a civilization far older than Earth's. Due to the natives' inherent conservatism and an environment deficient in fossil fuels, its technology has not advanced beyond edged weapons and steam-driven vehicles. The Kukulkanians, or \"Kooks\" as they are known among Terrans, are honest, honor-bound, and dull in personality. Terrans have obtained land for a colony by treaty, and the colonists, consisting primarily of descendants of North American, Russian, and Chinese settlers, co-inhabit the planet in a somewhat uneasy relationship with the natives. The cultural level of the aboriginal race places the Kukulkan stories firmly within the [[Sword and Planet]] genre, though the non-humanoid inhabitants are an unusual feature.  The Kooks' rational and dispassionate observations allow the authors to present a rather arch perspective on the comparatively less stable Earthlings.\n\n==Placement in the ''Viagens'' series==\nThe status of the Kukulkan novels as part of the ''Viagens'' series is problematic on three grounds. First, the ''Viagens Interplanetarias'' is never actually mentioned in the novels. Second, these novels portray America, Russia and China as supplying most of the Terran settlers of Kukulkan, in seeming contradiction to the series' premise that these countries have been eclipsed by Brazil in the ''Viagens'' future; no Brazilians appear in the novels. Third, the name of the planet Kukulkan violates the nomenclature previously established for the planetary system of Epsilon Eridani in the introduction and [[The Continent Makers|title story]] of ''[[The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens]]'', according to which the planets take their names from [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods like [[Thor]], not [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n gods like [[Kukulkan]].

Sprague de Camp]], the twelfth book in his ''[[Viagens Interplanetarias]]'' series and the second in its [[Viagens Interplanetarias#The Kukulkan novels|subseries]] of stories set on the fictional planet Kukulkan. It was first published in paperback by [[Del Rey Books]] in November 1992.<ref>{{isfdb title|id=18956|title=The Venom Trees of Sunga}}</ref> An [[E-book]] edition was published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]'s [[SF Gateway]] imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.<ref>[http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/authors/de-camp-l.-sprague2 Orion Publishing Group's L. Sprague de Camp webpage]</ref><ref>[https://www.amazon.de/Venom-Trees-Sunga-ebook/dp/B005OAIBKM Amazon.com entry for e-book edition]</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe lead character Kirk Salazar, a second-generation Terran colonist on the planet Kukulkan, is near the end of his education to become a biologist, lacking only field research to complete his studies. Interested in the evolutionary background of the dominant native species, the intelligent reptilian Kukulkanians, he focuses on a related animal species whose habitat is the poisonous \"venom trees\" on the remote island of Sunga. To reach his destination he joins a tour group headed for the island, among whom are some family friends worried about their daughter, who has joined a band of Terran cult members there. They discover she has become the cult's leader, and Salazar finds himself caught in the crossfire of a power struggle between the cultists and a Terran logging magnate intent on clear-cutting the venom trees. He is able to save his neck and preserve the habitat of his research subjects by an unorthodox use of his findings, a spectacularly unlikely disguise, and a healthy dose of dumb luck.\n\n==Setting==\nKukulkan, a planet of the star [[Epsilon Eridani]], is inhabited by intelligent [[dinosaur]]-like creatures possessed of a civilization far older than Earth's. Due to the natives' inherent conservatism and an environment deficient in fossil fuels, its technology has not advanced beyond edged weapons and steam-driven vehicles. The Kukulkanians, or \"Kooks\" as they are known among Terrans, are honest, honor-bound, and dull in personality. Terrans have obtained land for a colony by treaty, and the colonists, consisting primarily of descendants of North American, Russian, and Chinese settlers, co-inhabit the planet in a somewhat uneasy relationship with the natives. The cultural level of the aboriginal race places the Kukulkan stories firmly within the [[Sword and Planet]] genre, though the non-humanoid inhabitants are an unusual feature.  The Kooks' rational and dispassionate observations allow the authors to present a rather arch perspective on the comparatively less stable Earthlings.\n\n==Placement in the ''Viagens'' series==\nThe status of the Kukulkan novels as part of the ''Viagens'' series is problematic on three grounds. First, the ''Viagens Interplanetarias'' is never actually mentioned in the novels. Second, these novels portray America, Russia and China as supplying most of the Terran settlers of Kukulkan, in seeming contradiction to the series' premise that these countries have been eclipsed by Brazil in the ''Viagens'' future; no Brazilians appear in the novels. Third, the name of the planet Kukulkan violates the nomenclature previously established for the planetary system of Epsilon Eridani in the introduction and [[The Continent Makers|title story]] of ''[[The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens]]'', according to which the planets take their names from [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods like [[Thor]], not [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n gods like [[Kukulkan]]. The first two issues are explicable. Since the novels' activities take place entirely on-planet and Kukulkan's well-established settlements are not dependent on extra-system support, there is no need for the ''Viagens'' to play a role. The ethnic make-up of the settlements presumably results from the well-known tendency of depressed economies rather than prosperous ones to supply emigrants.

Obeying the usual rules about not stealing, cheating, hurting, and killing is not enough, or at least not enough for those of us who have the great good fortune to live in material comfort, who can feed, house, and clothe ourselves and our families and still have money or time to spare.

The city has been a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Messina-Lipari-Santa Lucia del Mela|Archdiocese and Archimandrite]] seat since 1548 and is home to a locally important international fair. The city has the [[University of Messina]], founded in 1548 by [[Ignatius of Loyola]].\n\nMessina has a light rail system, [[Trams in Messina|''Tranvia di Messina'']], opened on 3 April 2003. This line is {{convert|7.7|km}} and links the city's central railway station with the city centre and harbour.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Messina}}\n[[File:Augustale.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] age coins.]][[File:Gloeden, Wilhelm von (1856-1931) - Terremoto di Messina, 1908.jpg|thumb|left|An image of the [[1908 Messina earthquake]] aftermath.]][[File:La nuova cortina del porto di Messina 1 (Luigi Borz\u00ec).jpg|thumb|left|Unexecuted [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] plan for the reconstruction of the port, 1909.]]\n\nFounded by [[Greece|Greek]] colonists in the 8th century BC, Messina was originally called '''Zancle''' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u0396\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7}}), from the Greek {{lang|grc|\u03b6\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}} meaning \"[[scythe]]\" because of the shape of its natural harbour (though a legend attributes the name to King [[Zanclus]]). A ''[[comune]]'' of its Metropolitan City, located at the southern entrance of the [[Strait of Messina]], is to this day called 'Scaletta Zanclea'. [[Solinus]] write that the city of [[Metauros]] was established by people from the Zancle.<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/747#8.7 Solinus, Polyhistor, 2.10]</ref>  \n\nIn the early 5th century BC, [[Anaxilas of Rhegium]] renamed it '''Messene''' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7}}) in honour of the Greek city [[Messene]] (See also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). Later, [[Micythus]] was the ruler of [[Rhegium]] and Zancle, and he also founded the city of [[Pyxus]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc3:11.59 Diodorus Siculus, Library, \u00a7 11.59.1]</ref>\nThe city was [[Battle of Messene|sacked in 397 BC]] by the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and then reconquered by [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]].\n[[File:Beaches,Messina.JPG|thumb|a tract of around 30 kilometres of [[beaches]] of Messina]]\n[[File:Feluca in the strait of Messina.JPG|thumb|the  ''Feluca'', a typical boat used by the fishermen of Messina to hunt [[swordfish]] ]]\n\nIn 288 BC the [[Mamertines]] seized the city by treachery, killing all the men and taking the women as their wives. The city became a base from which they ravaged the countryside, leading to a conflict with the expanding regional empire of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. [[Hiero II]], tyrant of Syracuse, defeated the Mamertines near [[Mylae]] on the [[Longanus River]] and besieged Messina. [[Carthage]] assisted the Mamertines because of a [[Sicilian Wars|long-standing conflict]] with Syracuse over dominance in Sicily. When Hiero attacked a second time in 264 BC, the Mamertines petitioned the [[Roman Republic]] for an alliance, hoping for more reliable protection. Although initially reluctant to assist lest it encourage other mercenary groups to mutiny, Rome was unwilling to see Carthaginian power spread further over Sicily and encroach on Italy. Rome therefore entered into an alliance with the Mamertines. In 264 BC, Roman troops were deployed to Sicily, the first time a Roman army acted outside the [[Italian Peninsula]]. At the end of the [[First Punic War]] it was a free city allied with Rome. In Roman times Messina, then known as '''Messana''', had an important [[History of lighthouses|pharos]] (lighthouse). Messana was the base of [[Sextus Pompeius]], during his war against [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian]].\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the city was successively ruled by [[Goths]] from 476, then by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 535, by the [[Arabs]] in 842, and in 1061 by the [[Normans|Norman]] brothers [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger Guiscard]] (later count Roger I of Sicily). In 1189 the English King [[Richard I of England|Richard I (''\"The Lionheart\"'')]] stopped at Messina en route to the [[Holy Land]] for the [[Third Crusade]] and briefly occupied the city after a dispute over the dowry of his sister, who had been married to [[William the Good, King of Sicily]]. In 1345 [[Orlando d'Aragona]], illegitimate son of [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick II of Sicily]] was the ''[[strategos]]'' of Messina.\n\nIn 1347, Messina was one of the first points of entry for the [[black death]] into Western Europe. [[Genoa|Genoese]] galleys traveling from the infected city of [[Feodosia|Kaffa]] carried plague into the Messina ports. Kaffa had been infected via Asian trade routes and siege from infected [[Mongol]] armies led by [[Janibeg]]; it was a departure point for many Italian merchants who fled the city to Sicily. Contemporary accounts from Messina tell of the arrival of \"Death Ships\" from the East, which floated to shore with all the passengers on board already dead or dying of plague. Plague-infected rats probably also came aboard these ships. The black death ravaged Messina, and rapidly spread northward into mainland Italy from Sicily in the following few months.\n\nIn 1548 [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]] founded there the first [[Jesuit]] college in the world, which later gave birth to the ''Studium Generale'' (the current [[University of Messina]]). {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Christian ships that won the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]] left from Messina: the [[Spain|Spanish]] author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who took part in the battle, recovered for some time in the ''Grand Hospital''. The city reached the peak of its splendour in the early 17th century, under Spanish domination: at the time it was one of the ten greatest cities in Europe. \n\nIn 1674 the city [[Messina revolt|rebelled against the foreign garrison]]. It managed to remain independent for some time, thanks to the help of the French king [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], but in 1678, with the [[Peace of Nijmegen]], it was reconquered by the Spaniards and sacked: the university, the senate and all the privileges of autonomy it had enjoyed since the Roman times were abolished. A [[Real Cittadella|massive fortress]] was built by the occupants and Messina decayed steadily. In 1743, 48,000 died of a second wave of [[plague (disease)|plague]] in the city.<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2630035 \"Epidemiology of the Black Death and Successive Waves of Plague\"] by Samuel K Cohn JR. ''Medical History''.</ref>\n\nIn 1783, an [[1783 Calabrian earthquakes|earthquake]] devastated much of the city, and it took decades to rebuild and rekindle the cultural life of Messina. In 1847 it was one of the first cities in Italy where [[Risorgimento]] riots broke out. In 1848 it rebelled openly against the reigning [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], but was heavily suppressed again. Only in 1860, after the [[Battle of Milazzo (1860)|Battle of Milazzo]], the [[Garibaldi]]ne troops occupied the city. One of the main figures of the [[unification of Italy]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], was elected [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] at Messina in the general elections of 1866. Another earthquake of less intensity damaged the city on 16 November 1894. The city was almost entirely destroyed by [[1908 Messina earthquake|an earthquake]] and associated [[tsunami]] on the morning of 28 December 1908, killing about 100,000 people and destroying most of the ancient architecture. The city was largely rebuilt in the following year. \n\n{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}\nIt incurred further damage from the massive Allied air bombardments of 1943; before and during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] Messina, owing to its strategic importance as a transit point for Axis troops and supplies sent to Sicily from mainland Italy, was a prime target for the British and American air forces, which dropped some 6,500 tons of bombs in the span of a few months.<ref>[http://www.societaitalianastoriamilitare.org/COLLANA%20SISM/2014%20DONATO%20La%20Piazza%20di%20Messina%201939-1943.pdf La Piazza Marittima di Messina (1939-1943)]</ref> These raids destroyed one third of the city, and caused 854 deaths among the population.<ref>[https://www.tempostretto.it/news/proposta-proposta-istituzione-giornata-memoria-854-messinesi-morti-sotto-bombardamenti-43.html Proposta l\u2019istituzione di una \u201cgiornata della memoria\u201d degli 854 messinesi morti sotto i bombardamenti del \u201843]</ref> The city was awarded a [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] and one for Civil Valor by the Italian government in memory of the event and the subsequent effort of reconstruction.<ref>[https://www.quirinale.it/onorificenze/insigniti/18388 Presidenza della Repubblica]</ref>\n\nIn June 1955, Messina was the location of the [[Messina Conference]] of [[Western Europe]]an [[foreign minister]]s which led to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eu-history.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=10&c=52|title='&#39;The Messina Declaration 1955'&#39; final document of '&#39;The Conference of Messina'&#39; 1 to 3 June 1955 \u2013 birth of the European Union|publisher=Eu-history.leidenuniv.nl|accessdate=5 April 2011}}</ref> The conference was held mainly in Messina's [[Palazzo Zanca|City Hall building]] ([[:it:Palazzo Zanca|it]]), and partly in nearby [[Taormina]]. \n\nThe city is home to a small [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] minority, which arrived from the [[Peloponnese]] between 1533-34 when fleeing from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The building had to be almost entirely rebuilt in 1919\u201320, following the devastating [[1908 Messina earthquake|1908 earthquake]], and again in 1943, after a fire triggered by Allied bombings. The original [[Norman architecture|Norman]] structure can be recognised in the apsidal area. The fa\u00e7ade has three late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] portals, the central of which probably dates back to the early 15th century. The architrave is decorated with a sculpture of ''Christ Among the Evangelists'' and various representations of men, animals and plants. The [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] dates back to 1468. The interior is organised in a nave and two equally long aisles divided by files of 28 columns. Some decorative elements belong the original building, although the mosaics in the [[apse]] are reconstructions. Tombs of illustrious men besides Conrad IV include those of Archbishops Palmer (died in 1195), Guidotto de Abbiate (14th century) and Antonio La Legname (16th century). Special interest is held by the Chapel of the Sacrament (late 16th century), with scenic decorations and 14th century mosaics. The [[bell tower]] holds the [[Messina astronomical clock]], one of the largest astronomical clocks in the world, built in 1933 by the Ungerer Company of [[Strasbourg]]. The belfry's mechanically-animated statues, which illustrate events from the civil and religious history of the city every day at noon, are a popular tourist attraction.\n* The Sanctuary of Santa Maria del Carmelo (near the Courthouse), built in 1931, which contains a 17th-century statue of the Virgin Mary.

Dating from the late Norman period, it was transformed in the 13th century when the nave was shortened and the fa\u00e7ade added. It has a cylindrical apse and a high dome emerging from a high [[tambour]]. Noteworthy is the external decoration of the [[transept]] and the dome area, with a series of blind arches separated by small columns, clearly reflecting Arabic architectural influences.\n* The Church of Santa Maria degli Alemanni (early 13th century), which was formerly a chapel of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. It is a rare example of pure Gothic architecture in Sicily, as is witnessed by the arched windows and shapely [[buttress]]es.\n[[File:Giganti di Messina (Mata e Grifone) - Messina (Sicily) - Italy - 15 Aug. 2009 - (3).jpg|thumb|The [[giant]]s Mata and Grifone, whose stories are told about the city, are brought around Messina during the second week of August]]\n[[File:Madonna della Lettera - Messina - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The Madonna della Lettera that dominates the port of Messina is the  Patron Saint of the city, celebrated on the 3rd of June]]\n\n===Civil and military architecture===\n* The 'Botanical Garden [[Pietro Castelli]] of the [[University of Messina]].\n* The Palazzo Calapaj, an example of 18th-century Messinese architecture which survived until the 1908 earthquake.\n* The [[Forte del Santissimo Salvatore]], a 16th-century fort in the [[Port of Messina]].\n* The [[Forte Gonzaga]], a 16th-century fort overlooking Messina.\n* The Porta Grazia, 17th-century gate of the \"[[Real Cittadella]] di Messina\", by Domenico Biundo and Antonio Amato, a fortress still existing in the harbour.\n* The [[Pylons of Messina|Pylon]], built in 1957 together with a twin located across the Strait of Messina, to carry a 220 kV [[overhead power line]] bringing electric power to the island.

A ''[[comune]]'' of its Metropolitan City, located at the southern entrance of the [[Strait of Messina]], is to this day called 'Scaletta Zanclea'. [[Solinus]] write that the city of [[Metauros]] was established by people from the Zancle.<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/747#8.7 Solinus, Polyhistor, 2.10]</ref>  \n\nIn the early 5th century BC, [[Anaxilas of Rhegium]] renamed it '''Messene''' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7}}) in honour of the Greek city [[Messene]] (See also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). Later, [[Micythus]] was the ruler of [[Rhegium]] and Zancle, and he also founded the city of [[Pyxus]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc3:11.59 Diodorus Siculus, Library, \u00a7 11.59.1]</ref>\nThe city was [[Battle of Messene|sacked in 397 BC]] by the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and then reconquered by [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]].\n[[File:Beaches,Messina.JPG|thumb|a tract of around 30 kilometres of [[beaches]] of Messina]]\n[[File:Feluca in the strait of Messina.JPG|thumb|the  ''Feluca'', a typical boat used by the fishermen of Messina to hunt [[swordfish]] ]]\n\nIn 288 BC the [[Mamertines]] seized the city by treachery, killing all the men and taking the women as their wives. The city became a base from which they ravaged the countryside, leading to a conflict with the expanding regional empire of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. [[Hiero II]], tyrant of Syracuse, defeated the Mamertines near [[Mylae]] on the [[Longanus River]] and besieged Messina. [[Carthage]] assisted the Mamertines because of a [[Sicilian Wars|long-standing conflict]] with Syracuse over dominance in Sicily. When Hiero attacked a second time in 264 BC, the Mamertines petitioned the [[Roman Republic]] for an alliance, hoping for more reliable protection. Although initially reluctant to assist lest it encourage other mercenary groups to mutiny, Rome was unwilling to see Carthaginian power spread further over Sicily and encroach on Italy. Rome therefore entered into an alliance with the Mamertines. In 264 BC, Roman troops were deployed to Sicily, the first time a Roman army acted outside the [[Italian Peninsula]]. At the end of the [[First Punic War]] it was a free city allied with Rome. In Roman times Messina, then known as '''Messana''', had an important [[History of lighthouses|pharos]] (lighthouse). Messana was the base of [[Sextus Pompeius]], during his war against [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian]].\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the city was successively ruled by [[Goths]] from 476, then by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 535, by the [[Arabs]] in 842, and in 1061 by the [[Normans|Norman]] brothers [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger Guiscard]] (later count Roger I of Sicily). In 1189 the English King [[Richard I of England|Richard I (''\"The Lionheart\"'')]] stopped at Messina en route to the [[Holy Land]] for the [[Third Crusade]] and briefly occupied the city after a dispute over the dowry of his sister, who had been married to [[William the Good, King of Sicily]]. In 1345 [[Orlando d'Aragona]], illegitimate son of [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick II of Sicily]] was the ''[[strategos]]'' of Messina.\n\nIn 1347, Messina was one of the first points of entry for the [[black death]] into Western Europe. [[Genoese]] galleys traveling from the infected city of [[Feodosia|Kaffa]] carried plague into the Messina ports. Kaffa had been infected via Asian trade routes and siege from infected [[Mongol]] armies led by [[Janibeg]]; it was a departure point for many Italian merchants who fled the city to Sicily. Contemporary accounts from Messina tell of the arrival of \"Death Ships\" from the East, which floated to shore with all the passengers on board already dead or dying of plague. Plague-infected rats probably also came aboard these ships. The black death ravaged Messina, and rapidly spread northward into mainland Italy from Sicily in the following few months.\n\nIn 1548 [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]] founded there the first [[Jesuit]] college in the world, which later gave birth to the ''Studium Generale'' (the current [[University of Messina]]). {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Christian ships that won the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]] left from Messina: the [[Spain|Spanish]] author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who took part in the battle, recovered for some time in the ''Grand Hospital''. The city reached the peak of its splendour in the early 17th century, under Spanish domination: at the time it was one of the ten greatest cities in Europe. \n\nIn 1674 the city [[Messina revolt|rebelled against the foreign garrison]]. It managed to remain independent for some time, thanks to the help of the French king [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], but in 1678, with the [[Peace of Nijmegen]], it was reconquered by the Spaniards and sacked: the university, the senate and all the privileges of autonomy it had enjoyed since the Roman times were abolished. A [[Real Cittadella|massive fortress]] was built by the occupants and Messina decayed steadily. In 1743, 48,000 died of a second wave of [[plague (disease)|plague]] in the city.<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2630035 \"Epidemiology of the Black Death and Successive Waves of Plague\"] by Samuel K Cohn JR. ''Medical History''.</ref>\n\nIn 1783, an [[1783 Calabrian earthquakes|earthquake]] devastated much of the city, and it took decades to rebuild and rekindle the cultural life of Messina. In 1847 it was one of the first cities in Italy where [[Risorgimento]] riots broke out. In 1848 it rebelled openly against the reigning [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], but was heavily suppressed again. Only in 1860, after the [[Battle of Milazzo (1860)|Battle of Milazzo]], the [[Garibaldi]]ne troops occupied the city. One of the main figures of the [[unification of Italy]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], was elected [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] at Messina in the general elections of 1866. Another earthquake of less intensity damaged the city on 16 November 1894. The city was almost entirely destroyed by [[1908 Messina earthquake|an earthquake]] and associated [[tsunami]] on the morning of 28 December 1908, killing about 100,000 people and destroying most of the ancient architecture. The city was largely rebuilt in the following year. \n\n{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}\nIt incurred further damage from the massive Allied air bombardments of 1943; before and during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] Messina, owing to its strategic importance as a transit point for Axis troops and supplies sent to Sicily from mainland Italy, was a prime target for the British and American air forces, which dropped some 6,500 tons of bombs in the span of a few months.<ref>[http://www.societaitalianastoriamilitare.org/COLLANA%20SISM/2014%20DONATO%20La%20Piazza%20di%20Messina%201939-1943.pdf La Piazza Marittima di Messina (1939-1943)]</ref> These raids destroyed one third of the city, and caused 854 deaths among the population.<ref>[https://www.tempostretto.it/news/proposta-proposta-istituzione-giornata-memoria-854-messinesi-morti-sotto-bombardamenti-43.html Proposta l\u2019istituzione di una \u201cgiornata della memoria\u201d degli 854 messinesi morti sotto i bombardamenti del \u201843]</ref> The city was awarded a [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] and one for Civil Valor by the Italian government in memory of the event and the subsequent effort of reconstruction.<ref>[https://www.quirinale.it/onorificenze/insigniti/18388 Presidenza della Repubblica]</ref>\n\nIn June 1955, Messina was the location of the [[Messina Conference]] of [[Western Europe]]an [[foreign minister]]s which led to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eu-history.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=10&c=52|title='&#39;The Messina Declaration 1955'&#39; final document of '&#39;The Conference of Messina'&#39; 1 to 3 June 1955 \u2013 birth of the European Union|publisher=Eu-history.leidenuniv.nl|accessdate=5 April 2011}}</ref> The conference was held mainly in Messina's [[Palazzo Zanca|City Hall building]] ([[:it:Palazzo Zanca|it]]), and partly in nearby [[Taormina]]. \n\nThe city is home to a small [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] minority, which arrived from the [[Peloponnese]] between 1533-34 when fleeing from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The building had to be almost entirely rebuilt in 1919\u201320, following the devastating [[1908 Messina earthquake|1908 earthquake]], and again in 1943, after a fire triggered by Allied bombings. The original [[Norman architecture|Norman]] structure can be recognised in the apsidal area. The fa\u00e7ade has three late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] portals, the central of which probably dates back to the early 15th century. The architrave is decorated with a sculpture of ''Christ Among the Evangelists'' and various representations of men, animals and plants. The [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] dates back to 1468. The interior is organised in a nave and two equally long aisles divided by files of 28 columns. Some decorative elements belong the original building, although the mosaics in the [[apse]] are reconstructions. Tombs of illustrious men besides Conrad IV include those of Archbishops Palmer (died in 1195), Guidotto de Abbiate (14th century) and Antonio La Legname (16th century). Special interest is held by the Chapel of the Sacrament (late 16th century), with scenic decorations and 14th century mosaics. The [[bell tower]] holds the [[Messina astronomical clock]], one of the largest astronomical clocks in the world, built in 1933 by the Ungerer Company of [[Strasbourg]]. The belfry's mechanically-animated statues, which illustrate events from the civil and religious history of the city every day at noon, are a popular tourist attraction.\n* The Sanctuary of Santa Maria del Carmelo (near the Courthouse), built in 1931, which contains a 17th-century statue of the Virgin Mary. See also [[Chiesa del Carmine (Messina)|Chiesa del Carmine]].\n* The Sanctuary of Montevergine, where the [[incorruptibility|incorrupt]] body of [[Saint]] [[Eustochia Smeralda Calafato]] is preserved.\n* The [[Church of the Santissima Annunziata dei Catalani]] (late 12th\u201313th century). Dating from the late Norman period, it was transformed in the 13th century when the nave was shortened and the fa\u00e7ade added. It has a cylindrical apse and a high dome emerging from a high [[tambour]]. Noteworthy is the external decoration of the [[transept]] and the dome area, with a series of blind arches separated by small columns, clearly reflecting Arabic architectural influences.\n* The Church of Santa Maria degli Alemanni (early 13th century), which was formerly a chapel of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. It is a rare example of pure Gothic architecture in Sicily, as is witnessed by the arched windows and shapely [[buttress]]es.\n[[File:Giganti di Messina (Mata e Grifone) - Messina (Sicily) - Italy - 15 Aug. 2009 - (3).jpg|thumb|The [[giant]]s Mata and Grifone, whose stories are told about the city, are brought around Messina during the second week of August]]\n[[File:Madonna della Lettera - Messina - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The Madonna della Lettera that dominates the port of Messina is the  Patron Saint of the city, celebrated on the 3rd of June]]\n\n===Civil and military architecture===\n* The 'Botanical Garden [[Pietro Castelli]] of the [[University of Messina]].\n* The Palazzo Calapaj, an example of 18th-century Messinese architecture which survived until the 1908 earthquake.\n* The [[Forte del Santissimo Salvatore]], a 16th-century fort in the [[Port of Messina]].\n* The [[Forte Gonzaga]], a 16th-century fort overlooking Messina.\n* The Porta Grazia, 17th-century gate of the \"[[Real Cittadella]] di Messina\", by Domenico Biundo and Antonio Amato, a fortress still existing in the harbour.\n* The [[Pylons of Messina|Pylon]], built in 1957 together with a twin located across the Strait of Messina, to carry a 220 kV [[overhead power line]] bringing electric power to the island.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Shorey and Gordon H. Blackader, for whom the [[McGill School of Architecture#Blackader-Lauterman Library of Art and Architecture|Blackader-Lauterman Library]] is named.

After the [[World War Two|war]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment. This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a former Victorian residential building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nAround this time, Professor Frederic Lasserre of McGill's School of Architecture left the university to establish a new School of Architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sala.ubc.ca/about/history|title=History|publisher=University of British Columbia School of Architecture + Landscape Architecture|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and invited McGill Architecture graduates [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]], [[Peter Oberlander]] and [[Arthur Erickson]] to teach at his new school.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nIn 1946, [[Harold Spence-Sales]] was appointed Associate Professor of Design.
