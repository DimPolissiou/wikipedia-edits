Changes in river height from dam releases may also affect the pre-break-up. During the ''break-up'', the ice in areas of rapids is carried downstream as an [[ice floe]] and may jam on still frozen sections of ice on calm water or against structures in the river such as the [[Honeymoon Bridge (Ontario)|Honeymoon Bridge]], destroyed in 1938 by an ice jam. Smaller jams may dislodge, flow downstream and form a larger jam. During the ''final drive'', a large jam will dislodge and take out the remaining jams, clearing the river of ice in a matter of hours. Ice jams usually occur in spring, but they can happen as winter sets in when the downstream part becomes frozen first. Freeze-up jams may be larger because the ice is stronger and temperatures are continuing to cool unlike a spring break-up when the environment is warming, but are less likely to suddenly release water.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UBuQw8jUzIC|title=Ice Jam Flooding and Mitigation: Lower Platte River Basin, Nebraska|last=White|first=Kathleen D.|last2=Kay|first2=Roger L.|last3=(U.S.)|first3=Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory|date=1996|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-1388-2}}</ref>\n\nThree types of natural ice jams can occur:<ref name=\":2\" />\n# a ''surface jam'', a single layer of ice in a floe on calm water;\n# a ''narrow-channel'' or ''wide-channel jam''; and\n# a ''hanging jam'', the accumulation of river ice at slow current areas which only occur during freeze-up.\n\nIce jams also occur at sharp bends in the river, at man-made objects such as bridge piers, and at [[confluence]]s.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Occurrences and consequences==\nIn the [[northern hemisphere]], northerly flowing rivers tend to have more ice jams because the upper, more southerly reaches thaw first and the ice gets carried downstream into the still-frozen northerly part. There are three physical hazards of ice jams. The ice floe can form a dam that floods the areas upstream of the jam.  This occurred during the [[2009 Red River Flood]] and the [[2009 Alaska floods]]. As the ice jam breaks apart, a sudden surge of water breaking through can then flood areas downstream of the jam. Such a surge occurred on the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]] in 1848, when flow over [[Niagara Falls]] was substantially cut off by an ice jam, which then sent a surge of water downstream when the jam broke open.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/0330niagara-falls-stops/|title=March 30, 1848: Niagara Falls Runs Dry|last=Alfred|first=Randy|date=2010-03-30|work=Wired|access-date=2019-11-25|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> The third hazard is that the ice buildup and final drive may damage structures in or near the river<ref name=\"Brit\">{{Britannica|281150|ice jam}}</ref> and boats in the river.\n\nIce jams may scour the river bed, causing damage or benefit to wildlife habitats and possibly damage to structures in the river.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Prediction and mitigation==\n[[File:CRREL Ice Engineering Facility model of Cazenovia Creek ice jam control structure.jpg|thumb|Model of a structure built to retain river ice upstream of a site on [[Cazenovia Creek]] that was the cause of ice jams during river thaws.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|url=http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/portals/55/siteimages/121108-A-HB029-011.jpg|title=Cazenovia Creek Ice-Control Structure|last=Lever|first=James H.|last2=Gooch|first2=Gordon|date=August 2000|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers|last3=Daly|first3=Steven| journal =CRREL/ERDC Technical Report TR | volume =00 | issue =14}}</ref>]]\nEarly warnings of an ice jam include using trained observers to monitor break-up conditions and ice motion detectors.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe prevention of ice jams may be accomplished by\n# weakening the ice before the break-up by cutting or drilling holes in the ice;\n# weakening the ice by dusting it with a dark colored sand; or\n# controlling the timing of the break-up using [[ice breaker]]s, towboats, hovercraft, or amphibious excavators.

Defined by the International Association of Hydraulic Research (IAHR) Working Group on River Ice Hydraulics an ice jam is a \"stationary accumulation of fragmented ice or [[Frazil ice|frazil]] that restricts flow\" on a river or stream. The jam may effectively create a dam with an accumulation of [[anchor ice]] on the bottom of the river.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k-NGKtJX4JoC|title=River Ice Jams|last=Beltaos|first=S.|date=1995|publisher=Water Resources Publication|year=|isbn=978-0-918334-87-9|location=Highlands Ranch, Colorado}}</ref>  On rivers the obstruction may be a change of width, structure, bend or decrease in gradient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/media/dmx/Hydro/DMX_InfoSht_IceJamsAndFlooding.pdf|title=Ice Jams & Flooding|last=Editor|website=National Weather Service}}</ref> \n\nIce jam floods are less predictable and potentially more destructive than open-water flooding and can produce much deeper and faster flooding. Ice jam floods also may occur during freezing weather, and may leave large pieces of ice behind, but they are much more localized than open-water floods. Ice jams also damage an economy by causing river-side industrial facilities such as [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] generating stations to shut down and to interfere with [[ship transport]]. The United States averages 125 million dollars in losses to ice jams per year.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/floodsafety/ice_jam.shtml |title=Ice Jams |publisher=Nws.noaa.gov |date=2013-03-13 |accessdate=2014-01-11}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a473/2272511/|title=Ice Dams: Taming An Icy River|last=Staff writer|date=2006-02-07|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Mechanisms==\n[[File:Kry2.jpg|thumb|Ice floes/cakes left over on a river bank after an ice jam]]\nIce jams on rivers usually occur in the springtime as the river ice begins to ''break up'', but may also occur in early winter during ''freeze-up''.

Changes in river height from dam releases may also affect the pre-break-up. During the ''break-up'', the ice in areas of rapids is carried downstream as an [[ice floe]] and may jam on still frozen sections of ice on calm water or against structures in the river such as the [[Honeymoon Bridge (Ontario)|Honeymoon Bridge]], destroyed in 1938 by an ice jam. Smaller jams may dislodge, flow downstream and form a larger jam. During the ''final drive'', a large jam will dislodge and take out the remaining jams, clearing the river of ice in a matter of hours. Ice jams usually occur in spring, but they can happen as winter sets in when the downstream part becomes frozen first. Freeze-up jams may be larger because the ice is stronger and temperatures are continuing to cool unlike a spring break-up when the environment is warming, but are less likely to suddenly release water.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7UBuQw8jUzIC|title=Ice Jam Flooding and Mitigation: Lower Platte River Basin, Nebraska|last=White|first=Kathleen D.|last2=Kay|first2=Roger L.|last3=(U.S.)|first3=Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory|date=1996|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-1388-2}}</ref>\n\nThree types of natural ice jams can occur:<ref name=\":2\" />\n# a ''surface jam'', a single layer of ice in a floe on calm water;\n# a ''narrow-channel'' or ''wide-channel jam''; and\n# a ''hanging jam'', the accumulation of river ice at slow current areas which only occur during freeze-up.\n\nIce jams also occur at sharp bends in the river, at man-made objects such as bridge piers, and at [[confluence]]s.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Occurrences and consequences==\nIn the [[northern hemisphere]], northerly flowing rivers tend to have more ice jams because the upper, more southerly reaches thaw first and the ice gets carried downstream into the still-frozen northerly part. There are three physical hazards of ice jams. The ice floe can form a dam that floods the areas upstream of the jam.  This occurred during the [[2009 Red River Flood]] and the [[2009 Alaska floods]]. As the ice jam breaks apart, a sudden surge of water breaking through can then flood areas downstream of the jam. Such a surge occurred on the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]] in 1848, when flow over [[Niagara Falls]] was substantially cut off by an ice jam, which then sent a surge of water downstream when the jam broke open.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/03/0330niagara-falls-stops/|title=March 30, 1848: Niagara Falls Runs Dry|last=Alfred|first=Randy|date=2010-03-30|work=Wired|access-date=2019-11-25|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> The third hazard is that the ice buildup and final drive may damage structures in or near the river<ref name=\"Brit\">{{Britannica|281150|ice jam}}</ref> and boats in the river.\n\nIce jams may scour the river bed, causing damage or benefit to wildlife habitats and possibly damage to structures in the river.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Prediction and mitigation==\n[[File:CRREL Ice Engineering Facility model of Cazenovia Creek ice jam control structure.jpg|thumb|Model of a structure built to retain river ice upstream of a site on [[Cazenovia Creek]] that was the cause of ice jams during river thaws.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|url=http://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/portals/55/siteimages/121108-A-HB029-011.jpg|title=Cazenovia Creek Ice-Control Structure|last=Lever|first=James H.|last2=Gooch|first2=Gordon|date=August 2000|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers|last3=Daly|first3=Steven| journal =CRREL/ERDC Technical Report TR | volume =00 | issue =14}}</ref>]]\nEarly warnings of an ice jam include using trained observers to monitor break-up conditions and ice motion detectors.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe prevention of ice jams may be accomplished by\n# weakening the ice before the break-up by cutting or drilling holes in the ice;\n# weakening the ice by dusting it with a dark colored sand; or\n# controlling the timing of the break-up using [[ice breaker]]s, towboats, hovercraft, or amphibious excavators.
