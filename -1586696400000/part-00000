He later achieved a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology, and he practised as a psychometrist. Li Preti is founder and president of the Family and Individual Psychoneurological Assessment Centre.\n\n==North York city councillor==\nLi Preti was appointed to fill a vacancy on [[North York]] City Council in 1985 when former alderman [[Claudio Polsinelli]] ran for a seat in the provincial legislature. Representing the troubled [[Jane and Finch]], he campaigned for development in the area, including extending the [[Yonge\u2013University\u2013Spadina line|Spadina subway]].  He also argued that the media was biased against the region, and attempted to set up a fund that would sue for libel any media outlet that spoke negatively of the area.\n\n==Federal politics==\nPrior to the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 federal election]], Li Preti had sought the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] nomination in the [[York Centre]] riding.  However, Liberal leader [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] directly appointed [[Art Eggleton]] to run in the seat.  Besides Li Preti and his supporters, the appointment was criticized by several high profile Toronto Liberals including [[Joe Volpe]], [[Dennis Mills]], and [[John Nunziata]].  Allegations of racism against [[Italian-Canadian]]s were also levelled. After battling Chr\u00e9tien in the media and in the courts, Li Preti eventually chose to run as an independent, branding himself an \"independent Liberal\" using the Liberal colour red, and promising voters he would ask to join the Liberal caucus in [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] if elected. Li Preti came under some criticism for potentially misleading some voters as to his affiliation with the party. Unlike the [[pro-choice]] Eggleton, he took an [[anti-abortion]] position. He emphasized his support for industrial development in many of the [[Downsview Park|CFB Downsview lands]] in the riding that were being decommissioned. Li Preti came in a distant second polling 3,918 votes to Eggleton's 27, 150.\n\n==Toronto city councillor==\nIn 1997 when North York was merged with Toronto and the other parts of Metro to form the new \"megacity\", he was elected to the new [[Toronto City Council]] in [[1997 Toronto municipal election|the 1997]] He was also elected in [[2000 Toronto municipal election|2000]] and [[2003 Toronto municipal election|2003 elections]].\n\nIn the [[2006 Toronto municipal election|2006 municipal election]] he sought re-election against former North York colleague [[Anthony Perruzza]]. Several incidents occurred during advanced polling on the weekend of November 4\u20135, 2006, leading to Li Preti and Perruzza accusing each other of dirty campaigning and the breaking of numerous [[election law|election]]s.

{"title_page": "Rob Davis (politician)", "text_new": "{{short description|Canadian politician|bot=PearBOT 5}}\n'''Rob Davis''' (born ca. 1964) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician. He served on the [[York, Toronto|York]] city council from 1991 to 1997, and was a member of the [[Toronto City Council]] from 1997 to 2000.\n\n==Background==\nDavis was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Political Science]] from [[York University]]. He worked as a stockbroker in private life.\n\n==Election to York city council==\nHe was one of six new councillors elected for York in the [[1991 Toronto municipal election|1991 municipal election]], as city residents voted out a number of incumbents following the revelations of the Fairbank Park Scandal. Davis was the first [[Black Canadian]] elected to the York council in the city's 200-year history.\n\nHe was re-elected to the York council in the [[1994 Toronto municipal election|1994 election]]. His council experience includes service on the Administrative Services Committee, the Works and Parks Committee, the boards of health, the Northwestern General Hospital, the York Library and the St. Clair Community Youth Services.\n\n==1996 Ontario by-election==\nHe campaigned for the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] in a 1996 [[by-election]] in [[York South (provincial electoral district)|York South]], as a candidate of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative Party]] when [[New Democratic Party of Ontario|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) leader [[Bob Rae]] vacated his seat. Davis defeated Zubair Chowdhry for the Progressive Conservative nomination, and placed third in the election with 5,093 votes (25.69%). The winner was [[Gerard Kennedy]] who shortly afterwards sought the leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Ontario|Liberals]]. City councillor [[David Miller (mayor of Toronto)|David Miller]] finished second for the NDP. Davis was 32 years old at the time.\n\n==Toronto City Council==\nThe City of York was amalgamated into the new City of Toronto in 1997, and Davis was elected to Toronto City Council in the [[1997 Toronto municipal election|1997 election]] as one of two members for Ward 28. He served as chair of Toronto's crime prevention task force, and in 2000 was the driving force behind a [[gun buyback program]] which allocated fifty dollars to any city resident who surrendered a gun. The program was generally considered a success, and Davis has said that the city was able to collect over 2,000 guns in less than two weeks.<ref>Patrick Evans. Opponents open fire on gun amnesty plan; Police optimistic about province's new program Plan branded as 'makeshift, cheap political solution'. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', September 3, 2005. p.

Wednesday February 4, 1998. p. 184. [http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/minutes/council/cc980204.htm]</ref>\n\n==Defeat==\nThe wards in Toronto were redistributed prior to the [[2000 Toronto municipal election|2000 election]], and some sitting councillors were forced to face one another for re-election.  Davis was defeated in Ward 21, losing to fellow councillor [[Joe Mihevc]] by over 3,500 votes following a very divisive contest. He sought to return to council in the [[2003 Toronto municipal election|2003 campaign]] in Ward 33 in the eastern part of the former city of North York, but was narrowly defeated by [[Shelley Carroll]].\n\n==2003 election==\nDuring the 2003 contest, Davis supported tenant advocacy, the restoration of rent control and gas tax financing for the TTC. Acknowledging that Progressive Conservative governments at the provincial level had opposed all three initiatives, he said, \"I differed with my party\".<ref name=\"Deverell\"/>\n\nHe has worked as a consultant since leaving the council. In 2004, he organized a march in support of police chief [[Julian Fantino]], after it was announced that the deadlocked Toronto Police Services Board would not renew Fantino's contract.<ref>James Cowan. Pro-Fantino group playing politics. ''[[National Post]]''. July 24, 2004. p. TO4.</ref>\n\n==Return to politics==\nIn April 2008, he was appointed to replace trustee Christine Nunziata, who resigned due to allegations over her spending.\n\nDavis was appointed to Ward 6 (York) of the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] to replace Christine Nunziata, who was removed for missing three consecutive board meetings, on May 8, 2010.  Immediately after his appointment, Davis said there needed to be an \"infrastructure of integrity\" in place before the Trustees can restore parent confidence and move on from the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board#Trustee spending scandal|Trustee spending scandal]]. His first motion as trustee was to call upon the board to create an integrity commissioner position at their next meeting held on May 14, 2010.<ref>Cynthia Reason.

He served on the [[York, Toronto|York]] city council from 1991 to 1997, and was a member of the [[Toronto City Council]] from 1997 to 2000.\n\n==Background==\nDavis was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Political Science]] from [[York University]]. He worked as a stockbroker in private life.\n\n==Election to York city council==\nHe was one of six new councillors elected for York in the [[1991 Toronto municipal election|1991 municipal election]], as city residents voted out a number of incumbents following the revelations of the Fairbank Park Scandal. Davis was the first [[Black Canadian]] elected to the York council in the city's 200-year history.\n\nHe was re-elected to the York council in the [[1994 Toronto municipal election|1994 election]]. His council experience includes service on the Administrative Services Committee, the Works and Parks Committee, the boards of health, the Northwestern General Hospital, the York Library and the St. Clair Community Youth Services.\n\n==1996 Ontario by-election==\nHe campaigned for the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] in a 1996 [[by-election]] in [[York South (provincial electoral district)|York South]], as a candidate of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative Party]] when [[New Democratic Party of Ontario|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) leader [[Bob Rae]] vacated his seat. Davis defeated Zubair Chowdhry for the Progressive Conservative nomination, and placed third in the election with 5,093 votes (25.69%). The winner was [[Gerard Kennedy]] who shortly afterwards sought the leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Ontario|Liberals]]. City councillor [[David Miller (mayor of Toronto)|David Miller]] finished second for the NDP. Davis was 32 years old at the time.\n\n==Toronto City Council==\nThe City of York was amalgamated into the new City of Toronto in 1997, and Davis was elected to Toronto City Council in the [[1997 Toronto municipal election|1997 election]] as one of two members for Ward 28. He served as chair of Toronto's crime prevention task force, and in 2000 was the driving force behind a [[gun buyback program]] which allocated fifty dollars to any city resident who surrendered a gun. The program was generally considered a success, and Davis has said that the city was able to collect over 2,000 guns in less than two weeks.<ref>Patrick Evans. Opponents open fire on gun amnesty plan; Police optimistic about province's new program Plan branded as 'makeshift, cheap political solution'. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', September 3, 2005. p. B03.</ref> He also served as vice-chair of the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC) from 1997 to 2000.<ref name=\"Deverell\">John Deverell. Familiar faces running in North York; Ex-councillor, trustee top field Tenants' rights, traffic at issue. ''Toronto Star''. October 30, 2003. p. B02.</ref>\n\nDavis was known as a right-wing councillor, and often highlighted tax reduction and law-and-order issues.  An ally of mayor [[Mel Lastman]], he sought to have [[Howard Moscoe]] removed as TTC chair in 1999<ref>TTC plot foiled. ''Toronto Star'', April 10, 1999. p.1.</ref> In 1998, Davis was one of 13 councillors to vote against same-sex benefits for city employees.<ref>Minutes of the Council of the City of Toronto. Wednesday February 4, 1998. p. 184. [http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/minutes/council/cc980204.htm]</ref>\n\n==Defeat==\nThe wards in Toronto were redistributed prior to the [[2000 Toronto municipal election|2000 election]], and some sitting councillors were forced to face one another for re-election.  Davis was defeated in Ward 21, losing to fellow councillor [[Joe Mihevc]] by over 3,500 votes following a very divisive contest. He sought to return to council in the [[2003 Toronto municipal election|2003 campaign]] in Ward 33 in the eastern part of the former city of North York, but was narrowly defeated by [[Shelley Carroll]].\n\n==2003 election==\nDuring the 2003 contest, Davis supported tenant advocacy, the restoration of rent control and gas tax financing for the TTC. Acknowledging that Progressive Conservative governments at the provincial level had opposed all three initiatives, he said, \"I differed with my party\".<ref name=\"Deverell\"/>\n\nHe has worked as a consultant since leaving the council. In 2004, he organized a march in support of police chief [[Julian Fantino]], after it was announced that the deadlocked Toronto Police Services Board would not renew Fantino's contract.<ref>James Cowan. Pro-Fantino group playing politics. ''[[National Post]]''. July 24, 2004. p. TO4.</ref>\n\n==Return to politics==\nIn April 2008, he was appointed to replace trustee Christine Nunziata, who resigned due to allegations over her spending.\n\nDavis was appointed to Ward 6 (York) of the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] to replace Christine Nunziata, who was removed for missing three consecutive board meetings, on May 8, 2010.  Immediately after his appointment, Davis said there needed to be an \"infrastructure of integrity\" in place before the Trustees can restore parent confidence and move on from the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board#Trustee spending scandal|Trustee spending scandal]]. His first motion as trustee was to call upon the board to create an integrity commissioner position at their next meeting held on May 14, 2010.<ref>Cynthia Reason.

Berardinetti claimed that Heaps defamed her by distributing copies of an article in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that endorsed him two days before the election. The article by columnist John Barber who described himself as a classmate of Heaps endorsed him while belittling Berardinetti as little more than a nepotistic \"pillow talker\" of her MPP husband.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Barber |title=Wise Council: In these wards, the choice is clear |work=The Globe and Mail |date=November 11, 2006 |pp=M1, M4}}</ref> The article which was nver distributed by Heaps, however Heaps and Berardinetti eventually settled out of court. In December, 2009, City Council voted to reimburse Heaps for both the settlement and legal expenses which amounted to $65,680. In January, 2010 Heaps elected to refuse the reimbursement.<ref name=\"lawsuit\">{{cite news |title=Councillor refuses legal-fee reimbursement |work=The Globe and Mail |date=January 26, 2010 |p=A11}}</ref>\n\nIn a related matter, City Council also decided to reimburse legal fees incurred by Heaps when a group called the ''Toronto Party for a Better City'' (TPBC) requested a compliance audit on Heaps' campaign expenses. The audit committee reviewed the expenses and found no evidence of improper financing but the group appealed the decision to a higher court. The legal fees for this process amounted to $45,330. City Council also authorized an additional payment since the reimbursement was deemed a taxable benefit. TPBC and fellow councillor [[Doug Holyday]] launched a second legal action to force Heaps to repay the money. Heaps had refused the reimbursement for the defamation lawsuit but still accepted the reimbursement for the compliance audit action, although he played no role in the council meeting where this took place. Instead he chose to excuse himself from the meeting so as not display any interest in the matter. In July 2010, the Divisional Court ruled that City Council had no authority to reimburse Heaps since he was a candidate at the time and not yet a councillor. In August 2010, City Council appealed that decision and went further by declaring the money to be a 'grant' rather than a 'reimbursement'. Mayor David Miller argued that anyone running for office should not be forced into paying large legal fees. He said, \"Nobody in this city, unless you're really rich, can afford to run for public office and be subjected to $70,000 in legal fees.\" In December 2010, the court refused the city's request for an appeal. However, the court did not force Heaps to return the money.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/752511 Citizens challenge councillor payments], ''Toronto Star'', January 19, 2010.</ref><ref>Daniel Dale.

Berardinetti claimed that unconnected bike lanes on Pharmacy Avenue and [[Birchmount Road]] were leading some residents who lived on those streets to move out of the ward. Berardinetti, who described them as \"bike lanes to nowhere\", said that she would replace them with [[sharrows]]. Heaps said that the bike lanes were put in place by the previous councillor.

Berardinetti claimed that Heaps defamed her by distributing copies of an article in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that endorsed him two days before the election. The article by columnist John Barber who described himself as a classmate of Heaps endorsed him while belittling Berardinetti as little more than a nepotistic \"pillow talker\" of her MPP husband.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Barber |title=Wise Council: In these wards, the choice is clear |work=The Globe and Mail |date=November 11, 2006 |pp=M1, M4}}</ref> The article which was nver distributed by Heaps, however Heaps and Berardinetti eventually settled out of court. In December, 2009, City Council voted to reimburse Heaps for both the settlement and legal expenses which amounted to $65,680. In January, 2010 Heaps elected to refuse the reimbursement.<ref name=\"lawsuit\">{{cite news |title=Councillor refuses legal-fee reimbursement |work=The Globe and Mail |date=January 26, 2010 |p=A11}}</ref>\n\nIn a related matter, City Council also decided to reimburse legal fees incurred by Heaps when a group called the ''Toronto Party for a Better City'' (TPBC) requested a compliance audit on Heaps' campaign expenses. The audit committee reviewed the expenses and found no evidence of improper financing but the group appealed the decision to a higher court. The legal fees for this process amounted to $45,330. City Council also authorized an additional payment since the reimbursement was deemed a taxable benefit. TPBC and fellow councillor [[Doug Holyday]] launched a second legal action to force Heaps to repay the money. Heaps had refused the reimbursement for the defamation lawsuit but still accepted the reimbursement for the compliance audit action, although he played no role in the council meeting where this took place. Instead he chose to excuse himself from the meeting so as not display any interest in the matter. In July 2010, the Divisional Court ruled that City Council had no authority to reimburse Heaps since he was a candidate at the time and not yet a councillor. In August 2010, City Council appealed that decision and went further by declaring the money to be a 'grant' rather than a 'reimbursement'. Mayor David Miller argued that anyone running for office should not be forced into paying large legal fees. He said, \"Nobody in this city, unless you're really rich, can afford to run for public office and be subjected to $70,000 in legal fees.\" In December 2010, the court refused the city's request for an appeal. However, the court did not force Heaps to return the money.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/752511 Citizens challenge councillor payments], ''Toronto Star'', January 19, 2010.</ref><ref>Daniel Dale.

Berardinetti claimed that unconnected bike lanes on Pharmacy Avenue and [[Birchmount Road]] were leading some residents who lived on those streets to move out of the ward. Berardinetti, who described them as \"bike lanes to nowhere\", said that she would replace them with [[sharrows]]. Heaps said that the bike lanes were put in place by the previous councillor. He said that the best alternative was to link up the existing network rather than approve any more stand alone bike lanes.<ref>Don Peat, [http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2010/11/22/16266221.html Bike lanes irk councillor], Toronto Sun, November 22, 2010.</ref><ref>Kristofer Baker.
