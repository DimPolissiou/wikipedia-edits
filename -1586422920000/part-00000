[[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

The district of the Paris region was renamed \"[[\u00cele-de-France]]\" in 1977, but this abbreviated \"Paris region\" name is still commonly used today to describe the \u00cele-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.driea.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Chapitre5_de_Breve_histoire_de_amenagement_de_Paris_DREIF_Auteur_Claude_Cottour_cle0344bc.pdf |title=Une br\u00e8ve histoire de l'am\u00e9nagement de Paris et sa r\u00e9gion Du District \u00e0 la R\u00e9gion \u00cele-de-France |accessdate=26 November 2014 |publisher=DRIEA \u00cele-de-France |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101005621/http://www.driea.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Chapitre5_de_Breve_histoire_de_amenagement_de_Paris_DREIF_Auteur_Claude_Cottour_cle0344bc.pdf |archive-date=1 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the M\u00e9tropole du [[Grand Paris]] came into existence.<ref name=MGP>{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000028528695&dateTexte=vig |title=Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des collectivit\u00e9s territoriales \u2013 Article L5219-1 |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Legifrance |language=fr |trans-title=General Code of Territorial Communities \u2013 Article L5219-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101095821/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000028528695&dateTexte=vig |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nParis' disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth.

As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the \"City of Art\".{{sfn|Montclos|2003}} Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the [[French Baroque and Classicism]] era. Sculptors such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Girardon|Girardon]], [[Antoine Coysevox|Coysevox]] and [[Nicolas Coustou|Coustou]] acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. [[Pierre Mignard]] became the first painter to King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] during this period. In 1648, the ''[[Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture]]'' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital.

In the 20th century, the caf\u00e9s of the Left Bank, especially [[Caf\u00e9 de la Rotonde]] and [[Le D\u00f4me Caf\u00e9]] in Montparnasse and [[Caf\u00e9 de Flore]] and [[Les Deux Magots]] on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=1137}} A [[bistro]] is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \"bistro\" means \"quickly\" in [[Russian language|Russian]], and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=715}} A [[brasserie]] originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like caf\u00e9s, serve food and drinks throughout the day.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=773}}\n\n=== Fashion ===\n{{Main|French fashion}}\n[[File:Magdalena Frackowiak.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Magdalena Frackowiak]] at [[Paris Fashion Week]] (Fall 2011)]]\nSince the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of [[haute couture]] (clothing hand-made to order for private clients).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carr-Allinson|first1=Rowena|title=11 Ways to Look like a Local in Paris|url=http://www.iexplore.com/destinations/paris/how-to-look-like-a-local-in-paris|website=iExplore.com|publisher=Inside-Out Media|accessdate=16 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924211810/http://www.iexplore.com/destinations/paris/how-to-look-like-a-local-in-paris|archive-date=24 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior]] and [[Chanel]], as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as [[Karl Lagerfeld]], [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Givenchy]], and [[Christian Lacroix]].

With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the [[Holy Innocents' Cemetery]], were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris' parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of [[Mines of Paris|Paris's stone mines]] outside the \"Porte d'Enfer\" city gate, today [[place Denfert-Rochereau]] in the 14th arrondissement.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=101}}{{sfn|Broadwell|2007|p=92}} The process of moving bones from the ''Cimeti\u00e8re des Innocents'' to the [[Catacombs of Paris|catacombs]] took place between 1786 and 1814;{{sfn|Andia|Brialy|2001|p=221}} part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs.\n\nAfter a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.{{sfn|Ayers|2004|p=271}} Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery|P\u00e8re Lachaise]], [[Montmartre Cemetery|Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse Cemetery|Montparnasse]], and later [[Passy Cemetery|Passy]]; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860.

The district of the Paris region was renamed \"[[\u00cele-de-France]]\" in 1977, but this abbreviated \"Paris region\" name is still commonly used today to describe the \u00cele-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.driea.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Chapitre5_de_Breve_histoire_de_amenagement_de_Paris_DREIF_Auteur_Claude_Cottour_cle0344bc.pdf |title=Une br\u00e8ve histoire de l'am\u00e9nagement de Paris et sa r\u00e9gion Du District \u00e0 la R\u00e9gion \u00cele-de-France |accessdate=26 November 2014 |publisher=DRIEA \u00cele-de-France |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101005621/http://www.driea.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Chapitre5_de_Breve_histoire_de_amenagement_de_Paris_DREIF_Auteur_Claude_Cottour_cle0344bc.pdf |archive-date=1 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the M\u00e9tropole du [[Grand Paris]] came into existence.<ref name=MGP>{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000028528695&dateTexte=vig |title=Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des collectivit\u00e9s territoriales \u2013 Article L5219-1 |accessdate=29 November 2015 |publisher=Legifrance |language=fr |trans-title=General Code of Territorial Communities \u2013 Article L5219-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101095821/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000028528695&dateTexte=vig |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nParis' disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth.

As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the \"City of Art\".{{sfn|Montclos|2003}} Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the [[French Baroque and Classicism]] era. Sculptors such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Girardon|Girardon]], [[Antoine Coysevox|Coysevox]] and [[Nicolas Coustou|Coustou]] acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. [[Pierre Mignard]] became the first painter to King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] during this period. In 1648, the ''[[Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture]]'' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital.

Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; \"bistro\" means \"quickly\" in [[Russian language|Russian]], and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=715}} A [[brasserie]] originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like caf\u00e9s, serve food and drinks throughout the day.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=773}}\n\n=== Fashion ===\n{{Main|French fashion}}\n[[File:Magdalena Frackowiak.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Magdalena Frackowiak]] at [[Paris Fashion Week]] (Fall 2011)]]\nSince the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of [[haute couture]] (clothing hand-made to order for private clients).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carr-Allinson|first1=Rowena|title=11 Ways to Look like a Local in Paris|url=http://www.iexplore.com/destinations/paris/how-to-look-like-a-local-in-paris|website=iExplore.com|publisher=Inside-Out Media|accessdate=16 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924211810/http://www.iexplore.com/destinations/paris/how-to-look-like-a-local-in-paris|archive-date=24 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior]] and [[Chanel]], as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as [[Karl Lagerfeld]], [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Givenchy]], and [[Christian Lacroix]].

With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the [[Holy Innocents' Cemetery]], were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris' parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of [[Mines of Paris|Paris's stone mines]] outside the \"Porte d'Enfer\" city gate, today [[place Denfert-Rochereau]] in the 14th arrondissement.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=101}}{{sfn|Broadwell|2007|p=92}} The process of moving bones from the ''Cimeti\u00e8re des Innocents'' to the [[Catacombs of Paris|catacombs]] took place between 1786 and 1814;{{sfn|Andia|Brialy|2001|p=221}} part of the network of tunnels and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs.\n\nAfter a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.{{sfn|Ayers|2004|p=271}} Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery|P\u00e8re Lachaise]], [[Montmartre Cemetery|Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse Cemetery|Montparnasse]], and later [[Passy Cemetery|Passy]]; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860.

The Lord Great Chamberlain has charge over the [[Palace of Westminster]] (though since the 1960s his personal authority has been limited to the royal apartments and Westminster Hall).\n\nOn formal state occasions, he wears a distinctive scarlet court uniform and bears a gold key and a white stave as the insignia of his office.\n\nThe position is a hereditary one, held since 1780 [[hereditary in gross|in gross]]. At any one time, a single person actually exercises the office of Lord Great Chamberlain. The various individuals who hold fractions of the Lord Great Chamberlainship are technically each ''Joint Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain''. The Joint Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlains are choosing one individual of the rank of a knight or higher to be the ''Deputy Lord Great Chamberlain''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Journal of the House of Lords Volume 36, 1779-1783 |date=1767-1830 |publisher=British History Online |location=London |pages=296-309 |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/lords-jrnl/vol36/pp296-309#p134 |accessdate=5 January 2020 |chapter=House of Lords Journal Volume 36: May 1781 21-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Lords|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/1902-05-06/debates/05337074-f74d-4e05-92a7-73116832f120/OfficeOfLordGreatChamberlain|date=May 6, 1902|title=Office Of Lord Great Chamberlain}}</ref> Due to an agreement from 1912, the right to exercise the office for a given reign rotates proportionately between three families (of the then three joint office holders) to the fraction of the office held. For instance, the Marquesses of Cholmondeley hold one-half of the office, and may therefore exercise the office or appoint a deputy every alternate reign. Whenever one of the three shares of the 1912 agreement is split further, the joint heirs of this share have to agree among each other, who should be their deputy or any mechanism to determine who of them has the right to choose a deputy.\n\nThe office of Lord Great Chamberlain is distinct from the non-hereditary office of [[Lord Chamberlain|Lord Chamberlain of the Household]], a position in the monarch's household. This office arose in the 14th century as a deputy of the Lord Great Chamberlain to fulfil the latter's duties in the Royal Household, but now they are quite distinct.\n\nThe [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed the automatic right of [[hereditary peer]]s to sit in the House of Lords, but the Act provided that a hereditary peer exercising the office of Lord Great Chamberlain (as well as the [[Earl Marshal]]) be exempt from such a rule, in order to perform ceremonial functions.\n\n== History of the office ==\n[[File:Barack Obama in the Members' Lobby of the Palace of Westminster, 2011.jpg|thumb|The Lord Great Chamberlain, the [[David Cholmondeley, 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley|7th Marquess of Cholmondeley]] (left), holding his white staff of office; the Lord Speaker, [[Baroness Hayman]]; and the Speaker of the House of Commons, [[John Bercow]] showing US President [[Barack Obama]] around Members' Lobby during a tour of the Palace in May 2011]]\n\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}\nThe office was originally held by [[Robert Malet]], a son of one of the leading companions of [[William the Conqueror]]. In 1133, however, [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] declared Malet's estates and titles forfeit, and awarded the office of Lord Great Chamberlain to [[Aubrey de Vere II|Aubrey de Vere]], whose son was created [[Earl of Oxford]]. Thereafter, the Earls of Oxford held the title almost continuously until 1526, with a few intermissions due to the forfeiture of some Earls for treason. In 1526, however, the fourteenth Earl of Oxford died, leaving his aunts as his heirs. The earldom was inherited by a more distant heir-male, his second cousin. The Sovereign then decreed that the office belonged to [[The Crown]], and was not transmitted along with the earldom. The Sovereign appointed the fifteenth Earl to the office, but the appointment was deemed for life and was not hereditary. The family's association with the office was  interrupted in 1540, when the fifteenth earl died and [[Thomas Cromwell]], the King's chief adviser, was appointed Lord Great Chamberlain.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA115|title=The British Plutarch |editor=[[Thomas Mortimer (writer)|Thomas Mortimer]] |page=115}}</ref> After Cromwell's [[attainder]] and execution later the same year, the office passed through a few more court figures, until 1553, when it was passed back to the De Vere family, the sixteenth Earl of Oxford, again as an uninheritable life appointment.<ref>Loades, D. (2004) ''Intrigue and Treason: the Tudor Court, 1547\u20131558'' Harlow: Pearson, p.309</ref> Later, [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] ruled that the Earls of Oxford were indeed entitled to the office of Lord Great Chamberlain on an hereditary basis.\n\nThus, the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth Earls of Oxford held the position on a hereditary basis until 1626, when the eighteenth Earl died, again leaving a distant relative as [[heir male]], but a closer one as a female heir. The [[House of Lords]] eventually ruled that the office belonged to the '''heir general''', [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Robert Bertie, 14th Baron Willoughby de Eresby]], who later became [[Earl of Lindsey]]. The office remained vested in the Earls of Lindsey, who later became [[Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven|Dukes of Ancaster and Kesteven]]. In 1779, however, the fourth Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven died, leaving two sisters as female heirs, and an uncle as an heir male. The uncle became the fifth and last Duke, but the House of Lords ruled that the two sisters were jointly Lord Great Chamberlain and could appoint a Deputy to fulfil the functions of the office. The barony of [[Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Willoughby de Eresby]] went into [[abeyance]] between the two sisters, but the Sovereign terminated the abeyance and granted the title to the elder sister, [[Priscilla Bertie, 21st Baroness Willoughby de Eresby]]. The younger sister later married the first [[George Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley|Marquess of Cholmondeley]]. The office of Lord Great Chamberlain, however, was divided between Priscilla and her younger sister Georgiana. Priscilla's share was eventually split between two of her granddaughters, and has been split several more times since then. By contrast, Georgiana's share has been inherited by a single male heir each time; that individual has in each case been the Marquess of Cholmondeley, a title created for Georgiana's husband.\n\nIn 1902 it was ruled by the house of Lords, that the joint office holders, the Earl of Ancaster, the Marquess of Cholmondeley and the Earl Carrington have to agree on a deputy to exercise the office, subject to the approval of the Sovereign. Otherwise the Sovereign should appoint a deputy until an agreement is reached.<ref>{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Lords|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/1902-05-06/debates/05337074-f74d-4e05-92a7-73116832f120/OfficeOfLordGreatChamberlain|date=May 6, 1902|title=Office Of Lord Great Chamberlain}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912 an agreement was reached, that, alternating every reign, the right to appoint the person who exercises the office, rotates between the three joint office holders or respectively their heirs with the Marquess of Cholmondeley or his heirs, take turn every second reign.<ref name=debrett>[http://www.debretts.com/people/royal-family/the-royal-household/great-officers-of-state.aspx Great Officers of State: The Lord Great Chamberlain and The Earl Marshal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106031947/http://www.debretts.com/people/royal-family/the-royal-household/great-officers-of-state.aspx |date=6 January 2014 }}.

The Lord Great Chamberlain has charge over the [[Palace of Westminster]] (though since the 1960s his personal authority has been limited to the royal apartments and Westminster Hall).\n\nOn formal state occasions, he wears a distinctive scarlet court uniform and bears a gold key and a white stave as the insignia of his office.\n\nThe position is a hereditary one, held since 1780 [[hereditary in gross|in gross]]. At any one time, a single person actually exercises the office of Lord Great Chamberlain. The various individuals who hold fractions of the Lord Great Chamberlainship are technically each ''Joint Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain''. The Joint Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlains are choosing one individual of the rank of a knight or higher to be the ''Deputy Lord Great Chamberlain''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Journal of the House of Lords Volume 36, 1779-1783 |date=1767-1830 |publisher=British History Online |location=London |pages=296-309 |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/lords-jrnl/vol36/pp296-309#p134 |accessdate=5 January 2020 |chapter=House of Lords Journal Volume 36: May 1781 21-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Lords|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/1902-05-06/debates/05337074-f74d-4e05-92a7-73116832f120/OfficeOfLordGreatChamberlain|date=May 6, 1902|title=Office Of Lord Great Chamberlain}}</ref> Due to an agreement from 1912, the right to exercise the office for a given reign rotates proportionately between three families (of the then three joint office holders) to the fraction of the office held. For instance, the Marquesses of Cholmondeley hold one-half of the office, and may therefore exercise the office or appoint a deputy every alternate reign. Whenever one of the three shares of the 1912 agreement is split further, the joint heirs of this share have to agree among each other, who should be their deputy or any mechanism to determine who of them has the right to choose a deputy.\n\nThe office of Lord Great Chamberlain is distinct from the non-hereditary office of [[Lord Chamberlain|Lord Chamberlain of the Household]], a position in the monarch's household. This office arose in the 14th century as a deputy of the Lord Great Chamberlain to fulfil the latter's duties in the Royal Household, but now they are quite distinct.\n\nThe [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed the automatic right of [[hereditary peer]]s to sit in the House of Lords, but the Act provided that a hereditary peer exercising the office of Lord Great Chamberlain (as well as the [[Earl Marshal]]) be exempt from such a rule, in order to perform ceremonial functions.\n\n== History of the office ==\n[[File:Barack Obama in the Members' Lobby of the Palace of Westminster, 2011.jpg|thumb|The Lord Great Chamberlain, the [[David Cholmondeley, 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley|7th Marquess of Cholmondeley]] (left), holding his white staff of office; the Lord Speaker, [[Baroness Hayman]]; and the Speaker of the House of Commons, [[John Bercow]] showing US President [[Barack Obama]] around Members' Lobby during a tour of the Palace in May 2011]]\n\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}\nThe office was originally held by [[Robert Malet]], a son of one of the leading companions of [[William the Conqueror]]. In 1133, however, [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] declared Malet's estates and titles forfeit, and awarded the office of Lord Great Chamberlain to [[Aubrey de Vere II|Aubrey de Vere]], whose son was created [[Earl of Oxford]]. Thereafter, the Earls of Oxford held the title almost continuously until 1526, with a few intermissions due to the forfeiture of some Earls for treason. In 1526, however, the fourteenth Earl of Oxford died, leaving his aunts as his heirs. The earldom was inherited by a more distant heir-male, his second cousin. The Sovereign then decreed that the office belonged to [[The Crown]], and was not transmitted along with the earldom. The Sovereign appointed the fifteenth Earl to the office, but the appointment was deemed for life and was not hereditary. The family's association with the office was  interrupted in 1540, when the fifteenth earl died and [[Thomas Cromwell]], the King's chief adviser, was appointed Lord Great Chamberlain.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA115|title=The British Plutarch |editor=[[Thomas Mortimer (writer)|Thomas Mortimer]] |page=115}}</ref> After Cromwell's [[attainder]] and execution later the same year, the office passed through a few more court figures, until 1553, when it was passed back to the De Vere family, the sixteenth Earl of Oxford, again as an uninheritable life appointment.<ref>Loades, D. (2004) ''Intrigue and Treason: the Tudor Court, 1547\u20131558'' Harlow: Pearson, p.309</ref> Later, [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] ruled that the Earls of Oxford were indeed entitled to the office of Lord Great Chamberlain on an hereditary basis.\n\nThus, the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth Earls of Oxford held the position on a hereditary basis until 1626, when the eighteenth Earl died, again leaving a distant relative as [[heir male]], but a closer one as a female heir. The [[House of Lords]] eventually ruled that the office belonged to the '''heir general''', [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Robert Bertie, 14th Baron Willoughby de Eresby]], who later became [[Earl of Lindsey]]. The office remained vested in the Earls of Lindsey, who later became [[Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven|Dukes of Ancaster and Kesteven]]. In 1779, however, the fourth Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven died, leaving two sisters as female heirs, and an uncle as an heir male. The uncle became the fifth and last Duke, but the House of Lords ruled that the two sisters were jointly Lord Great Chamberlain and could appoint a Deputy to fulfil the functions of the office. The barony of [[Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Willoughby de Eresby]] went into [[abeyance]] between the two sisters, but the Sovereign terminated the abeyance and granted the title to the elder sister, [[Priscilla Bertie, 21st Baroness Willoughby de Eresby]]. The younger sister later married the first [[George Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley|Marquess of Cholmondeley]]. The office of Lord Great Chamberlain, however, was divided between Priscilla and her younger sister Georgiana. Priscilla's share was eventually split between two of her granddaughters, and has been split several more times since then. By contrast, Georgiana's share has been inherited by a single male heir each time; that individual has in each case been the Marquess of Cholmondeley, a title created for Georgiana's husband.\n\nIn 1902 it was ruled by the house of Lords, that the joint office holders, the Earl of Ancaster, the Marquess of Cholmondeley and the Earl Carrington have to agree on a deputy to exercise the office, subject to the approval of the Sovereign. Otherwise the Sovereign should appoint a deputy until an agreement is reached.<ref>{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Lords|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/1902-05-06/debates/05337074-f74d-4e05-92a7-73116832f120/OfficeOfLordGreatChamberlain|date=May 6, 1902|title=Office Of Lord Great Chamberlain}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912 an agreement was reached, that, alternating every reign, the right to appoint the person who exercises the office, rotates between the three joint office holders or respectively their heirs with the Marquess of Cholmondeley or his heirs, take turn every second reign.<ref name=debrett>[http://www.debretts.com/people/royal-family/the-royal-household/great-officers-of-state.aspx Great Officers of State: The Lord Great Chamberlain and The Earl Marshal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106031947/http://www.debretts.com/people/royal-family/the-royal-household/great-officers-of-state.aspx |date=6 January 2014 }}.

He is a member of a shapeshifting species called [[Changeling (Star Trek)|Changelings]] and serves as the head of security for the space station [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]] on which the show is set. Intelligent, observant and taciturn, Odo uses his unique abilities throughout the show to maintain security on the DS9 station and, later, aids the Bajoran people and the Federation throughout the [[Dominion War]] against his own people, the [[Founders (Star Trek)|Founders]].\n\n==Overview==\n=== Star Trek: Deep Space 9 ===\nThe original Writer's Bible from 1992 for [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]] described Odo as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Odo, an alien male, middle-aged curmudgeon, and a shape-shifter. In his natural state he is a gelatinous liquid. He was a [[Bajoran]] law enforcement officer on the space station under the [[Cardassian]]s. [[Starfleet]] decides to have him continue in that role, since he's extremely savvy about the Promenade and all who frequent it. His backstory is: 50 years ago, with no memory of his past, he was found alone in a mysterious spacecraft that appeared in the Denarias asteroid belt. He was found by the [[Bajoran]] and lived amongst them. At first he was sort of an [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]], a source of curiosity and humor as he turned himself into a chair or pencil. Finally he realized he would have to take the form of a humanoid to assimilate and function in their environment. He does it, but resents it. As a result, Odo performs a uniquely important role in the ensemble: he is a character who explores and comments on Human values. Because he is forced to pass as one of us, his point of view usually comes with a cynical and critical edge. But he can't quite get it right, this humanoid shape, though he continues to try. So he looks a little unfinished in a way. He's been working on it a long time. Someone might ask him: Why don't you take the form of a younger man. His answer: I would if I could. He has the [[adopted child syndrome]], searching for his own personal identity. Although he doesn't know anything about his species, he is certain that justice is an integral part of their being, because the necessity for it runs through every fiber of his body \u2013 a racial memory. That's why he became a law man. He has a couple of Bajoran deputies; he doesn't allow weapons on the Promenade, and once every day he must return to his gelatinous form.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.twguild.com/resources/development1.html |title=Star Trek Deep Space Nine Pre-Premiere Bible |website=Trek Writer's Guild |access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Rene Auberjonois by Luigi Rosa, 12.jpg|thumb|left|Odo was portrayed in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' by actor [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]]]\n\nActor [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] describes Odo as \"a very unformed being\" who was  \"trying to get some kind of shape to his life\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/catching-up-with-ds9undefineds-rene-auberjonois-part-1|title=Catching Up with DS9\u2019s Rene Auberjonois, Part 1|work=StarTrek.com|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en}}</ref> Co-creator of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', [[Michael Piller]], speaks of Odo's role within the show as being prompted by needing \"a character who represented the traditions of [[Spock]] and [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], the outsider who looks in at humanity.\"<ref>''New Frontiers: The Story of Deep Space Nine'', DS9 Season 2 DVD, Special Features</ref>\n\nLate in the [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (season 5)|fifth season]], in the episode \"[[Children of Time (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Children of Time]]\", an Odo who has lived an additional 200 years tells the \"current\" Kira Nerys that he has loved her from the time their friendship first began. With this revelation, Kira and the \"current\" Odo eventually become a couple.\n\nAccording to the backstory of the series, Odo was found adrift in his natural gelatinous state in the Denorios Belt in the Bajoran system. Doctor [[Mora Pol]] studied him for seven years, not initially recognising him as a sentient being. Doctor Mora was later forced to recognise Odo's sentience when he copied a [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]] on a laboratory table. Odo's name stemmed from the Cardassian language word \"Odo'ital\", meaning \"nothing\", which was the loose translation of the \"unknown sample\" label in Bajoran on his laboratory flask.\n\n===Mirror Universe===\nIn the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]], Odo is the supervisor of the mining complex at [[Terok Nor]]. He is a brutal taskmaster over [[Earth|Terran]] slaves there and tolerates no deviation from his strict rules. Relatively little is known of him, as no one in the Mirror Universe is aware that the [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]] exists or who Odo's [[Changelings (Star Trek)|people]] are. During a mining accident, Odo begins an evacuation of the Terran workers from the complex.

He is a member of a shapeshifting species called [[Changeling (Star Trek)|Changelings]] and serves as the head of security for the space station [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]] on which the show is set. Intelligent, observant and taciturn, Odo uses his unique abilities throughout the show to maintain security on the DS9 station and, later, aids the Bajoran people and the Federation throughout the [[Dominion War]] against his own people, the [[Founders (Star Trek)|Founders]].\n\n==Overview==\n=== Star Trek: Deep Space 9 ===\nThe original Writer's Bible from 1992 for [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]] described Odo as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Odo, an alien male, middle-aged curmudgeon, and a shape-shifter. In his natural state he is a gelatinous liquid. He was a [[Bajoran]] law enforcement officer on the space station under the [[Cardassian]]s. [[Starfleet]] decides to have him continue in that role, since he's extremely savvy about the Promenade and all who frequent it. His backstory is: 50 years ago, with no memory of his past, he was found alone in a mysterious spacecraft that appeared in the Denarias asteroid belt. He was found by the [[Bajoran]] and lived amongst them. At first he was sort of an [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]], a source of curiosity and humor as he turned himself into a chair or pencil. Finally he realized he would have to take the form of a humanoid to assimilate and function in their environment. He does it, but resents it. As a result, Odo performs a uniquely important role in the ensemble: he is a character who explores and comments on Human values. Because he is forced to pass as one of us, his point of view usually comes with a cynical and critical edge. But he can't quite get it right, this humanoid shape, though he continues to try. So he looks a little unfinished in a way. He's been working on it a long time. Someone might ask him: Why don't you take the form of a younger man. His answer: I would if I could. He has the [[adopted child syndrome]], searching for his own personal identity. Although he doesn't know anything about his species, he is certain that justice is an integral part of their being, because the necessity for it runs through every fiber of his body \u2013 a racial memory. That's why he became a law man. He has a couple of Bajoran deputies; he doesn't allow weapons on the Promenade, and once every day he must return to his gelatinous form.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.twguild.com/resources/development1.html |title=Star Trek Deep Space Nine Pre-Premiere Bible |website=Trek Writer's Guild |access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Rene Auberjonois by Luigi Rosa, 12.jpg|thumb|left|Odo was portrayed in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' by actor [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]]]\n\nActor [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] describes Odo as \"a very unformed being\" who was  \"trying to get some kind of shape to his life\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/catching-up-with-ds9undefineds-rene-auberjonois-part-1|title=Catching Up with DS9\u2019s Rene Auberjonois, Part 1|work=StarTrek.com|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en}}</ref> Co-creator of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', [[Michael Piller]], speaks of Odo's role within the show as being prompted by needing \"a character who represented the traditions of [[Spock]] and [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], the outsider who looks in at humanity.\"<ref>''New Frontiers: The Story of Deep Space Nine'', DS9 Season 2 DVD, Special Features</ref>\n\nLate in the [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (season 5)|fifth season]], in the episode \"[[Children of Time (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Children of Time]]\", an Odo who has lived an additional 200 years tells the \"current\" Kira Nerys that he has loved her from the time their friendship first began. With this revelation, Kira and the \"current\" Odo eventually become a couple.\n\nAccording to the backstory of the series, Odo was found adrift in his natural gelatinous state in the Denorios Belt in the Bajoran system. Doctor [[Mora Pol]] studied him for seven years, not initially recognising him as a sentient being. Doctor Mora was later forced to recognise Odo's sentience when he copied a [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]] on a laboratory table. Odo's name stemmed from the Cardassian language word \"Odo'ital\", meaning \"nothing\", which was the loose translation of the \"unknown sample\" label in Bajoran on his laboratory flask.\n\n===Mirror Universe===\nIn the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]], Odo is the supervisor of the mining complex at [[Terok Nor]]. He is a brutal taskmaster over [[Earth|Terran]] slaves there and tolerates no deviation from his strict rules. Relatively little is known of him, as no one in the Mirror Universe is aware that the [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]] exists or who Odo's [[Changelings (Star Trek)|people]] are. During a mining accident, Odo begins an evacuation of the Terran workers from the complex. [[Julian Bashir]], seizing the opportunity to escape, disintegrates him with a [[Disruptor (science fiction)|disruptor]].\n\nIn this reality, Odo has his own set of rules called the \"[[Rules of Obedience]]\" and quotes one of the rules in the same way that regular universe [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] would quote his \"[[Rules of Acquisition]]\".\n\nAfter filming of the episode \"[[Crossover (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Crossover]]\", which was mirror Odo's sole onscreen appearance, actor [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] liked the alternate uniform so much he began wearing it while playing the regular universe version of Odo as well.\n\n===Novels===\nIn the initial [[Deep Space Nine relaunch|''Deep Space Nine'' relaunch]] novels, Odo is succeeded as security chief by [[Ro Laren]], who is working for the [[Bajoran]] Militia.

Defence Commission]] was created in 1972 as per the 1972 Constitution, originally the commission's mandate was to supervise national defence matters within North Korea.\n\nPer the 4th plenary session of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] in June 2016 the National Defence Commission was officially replaced by the ''State Affairs Commission'', with an expanded focus towards other national concerns aside from defence and security.\n\nToday, the state affairs commission serves to fund all branches of the military.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Powers and responsibilities==\nArticle 106 of the [[Constitution of North Korea]] defines the State Affairs Commission as the highest leadership body.{{sfn|Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|2016|loc=Article 106}} Article 109 of the Constitution states that the SAC's powers are to:{{sfn|Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|2016|loc=Article 109}}\n*deliberate and decide on major policies of the State including defence;\n*exercise supervision over the fulfillment of the orders of the [[Chairman of the State Affairs Commission]] of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the decisions and directives of the Commission, and take measures for their fulfillment;\n*abrogate decisions and directives of State organs which run counter to the orders of the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the decisions and directives of the Commission.\n\nIn practice, SAC supervises the [[Cabinet of North Korea]]. It also directly supervises the three ministries that are not under the Cabinet, namely the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces]], [[Ministry of State Security (North Korea)|Ministry of State Security]] and the [[Ministry of People's Security]] and the [[General Staff Department of the Korean People's Army]] and [[General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army]]. One additional entity, the [[State Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission]], is also under the SAC as its Chairman is appointed by the Commission.<ref name=unikorea>{{Cite web|title=Organizational Chart of North Korean Leadership|location=Seoul|publisher=Political and Military Analysis Division, Intelligence and Analysis Bureau; Ministry of Unification |date=January 2018|accessdate=17 October 2018|url=https://www.unikorea.go.kr/cms/getFile.do?file=2018012913454378143.pdf&orgname=north_korean_Leadership.pdf&mgmtId=MGMT_0000000754&siteId=SITE_00003&filePath=eng_unikorea/common/file/&count=Y#.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\nThe following are the current members of the State Affairs Commission as of its election by the 14th Supreme People's Assembly on 11 April 2019:<ref name=1stSession14thSPA>{{Cite web |title=In full: promotions and demotions at North Korea\u2019s 14th SPA |publisher=Korea Risk Group |work=NK PRO |date=12 April 2019 |access-date=17 April 2019 |url= https://www.nknews.org/pro/in-full-promotions-and-demotions-at-north-koreas-14th-spa/ }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"6\" |[[Chairman of the State Affairs Commission]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Chairman\n! colspan=\"2\" |Political party\n!Member since\n!
