Despite this information being corrected to consider them \"upcoming\" features, the flood of criticism prompted [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] to pull the game from sale on Steam and offer refunds, stating that the game was accidentally made available for purchase prematurely. In an interview with [[PC Gamer]], executive producer Sergey Titov (who was also listed as a producer for ''[[Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing]]'') claimed that its servers were temporarily capped at 50 due to player feedback, and that its marketing team had misinterpreted information about the current state of the game. Due to its similar themes, gameplay, and title, some also felt that ''The War Z'' was a clone of the popular ''[[ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead]]'' mod ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'' (of which a [[DayZ (video game)|standalone version]] was in development); on June 20, 2013, Hammerpoint announced that the game would be renamed ''Infestation: Survivor Stories'', \"primarily as a result of some confusion and trademark issues with a similarly titled property\" (a statement which also factored in a conflict with the film ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]'').<ref name=\"gamespy-warzclaims\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-war-z/1226980p1.html|title=A Shocking Interview With The War Z Developer On False Steam Store Claims|last=Stapleton|first=Dan|date=December 18, 2012|work=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"pcgamer-warzinterview\">{{cite magazine|title=The War Z interview: Sergey Titov responds to backlash, sale removal from Steam|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/20/the-war-z-interview-sergey-titov-backlash|magazine=PC Gamer|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"eurog - 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-19-the-war-z-dev-apologises-to-gamers-who-misread-steam-page-hits-out-at-dayz-fanboys|title=The War Z dev apologises to gamers who \"misread\" Steam page, hits out at \"extreme DayZ fanboys\"|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=December 19, 2012|website=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"pcgamer-warzrenamed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/06/20/the-war-z-renamed-as-infestation-survivor-stories-is-still-rubbish/|title=The War Z renamed as Infestation: Survivor Stories \u2013 is still rubbish|website=PC Gamer|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== ''SimCity'' (2013) ===\n''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]]'', developed by [[Maxis]] and [[Electronic Arts]] (EA), was aimed to augment the normally single-player [[city-building game]] with online features that would allow players' cities to interact with one other, building a software platform rather than a single game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/5/20/11722342/simcity-launch-ea-maxis-ocean-quigley |title=SimCity 2013's creative director explains what went right and what went so, so wrong |first=Samit |last=Sarkar |date=May 20, 2016 |accessdate=July 5, 2017 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> The game was released in March 2013, but there was no offline mode, and the servers for online connectivity were over capacity, requiring players to wait upwards of thirty minutes to play for several weeks following launch.

Despite this information being corrected to consider them \"upcoming\" features, the flood of criticism prompted [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] to pull the game from sale on Steam and offer refunds, stating that the game was accidentally made available for purchase prematurely. In an interview with [[PC Gamer]], executive producer Sergey Titov (who was also listed as a producer for ''[[Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing]]'') claimed that its servers were temporarily capped at 50 due to player feedback, and that its marketing team had misinterpreted information about the current state of the game. Due to its similar themes, gameplay, and title, some also felt that ''The War Z'' was a clone of the popular ''[[ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead]]'' mod ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'' (of which a [[DayZ (video game)|standalone version]] was in development); on June 20, 2013, Hammerpoint announced that the game would be renamed ''Infestation: Survivor Stories'', \"primarily as a result of some confusion and trademark issues with a similarly titled property\" (a statement which also factored in a conflict with the film ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]'').<ref name=\"gamespy-warzclaims\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-war-z/1226980p1.html|title=A Shocking Interview With The War Z Developer On False Steam Store Claims|last=Stapleton|first=Dan|date=December 18, 2012|work=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"pcgamer-warzinterview\">{{cite magazine|title=The War Z interview: Sergey Titov responds to backlash, sale removal from Steam|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/20/the-war-z-interview-sergey-titov-backlash|magazine=PC Gamer|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"eurog - 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-19-the-war-z-dev-apologises-to-gamers-who-misread-steam-page-hits-out-at-dayz-fanboys|title=The War Z dev apologises to gamers who \"misread\" Steam page, hits out at \"extreme DayZ fanboys\"|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=December 19, 2012|website=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"pcgamer-warzrenamed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/06/20/the-war-z-renamed-as-infestation-survivor-stories-is-still-rubbish/|title=The War Z renamed as Infestation: Survivor Stories \u2013 is still rubbish|website=PC Gamer|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== ''SimCity'' (2013) ===\n''[[SimCity (2013 video game)|SimCity]]'', developed by [[Maxis]] and [[Electronic Arts]] (EA), was aimed to augment the normally single-player [[city-building game]] with online features that would allow players' cities to interact with one other, building a software platform rather than a single game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/5/20/11722342/simcity-launch-ea-maxis-ocean-quigley |title=SimCity 2013's creative director explains what went right and what went so, so wrong |first=Samit |last=Sarkar |date=May 20, 2016 |accessdate=July 5, 2017 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> The game was released in March 2013, but there was no offline mode, and the servers for online connectivity were over capacity, requiring players to wait upwards of thirty minutes to play for several weeks following launch.

Coupled with the tiered distribution of items from Star Crates, many journalists and players expressed concern over how the game was treating consumers due to these loot box mechanics; other games released in 2017 had raised similar issues, but ''Battlefront II'' became a large focus due to the highly visible nature of the ''Star Wars'' branding.<ref name=\"eg pegi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-11-are-loot-boxes-gambling|title=Are loot boxes gambling?|last=Hood|first=Vic|date=October 12, 2017|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"cbc\">{{cite web | url =  http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/video-games-loot-boxes-1.4373079 |title = Loot box brouhaha: Are video games becoming too much like gambling?  |first = Jonathan | last = Ore | date = October 29, 2017 | accessdate = October 30, 2017 | work = [[CBC News|CBC]] }}</ref> One official response on [[Reddit]] to a player's complaint about the cost of acquiring Darth Vader ended up with more than 683,000 downvotes, subsequently noted by the [[Guinness World Records]] in their 2020 edition as the most downvoted comment on Reddit to that point.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/eas-infamous-defense-of-lootboxes-wins-a-guinness-world-record-for-most-downvoted-comment-on-reddit/ | title = EA's infamous defense of Battlefront 2's awful grind wins a Guinness World Record | first = Steven | last = Messner | date = September 6, 2019 | accessdate = September 6, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nEA made a number of revisions to the Star Crate approach prior to launch, such as reducing the cost of the special characters by 75%, but a large portion of the players still were critical of the overall \"pay-to-win\" nature.

From 1989 to 2003, a jury of journalists allotted \"Golden Aces\" by category to games presented by their editors.  A special prize, the ''Super As d'Or'', was allotted to the best game from any category.\n\nIn 2003, the process was modified to give more autonomy to the jury.  A single As d'Or was awarded, and 10 nominees were announced.\n\nIn 2005, the award merged with the [[Jeu de l'Ann\u00e9e]].  It was decided that the combined award should be named after the year of awarding rather than year of publication, so the first combined award was the 2005 ''As d'Or Jeu de l'Ann\u00e9e'' with awards in three categories: general public/family games, experts, and children. In 2012, the ''As d'Or Prix du Jury'' was added.\n\n== Super As d'Or ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable alternance\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Game\n! scope=\"col\" | Designer(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Publisher\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1988\n| ''[[Supergang]]''\n| [[G\u00e9rard Mathieu]] & [[G\u00e9rard Delfanti]]\n| [[Ludod\u00e9lire]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1989\n| ''[[Abalone (board game)|Abalone]]''\n| [[Michel Lalet]] & [[Laurent L\u00e9vi]]\n| [[Abalone (jeu)|Abalone]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1990\n| ''[[Tutankhamun (game)|Toutankhamon]]''\n| [[Stefanie Rohner]] & [[Christian Wolf]]\n| [[Jumbo (\u00e9diteur)|Jumbo]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1992\n| ''[[Quarto (board game)]]''\n| [[Blaise Muller]]\n| [[Gigamic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1993\n| ''[[S.O.S.

Most recumbent riders choose this type of design for [[ergonomic]] reasons: the rider's weight is distributed comfortably over a larger area, supported by back and buttocks. On a traditional [[upright bicycle]], the body weight rests entirely on a small portion of the [[Tuberosity of the ischium|sitting bones]], the feet, and the hands.\n\nMost recumbent models also have an [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] advantage; the reclined, legs-forward position of the rider's body presents a smaller frontal profile. A recumbent holds the world speed record for a bicycle,<ref>{{cite news|title=Dutch cyclist claims new world speed record in Nevada|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-24133410|accessdate=11 May 2014|newspaper=BBC}}</ref> and they were banned from racing under the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI) in 1934,<ref name=\"nelson\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.helsinki.fi/~tlinden/winforb.html\n| title = The History of the Recumbent Bicycle: Winning Forbidden\n| accessdate = 28 August 2008}}</ref> and now race under the banner of the [[World Human Powered Vehicle Association]] (WHPVA) and [[International Human Powered Vehicle Association]] (IHPVA).\n\nRecumbents are available in a wide range of configurations, including: long to short wheelbase; large, small, or a mix of wheel sizes; overseat, underseat, or no-hands steering; and rear wheel or front wheel drive. A variant with three wheels is a recumbent [[tricycle]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:CNC Cruzbike 2007.jpg|thumb|260px|Woman riding a Cruzbike Sofrider (PBFWD recumbent) near the end of the {{convert|500|mi|km|-1|adj=on}} \"Ride Across North Carolina\" 2007]]\nRecumbents can be categorized by their wheelbase, wheel sizes, steering system, faired or unfaired, and front-wheel or rear-wheel drive.\n\n===Wheelbase===\n[[File:LWB Lowrider Recumbent.jpg|thumb|240px|Long-wheel-base low-rider recumbent with steering u-joint (UA)]]\nLong-wheelbase (LWB) models have the pedals located between the front and rear wheels; short-wheelbase (SWB) models have the pedals in front of the front wheel; compact long-wheelbase (CLWB) models have the pedals either very close to the front wheel or above it. Within these categories are variations, intermediate types, and even [[convertible]] designs (LWB to CLWB) \u2013 there is no \"standard\" recumbent.\n\n===Wheel sizes===\nThe rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size, from around {{convert|16|in|mm}} to the 700c (or 27\" on some older models, as on upright road bikes of that time) of an upright racing cycle. The front wheel is commonly smaller than the rear, although a number of recumbents feature dual 26-inch (ISO 559), ISO 571 (650c), ISO 622 (700c), or even 29 x 4\" oversize all-terrain tires. Given the higher rolling resistance of the smaller front wheel, loss of steering and control are somewhat more likely attempting sharp or quick changes of direction while crossing over patches of loose dirt, sand or pebbles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pedallers.com/are-recumbent-bikes-any-good/ |title = Are Recumbent Bikes Any Good? |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=10 April 2020|work=Pedallers}}</ref> Larger diameter wheels generally have lower [[rolling resistance]] but a higher profile leading to higher air resistance.

Another advantage of both wheels being the same size is that the bike requires only one size of inner tube.\n\nOne common arrangement is an ISO 559 (26-inch) rear wheel and an ISO 406 or ISO 451 (20-inch) front wheel. The small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other, avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called \"heel strike\" (where the rider's heels catch the wheel in tight turns). A pivoting-boom front-wheel drive (PBFWD aka Moving Bottom Bracket recumbent) configuration also overcomes heel strike since the pedals and front wheel turn together. PBFWD bikes may have dual {{convert|26|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels or larger.\n\n[[File:Under seat steering.JPG|thumb|300px|Handlebar setup for under-seat steering (USS)]]\n\n===Steering===<!-- This section is linked from [[Bicycle]] -->\n[[File:0x-flevo-1.jpg|thumb|260px|right|A Flevobike showing pivot steering (and FWD)]]\nSteering for recumbent bikes can be generally categorized as\n* over-seat (OSS) or above seat steering (ASS);\n* under-seat (USS); or\n* center steering or pivot steering.\nOSS/ASS is generally direct\u2014the steerer acts on the front fork like a standard [[bicycle handlebar]]\u2014but the bars themselves may extend well behind the front wheel (more like a [[tiller]]); alternatively the bars might have long rearward extensions (sometimes known as Superman or Kingcycle bars).

They can provide good maneuverability at low speeds, but have been reported to be potentially unstable at speeds above {{convert|25|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best Tricycle for Kids|url=http://www.kidsfashionstyles.com/best-tricycle-kids/|publisher=Sidewinder|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Drive===\nMost recumbents have the cranks attached to a boom fixed to the frame, with a long drive chain for rear wheel drive. However, due to the proximity of the crank to the front wheel, front wheel drive (FWD) can be an option, and it allows for a much shorter chain. One style requires the chain to twist slightly to allow for steering.<ref name=\"Toxy\">{{cite web\n| url = https://recumbentbikelab.com/\n| title = Recumbent Exercise Bike Resources\n| accessdate = 24 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CruzbikeSilvio 2009.jpg|thumb|260px|Cruzbike Silvio (2009) A moving (pivoting) bottom bracket, front wheel-drive, 700C road bike (with rear rack).]]\nAnother style, Pivoting-boom FWD (PBFWD), has the crankset connected to and moving with the front fork.<ref name=\"traylor\">{{cite web\n| url = http://traylorfwd.home.mindspring.com/fwd.html\n | title = Front Wheel Drive \u2013 Is it practical?\n| accessdate = 22 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061022094132/http://traylorfwd.home.mindspring.com/fwd.html |archivedate = 22 October 2006}}</ref>\nIn addition to the much shorter chain, the advantages to PBFWD are use of a larger front wheel for lower rolling resistance without heel strike (you can pedal while turning) and use of the upper body when sprinting or climbing. The main disadvantage to all FWD designs is \"wheelspin\" when climbing steep hills covered with loose gravel, wet grass, etc. This mainly affects off-road riders, and can be ameliorated by shifting the weight forward, applying steady pressure to the pedals, and using [[Bicycle tire|tires]] with more aggressive tread. Another disadvantage of PBFWD for some riders is a slightly longer \"learning curve\" due to adaptation to the pedal-steer effect (forces applied to the pedal can actually steer the bike). Beginner riders tend to swerve along a serpentine path until they adapt a balanced pedal motion. After adaptation, a PBFWD recumbent can be ridden in as straight a line as any other bike, and can even be steered accurately with the feet only. [[Cruzbike]] is the only PBFWD recumbent currently in production, and features a traditional steering axis similar to most standard and recumbent bikes. Flevobike formerly produced a center-steered FWD bike similar to the [[Python Lowracer]].\n\nYet another drive-train variation is on [[rowing cycles]] where the rider rows using arms and legs.\n\n===Fully suspended bikes===\nModern recumbent bikes are increasingly being fitted with front and rear suspension systems for increased comfort and traction on rough surfaces. Coil, elastomer, and air-sprung suspension systems have all been used on recumbent bikes, with oil or air-damping in the forks and rear shock absorbers. The maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided the development of these designs, which often use many of the same parts, suitably modified for recumbent use.\n\n[[File:Nzleitras.jpg|thumbnail|Leitra Velomobiles]]\n\n===Fairings===\n{{Main|Bicycle fairing}}\n\nSome riders fit their bikes with [[aerodynamic]] devices called [[Bicycle fairing|fairing]]s. These can reduce aerodynamic drag<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hostelshoppe.com/atp_archives/mit_windtunnel.pdf\n| title = Aerodynamic Performance of VISION recumbents\n| author = Grant Bower\n| publisher = Advanced Transportation Products\n| year = 1999\n| accessdate = 1 October 2010}}</ref> and help keep the rider warmer and drier in cold and wet weather. Fairings are also available for upright bikes, but are much less common.  Fully enclosed bikes and trikes are considered [[velomobile]]s.\n\n===Seats===\nThe [[Bicycle seat|seats]] themselves are either of mesh stretched tightly over a frame (as in the Gold Rush pictured) or foam cushions over hard shells like the Stinger pictured, which might be moulded (as here) or assembled from sheet materials. Hard-shell seats predominate in Europe, mesh seats in the USA.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Challenge Hurricane recumbent.jpg|thumb|300px|Challenge Hurricane: a ''mid-racer''.]]\n\n===Mountain bike recumbents===\nWith the right equipment and design, recumbent bikes can be used for riding unpaved roads and offroad, just as with conventional mountain bikes. Because of their longer wheelbase and the manner in which the rider is confined to the seat, recumbents are not as easy to use on tight, curving unpaved singletrack. Large-diameter wheels, mountain gearing and off-road specific design have been used since 1999. [[Crank forward|Crank-forward]] designs that facilitate climbing out of the saddle, such as the RANS Dynamik, also can be used off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bikeroute.com/Recumbents/News/Archives/2007_11.html|title=Recumbent News: November 2007 Archives|website=www.bikeroute.com}}</ref>\n\n===Lowracers===\nLowracers are a type of recumbent more common in Europe among racing enthusiasts. These typically have two 20\" wheels or a 26\" wheel at the rear and 20\" wheel at the front. The seat is positioned between the wheels rather than above them. The extreme reclined position, and the fact that the rider is sitting in line with the wheels rather than atop them, makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents.\n\n===Highracers===\nHighracers are distinguished by using two large wheels (usually ISO 559, 650c or 700c). This necessitates a higher bottom bracket than on a lowracer so that the rider's legs are above the front wheel, and this in turn requires a higher seat. The seating position may be otherwise identical to that on a lowracer allowing similar aerodynamics. \"Racer\" in the name implies that this will often be the case, since these bikes strive for speed.\n\nHighracers are generally more maneuverable than lowracers since their higher center of mass make them easier to balance at lower speeds.<ref name = Fajans/> Given the same seating position they may be faster than lowracers, since it is widely believed that rolling resistance is inversely proportional to wheel diameter.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/bicycle-tires-puncturing-the-myths-29245/\n| title = Bicycle tires \u2013 puncturing the myths\n| author = James Huang\n| date = 12 February 2011\n| publisher = BikeRadar\n| quote = Larger diameter wheels roll faster than smaller ones: Yep, it's now been confirmed in the lab \u2013 29er mountain bikes roll faster than 26ers. Wheel Energy say the effect here is similar to that of tire width, in that larger-diameter tires exhibit less casing deflection and thus less energy loss.\n| accessdate = 4 October 2012}}</ref> However, lowracer proponents reply that their design is faster due to aerodynamics. The reasoning is that the riders body is in line with the wheels, reducing drag.\n\nHip and elbow injuries are more common on highracers than on lowracers due to the greater height from which the rider can fall. However, the injuries are very rare and seldom serious.\n\n===Semi-recumbent and crank forward bicycles===\nBicycles that use positions intermediate between a conventional upright and a recumbent are called semi-recumbent or [[crank forward]] designs. These generally are intended for casual use and have comfort and ease of use as primary objectives, with aerodynamics sacrificed for this purpose.\n\n===Tandem recumbents===\n[[File:Barcroft Columbia.jpg|thumb|300px|This Barcroft Columbia is an example of how a tandem recumbent can be fitted within a compact layout for easy transport.]]\nJust as with upright [[bicycle]]s, recumbents are built and marketed with more than one seat, thus combining the advantages of recumbents with those of [[tandem bicycle]]s. In order to keep the [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Wheelbase|wheelbase]] from being any longer than absolutely necessary, tandem recumbents often place the stoker's [[crankset]] under the captain's [[Bicycle seat|seat]]. A common configuration for two riders in the recumbent position is the [[sociable]] tandem, wherein the two riders ride side by side. There are also hybrid recumbent designs such as the [http://www.recumbent-cycle.com/en/recumbent-bike/41-hase-pinoallround Hase Pino Allround] that utilize a recumbent stoker in the front, and an upright pilot in the rear.\n\n=== Recumbent tricycles ===\n[[File:Faireds1.jpg|thumb|300px|A tadpole recumbent tricycle made by [[Inspired Cycle Engineering]] with a transparent front fairing]]\n[[File:hand & foot recumbent trike2.jpg|thumb|260px|Hand and foot recumbent tricycle]]\n[[File:Quattrocycle with canopy.jpg|thumb|260px|right|A modern touring 4-wheel recumbent quadracycle \u2013 a 2011 model Quattrocycle four seater with canopy<ref name=\"Quattro\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.quattrocycle.com/|title = Quattrocycle|accessdate = 30 June 2009|last = Quattrocycle BV|authorlink = |year = 2008}}</ref>]]\n\nRecumbent [[tricycle]]s (trikes) are closely related to recumbent bicycles, but have three wheels instead of two.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Handcycle.jpg|thumb|300px|A competition handcycle]] -->\n\n====Handcycles====\n{{Main|Handcycles}}\nIn order to accommodate [[paraplegics]] and other individuals with little or no use of their legs, many manufacturers have designed and released hand-powered recumbent trikes, or handcycles. Handcycles are a regular sight at [[Human-powered transport|HPV]] meetings and are beginning to be seen on the streets. They usually follow a delta design with front wheels driven by standard d\u00e9railleur gearing powered by hand cranks. Brake levers are usually mounted on the hand holds, which are usually set with no offset rather than the 180\u00b0 of pedal cranks. The entire crank assembly and the front wheel turn together, allowing the rider to steer and crank simultaneously.\n\nAlthough arms are weaker than legs, many hand cyclists are able to make use of the power of the whole upper body. A good hand cyclist can still achieve a respectable pace in competitions. Handcycles have also been used for touring, though few designers incorporate mudguards or luggage racks. Also, the gear ratios of standard handcycles tend to be less useful for long steep climbs.\n\n==== Hand-and-foot recumbent tricycles ====\nRecumbent cycles offer the possibility of combined hand and foot power inputs, and thus the potential for a full-body workout, and the option for persons with a weak or missing leg(s) to power a cycle.

Like a regular stationary exercise bike, these stay in one place and the user pedals against some kind of resistance mechanism such as a fan or alternator but in a recumbent position. These have the same comfort advantages as road-going recumbents. Stationary recumbents almost always have a fairly upright seat and the pedal crank is lower than the level of the seat. The seat is normally adjustable and is adjusted by sliding it along a rail.<ref>http://www.inhomecyclist.com</ref>\n\n==Compared to uprights==\n\nThere are striking differences between recumbents and upright bikes. Since recumbents vary widely, the advantages and disadvantages listed below may apply to different types to different degrees or not at all. (For example, balance is not a concern with tricycles.)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Issue\n!Recumbent Bike\n!Recumbent Trike\n!Upright Bicycle\n!Description\n|-\n| style=\"background: #E0E0E0\" | '''Safety/Comfort'''\n|-\n|Falls\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|\n| In a fall, the rider's shorter distance from the ground reduces the vertical component of the impact velocity. Unless complete somersaulting or rolling occurs, impacts are primarily to the lower body rather than to the head, due to the feet-first orientation.

On tricycles, the inherent stability of three wheels allows very low gearing to be used, so hills can be climbed without strain on joints. Also, on some recumbents, the rider's legs are nearly at the same height as the heart. This reduces the rider's [[hydrostatic pressure]], thus allowing [[venous]] [[blood]] to more easily return to the [[heart]]. This physiological effect of improved [[Circulatory system|circulation]] suggests an increase in rider endurance and/or increased power output on long rides. Recumbent riders are not bent over as are conventional bike riders, and this makes breathing easier.\n\nThe recumbent riding position reduces strain on the body, making it particularly suitable for long rides and touring.<ref name=\"med\">{{cite web\n|title = Medical Benefits of Recumbent Bicycles\n|last = Nolan, M.D.\n|first = Paul\n|url= http://www.bikeroute.com/Recumbents/BentMedBenefits.php\n|accessdate= 5 July 2008\n}}\n</ref> Depending on the angle of the seat, it can be very easy on the neck,<ref name=\"med\"/><ref name=\"dot\">\n{{Cite journal\n|title = Characteristics of emerging road users and their safety\n|publisher = US Department of Transportation\n<!--|url = http://www.tfhrc.gov/safety/pubs/04103/04103.pdf old, dead link-->\n|url = http://www.segway.com/media/1263/04103.pdf\n|year=2004\n|id=Publication No. FHWA-HRT-04-103\n|last1 = Landis |first1=Bruce\n|last2 = Petritsch |first2=Theodore\n|last3 = Huang |first3=Herman\n|postscript = <!--None-->\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite web\n| url = http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ra-e.html#recumbent\n| title = Sheldon Brown's Bicycle Glossary: Recumbent\n| accessdate = 12 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| first = Gretchen\n| last = Konrady\n| publisher = Gretchen Konrady (originally Group Health Cooperative)\n| title = Best Tricycle for Kids\n| url = http://www.kidsfashionstyles.com/best-tricycle-kids/\n| accessdate = 13 September 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"wilson\">{{cite book\n| title = Bicycling Science\n| edition = Third\n| last = Wilson\n| first = David Gordon\n| coauthors = \n| year = 2004\n| publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n| isbn = 0-262-73154-1\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546/page/72 72,86,446]\n| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546/page/72\n}}</ref> wrists,<ref name=\"dot\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/> hands,<ref name=\"Brown\"/> arms, shoulders, lower back, and [[ischial tuberosity|ischial tuberosities]] (\"sit bones\"). \n|-\n|Seat pain/impotence\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|\n|Studies indicate that upright bicycle riding may be a cause of male [[impotence]] due to pressure placed on the perineal nerve by the seat;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/04/health/nutrition/04bike.html?pagewanted=all Serious Riders, Your Bicycle Seat May Affect Your Love Life] New York Times 4 October 2005</ref><ref>Breda, G.

Urogenital trouble is less because the pedals are not under the seat, thus the seat can be larger so weight can be distributed to a larger area and to the seat back. Shorts made for recumbent riders do not have padding or any need for it.\n|-\n| \"Leg suck\"\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n| A type of injury characteristic of recumbents trikes called \"leg suck\" occurs when a foot touches the ground while at speed and the trike runs forward over the foot, causing ligament damage and, in some cases, ankle fractures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The use of clipless pedals reduces this possibility by preventing the foot from slipping off the pedal. But with clipless pedals, remaining clipped in during a front tire or wheel failure at high speeds can result in a bicycle rolling over the rider and taking a clipped in leg or legs with it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This scenario, although very rare, can create severe spiral fractures of the [[femur]] rarely seen with upright bicycles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n|-\n|Constant position\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n| While the riding position is comfortable and removes stress from the arms, it cannot easily be varied during a ride (as upright riders might stand for a hill), and some find that bottom brackets at or near hip level produces problems with cold or numb feet. Some riders suffer \"recumbent butt,\" a pain in the [[gluteal]] muscles caused by their increased effort while being compressed. This can usually be addressed by adjusting the seat angle and pedal position. In a more reclined position, the weight is spread evenly between the back and buttocks. The rider of a conventional bike can stand up on the pedals to allow his legs to take up the shock of a severe bump in the road. The recumbent rider cannot (although bracing against the back rest can reduce the shock of a bump).\n|-\n|Visibility of traffic\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|In some designs \u2013 notably low-racers and most trikes \u2013 the rider is significantly lower than on a conventional bicycle and so visibility can often be obscured by fences, parked cars, etc. It is also a bit more difficult to glance back, which can be addressed by adding mirrors to helmet, handlebars or eyeglasses.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.icebike.org/what-you-need-to-know-about-cycling-mirrors/ |title=What You Need to Know About Cycling Mirrors |first=John |last=Andersen |website=icebike.org |accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|Visibility of the cyclist\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|In urban traffic, many recumbent bikes and trikes are below the eye level of many automobile drivers, although proponents{{who|date=December 2012}} have experienced that the relative novelty of the design helps make drivers more conscious of them. Recumbent commuters often add flags, lighting, and reflective material to their bikes and gear to enhance visibility, and many refer to being able to see eye-to-eye with the automobile drivers as an advantage.<ref name=\"Comparison Table\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.biketcba.org/TRICORR/compare.html\n| title = Upright vs Recumbent Comparison Table\n| accessdate = 21 April 2007}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"background: #E0E0E0\" | '''Riding Experience'''\n|-\n|View Angles\n|style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|\n| The recumbent riding position, if not too aggressively reclined, can enable the rider to face straight ahead comfortably and view the passing scenery. Many upright bikes, particularly those used in [[Bicycle racing|competition]], on the other hand, have a riding position in which the natural position is to face more downwards towards the pavement; in order to face straight ahead, the neck must be craned upward.\n|-\n|Balance\n|\n|style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|\n| Compared with riders of conventional bikes, two-wheeled recumbent riders may have less scope for shifting their weight to steer or help balance the bicycle. As a consequence, riding at low speed and tight maneuvers can be more challenging on a recumbent.  At a minimum, it will require some retraining. Recumbent tricycles, having three wheels, are inherently stable.\n|-\n|Uphills\n|\n|\n|\n| A much debated disadvantage of the recumbent position is the effort required to ride up hills. This is most noticeable during the initial period of riding a recumbent when the legs are not yet trained for the different muscle requirements. On a traditional bicycle, the rider can stand on the pedals and pull against the handlebars, although on a recumbent the rider can push against the seat. On either style, higher [[cadence (cycling)|cadence]] reduces leg strain and fatigue when climbing. Recumbent tricycles are a special case, as riders can climb almost any gradient of hill (subject to tire traction) with appropriate gearing since balance (and hence speed) is not a consideration. A few designers have attempted to build bikes which convert from recumbent to upright for climbs.<ref>{{Cite patent\n| inventor-last = van Pelt\n| inventor-first = James L\n| issue-date = 2002-12-24\n| title = Convertible bicycle\n| country-code = US\n| description = ... a bicycle that can be quickly and easily configured in an upright position, a recumbent position, and a tandem position.\n| patent-number = 6497426\n| postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref> In practice, the biggest difference is probably the additional weight of the recumbent layout combined with the difficulty of balancing a bike with a low center of mass at speeds below about {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n|-\n|Turns\n|\n|\n| \n| Long wheelbase recumbents have a larger turning radius and combined with the greater difficulties of balance, tight and low-speed maneuvers can be difficult. Overlap of heels with the front wheel during tight turns with some short-wheelbase (SWB) and some compact long-wheelbase (CLWB) design is known as \"heel strike.\" This is only evident during tight turns and can be avoided by lifting the heel or pausing pedaling. It is similar in many respects to \"toe strike\" in upright designs, which is similarly dependent upon design, implementation, size of feet and their position on the pedal, and the presence or otherwise of fenders/mudguards.\n|-\n|Obstacles\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|It is difficult to jerk the front wheel(s) of recumbents onto curbs or over other obstacles. Since the front wheel of a recumbent bike is often small, driving up onto full height curbs can be very risky even with suspension.\n|-\n|Speed\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n| \n| \n| On declines, on the flat, or on shallow inclines, the more horizontal recumbent bicycle designs are generally faster than upright bicycles for the same level of effort because the [[aerodynamic]] profile of the rider reduces [[wind resistance]].<ref>Gross, A.C.

At the low end, the vast majority of upright bikes retail for less than the cost of the cheapest new recumbent.\n|-\n|Length/width of frame\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|Some recumbent bicycle designs use longer frames than conventional bicycles.  This generally results in a weight penalty and in more flexing of the frame, which causes a loss of power.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  The chain (on rear wheel drive models) is two to three times as long as an upright and usually requires one or more idler pulleys.  There is a small amount of friction in such pulleys, which also reduces power slightly.  Longer or wider frame designs are more difficult to transport if the bikes are shipped, or put on racks on automobiles.  Trikes may be difficult to fit through doorways.  Some manufacturers offer folding or break-apart designs, but these tend to be expensive.  The longer distance from the handlebars to the wheels can be problematic for speedometers and cyclocomputers, including both wireless and hard-wired models.  The distance from the handlebars to the crankset is likewise longer than a conventional bike and can give problems for cadence sensors.\n|-\n|Nonstandard design\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|Recumbents often have radically different shapes from diamond-frame bikes, so conventional bike racks, automobile carriers, accessories, and locks do not fit in the usual ways. Additionally, the designs are difficult to mount in traditional bicycle work stands and often require a second person during derailleur adjustments to spin cranks that are too far from the shift controls and derailleur locations. Some bicycle mechanics may be reluctant to work on \"nonstandard\" bicycle designs.\n|}\n\n==History==\nRecumbent bicycle designs date back to the middle of the 19th century. Several designs were patented around 1900, but these early designs were unsuccessful.\n\n===Early recumbents===\n[[File:Liegeraeder 1920er Velorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Recumbents from the 1920s in the [[Velorama]]]]\nRecumbent designs of both prone and supine varieties can be traced back to the earliest days of the bicycle. Before the shape of the bicycle settled down following [[John Kemp Starley|Starley]]'s [[safety bicycle]], there was a good deal of experimentation with various arrangements, and this included designs which might be considered recumbent. Although these dated back to the 1860s the first recorded illustration of a recumbent considered as a separate class of bicycle is considered to be in the magazine ''[[Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter]]'' of 10 September 1893. This year also saw what is considered the first genuine recumbent, the Fautenil V\u00e9lociped. Patent applications for a number of recumbent designs exist in the late years of the 19th century, and there were discussions in the cycling press of the relative merits of different layouts. The Challand designs of 1897 and the American Brown of 1901 are both recognisable as forerunners of today's recumbents.\n\n===The Mochet 'V\u00e9lo-Velocar' and 'V\u00e9lorizontal'.===\n[[File:1945MochetVelocar.jpg|thumb|1945 Mochet Velocar]]\nA four-wheeled, two-seater, pedal-propelled car called the '[[Velocar]]' was built in the 1930s by [[France|French]] inventor and light car builder [[Charles Mochet]]. Velocars sold well to French buyers who could not afford a motor car, possibly because of a poor [[economy]] during the [[Great Depression]]. The four-wheeled Velocars were fast but didn't corner well at high speed. Mochet then experimented with a three-wheel design and finally a mould-breaking two-wheel design based on the V\u00e9locar technology.\n\nThe early models of Mochet's 'La bicyclette de l'Avenir' (The bicycle of the Future), the 'V\u00e9lo-V\u00e9locar', or 'V-V' as the factory referred to them, used a 40mm steel-tube, single-beam frame and 450 x 55 wheels with handlebars over the rider and steering torque transmitted by [[bevel gear]]s. Various types of Mochet-designed derailleur gears were fitted, with a single gear for the track models. Gears were mid-mounted using primary and secondary chains. The back-rest was adjustable on more sporting models.\n\nTo demonstrate the speed of his recumbent bicycle, Mochet had the design ratified by the UCI and UVF and enlisted cyclist [[Francis Faure]], a Category 2 racer, to ride it in races. Faure was highly successful, defeating many of Europe's top cyclists both on the track and in road races, and setting new world records at short distances. Another cyclist, Paul Morand, won the Paris-Limoges race in 1933 on one of Mochet's recumbents.\n\nOn 7 July 1933, at a Paris [[velodrome]], Faure rode a modified V\u00e9lo-Velocar {{convert|45.055|km|mi|abbr=on}} in one hour, beating an almost 20-year-old [[hour record]] held by [[Oscar Egg]], and attracting a great deal of attention.\n\nWhen the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI) met in February 1934, manufacturers of 'upright' bicycles lobbied to have Faure's one-hour record declared invalid. On 1 April 1934, the UCI published a new definition of a racing bicycle that specified how high the bottom bracket could be above the ground, how far it could be in front of the seat and how close it could be to the front wheel. The new definition effectively banned recumbents from UCI events for a combination of tradition, safety, and economic reasons.<ref name=\"nelson\"/>\n\nCharles Mochet died a short time after the ban was enacted, still protesting against the UCI decision, and the firm continued to make recumbents under his widow and, later, Georges Mochet until at least 1941 for a limited number of customers. Their final versions were a single-chain design named the 'V\u00e9lorizontal', the final model using a 'Cyclo' four-speed gear.\n\nAfter the UCI decision, Faure continued to race, and consistently beat upright bicycles with the Velocar. In 1938, Faure and Mochet's son, Georges, began adding fairings to the Velocar in hopes of bettering the world record of one hour for a bicycle with aerodynamic components. On 5 March 1938, Faure rode a faired Velocar 50.537 kilometers in an hour and became the first cyclist to travel more than 50 kilometers in an hour without the aid of a [[derny|pace vehicle]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe UCI ban on recumbent bicycles and other aerodynamic improvements virtually stopped development of recumbents for four decades and remains in force.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Although recumbent designs continued to crop up over the years they were mainly the work of lone enthusiasts and numbers remained insignificant until the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Georges Mochet died in 2008.\n\n===1970s resurgence and the IHPVA===\nWhile developments had been made in this fallow period by Paul Rinkowski and others, the modern recumbent movement was given a boost in 1969 when the ''Ground Hugger'' by Robert Riley was featured in [[Popular Mechanics]].<ref name=LightHist>{{cite web|title=History of the Modern Recumbent|url=https://www.lightningbikes.com/riders/martin-krieg/recumbent-history/index.html|publisher=Lightning Bikes|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref> There was also the work of [[Chester Kyle]] and particularly [[David Gordon Wilson]] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], two Americans who opposed the UCI restrictions and continued to work on fairings and recumbents. In 1974, they also nucleated the International Human Power speed Championship in [[Long Beach, California]], from which the [[IHPVA]] grew. Kyle and his students had been experimenting with fairings for upright bicycles, also banned by the UCI.  In 1975 the brothers John and Randy Schlitter started producing recumbents at their company, [[Rans Designs|Rans]], and became the first U.S. company to do so.<ref name=LightHist />\n\nIn 1978, the \"V\u00e9l\u00e9rique\" is the very first commercialized recumbent bicycle (fully faired), by the Belgian Erik Abergen.\n\nThe Avatar 2000, a LWB bike very much like the current Easy Racers products, arrived in 1979. It was [http://ryanownersclub.com/scrapbook/avatar/brainstorm/ featured] in the [[Brainstorm (1983 film)|1983 film Brainstorm]], ridden by Christopher Walken, and in the popular cycling reference ''Richard's Bicycle Book'' by [[Richard Ballantine]].

For about ten years afterward, speed records were exchanged between Easy Racers with Freddy Markham in the cockpit and the Lightning Team. So America's strength became the flying 200 meter sprint in the streamliner division. The oil crises of the 1970s sparked a resurgence in cycling coincident with the arrival of these \"new\" designs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nA parallel but somewhat separate scene grew up in Europe, with the first European human power championships being held in 1983. The European scene was more dominated by competition than was the US, with the result that European bikes are more likely to be low SWB machines, while LWB are much more popular in the US (although there have been some notable European LWB bikes, such as the Peer Gynt).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n=== In the 1980s ===\n\nIn 1984, Linear Recumbents of Iowa began producing bicycles. In 2002, Linear Manufacturing's assets were bought by Bicycle Man LLC and moved to New York.

Most recumbent riders choose this type of design for [[ergonomic]] reasons: the rider's weight is distributed comfortably over a larger area, supported by back and buttocks. On a traditional [[upright bicycle]], the body weight rests entirely on a small portion of the [[Tuberosity of the ischium|sitting bones]], the feet, and the hands.\n\nMost recumbent models also have an [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] advantage; the reclined, legs-forward position of the rider's body presents a smaller frontal profile. A recumbent holds the world speed record for a bicycle,<ref>{{cite news|title=Dutch cyclist claims new world speed record in Nevada|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-24133410|accessdate=11 May 2014|newspaper=BBC}}</ref> and they were banned from racing under the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI) in 1934,<ref name=\"nelson\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.helsinki.fi/~tlinden/winforb.html\n| title = The History of the Recumbent Bicycle: Winning Forbidden\n| accessdate = 28 August 2008}}</ref> and now race under the banner of the [[World Human Powered Vehicle Association]] (WHPVA) and [[International Human Powered Vehicle Association]] (IHPVA).\n\nRecumbents are available in a wide range of configurations, including: long to short wheelbase; large, small, or a mix of wheel sizes; overseat, underseat, or no-hands steering; and rear wheel or front wheel drive. A variant with three wheels is a recumbent [[tricycle]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:CNC Cruzbike 2007.jpg|thumb|260px|Woman riding a Cruzbike Sofrider (PBFWD recumbent) near the end of the {{convert|500|mi|km|-1|adj=on}} \"Ride Across North Carolina\" 2007]]\nRecumbents can be categorized by their wheelbase, wheel sizes, steering system, faired or unfaired, and front-wheel or rear-wheel drive.\n\n===Wheelbase===\n[[File:LWB Lowrider Recumbent.jpg|thumb|240px|Long-wheel-base low-rider recumbent with steering u-joint (UA)]]\nLong-wheelbase (LWB) models have the pedals located between the front and rear wheels; short-wheelbase (SWB) models have the pedals in front of the front wheel; compact long-wheelbase (CLWB) models have the pedals either very close to the front wheel or above it. Within these categories are variations, intermediate types, and even [[convertible]] designs (LWB to CLWB) \u2013 there is no \"standard\" recumbent.\n\n===Wheel sizes===\nThe rear wheel of a recumbent is usually behind the rider and may be any size, from around {{convert|16|in|mm}} to the 700c (or 27\" on some older models, as on upright road bikes of that time) of an upright racing cycle. The front wheel is commonly smaller than the rear, although a number of recumbents feature dual 26-inch (ISO 559), ISO 571 (650c), ISO 622 (700c), or even 29 x 4\" oversize all-terrain tires. Given the higher rolling resistance of the smaller front wheel, loss of steering and control are somewhat more likely attempting sharp or quick changes of direction while crossing over patches of loose dirt, sand or pebbles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pedallers.com/are-recumbent-bikes-any-good/ |title = Are Recumbent Bikes Any Good? |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=10 April 2020|work=Pedallers}}</ref> Larger diameter wheels generally have lower [[rolling resistance]] but a higher profile leading to higher air resistance.

Another advantage of both wheels being the same size is that the bike requires only one size of inner tube.\n\nOne common arrangement is an ISO 559 (26-inch) rear wheel and an ISO 406 or ISO 451 (20-inch) front wheel. The small front wheel and large rear wheel combination is used to keep the pedals and front wheel clear of each other, avoiding the problem on a short wheelbase recumbent called \"heel strike\" (where the rider's heels catch the wheel in tight turns). A pivoting-boom front-wheel drive (PBFWD aka Moving Bottom Bracket recumbent) configuration also overcomes heel strike since the pedals and front wheel turn together. PBFWD bikes may have dual {{convert|26|in|mm|adj=on}} wheels or larger.\n\n[[File:Under seat steering.JPG|thumb|300px|Handlebar setup for under-seat steering (USS)]]\n\n===Steering===<!-- This section is linked from [[Bicycle]] -->\n[[File:0x-flevo-1.jpg|thumb|260px|right|A Flevobike showing pivot steering (and FWD)]]\nSteering for recumbent bikes can be generally categorized as\n* over-seat (OSS) or above seat steering (ASS);\n* under-seat (USS); or\n* center steering or pivot steering.\nOSS/ASS is generally direct\u2014the steerer acts on the front fork like a standard [[bicycle handlebar]]\u2014but the bars themselves may extend well behind the front wheel (more like a [[tiller]]); alternatively the bars might have long rearward extensions (sometimes known as Superman or Kingcycle bars).

They can provide good maneuverability at low speeds, but have been reported to be potentially unstable at speeds above {{convert|25|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sidewinder trikes|url=http://www.sidewindercycle.com/|publisher=Sidewinder|accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Drive===\nMost recumbents have the cranks attached to a boom fixed to the frame, with a long drive chain for rear wheel drive. However, due to the proximity of the crank to the front wheel, front wheel drive (FWD) can be an option, and it allows for a much shorter chain. One style requires the chain to twist slightly to allow for steering.<ref name=\"Toxy\">{{cite web\n| url = https://recumbentbikelab.com/\n| title = Recumbent Exercise Bike Resources\n| accessdate = 24 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CruzbikeSilvio 2009.jpg|thumb|260px|Cruzbike Silvio (2009) A moving (pivoting) bottom bracket, front wheel-drive, 700C road bike (with rear rack).]]\nAnother style, Pivoting-boom FWD (PBFWD), has the crankset connected to and moving with the front fork.<ref name=\"traylor\">{{cite web\n| url = http://traylorfwd.home.mindspring.com/fwd.html\n | title = Front Wheel Drive \u2013 Is it practical?\n| accessdate = 22 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061022094132/http://traylorfwd.home.mindspring.com/fwd.html |archivedate = 22 October 2006}}</ref>\nIn addition to the much shorter chain, the advantages to PBFWD are use of a larger front wheel for lower rolling resistance without heel strike (you can pedal while turning) and use of the upper body when sprinting or climbing. The main disadvantage to all FWD designs is \"wheelspin\" when climbing steep hills covered with loose gravel, wet grass, etc. This mainly affects off-road riders, and can be ameliorated by shifting the weight forward, applying steady pressure to the pedals, and using [[Bicycle tire|tires]] with more aggressive tread. Another disadvantage of PBFWD for some riders is a slightly longer \"learning curve\" due to adaptation to the pedal-steer effect (forces applied to the pedal can actually steer the bike). Beginner riders tend to swerve along a serpentine path until they adapt a balanced pedal motion. After adaptation, a PBFWD recumbent can be ridden in as straight a line as any other bike, and can even be steered accurately with the feet only. [[Cruzbike]] is the only PBFWD recumbent currently in production, and features a traditional steering axis similar to most standard and recumbent bikes. Flevobike formerly produced a center-steered FWD bike similar to the [[Python Lowracer]].\n\nYet another drive-train variation is on [[rowing cycles]] where the rider rows using arms and legs.\n\n===Fully suspended bikes===\nModern recumbent bikes are increasingly being fitted with front and rear suspension systems for increased comfort and traction on rough surfaces. Coil, elastomer, and air-sprung suspension systems have all been used on recumbent bikes, with oil or air-damping in the forks and rear shock absorbers. The maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided the development of these designs, which often use many of the same parts, suitably modified for recumbent use.\n\n[[File:Nzleitras.jpg|thumbnail|Leitra Velomobiles]]\n\n===Fairings===\n{{Main|Bicycle fairing}}\n\nSome riders fit their bikes with [[aerodynamic]] devices called [[Bicycle fairing|fairing]]s. These can reduce aerodynamic drag<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hostelshoppe.com/atp_archives/mit_windtunnel.pdf\n| title = Aerodynamic Performance of VISION recumbents\n| author = Grant Bower\n| publisher = Advanced Transportation Products\n| year = 1999\n| accessdate = 1 October 2010}}</ref> and help keep the rider warmer and drier in cold and wet weather. Fairings are also available for upright bikes, but are much less common.  Fully enclosed bikes and trikes are considered [[velomobile]]s.\n\n===Seats===\nThe [[Bicycle seat|seats]] themselves are either of mesh stretched tightly over a frame (as in the Gold Rush pictured) or foam cushions over hard shells like the Stinger pictured, which might be moulded (as here) or assembled from sheet materials. Hard-shell seats predominate in Europe, mesh seats in the USA.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Challenge Hurricane recumbent.jpg|thumb|300px|Challenge Hurricane: a ''mid-racer''.]]\n\n===Mountain bike recumbents===\nWith the right equipment and design, recumbent bikes can be used for riding unpaved roads and offroad, just as with conventional mountain bikes. Because of their longer wheelbase and the manner in which the rider is confined to the seat, recumbents are not as easy to use on tight, curving unpaved singletrack. Large-diameter wheels, mountain gearing and off-road specific design have been used since 1999. [[Crank forward|Crank-forward]] designs that facilitate climbing out of the saddle, such as the RANS Dynamik, also can be used off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bikeroute.com/Recumbents/News/Archives/2007_11.html|title=Recumbent News: November 2007 Archives|website=www.bikeroute.com}}</ref>\n\n===Lowracers===\nLowracers are a type of recumbent more common in Europe among racing enthusiasts. These typically have two 20\" wheels or a 26\" wheel at the rear and 20\" wheel at the front. The seat is positioned between the wheels rather than above them. The extreme reclined position, and the fact that the rider is sitting in line with the wheels rather than atop them, makes this type the most aerodynamic of unfaired recumbents.\n\n===Highracers===\nHighracers are distinguished by using two large wheels (usually ISO 559, 650c or 700c). This necessitates a higher bottom bracket than on a lowracer so that the rider's legs are above the front wheel, and this in turn requires a higher seat. The seating position may be otherwise identical to that on a lowracer allowing similar aerodynamics. \"Racer\" in the name implies that this will often be the case, since these bikes strive for speed.\n\nHighracers are generally more maneuverable than lowracers since their higher center of mass make them easier to balance at lower speeds.<ref name = Fajans/> Given the same seating position they may be faster than lowracers, since it is widely believed that rolling resistance is inversely proportional to wheel diameter.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/bicycle-tires-puncturing-the-myths-29245/\n| title = Bicycle tires \u2013 puncturing the myths\n| author = James Huang\n| date = 12 February 2011\n| publisher = BikeRadar\n| quote = Larger diameter wheels roll faster than smaller ones: Yep, it's now been confirmed in the lab \u2013 29er mountain bikes roll faster than 26ers. Wheel Energy say the effect here is similar to that of tire width, in that larger-diameter tires exhibit less casing deflection and thus less energy loss.\n| accessdate = 4 October 2012}}</ref> However, lowracer proponents reply that their design is faster due to aerodynamics. The reasoning is that the riders body is in line with the wheels, reducing drag.\n\nHip and elbow injuries are more common on highracers than on lowracers due to the greater height from which the rider can fall. However, the injuries are very rare and seldom serious.\n\n===Semi-recumbent and crank forward bicycles===\nBicycles that use positions intermediate between a conventional upright and a recumbent are called semi-recumbent or [[crank forward]] designs. These generally are intended for casual use and have comfort and ease of use as primary objectives, with aerodynamics sacrificed for this purpose.\n\n===Tandem recumbents===\n[[File:Barcroft Columbia.jpg|thumb|300px|This Barcroft Columbia is an example of how a tandem recumbent can be fitted within a compact layout for easy transport.]]\nJust as with upright [[bicycle]]s, recumbents are built and marketed with more than one seat, thus combining the advantages of recumbents with those of [[tandem bicycle]]s. In order to keep the [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Wheelbase|wheelbase]] from being any longer than absolutely necessary, tandem recumbents often place the stoker's [[crankset]] under the captain's [[Bicycle seat|seat]]. A common configuration for two riders in the recumbent position is the [[sociable]] tandem, wherein the two riders ride side by side. There are also hybrid recumbent designs such as the [http://www.recumbent-cycle.com/en/recumbent-bike/41-hase-pinoallround Hase Pino Allround] that utilize a recumbent stoker in the front, and an upright pilot in the rear.\n\n=== Recumbent tricycles ===\n[[File:Faireds1.jpg|thumb|300px|A tadpole recumbent tricycle made by [[Inspired Cycle Engineering]] with a transparent front fairing]]\n[[File:hand & foot recumbent trike2.jpg|thumb|260px|Hand and foot recumbent tricycle]]\n[[File:Quattrocycle with canopy.jpg|thumb|260px|right|A modern touring 4-wheel recumbent quadracycle \u2013 a 2011 model Quattrocycle four seater with canopy<ref name=\"Quattro\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.quattrocycle.com/|title = Quattrocycle|accessdate = 30 June 2009|last = Quattrocycle BV|authorlink = |year = 2008}}</ref>]]\n\nRecumbent [[tricycle]]s (trikes) are closely related to recumbent bicycles, but have three wheels instead of two.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Handcycle.jpg|thumb|300px|A competition handcycle]] -->\n\n====Handcycles====\n{{Main|Handcycles}}\nIn order to accommodate [[paraplegics]] and other individuals with little or no use of their legs, many manufacturers have designed and released hand-powered recumbent trikes, or handcycles. Handcycles are a regular sight at [[Human-powered transport|HPV]] meetings and are beginning to be seen on the streets. They usually follow a delta design with front wheels driven by standard d\u00e9railleur gearing powered by hand cranks. Brake levers are usually mounted on the hand holds, which are usually set with no offset rather than the 180\u00b0 of pedal cranks. The entire crank assembly and the front wheel turn together, allowing the rider to steer and crank simultaneously.\n\nAlthough arms are weaker than legs, many hand cyclists are able to make use of the power of the whole upper body. A good hand cyclist can still achieve a respectable pace in competitions. Handcycles have also been used for touring, though few designers incorporate mudguards or luggage racks. Also, the gear ratios of standard handcycles tend to be less useful for long steep climbs.\n\n==== Hand-and-foot recumbent tricycles ====\nRecumbent cycles offer the possibility of combined hand and foot power inputs, and thus the potential for a full-body workout, and the option for persons with a weak or missing leg(s) to power a cycle. In one recumbent tricycle design the user makes the two front wheels change direction by shifting his center of weight, and moves forward by rotating the rear wheel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skywheel.kr/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025090056/http://www.skywheel.kr/ |archivedate=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There are also hybrids between a handcycle, a recumbent bike and a tricycle; these bikes enable cycling by use of legs, despite a spinal cord injury<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://berkelbike.co.uk/|title=BerkelBike \u2013 Cycle with your own muscles, in spite of your condition|website=BerkelBike}}</ref>\n\n=== Recumbent quadracycles ===\n{{main|Quadracycle}}\nRecumbent four-wheel cycles have the same general advantages of tricycles.<ref name=\"QuadStability\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibike.org/library/tech.htm#Quadracycles|title = Quadracycle Stability|accessdate = 29 May 2011|last = ibike.org|authorlink = |year = 2011}}</ref> For quadracycles with only one seat the stability improvements of the fourth wheel offer only a marginal advantage over a tadpole recumbent tricycle.

The frame designs may be as simple as a long steel tube bent into the appropriate shape, or as elaborate as hand-built carbon fiber frames.

These are often found in gyms but are also available for home use. Like a regular stationary exercise bike, these stay in one place and the user pedals against some kind of resistance mechanism such as a fan or alternator but in a recumbent position. These have the same comfort advantages as road-going recumbents. Stationary recumbents almost always have a fairly upright seat and the pedal crank is lower than the level of the seat.

Since recumbents vary widely, the advantages and disadvantages listed below may apply to different types to different degrees or not at all.

Unless complete somersaulting or rolling occurs, impacts are primarily to the lower body rather than to the head, due to the feet-first orientation.

On tricycles, the inherent stability of three wheels allows very low gearing to be used, so hills can be climbed without strain on joints. Also, on some recumbents, the rider's legs are nearly at the same height as the heart. This reduces the rider's [[hydrostatic pressure]], thus allowing [[venous]] [[blood]] to more easily return to the [[heart]]. This physiological effect of improved [[Circulatory system|circulation]] suggests an increase in rider endurance and/or increased power output on long rides. Recumbent riders are not bent over as are conventional bike riders, and this makes breathing easier.\n\nThe recumbent riding position reduces strain on the body, making it particularly suitable for long rides and touring.<ref name=\"med\">{{cite web\n|title = Medical Benefits of Recumbent Bicycles\n|last = Nolan, M.D.\n|first = Paul\n|url= http://www.bikeroute.com/Recumbents/BentMedBenefits.php\n|accessdate= 5 July 2008\n}}\n</ref> Depending on the angle of the seat, it can be very easy on the neck,<ref name=\"med\"/><ref name=\"dot\">\n{{Cite journal\n|title = Characteristics of emerging road users and their safety\n|publisher = US Department of Transportation\n<!--|url = http://www.tfhrc.gov/safety/pubs/04103/04103.pdf old, dead link-->\n|url = http://www.segway.com/media/1263/04103.pdf\n|year=2004\n|id=Publication No. FHWA-HRT-04-103\n|last1 = Landis |first1=Bruce\n|last2 = Petritsch |first2=Theodore\n|last3 = Huang |first3=Herman\n|postscript = <!--None-->\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite web\n| url = http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ra-e.html#recumbent\n| title = Sheldon Brown's Bicycle Glossary: Recumbent\n| accessdate = 12 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| first = Gretchen\n| last = Konrady\n| publisher = Gretchen Konrady (originally Group Health Cooperative)\n| title = Is the Recumbent Bicycle an Option?\n| url = http://www.gkonrady.com/content/writing-samples\n| accessdate = 13 September 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"wilson\">{{cite book\n| title = Bicycling Science\n| edition = Third\n| last = Wilson\n| first = David Gordon\n| coauthors = \n| year = 2004\n| publisher = Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n| isbn = 0-262-73154-1\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546/page/72 72,86,446]\n| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546/page/72\n}}</ref> wrists,<ref name=\"dot\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/> hands,<ref name=\"Brown\"/> arms, shoulders, lower back, and [[ischial tuberosity|ischial tuberosities]] (\"sit bones\"). \n|-\n|Seat pain/impotence\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|\n|Studies indicate that upright bicycle riding may be a cause of male [[impotence]] due to pressure placed on the perineal nerve by the seat;<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/04/health/nutrition/04bike.html?pagewanted=all Serious Riders, Your Bicycle Seat May Affect Your Love Life] New York Times 4 October 2005</ref><ref>Breda, G.

Urogenital trouble is less because the pedals are not under the seat, thus the seat can be larger so weight can be distributed to a larger area and to the seat back. Shorts made for recumbent riders do not have padding or any need for it.\n|-\n| \"Leg suck\"\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n| A type of injury characteristic of recumbents trikes called \"leg suck\" occurs when a foot touches the ground while at speed and the trike runs forward over the foot, causing ligament damage and, in some cases, ankle fractures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The use of clipless pedals reduces this possibility by preventing the foot from slipping off the pedal. But with clipless pedals, remaining clipped in during a front tire or wheel failure at high speeds can result in a bicycle rolling over the rider and taking a clipped in leg or legs with it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This scenario, although very rare, can create severe spiral fractures of the [[femur]] rarely seen with upright bicycles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n|-\n|Constant position\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n| While the riding position is comfortable and removes stress from the arms, it cannot easily be varied during a ride (as upright riders might stand for a hill), and some find that bottom brackets at or near hip level produces problems with cold or numb feet. Some riders suffer \"recumbent butt,\" a pain in the [[gluteal]] muscles caused by their increased effort while being compressed. This can usually be addressed by adjusting the seat angle and pedal position. In a more reclined position, the weight is spread evenly between the back and buttocks. The rider of a conventional bike can stand up on the pedals to allow his legs to take up the shock of a severe bump in the road. The recumbent rider cannot (although bracing against the back rest can reduce the shock of a bump).\n|-\n|Visibility of traffic\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|In some designs \u2013 notably low-racers and most trikes \u2013 the rider is significantly lower than on a conventional bicycle and so visibility can often be obscured by fences, parked cars, etc. It is also a bit more difficult to glance back, which can be addressed by adding mirrors to helmet, handlebars or eyeglasses.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.icebike.org/what-you-need-to-know-about-cycling-mirrors/ |title=What You Need to Know About Cycling Mirrors |first=John |last=Andersen |website=icebike.org |accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|Visibility of the cyclist\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|In urban traffic, many recumbent bikes and trikes are below the eye level of many automobile drivers, although proponents{{who|date=December 2012}} have experienced that the relative novelty of the design helps make drivers more conscious of them. Recumbent commuters often add flags, lighting, and reflective material to their bikes and gear to enhance visibility, and many refer to being able to see eye-to-eye with the automobile drivers as an advantage.<ref name=\"Comparison Table\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.biketcba.org/TRICORR/compare.html\n| title = Upright vs Recumbent Comparison Table\n| accessdate = 21 April 2007}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"background: #E0E0E0\" | '''Riding Experience'''\n|-\n|View Angles\n|style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|\n| The recumbent riding position, if not too aggressively reclined, can enable the rider to face straight ahead comfortably and view the passing scenery. Many upright bikes, particularly those used in [[Bicycle racing|competition]], on the other hand, have a riding position in which the natural position is to face more downwards towards the pavement; in order to face straight ahead, the neck must be craned upward.\n|-\n|Balance\n|\n|style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|\n| Compared with riders of conventional bikes, two-wheeled recumbent riders may have less scope for shifting their weight to steer or help balance the bicycle. As a consequence, riding at low speed and tight maneuvers can be more challenging on a recumbent.  At a minimum, it will require some retraining. Recumbent tricycles, having three wheels, are inherently stable.\n|-\n|Uphills\n|\n|\n|\n| A much debated disadvantage of the recumbent position is the effort required to ride up hills. This is most noticeable during the initial period of riding a recumbent when the legs are not yet trained for the different muscle requirements. On a traditional bicycle, the rider can stand on the pedals and pull against the handlebars, although on a recumbent the rider can push against the seat. On either style, higher [[cadence (cycling)|cadence]] reduces leg strain and fatigue when climbing. Recumbent tricycles are a special case, as riders can climb almost any gradient of hill (subject to tire traction) with appropriate gearing since balance (and hence speed) is not a consideration. A few designers have attempted to build bikes which convert from recumbent to upright for climbs.<ref>{{Cite patent\n| inventor-last = van Pelt\n| inventor-first = James L\n| issue-date = 2002-12-24\n| title = Convertible bicycle\n| country-code = US\n| description = ... a bicycle that can be quickly and easily configured in an upright position, a recumbent position, and a tandem position.\n| patent-number = 6497426\n| postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref> In practice, the biggest difference is probably the additional weight of the recumbent layout combined with the difficulty of balancing a bike with a low center of mass at speeds below about {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n|-\n|Turns\n|\n|\n| \n| Long wheelbase recumbents have a larger turning radius and combined with the greater difficulties of balance, tight and low-speed maneuvers can be difficult. Overlap of heels with the front wheel during tight turns with some short-wheelbase (SWB) and some compact long-wheelbase (CLWB) design is known as \"heel strike.\" This is only evident during tight turns and can be avoided by lifting the heel or pausing pedaling. It is similar in many respects to \"toe strike\" in upright designs, which is similarly dependent upon design, implementation, size of feet and their position on the pedal, and the presence or otherwise of fenders/mudguards.\n|-\n|Obstacles\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|It is difficult to jerk the front wheel(s) of recumbents onto curbs or over other obstacles. Since the front wheel of a recumbent bike is often small, driving up onto full height curbs can be very risky even with suspension.\n|-\n|Speed\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n| \n| \n| On declines, on the flat, or on shallow inclines, the more horizontal recumbent bicycle designs are generally faster than upright bicycles for the same level of effort because the [[aerodynamic]] profile of the rider reduces [[wind resistance]].<ref>Gross, A.C.

On a trike there is no reason to even unclip the pedals at a stop.\n|- style=\"background: #E0E0E0\" \n| '''Practicality'''\n|-\n|Price\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n| Recumbents are generally 50 \u2013 100% more expensive than upright bikes of equivalent quality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recumbent Primer (pp.15-16)|url=http://www.adventurecycling.org/default/assets/resources/20130701_RecumbentPrimer_Ball.pdf|publisher=Adventure Cycling|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> Virtually all are hand-built in relatively small runs by independent manufacturers, require at least a few specialized parts, and sell in far fewer numbers as compared to regular bicycles. At the low end, the vast majority of upright bikes retail for less than the cost of the cheapest new recumbent.\n|-\n|Length/width of frame\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|Some recumbent bicycle designs use longer frames than conventional bicycles.  This generally results in a weight penalty and in more flexing of the frame, which causes a loss of power.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}  The chain (on rear wheel drive models) is two to three times as long as an upright and usually requires one or more idler pulleys.  There is a small amount of friction in such pulleys, which also reduces power slightly.  Longer or wider frame designs are more difficult to transport if the bikes are shipped, or put on racks on automobiles.  Trikes may be difficult to fit through doorways.  Some manufacturers offer folding or break-apart designs, but these tend to be expensive.  The longer distance from the handlebars to the wheels can be problematic for speedometers and cyclocomputers, including both wireless and hard-wired models.  The distance from the handlebars to the crankset is likewise longer than a conventional bike and can give problems for cadence sensors.\n|-\n|Nonstandard design\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #81F781\" | advantage\n|Recumbents often have radically different shapes from diamond-frame bikes, so conventional bike racks, automobile carriers, accessories, and locks do not fit in the usual ways. Additionally, the designs are difficult to mount in traditional bicycle work stands and often require a second person during derailleur adjustments to spin cranks that are too far from the shift controls and derailleur locations. Some bicycle mechanics may be reluctant to work on \"nonstandard\" bicycle designs.\n|}\n\n==History==\nRecumbent bicycle designs date back to the middle of the 19th century. Several designs were patented around 1900, but these early designs were unsuccessful.\n\n===Early recumbents===\n[[File:Liegeraeder 1920er Velorama.jpg|thumb|300px|Recumbents from the 1920s in the [[Velorama]]]]\nRecumbent designs of both prone and supine varieties can be traced back to the earliest days of the bicycle. Before the shape of the bicycle settled down following [[John Kemp Starley|Starley]]'s [[safety bicycle]], there was a good deal of experimentation with various arrangements, and this included designs which might be considered recumbent. Although these dated back to the 1860s the first recorded illustration of a recumbent considered as a separate class of bicycle is considered to be in the magazine ''[[Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter]]'' of 10 September 1893. This year also saw what is considered the first genuine recumbent, the Fautenil V\u00e9lociped. Patent applications for a number of recumbent designs exist in the late years of the 19th century, and there were discussions in the cycling press of the relative merits of different layouts. The Challand designs of 1897 and the American Brown of 1901 are both recognisable as forerunners of today's recumbents.\n\n===The Mochet 'V\u00e9lo-Velocar' and 'V\u00e9lorizontal'.===\n[[File:1945MochetVelocar.jpg|thumb|1945 Mochet Velocar]]\nA four-wheeled, two-seater, pedal-propelled car called the '[[Velocar]]' was built in the 1930s by [[France|French]] inventor and light car builder [[Charles Mochet]]. Velocars sold well to French buyers who could not afford a motor car, possibly because of a poor [[economy]] during the [[Great Depression]]. The four-wheeled Velocars were fast but didn't corner well at high speed. Mochet then experimented with a three-wheel design and finally a mould-breaking two-wheel design based on the V\u00e9locar technology.\n\nThe early models of Mochet's 'La bicyclette de l'Avenir' (The bicycle of the Future), the 'V\u00e9lo-V\u00e9locar', or 'V-V' as the factory referred to them, used a 40mm steel-tube, single-beam frame and 450 x 55 wheels with handlebars over the rider and steering torque transmitted by [[bevel gear]]s. Various types of Mochet-designed derailleur gears were fitted, with a single gear for the track models. Gears were mid-mounted using primary and secondary chains. The back-rest was adjustable on more sporting models.\n\nTo demonstrate the speed of his recumbent bicycle, Mochet had the design ratified by the UCI and UVF and enlisted cyclist [[Francis Faure]], a Category 2 racer, to ride it in races. Faure was highly successful, defeating many of Europe's top cyclists both on the track and in road races, and setting new world records at short distances. Another cyclist, Paul Morand, won the Paris-Limoges race in 1933 on one of Mochet's recumbents.\n\nOn 7 July 1933, at a Paris [[velodrome]], Faure rode a modified V\u00e9lo-Velocar {{convert|45.055|km|mi|abbr=on}} in one hour, beating an almost 20-year-old [[hour record]] held by [[Oscar Egg]], and attracting a great deal of attention.\n\nWhen the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI) met in February 1934, manufacturers of 'upright' bicycles lobbied to have Faure's one-hour record declared invalid. On 1 April 1934, the UCI published a new definition of a racing bicycle that specified how high the bottom bracket could be above the ground, how far it could be in front of the seat and how close it could be to the front wheel. The new definition effectively banned recumbents from UCI events for a combination of tradition, safety, and economic reasons.<ref name=\"nelson\"/>\n\nCharles Mochet died a short time after the ban was enacted, still protesting against the UCI decision, and the firm continued to make recumbents under his widow and, later, Georges Mochet until at least 1941 for a limited number of customers. Their final versions were a single-chain design named the 'V\u00e9lorizontal', the final model using a 'Cyclo' four-speed gear.\n\nAfter the UCI decision, Faure continued to race, and consistently beat upright bicycles with the Velocar. In 1938, Faure and Mochet's son, Georges, began adding fairings to the Velocar in hopes of bettering the world record of one hour for a bicycle with aerodynamic components. On 5 March 1938, Faure rode a faired Velocar 50.537 kilometers in an hour and became the first cyclist to travel more than 50 kilometers in an hour without the aid of a [[derny|pace vehicle]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe UCI ban on recumbent bicycles and other aerodynamic improvements virtually stopped development of recumbents for four decades and remains in force.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Although recumbent designs continued to crop up over the years they were mainly the work of lone enthusiasts and numbers remained insignificant until the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Georges Mochet died in 2008.\n\n===1970s resurgence and the IHPVA===\nWhile developments had been made in this fallow period by Paul Rinkowski and others, the modern recumbent movement was given a boost in 1969 when the ''Ground Hugger'' by Robert Riley was featured in [[Popular Mechanics]].<ref name=LightHist>{{cite web|title=History of the Modern Recumbent|url=https://www.lightningbikes.com/riders/martin-krieg/recumbent-history/index.html|publisher=Lightning Bikes|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref> There was also the work of [[Chester Kyle]] and particularly [[David Gordon Wilson]] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], two Americans who opposed the UCI restrictions and continued to work on fairings and recumbents. In 1974, they also nucleated the International Human Power speed Championship in [[Long Beach, California]], from which the [[IHPVA]] grew. Kyle and his students had been experimenting with fairings for upright bicycles, also banned by the UCI.  In 1975 the brothers John and Randy Schlitter started producing recumbents at their company, [[Rans Designs|Rans]], and became the first U.S. company to do so.<ref name=LightHist />\n\nIn 1978, the \"V\u00e9l\u00e9rique\" is the very first commercialized recumbent bicycle (fully faired), by the Belgian Erik Abergen.\n\nThe Avatar 2000, a LWB bike very much like the current Easy Racers products, arrived in 1979.

For about ten years afterward, speed records were exchanged between Easy Racers with Freddy Markham in the cockpit and the Lightning Team.

The oil crises of the 1970s sparked a resurgence in cycling coincident with the arrival of these \"new\" designs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nA parallel but somewhat separate scene grew up in Europe, with the first European human power championships being held in 1983.

He is most famous for hiring [[Joe Chill]] to [[murder]] young Bruce Wayne's parents in early versions of [[Batman]]'s [[origin story]], thus making him indirectly responsible for Batman's existence.\n\n==Publication history==\nLew Moxon first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #235 and was created by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Sheldon Moldoff]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |page=267}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Golden / Silver Age version===\nSometime prior to their murder, Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] and his wife [[Martha Wayne|Martha]] attend a [[costume party]] to which Dr. Wayne wears a [[bat]]-like costume. Thomas Wayne is taken from the party at gunpoint to meet [[racketeer]] and bank robber Lew Moxon who orders Thomas Wayne to remove a bullet from his shoulder. Thomas Wayne carries out the operation before overpowering Moxon and his men.\n\nLew Moxon is arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for armed robbery. As he is taken away, he swears [[revenge]] on Thomas Wayne. Ten years later, a free Lew Moxon informs Thomas Wayne that he will get [[Joe Chill|someone else]] to exact that revenge. It is suggested that Lew Moxon ordered Joe Chill to kill the Waynes but keep young Bruce alive, thus providing a convincing [[alibi]] for Moxon.\n\nYears later, Batman learns of Lew Moxon's involvement in the murder of his parents, by which time Lew Moxon is operating a [[blimp]] business. Batman's first attempt to convict Lew Moxon for the murder of his parents fails as Lew Moxon is now suffering from [[amnesia]] and is able to pass a [[lie detector]] test. He is then released on bail with his only official crime being assault. Batman determines that Lew Moxon's blimp business must be a cover for illegal activities and continues to trail the gangster.\n\nEventually, after uncovering Lew Moxon's illegal activities, Batman confronts the criminal while wearing his father's costume (his own had been ripped during an earlier fight). On seeing Dr. Wayne's costume, Lew Moxon suddenly remembers what he had done. Thinking Batman was actually Thomas Wayne's [[ghost]] seeking revenge, Moxon panics and runs out into the street where he is run over by a [[truck]] and dies.\n\n===Modern Age (Post Zero Hour) version===\nLew Moxon was reintroduced into modern Batman continuity as an aging [[mob boss]] with failed political aspirations, who returned to [[Gotham City]] after several years in [[exile]]. In the past, Lew Moxon traveled in the same circle of wealthy socialites as Bruce's parents, and considered the Waynes to be friendly associates despite their disdain towards his immoral leanings. Upon Lew Moxon's return, Bruce is invited to a party, at which he is reintroduced to Lew Moxon's daughter Mallory who turns out to be Bruce's [[childhood sweetheart]]. At the party, Wayne discovers that Lew Moxon is the target of an [[assassination]] by [[Deadshot (comics)|Deadshot]]. For protection, Moxon has employed [[Zeiss (comics)|Philo Zeiss]] as his [[bodyguard]].\n\nDuring an earlier story, Zeiss killed Bruce's friend [[Jeremy Samuels]]. When Bruce confronts Zeiss as Batman, Zeiss reveals that the murder of Samuels was carried out under the order of Lew Moxon himself, as retaliation for something that Thomas Wayne had done to Lew Moxon years ago.\n\nLew Moxon survives Deadshot's assassination attempts (though he is now confined to a [[wheelchair]]), and Batman discovers Mallory is an active member of the [[crime family|family's criminal empire]]. Ultimately Batman discovers that Thomas, Martha and (a very young) Bruce Wayne had attended a costume party (to which Dr. Wayne wore a [[Zorro]] costume) which was also attended by Lew Moxon. At the party, Angelo Berretti, an 'employee' of Lew Moxon's, told Dr. Wayne that a man's life was in danger. Dr. Wayne made Berretti promise his safe return before departing. Dr. Wayne was informed that Lew Moxon's nephew required a bullet to be removed from his shoulder (following a failed armed robbery). Dr. Wayne performed the operation, but refused to take any money, and started a fight with Lew Moxon. Following this, Lew Moxon had ordered the murder of Thomas Wayne. However, this was not carried out because of Berretti's promise.\n\nYears later, Batman questions Angelo Berretti as to whether Lew Moxon had been involved in the murder of the Waynes (which occurred a few months after the costume party). According to Berretti, Lew Moxon was not involved. After Batman accepts Berretti's word and departs, Berretti holds his hand to his face and utters an ambiguous \"Oh, thank God\". Lew Moxon's involvement in the killing of the Wayne is, therefore, left to the reader's imagination.\n\nLew Moxon (alongside his current bodyguard [[Hellhound (comics)|Hellhound]]) is killed by Zeiss at a meeting of Gotham's gang bosses (arranged by [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Spoiler]]). This event occurs at the commencement of the ''[[Batman: War Games]]'' story line.\n\n==Place in continuity==\nDuring the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], Lew Moxon was established as the man who hired Joe Chill to kill Bruce Wayne's parents.\n\nDuring the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]] and [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], the Lew Moxon story remained [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] for tales set on [[Earth Two]]. For several years no mention is made of Moxon's role regards the origin of Batman on [[Earth One]] - that is until the [[Len Wein]] written mini-series, ''[[The Untold Legend of the Batman]]'' (published in 1980) re-introduced the Lew Moxon story, exactly as it was told in 1956. The canonical presence of the character is reinforced in the feature story in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #500, \"To Kill a Legend\" when Batman and Robin are sent to a parallel Earth to avert the murder of that version of the Waynes. To accomplish that goal, the superheroes find and question that world's version of Moxon about the whereabouts of Chill. Moxon had not yet hired Chill to perform the murder and with the attention of this bizarre figure, accelerated his plan with a different killer to first murder Chill and then the Waynes. Batman discovered the dying Chill and deduced that the Waynes were in danger that very night; thus, Batman managed to arrive in Crime Alley in time and stop the murder.\n\nDuring the post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] era, no mention is made of Lew Moxon, making his canonical status during this time uncertain. In ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'' Batman confronts Joe Chill, much as he did in the Golden and Silver Age continuities. However, just as in previous continuities, Chill makes no reference to Lew Moxon before his demise.\n\nDuring the post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] era, while Lew Moxon does appear in several issues, Joe Chill does not.\n\nAfter the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Joe Chill is again known to be responsible for the murder of the Waynes, and he was arrested for the crime on that same night. In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''Batman #673'', Batman learns Chill acted on his own.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the prequel comic to ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', [[Man-Bat|Batman]] tracks down Lew Moxon during a meeting with the other crime lords, along with his right-hand man, [[Joe Chill]]. When Batman corners them, Moxon offers him money to come work for him, but Batman refuses and then kills Moxon by sucking his blood. Kirk later attends Moxon's funeral where he meets Moxon's wife Angela and his son, Jeremy. Kirk later becomes friends with Jeremy and reveals his secret to him. Jeremy then agrees to help Kirk find a cure for his condition. When Angela is murdered, Jeremy reveals that the other crime lords believe that Moxon had evidence against them and they also believe that he knows where they are. Batman later tracks down Angela's murderer, who turns out to be [[Joe Chill]], who is now a vampire after Batman killed him. Batman though later on kills Chill with an axe. When he returns, Batman reveals to Jeremy that he found out that the other crime boss Chill was trying to defeat was Jeremy, who was groomed by Moxon to be a mobster like him and that his innocent, charming image was just an illusion. He then tells Jeremy that he doesn't want to be cured anymore. Jeremy then reveals that he knew that he killed his father and then offers that they work together. Before he leaves, Batman kills Jeremy by sucking his blood, leaving his body to sit in front of the fireplace.\n\n==In other media==\n* Lew Moxon appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\" voiced by [[Richard Moll]]. The episode mirrors many elements from the original story from the comics. Like the earlier appearances, he was the one who hired Joe Chill to kill Thomas Wayne. In this version, he admits to some guilt for leaving Bruce an orphan as the hit was only to be for Thomas Wayne and not his wife Martha. Disguised as a [[priest]], Batman learns of Joe Chill's identity from Lew Moxon as he gives his confession on his deathbed. When [[Phantom Stranger]] brings Batman to the past where he encounters his parents at a masquerade ball, he and Thomas Wayne fend off Lew Moxon's thugs who crashed the masquerade ball to rob it. While in prison, Lew Moxon hired Joe Chill to dispose of Thomas Wayne. When he learns of this, Batman finds a lead on the identity of the man who killed his parents.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Batman Family adversaries]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Batman characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moxon, Lew}}\n[[Category:Fictional business executives]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional gangsters]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1956]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Finger]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sheldon Moldoff]]\n[[Category:Fictional crime bosses]]\n", "text_old": "{{Superherobox <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image = <!-- optional -->\n| caption = <!-- optional -->\n| character_name = Lew Moxon\n| publisher = [[DC Comics]]\n| debut = Golden Age: ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #235 (November 1956)<br/>Modern Age: ''[[Batman]]'' #591 (July 2001)\n| creators = [[Bill Finger]] (writer) & <br/>[[Sheldon Moldoff]] (artist)\n| alter_ego =Lew Moxon\n| full_name = <!-- optional -->\n| species = <!-- optional -->\n| homeworld = <!-- optional -->\n| alliances = <!-- optional -->\n| aliases = <!-- optional: actual identities the character uses, not nicknames -->\n| supports= \n| powers = \n}}\n'''Lew Moxon''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] ''[[Batman]]'' series.
