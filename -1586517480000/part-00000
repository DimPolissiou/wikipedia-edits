As the backache eased by treatment and therapy, he grew determined to become an actor, at which point he entered acting school.<ref name=\"shijiemingren.com\"/><ref name=\"xc27.com\"/>\n\n==Entertainment career==\nShibuya started his acting career in 1993. Determined to become globally active, he felt the need to accumulate experiences in Japan first until an opportunity occurs. Besides acting on a daily basis, Shibuya further improved his performing skill in various ways, including method acting class taught by Yoko Narahashi who would later become a prominent figure of Japanese film industry at United Performers\u2019Studio which associated with NY Actors Studio, (Method [[Method acting]] later became Shibuya's present basic style of acting) ; film acting classes at Eizoujuku, a professional film college founded by Genji Nakamura, director of over 40 films; Japanese classical dancing class from Nishikawa\u2019 Kazuma, the master of Nishikawa school; vocal training at AK MUSIC specializing in opera, chanson and pop music. Shibuya acted in a number of independent and short films, in addition to his guest appearances for various film productions, which familiarized him with their methods and styles. Meanwhile, he had also taken part in filmmaking. He would even sing his original songs while playing guitar. Shibuya sought improvement day and night.\n \nShibuya's commercial debut was in Sadistic Song (1995), a film directed by Genji Nakamura. And in 1997 comes theatric opportunities for Shibuya. In March, he participated in Bolero, a famous ballet work. The performance was choreographed by Maurice B\u00e9jart, directed by Shiro Mizoshita of Tokyo Ballet, as one of dance ensembles presented at Tokyo culture hall. In July, he took parts in Princess Sayo, as both a character and Japanese folk dancer. In August 1997, Shibuya served as assistant director in Annie Get Your Gun, a famous Broadway musical, in Nagoya Chunichi Theater. In the next year, he had the longed opportunity to work with a famous theatric director. He passed the audition and played Capulet in Romeo and Juliet, as directed by [[Yukio Ninagawa]]. He kept at his cinematic career nonetheless. In 2001, Shibuya got a role in Agitator, a film by [[Takashi Miike]], prolific filmmaker. He played a member of the Mafia, who would support his leader played by [[Naoto Takenaka]]. Shibuya was only able to play small bits as detective, gangster, doctor, lawyer during this period. Shibuya's first experience with computer-generated animation was in ''[[Appleseed (2004 film)|Appleseed]]''. His playing of 4 characters was recorded and later processed into animation through \"motion capture\" technique. The film was directed by [[Shinji Aramaki]], and was released in 2004 globally.\n \nShibuya had made plans to start performing in China, only deterred by linguistic difficulties. After learning Mandarin in Beijing Language and Culture University for six months, he'd officially started his acting career in Chinese show business world. He starred in his first Chinese TV drama Caoyuanchunlaizao, playing an actual person on history, Shouji Kanai, in autumn 2006.  In the following year, he co-led his first movie in China, Feihuduidiezhan. Directed by Li Shu, this film was the most rebroadcast program of the year, aired by the predominant movie channel in China, CCTV-6. Although still a new face to Chinese audiences, his performances were soon recognized in the industry. Shibuya had been noticed, and would have been picked for a role in his next show by the director, Li Shu, which in turn led to more opportunities to play. Shibuya is grateful for all the support his co-workers have given.\n \nIn 2008, Shibuya played in [[Ip Man (film)]], a kung-fu movie by [[Wilson Yip]], which would win the best film award of 28th Hong Kong Film Awards. Shibuya's role, Colonel Sato, a cold-blooded and crafty villain, not only gained him reputation among professionals, but also made his impression in general public. In fact, the director, Wilson, had half-jokingly warned him to stay away from movie theaters, noticing the excitement of the audience and the success of the film.\n\nShibuya was offered an opportunity to act in his first costume TV drama, Yangguifeimishi, in 2009. Directed by You Xiaogang, starring Yin Tao, Anthony Wong, the show was set in China in the Tang dynasty. Being a foreigner, Shibuya sensed and successfully portrayed his ancient-Chinese character, fascinating thousands of viewers all over China.\n\nIn 2010, Shibuya took a main role in Shenhe, Minetsugu Yoshida, an ornithologist who came to Zhalong Lake to search two lost cranes from Japan. The entire film was shot in [[Qiqihar]], a northeastern city in China where, during the shooting of the film, would reach a temperature of -30\u02daC.  \nShibuya's next TV drama, Jieqiang, was both commercially successful and critically acclaimed. His part, Kato Keiji, an emotional and cunning antagonist, was remarked by critics as both evil and fascinating.<ref name=\"news.163.com\">http://news.163.com/11/0321/03/6VL1HUNP00014AED.html</ref> The program has broken the record of the highest revenue in the history of Chinese TV shows. Participating in such works as Yip Man and Jieqiang, Shibuya certainly became one of the most popular Japanese actors in China. As his works being broadcast in other countries, he gained popularity all over the world.\n\nIn 2011, Shibuya had a chance to play scenes with an Oscar-winner [[Christian Bale]] in [[The Flowers of War]], it was right after the successful TV drama, Jieqiang broadcast, so they gained attention of Chinese media.\n \nTV drama Daxifa\uff08Chinese Traditional Magic\uff09<ref>http://chinesemov.com/tv/2012/Chinese-Traditional-Magic.html</ref>, released in 2012, gave Shibuya a chance to play a complex and unique character. The role of Wutengzhang, Japanese Magician who came to China to steal a secret document of Chinese traditional magic, differs greatly from the soldier roles that Shibuya was used to. As the story progresses, the character adapts various identities such as honest young man, sexy female dancer of kabuki, magician playing magic on the stage, old woman, mad middle aged man. Yet another challenge to Shibuya is to speak Mandarin fluently in all 40 episodes. Overcoming all challenges, Shibuya gained praises for his acting skill and professionalism.\n\nShibuya once again impressed his fans by playing Ichiro Nakamura, the second male leading role in the film Hushed Roar in 2012. Ichiro was a simple-minded person suffered from hypoglycemia, whose marriage with his long-time lover was deterred for his fear of his illness being heredity. This film officially participated in Montr\u00e9al World Film Festival. The character, rich in emotions, was quite a new type for Shibuya to play, as he played numerous stereotypical, sometimes one-sided roles so far. Shibuya spoke only English in the film as required by the setting of the film.   Without knowing him in person, the producer said that Shibuya's playing as a comical role gave her confidence to cast him, and that she was very satisfied with Shibuya's performance.\n\nIn 2013, Shibuya participated in [[Kano (film)|KANO]] as the only Japanese cast from mainland China. The film tells a story about a high school baseball team in Taiwan. [[Umin Boya]], the director, offered the role as he was impressed by Shibuya's performance in Ip Man. Shibuya was also happy to accept his offer not only base on the strength of the script, but also the reputation of the director of being cooperative and accepting to different opinions. Breaking the box office record in Taiwan, the film was also very successful in Japan, Hong Kong and some other countries.  Shibuya appeared in Xiaobaohelaocai in 2013. It was his first opportunity for a comedic role in China which he loves to play. Being busy in Taiwan for shooting KANO at the time, he was able to join for one day shooting in Beijing. The supporting role of colonel Qingtian was a complicating one, despite appearance in few scenes. Colonel Qingtian, who stationed in China In the ending WW\u2161, got desperate as the situation of the war worsen. Knowing he would dispatch from his station the next day, he murdered another character, leading the turn of the plot. His part was insufficient to depict the character's personality, but Shibuya was able to act impromptu and even added humor to it. His performance was praised by both the crew members and the audience. Shibuya had been noted in main cast in spite of his small part.\n\nShibuya continued to expand his range of roles that he could play in China through TV dramas Fenghuoshuangxiong (2013), Youchai (2015) and Tiezaishao (2015).

He led in Wanfeng, a graduation project by a group of student in Beijing Film Academy. Shibuya found it interesting to work with students because of their passion and talent, regardless of the budget of the film. He decided to join students\u2019 graduation film; not only to be an actor but also to give advises in all aspects of filmmaking.\n\nShibuya values communication with directors and other crews, leading his repeated collaborations with many directors, including Xiao Feng. They kept in touch since they worked together in Hushed Roar in 2012, and when Xiao Feng directed Air Strike (Dahongzha)<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Strike_(2018_film)</ref> four years later, he entrusted Shibuya with the only Japanese main role. The film was co-produced by Chinese, Korean, and Hollywood teams.

All of the air battle scenes Shibuya acted were taken in the studio of special effect, which would have restricted his acting. Being in the cockpit, he could only act by facial expressions. Furthermore, his acting completely depended on his imagination as there were no opponents or objects in the studio. Shibuya received praises in general despite all the obstacles.\n\nShibuya appeared quite frequently on TV in China in the autumn of 2015. Including re-aired shows, five TV series Shibuya played\uff1bTiezaishao, Ershisidaoguai, Jieqiang, Xuanya, Xuebao, was broadcast on over ten TV channels including Anhui, Beijing, Zhejiang satellite, CCTV-8, Guizhou satellite, Xizang satellite, Shanxi satellite, Anhui satellite, Tianjin satellite.  A number of Shibuya's fans commented and discussed the roles Shibuya portrayed, especially of his new drama, Tiezaishao. They were moved when his passion and sensitivity came to an end when he had to kill the love of his life. Shibuya's performance receives upmost praise for its subtle, complex transition of emotions. Audiences were impressed especially by the compassionate image Shibuya has project, opposed to the usual, monstrous Japanese characters in Chinese productions.\n\nTenma Shibuya also sometimes collaborates with enterprises as an image character or a spokesman. 2013,July, he attended  Art exhibition, \u201cAn honor to meet you.\u201d <ref>http://baike.baidu.com/view/3065850.htm</ref><ref>http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_6cac56f70101i1af.html</ref><ref>http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3615019583</ref> 2014, March, he collaborated with Antique jewelry brand, \u201cHouse of Willow.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |url=http://she.21cn.com/tese/haixiuhui/a/2014/0530/16/27352606_1.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330003224/http://she.21cn.com/tese/haixiuhui/a/2014/0530/16/27352606_1.shtml |archivedate=2017-03-30 }}</ref><ref>http://fashion.ifeng.com/a/20140530/40014486_0.shtml</ref> 2014, May, did a spokesman for Millennium Residences Beijing at the project of \u201cTenma Shibuya\u2019s  Art Space & Art Life Style.\u201d <ref>http://fashion.ifeng.com/a/20140619/40019205_0.shtm</ref><ref>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/micro-reading/dzh/2014-06-19/content_11862681.html</ref> 2015, April, attended \u201cYinluchi Art District Fine Brushwork Exhibition.\u201d<ref>http://www.orgcc.com/news/2015/04/73036.html?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0</ref><ref>http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_6cac56f70102vobr.html</ref> 2015, July, participated in Chao Hong's Painting Art Exhibition, \u201cCombining the East and the West,\u201d he had a speech in it.<ref>http://www.orgcc.com/news/2015/07/77140.html</ref><ref name=\"xc27.com\"/> 2015, from June to July, he did a spokesman of African art brand, \u201cAfrican Symbol.\u201d <ref>http://ent.163.com/15/0710/17/AU69C2V400034OGT.html</ref><ref>http://ent.163.com/15/0630/17/ATCHS9FA00034OGT.html</ref><ref>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hqcj/xfly/2015-07-29/content_14050252.html</ref><ref>http://news.163.com/15/0715/17/AUJ40M1F00014AED.html</ref><ref>http://www.youngchina.cn/luxury/20150629/48402.html</ref><ref>http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3854487052][http://fun.youth.cn/2015/0715/1482311.shtml{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> 2017, February, he collaborated with Fragrance Brand, RE CLASSIFIED at the project of its promotion, \u201c\u201cTenma Shibuya Comprehends Ancient Greek Philosophy through Perfume.\u201d <ref>https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5MDY3ODYwNQ==&mid=2650457471&idx=2&sn=dda86d3fb030313537fb0efc8fbe2d17&pass_ticket=7Yfkk2uKe2LNmPGCrQsiWevVRxCrkIWSw%2BPZtYZYxRU4GNiH9Mx6WAyneNrO6JFp</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://e.gmw.cn/2017-02/13/content_23713106.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330011745/http://e.gmw.cn/2017-02/13/content_23713106.htm |archivedate=2017-03-30 }}][http://mini.eastday.com/a/170213182013180.html][{{cite web |url=http://www.sznews.com/ent/content/2017-02/13/content_15264807.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330005106/http://www.sznews.com/ent/content/2017-02/13/content_15264807.htm |archivedate=2017-03-30 }}</ref>\n\nUp to 2016, Shibuya has appeared in over 100 works including movies, TV dramas and stages in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the U.S. Today, he is recognized as one of famous Japanese actors in Chinese speaking regions, especially in mainland China.<ref name=\"xc27.com\"/>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As the backache eased by treatment and therapy, he grew determined to become an actor, at which point he entered acting school.<ref name=\"shijiemingren.com\"/><ref name=\"xc27.com\"/>\n\n==Entertainment career==\nShibuya started his acting career in 1993. Determined to become globally active, he felt the need to accumulate experiences in Japan first until an opportunity occurs. Besides acting on a daily basis, Shibuya further improved his performing skill in various ways, including method acting class taught by Yoko Narahashi who would later become a prominent figure of Japanese film industry at United Performers\u2019Studio which associated with NY Actors Studio, (Method [[Method acting]] later became Shibuya's present basic style of acting) ; film acting classes at Eizoujuku, a professional film college founded by Genji Nakamura, director of over 40 films; Japanese classical dancing class from Nishikawa\u2019 Kazuma, the master of Nishikawa school; vocal training at AK MUSIC specializing in opera, chanson and pop music. Shibuya acted in a number of independent and short films, in addition to his guest appearances for various film productions, which familiarized him with their methods and styles. Meanwhile, he had also taken part in filmmaking. He would even sing his original songs while playing guitar. Shibuya sought improvement day and night.\n \nShibuya's commercial debut was in Sadistic Song (1995), a film directed by Genji Nakamura. And in 1997 comes theatric opportunities for Shibuya. In March, he participated in Bolero, a famous ballet work. The performance was choreographed by Maurice B\u00e9jart, directed by Shiro Mizoshita of Tokyo Ballet, as one of dance ensembles presented at Tokyo culture hall. In July, he took parts in Princess Sayo, as both a character and Japanese folk dancer. In August 1997, Shibuya served as assistant director in Annie Get Your Gun, a famous Broadway musical, in Nagoya Chunichi Theater. In the next year, he had the longed opportunity to work with a famous theatric director. He passed the audition and played Capulet in Romeo and Juliet, as directed by [[Yukio Ninagawa]]. He kept at his cinematic career nonetheless. In 2001, Shibuya got a role in Agitator, a film by [[Takashi Miike]], prolific filmmaker. He played a member of the Mafia, who would support his leader played by [[Naoto Takenaka]]. Shibuya was only able to play small bits as detective, gangster, doctor, lawyer during this period. Shibuya's first experience with computer-generated animation was in ''[[Appleseed (2004 film)|Appleseed]]''. His playing of 4 characters was recorded and later processed into animation through \"motion capture\" technique. The film was directed by [[Shinji Aramaki]], and was released in 2004 globally.\n \nShibuya had made plans to start performing in China, only deterred by linguistic difficulties. After learning Mandarin in Beijing Language and Culture University for six months, he'd officially started his acting career in Chinese show business world. He starred in his first Chinese TV drama Caoyuanchunlaizao, playing an actual person on history, Shouji Kanai, in autumn 2006.  In the following year, he co-led his first movie in China, Feihuduidiezhan. Directed by Li Shu, this film was the most rebroadcast program of the year, aired by the predominant movie channel in China, CCTV-6. Although still a new face to Chinese audiences, his performances were soon recognized in the industry. Shibuya had been noticed, and would have been picked for a role in his next show by the director, Li Shu, which in turn led to more opportunities to play. Shibuya is grateful for all the support his co-workers have given.\n \nIn 2008, Shibuya played in [[Ip Man (film)]], a kung-fu movie by [[Wilson Yip]], which would win the best film award of 28th Hong Kong Film Awards. Shibuya's role, Colonel Sato, a cold-blooded and crafty villain, not only gained him reputation among professionals, but also made his impression in general public. In fact, the director, Wilson, had half-jokingly warned him to stay away from movie theaters, noticing the excitement of the audience and the success of the film.\n\nShibuya was offered an opportunity to act in his first costume TV drama, Yangguifeimishi, in 2009. Directed by You Xiaogang, starring Yin Tao, Anthony Wong, the show was set in China in the Tang dynasty. Being a foreigner, Shibuya sensed and successfully portrayed his ancient-Chinese character, fascinating thousands of viewers all over China.\n\nIn 2010, Shibuya took a main role in Shenhe, Minetsugu Yoshida, an ornithologist who came to Zhalong Lake to search two lost cranes from Japan. The entire film was shot in [[Qiqihar]], a northeastern city in China where, during the shooting of the film, would reach a temperature of -30\u02daC.  \nShibuya's next TV drama, Jieqiang, was both commercially successful and critically acclaimed. His part, Kato Keiji, an emotional and cunning antagonist, was remarked by critics as both evil and fascinating.<ref name=\"news.163.com\">http://news.163.com/11/0321/03/6VL1HUNP00014AED.html</ref> The program has broken the record of the highest revenue in the history of Chinese TV shows. Participating in such works as Yip Man and Jieqiang, Shibuya certainly became one of the most popular Japanese actors in China. As his works being broadcast in other countries, he gained popularity all over the world.\n\nIn 2011, Shibuya had a chance to play scenes with an Oscar-winner [[Christian Bale]] in [[The Flowers of War]], it was right after the successful TV drama, Jieqiang broadcast, so they gained attention of Chinese media.\n \nTV drama Daxifa\uff08Chinese Traditional Magic\uff09<ref>http://chinesemov.com/tv/2012/Chinese-Traditional-Magic.html</ref>, released in 2012, gave Shibuya a chance to play a complex and unique character. The role of Wutengzhang, Japanese Magician who came to China to steal a secret document of Chinese traditional magic, differs greatly from the soldier roles that Shibuya was used to. As the story progresses, the character adapts various identities such as honest young man, sexy female dancer of kabuki, magician playing magic on the stage, old woman, mad middle aged man. Yet another challenge to Shibuya is to speak Mandarin fluently in all 40 episodes. Overcoming all challenges, Shibuya gained praises for his acting skill and professionalism.\n\nShibuya once again impressed his fans by playing Ichiro Nakamura, the second male leading role in the film Hushed Roar in 2012. Ichiro was a simple-minded person suffered from hypoglycemia, whose marriage with his long-time lover was deterred for his fear of his illness being heredity. This film officially participated in Montr\u00e9al World Film Festival. The character, rich in emotions, was quite a new type for Shibuya to play, as he played numerous stereotypical, sometimes one-sided roles so far. Shibuya spoke only English in the film as required by the setting of the film.   Without knowing him in person, the producer said that Shibuya's playing as a comical role gave her confidence to cast him, and that she was very satisfied with Shibuya's performance.\n\nIn 2013, Shibuya participated in [[Kano (film)|KANO]] as the only Japanese cast from mainland China. The film tells a story about a high school baseball team in Taiwan. [[Umin Boya]], the director, offered the role as he was impressed by Shibuya's performance in Ip Man. Shibuya was also happy to accept his offer not only base on the strength of the script, but also the reputation of the director of being cooperative and accepting to different opinions. Breaking the box office record in Taiwan, the film was also very successful in Japan, Hong Kong and some other countries.  Shibuya appeared in Xiaobaohelaocai in 2013. It was his first opportunity for a comedic role in China which he loves to play. Being busy in Taiwan for shooting KANO at the time, he was able to join for one day shooting in Beijing. The supporting role of colonel Qingtian was a complicating one, despite appearance in few scenes. Colonel Qingtian, who stationed in China In the ending WW\u2161, got desperate as the situation of the war worsen. Knowing he would dispatch from his station the next day, he murdered another character, leading the turn of the plot. His part was insufficient to depict the character's personality, but Shibuya was able to act impromptu and even added humor to it. His performance was praised by both the crew members and the audience. Shibuya had been noted in main cast in spite of his small part.\n\nShibuya continued to expand his range of roles that he could play in China through TV dramas Fenghuoshuangxiong (2013), Youchai (2015) and Tiezaishao (2015).  In Fenghuoshuangxiong, he falls in love with a Japanese girl and losses her at the end of the story;<ref>http://ent.news.cn/2014-09/23/c_127022786.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>http://ent.qq.com/a/20140916/056812.htm</ref> in Youchai, he had a relationship with a Japanese female spy whose death causes his seek to vengeance;<ref>http://ent.163.com/16/0612/18/BPCNET59000333J5.html</ref><ref>http://www.sznews.com/ent/content/2016-06/12/content_13471288.htm{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref> in Tiezaishao, he falls in love with a Chinese girl but is forced to kill her.<ref name=\"ent.qq.com\"/> Through his performance, viewers were able to see different emotions, and carefully shaped personalities, which is rare to see on roles such as Japanese soldiers.\n\nShibuya had more freedom on choosing his future appearance as his fame and wealth increased by 2015. He led in Wanfeng, a graduation project by a group of student in Beijing Film Academy. Shibuya found it interesting to work with students because of their passion and talent, regardless of the budget of the film. He decided to join students\u2019 graduation film; not only to be an actor but also to give advises in all aspects of filmmaking.\n\nShibuya values communication with directors and other crews, leading his repeated collaborations with many directors, including Xiao Feng. They kept in touch since they worked together in Hushed Roar in 2012, and when Xiao Feng directed Air Strike (Dahongzha)<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Strike_(2018_film)</ref> four years later, he entrusted Shibuya with the only Japanese main role. The film was co-produced by Chinese, Korean, and Hollywood teams. Its consultants include Vilmos Zsigmond, Richard Anderson, and Ronald Bass, who are Oscar winners in cinematography, sound effect, and screenplay, respectively, and Mel Gibson participated in this film as an art director.<ref>https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/mel-gibson-china-the-bombing-1201538874/</ref><ref>http://www.thewrap.com/mel-gibson-to-serve-as-art-director-on-bruce-willis-chinese-war-movie-the-bombing/</ref> Telling the story about the Japanese bombings on city of Chongqing during the WW\u2161, the film stars from four countries; Liu Ye from China, Bruce Willis,<ref>https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/bruce-willis-the-bombing-chinese-language-1201511464/</ref> Adrien Brody from the U.S,<ref>http://ent.cntv.cn/2015/11/13/ARTI1447379086038874.shtml</ref> Song Seung-heon from Korea,<ref>http://www.1905.com/news/20150604/897961.shtml?fr=wwwfilm_news_rh_1_20141027</ref> and Shibuya from Japan.<ref>http://ent.ifeng.com/a/20150723/42459337_0.shtml</ref><ref>http://ent.news.cn/2015-07/08/c_127998215.htm</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://ent.qq.com/a/20150715/052057.htm</ref><ref>http://ent.163.com/15/0708/12/AU0J2ER800032DGD.html</ref><ref>http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hqcj/xfly/2015-07-23/content_14020853.html</ref> Shibuya plays an ace pilot who flies a Zero fighter and battles against Chinese battle-planes. All of the air battle scenes Shibuya acted were taken in the studio of special effect, which would have restricted his acting. Being in the cockpit, he could only act by facial expressions. Furthermore, his acting completely depended on his imagination as there were no opponents or objects in the studio. Shibuya received praises in general despite all the obstacles.\n\nShibuya appeared quite frequently on TV in China in the autumn of 2015. Including re-aired shows, five TV series Shibuya played\uff1bTiezaishao, Ershisidaoguai, Jieqiang, Xuanya, Xuebao, was broadcast on over ten TV channels including Anhui, Beijing, Zhejiang satellite, CCTV-8, Guizhou satellite, Xizang satellite, Shanxi satellite, Anhui satellite, Tianjin satellite.  A number of Shibuya's fans commented and discussed the roles Shibuya portrayed, especially of his new drama, Tiezaishao. They were moved when his passion and sensitivity came to an end when he had to kill the love of his life. Shibuya's performance receives upmost praise for its subtle, complex transition of emotions.

Eventually cornering him in an alley, Bosch shoots the suspect when he reaches in his pocket. The incident is shown later in the episode in two separate flashbacks. When seen from Bosch's point of view, it appears that there is something in the suspect's hand that falls in a puddle. When the incident is recounted by the plaintiff's lawyer during a wrongful death suit, there is clearly nothing in the suspect's hand and Bosch is shown planting a gun. Whatever really happened, Bosch is cleared by the department. The show fast-forwards to two years later when Bosch is being sued by the suspect's family in a wrongful death civil suit.\n\nRestless because he has been on restricted duty during the trial and anxious to do more active detective work, Bosch convinces two other detectives to trade shifts with him so he can work their weekend shift, much to the chagrin of his partner. On Saturday, Bosch is called out on a case which turns out to be a suicide, and a second case wherein a doctor reports his dog found a human bone in the woods.\n\nThe latter investigation turns up more bones and the coroner determines the skeleton is that of a small boy who was horribly abused and beaten, then buried in the woods. The boy has been dead since at least 1989 and could have been anywhere from 10 to 12 when he died, but because severe abuse stunts children's growth, the victim's exact age is uncertain. The details of the boy's mistreatment - more than 40 broken bones, some healed and others relatively recent - and death are so grisly that Bosch has to step away from the coroner's recitation to into the restroom to splash water on his face and sit down on a commode for a moment to regain his composure.\n\nThe second episode introduces Raynard Waits, a serial killer who confesses to the murder in the bones case and has a strange fascination with Bosch. After Waits escapes custody he begins to taunt Bosch as Bosch aims to both catch Waits and prove he had nothing to do with the murder of the boy.\n\n===Season 2===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on ''[[The Last Coyote]]'' (Book 4) and ''[[Trunk Music (novel)|Trunk Music]]'' (Book 5)\n|-\n|}\nPicking up six months after the events in Season 1, Bosch returns from a suspension. He investigates the murder of a Hollywood producer who appears to have mob connections. His investigation of the producer sends him to Las Vegas, where he also finds out that all is not well with his teenage daughter and ex-wife. Bosch's investigation almost threatens the life of his family as he is also brought into another case that leads to a ring of dirty cops. New evidence appears on the death of his mother, which causes him to investigate the circumstances, leading to her murder.\n\n===Season 3===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on [[The Black Echo|The Black Echo (Book 1)]] and [[A Darkness More Than Night|A Darkness More Than Night (Book 7)]]. Death of Ed Gunn based on [[The Drop (Connelly novel)|The Drop (Book 15)]]\n|-\n|}\nBosch is haunted with new leads to pursue on his mother's murder case. The season opens with a graffiti-tagging street urchin being in the vicinity where a homeless veteran, Billy Meadows, is murdered. Bosch also finds himself a suspect in the murder of Ed Gunn (a person who fits the MO of his mother's killer), doggedly pursued by veteran Detective Jimmy Robertson. Concurrently, Bosch is monitoring an ongoing criminal trial involving a powerful Hollywood movie mogul who is under [[house arrest]]. Under the director's employ is a former 20+ year police detective who proves to be a meddlesome and worthy adversary against Bosch and LAPD. Also, Bosch's personal life takes on new challenges with his daughter, Maddie, living in LA with him, along with a budding romantic relationship with the Deputy DA. Adding to the complexity is the introduction of a serial murderer, known as the Koreatown Killer (KTK).\n\n===Season 4===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on [[Angels Flight (novel)|Angels Flight (Book 6)]]\n|-\n|}\nCivil rights attorney Howard Elias is representing a black man who is accusing LAPD of police brutality, but Elias is murdered. Elias had a history of representing citizens who sue the LAPD, and the case produces racial strife in LA and elevated tension between the LAPD and citizens. Police Chief Irving assigns Bosch to head the task force to get to the bottom of the Elias murder and assigns pair of IA investigators to watch Bosch's team, which includes Edgar, Robertson, and Robertson's detective trainee. Bosch's ex-wife is pursuing a gang of Chinese nationals, one of whom is under an FBI investigation. The investigation leads to her being murdered in a drive-by shooting seconds after lunch with Harry. Bosch gains a vital clue into his mother's murder after the long-retired detective of his mother's case is killed.\n\n===Season 5===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on Two Kinds of Truth (Book 20)\n|-\n|}\nA murder conviction is brought into question from an old case Bosch worked, possibly affecting other past convictions and endangering his career. An embittered former girlfriend accuses Bosch of planting evidence and believes a claim of new DNA evidence purporting to tie another criminal to the crime. Bosch hires Honey Chandler to represent him for his battle against freeing the murderer. Concurrently, Bosch and Jerry try to expose an opioid ring implicated in the murder of a struggling pharmacist and his compromised son. Bosch's daughter Maddie is interning in the office of the district attorney and becomes anxious about the investigation into her father's old case and the coming anniversary of her mother's murder. Chief Irving, meanwhile, ponders running for mayor.\n\n===Season 6===\nThe sixth season of Bosch is set to premiere on April 17, 2020.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1239952134491312128|title=With Detective Harry Bosch, there\u2019s never a dull moment.

Eventually cornering him in an alley, Bosch shoots the suspect when he reaches in his pocket. The incident is shown later in the episode in two separate flashbacks. When seen from Bosch's point of view, it appears that there is something in the suspect's hand that falls in a puddle. When the incident is recounted by the plaintiff's lawyer during a wrongful death suit, there is clearly nothing in the suspect's hand and Bosch is shown planting a gun. Whatever really happened, Bosch is cleared by the department. The show fast-forwards to two years later when Bosch is being sued by the suspect's family in a wrongful death civil suit.\n\nRestless because he has been on restricted duty during the trial and anxious to do more active detective work, Bosch convinces two other detectives to trade shifts with him so he can work their weekend shift, much to the chagrin of his partner. On Saturday, Bosch is called out on a case which turns out to be a suicide, and a second case wherein a doctor reports his dog found a human bone in the woods.\n\nThe latter investigation turns up more bones and the coroner determines the skeleton is that of a small boy who was horribly abused and beaten, then buried in the woods. The boy has been dead since at least 1989 and could have been anywhere from 10 to 12 when he died, but because severe abuse stunts children's growth, the victim's exact age is uncertain. The details of the boy's mistreatment - more than 40 broken bones, some healed and others relatively recent - and death are so grisly that Bosch has to step away from the coroner's recitation to into the restroom to splash water on his face and sit down on a commode for a moment to regain his composure.\n\nThe second episode introduces Raynard Waits, a serial killer who confesses to the murder in the bones case and has a strange fascination with Bosch. After Waits escapes custody he begins to taunt Bosch as Bosch aims to both catch Waits and prove he had nothing to do with the murder of the boy.\n\n===Season 2===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on ''[[The Last Coyote]]'' (Book 4) and ''[[Trunk Music (novel)|Trunk Music]]'' (Book 5)\n|-\n|}\nPicking up six months after the events in Season 1, Bosch returns from a suspension. He investigates the murder of a Hollywood producer who appears to have mob connections. His investigation of the producer sends him to Las Vegas, where he also finds out that all is not well with his teenage daughter and ex-wife. Bosch's investigation almost threatens the life of his family as he is also brought into another case that leads to a ring of dirty cops. New evidence appears on the death of his mother, which causes him to investigate the circumstances, leading to her murder.\n\n===Season 3===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on [[The Black Echo|The Black Echo (Book 1)]] and [[A Darkness More Than Night|A Darkness More Than Night (Book 7)]]. Death of Ed Gunn based on [[The Drop (Connelly novel)|The Drop (Book 15)]]\n|-\n|}\nBosch is haunted with new leads to pursue on his mother's murder case. The season opens with a graffiti-tagging street urchin being in the vicinity where a homeless veteran, Billy Meadows, is murdered. Bosch also finds himself a suspect in the murder of Ed Gunn (a person who fits the MO of his mother's killer), doggedly pursued by veteran Detective Jimmy Robertson. Concurrently, Bosch is monitoring an ongoing criminal trial involving a powerful Hollywood movie mogul who is under [[house arrest]]. Under the director's employ is a former 20+ year police detective who proves to be a meddlesome and worthy adversary against Bosch and LAPD. Also, Bosch's personal life takes on new challenges with his daughter, Maddie, living in LA with him, along with a budding romantic relationship with the Deputy DA. Adding to the complexity is the introduction of a serial murderer, known as the Koreatown Killer (KTK).\n\n===Season 4===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on [[Angels Flight (novel)|Angels Flight (Book 6)]]\n|-\n|}\nCivil rights attorney Howard Elias is representing a black man who is accusing LAPD of police brutality, but Elias is murdered. Elias had a history of representing citizens who sue the LAPD, and the case produces racial strife in LA and elevated tension between the LAPD and citizens. Police Chief Irving assigns Bosch to head the task force to get to the bottom of the Elias murder and assigns pair of IA investigators to watch Bosch's team, which includes Edgar, Robertson, and Robertson's detective trainee. Bosch's ex-wife is pursuing a gang of Chinese nationals, one of whom is under an FBI investigation. The investigation leads to her being murdered in a drive-by shooting seconds after lunch with Harry. Bosch gains a vital clue into his mother's murder after the long-retired detective of his mother's case is killed.\n\n===Season 5===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Based on Two Kinds of Truth (Book 20)\n|-\n|}\nA murder conviction is brought into question from an old case Bosch worked, possibly affecting other past convictions and endangering his career. An embittered former girlfriend accuses Bosch of planting evidence and believes a claim of new DNA evidence purporting to tie another criminal to the crime. Bosch hires Honey Chandler to represent him for his battle against freeing the murderer. Concurrently, Bosch and Jerry try to expose an opioid ring implicated in the murder of a struggling pharmacist and his compromised son. Bosch's daughter Maddie is interning in the office of the district attorney and becomes anxious about the investigation into her father's old case and the coming anniversary of her mother's murder. Chief Irving, meanwhile, ponders running for mayor.\n\n===Season 6===\nThe sixth season of Bosch is set to premiere on April 17, 2020.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1239952134491312128|title=With Detective Harry Bosch, there\u2019s never a dull moment.
