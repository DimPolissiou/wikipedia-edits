His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and ended up opening for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Despite a promising success, the band broke up in the late 70's and Squier, the band's frontman, left to pursue a solo career.\n\nSquier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and released his solo debut in spring of 1980. ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled almost in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching top 5 in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (were the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signerature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling close to 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in an 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for 6 weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier's fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' came in September 1984 and brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Co-produced by a veteran songwriter [[Jim Steinman]], ''Signs of Life'' saw Squier melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; he reportedly played for half-empty arenas on the most dates of Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans, which was only boasted by the single's high charting.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued the tour and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, performing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video, more familiar to his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold a disappointing 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. It was also Squier's first album not to be supported with a tour, since Capitol decided not to promote it, which later built strong tensions between the label and Squier.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989''.'' The album fared only slightly better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'', but featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there in five years, since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album partly restored Squier's success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock with small hints of then-successful glam metal and is nowadays regarded as one of his strongest inputs by his fanbase. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour No Excess returned him to the upper class of arena rock in the US. However, despite a promising newfound success, Squier's popularity continued to descend soon after, and he wasn't able to make a notable comeback anymore.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. The album was criticized for the lack of innovation in songwriting and peaked only at #117 in US, becoming his lowest charting album since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature Squier's only 1990s single to hit Mainstream Rock's Top 5, \"She Goes Down\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a small tour, which became his last for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier put out his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies, despite its opening track \"Angry\" receiving modest airplay and becoming his last new entry on the Mainstream Rock charts. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He embarked on a mini-tour to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\".{{unsourced|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier joined [[Bad Company]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]] on a nationwide summer tour.\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"\n\nSampling of \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" continued as of 2016. The late [[Jam Master Jay]]'s reference to the song as a classic beat in the early days of hip hop paid great dividends for Squier. The three-piece hip hop group [[Run DMC]] performed a track live at The Funhouse entitled \"Here We Go,\" using the song's backbeat. [[Jay-Z]]'s \"99 Problems,\" a massive hit in 2003, was on that beat, as were British grime/hip-hop MC Dizzee Rascal's \"Fix Up, Look Sharp\" [[Kanye West]]'s \"Addiction\" and, in 2012, the [[Alicia Keys]] selection \"Girl on Fire.\"\n\n<br />{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years.

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews.

He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and ended up opening for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Despite a promising success, the band broke up in the late 70's and Squier, the band's frontman, left to pursue a solo career.\n\nSquier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and released his solo debut in spring of 1980. ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled almost in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching top 5 in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (were the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signerature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling close to 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in an 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for 6 weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100.

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold a disappointing 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. It was also Squier's first album not to be supported with a tour, since Capitol decided not to promote it, which later built strong tensions between the label and Squier.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989''.'' The album fared only slightly better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'', but featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there in five years, since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album partly restored Squier's success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock with small hints of then-successful glam metal and is nowadays regarded as one of his strongest inputs by his fanbase. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour No Excess returned him to the upper class of arena rock in the US. However, despite a promising newfound success, Squier's popularity continued to descend soon after, and he wasn't able to make a notable comeback anymore.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. The album was criticized for the lack of innovation in songwriting and peaked only at #117 in US, becoming his lowest charting album since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature Squier's only 1990s single to hit Mainstream Rock's Top 5, \"She Goes Down\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a small tour, which became his last for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier put out his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies, despite its opening track \"Angry\" receiving modest airplay and becoming his last new entry on the Mainstream Rock charts. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He embarked on a mini-tour to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\".{{unsourced|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier joined [[Bad Company]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]] on a nationwide summer tour.\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"\n\nSampling of \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" continued as of 2016. The late [[Jam Master Jay]]'s reference to the song as a classic beat in the early days of hip hop paid great dividends for Squier. The three-piece hip hop group [[Run DMC]] performed a track live at The Funhouse entitled \"Here We Go,\" using the song's backbeat. [[Jay-Z]]'s \"99 Problems,\" a massive hit in 2003, was on that beat, as were British grime/hip-hop MC Dizzee Rascal's \"Fix Up, Look Sharp\" [[Kanye West]]'s \"Addiction\" and, in 2012, the [[Alicia Keys]] selection \"Girl on Fire.\"\n\n<br />{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years. It was released in collaboration with Squier, who provided two live bonus cuts from his personal collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/music/news/shout~_factory_re-issuing_concrete_blonde_~_billy_squier|title=Shout!

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Post|date=May 14, 2000|url=https://nypost.com/2000/05/14/rocker-billys-a-country-squier/|title=Rocker Billy's A Country \u2018Squier\u2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Social Diary|date=September 2, 2015|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2015/end-of-summer-doings-at-madoo|title=End of Summer Doings at Madoo}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Billy Squier discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n*''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Emotions in Motion]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Happy Blue (Billy Squier album)|Happy Blue]]'' (1998)\n\n===Non-album soundtrack contributions===\n*''Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Fast Times At Ridgemont High]]'' (1982)\n*''On Your Own'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1984)\n*''Shake Down'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--unused<ref name=\"parker\">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Martha, Martha, Martha! 35 Years Later, Original VJ Quinn Remembers MTV's Early Days|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/martha-martha-martha-35-years-later-original-vj-quinn-remembers-mtvs-early-days-042906236.html|website=Yahoo!

Cecil spotted his workmates driving radio-controlled cars on the company's helipad and decided it needed a [[ball differential]] after noticing the cars skittered.   He soon started noticing large areas that these early primitive cars could be improved. Having noticed high tyre wear he introduced the [[ball differential]] to radio-controlled cars.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Cecil|publisher=RC Racing TV|year=2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsIX5J9mbhs|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Burr|2015|p=156 }}\n\nThese ball differentials were used by his son Robin then his friends then local model shop requested to stock it and soon international orders followed. It came to the point that Cecil Schumacher was making more money from this side business than through his employer. So in 1981 Schumacher Racing Products was formed in [[Northampton]], England.\n\nThe company has always operated out of Northampton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioracecar.com/article.aspx?a=4875 |title=The Hobby Hub |publisher=Radioracecar.com |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> but sourced some components from China like most other successful RC companies; however, the majority of manufacturing remains in England and Schumacher remains very much an English company. Cecil Schumacher's son Robin Schumacher took over the business in 2001.\n\n===1980s===\nThe first car to be produced by Schumacher was the XL Lexan chassis pan car in 1981 which had intentionally highly flexible chassis suitable for indoor racing. This was followed in 1983 by the \"C\" car which was made out of fibreglass reinforced epoxy resin sheet and designed specifically for racing on carpet. It included many features that are still around on every modern 1/12-scale car; race wins include the euros in 1985 and 1988.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1980s, [[off-road]] RC cars increased in popularity. In 1986 the first [[4WD]] [[1:10 radio-controlled off-road buggy|1/10-scale off-road buggy]] was launched, called the SWB CAT. This launched the CAT (Competition All Terrain) brand for Schumacher. This first variant SWB (Short Wheel Base) 4WD car was an instant success with serious RC fans with its popularity cemented into history when [[Masami Hirosaka]] won the 1987 [[IFMAR]] off-road RC World Championships<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUSO_QwBrhU |title=Past IFMAR WC\u00b4s \u2013 1987 IFMAR Worlds Championship |via=YouTube |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> having been lent a works car after Schumacher scouts noted his driving form during practice sessions.\n\n===1990s===\nFollowing the success of the first generation of off-road CATs, Schumacher continued to produce many successful off and on-road electric cars. The popularity of the touring car class seriously affected the off-road world during the 1990s. Schumacher stepped down the development of this class through the 1990s. Schumacher was then starting to dominate a niche in the \"fun\" car sector, with high-power/speed [[Nitromethane|nitro]]-powered models capable of real speeds in excess of 80&nbsp;mph.\n\n===2000s===\nOver the turn of this century the Schumacher product line-up became quite familiar with the \"fun\" cars with increasing number of nitro products; however it remained in the 1/10 competition touring cars market. \n\n===2010s===\nThe flood of cheap high-volume low-margin ready to run cars produced in Asia meant the company no longer produce a nitro car or fun car. Schumacher now concentrate on the high level 1/10-scale electrical competitive market. Alongside their Mi touring car range the company re-entered the off-road scene with the CAT SX (4WD) and Cougar SV (2WD). Vintage racing of older designed cars became popular with Schumacher re-releasing the CAT XLS in 2017 and then the Top Cat. In the mid 2010s a move was made to help the sport grow with the introduction of a number of lower priced competition cars. The Mi1 touring car was introduced alongside the ever evolving top spec version. And then a move was made to re-establish 1/12th electric carpet racing with the launch of the Supastock and Eclipse range. It also increased its distrution business of other none competing RC products.\n\n===2020s===\nIn January 2020 Schumacher won IFMAR 1/12 World Championships held in [[Milton Keynes]]\n\n==Racing Success==\n\n===World Championships===\n\nPodiums\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Cecil spotted his workmates driving radio-controlled cars on the company's helipad and decided it needed a [[ball differential]] after noticing the cars skittered.   He soon started noticing large areas that these early primitive cars could be improved. Having noticed high tyre wear he introduced the [[ball differential]] to radio-controlled cars.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Cecil|publisher=RC Racing TV|year=2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsIX5J9mbhs|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Burr|2015|p=156 }}\n\nThese ball differentials were used by his son Robin then his friends then local model shop requested to stock it and soon international orders followed. It came to the point that Cecil Schumacher was making more money from this side business than through his employer. So in 1981 Schumacher Racing Products was formed in [[Northampton]], England.\n\nThe company has always operated out of Northampton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioracecar.com/article.aspx?a=4875 |title=The Hobby Hub |publisher=Radioracecar.com |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> but sourced some components from China like most other successful RC companies; however, the majority of manufacturing remains in England and Schumacher remains very much an English company. Cecil Schumacher's son Robin Schumacher took over the business in 2001.\n\n===1980s===\nThe first car to be produced by Schumacher was the XL Lexan chassis pan car in 1981 which had intentionally highly flexible chassis suitable for indoor racing. This was followed in 1983 by the \"C\" car which was made out of fibreglass reinforced epoxy resin sheet and designed specifically for racing on carpet. It included many features that are still around on every modern 1/12-scale car; race wins include the euros in 1985 and 1988.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1980s, [[off-road]] RC cars increased in popularity. In 1986 the first [[4WD]] [[1:10 radio-controlled off-road buggy|1/10-scale off-road buggy]] was launched, called the SWB CAT. This launched the CAT (Competition All Terrain) brand for Schumacher. This first variant SWB (Short Wheel Base) 4WD car was an instant success with serious RC fans with its popularity cemented into history when [[Masami Hirosaka]] won the 1987 [[IFMAR]] off-road RC World Championships<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUSO_QwBrhU |title=Past IFMAR WC\u00b4s \u2013 1987 IFMAR Worlds Championship |via=YouTube |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> having been lent a works car after Schumacher scouts noted his driving form during practice sessions.\n\n===1990s===\nFollowing the success of the first generation of off-road CATs, Schumacher continued to produce many successful off and on-road electric cars. The popularity of the touring car class seriously affected the off-road world during the 1990s. Schumacher stepped down the development of this class through the 1990s. Schumacher was then starting to dominate a niche in the \"fun\" car sector, with high-power/speed [[Nitromethane|nitro]]-powered models capable of real speeds in excess of 80&nbsp;mph.\n\n===2000s===\nOver the turn of this century the Schumacher product line-up became quite familiar with the \"fun\" cars with increasing number of nitro products; however it remained in the 1/10 competition touring cars market. \n\n===2010s===\nThe flood of cheap high-volume low-margin ready to run cars produced in Asia meant the company no longer produce a nitro car or fun car. Schumacher now concentrate on the high level 1/10-scale electrical competitive market. Alongside their Mi touring car range the company re-entered the off-road scene with the CAT SX (4WD) and Cougar SV (2WD). Vintage racing of older designed cars became popular with Schumacher re-releasing the CAT XLS in 2017 and then the Top Cat. In the mid 2010's a move was made to help the sport grow with the introduction of a number of lower priced competition cars. The Mi1 touring car was introduced alongside the ever evolving top spec version. And then a move was made to re-establish 1/12th electric carpet racing with the launch of the Supastock and Eclipse range. It also increased its distrution business of other none competing RC products.\n\n===2020s===\nIn January 2020 Schumacher won IFMAR 1/12 World Championships held in [[Milton Keynes]]\n\n==Racing Success==\n\n===World Championships===\n\nPodiums\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

His early studies were at [[Lourdes School of Quezon City|Lourdes School]] ([[Quezon City]]), Sacred Heart School and University of Southern Philippines ([[Cebu City]]). As a [[Rotex Scholar]] in [[Arvada, Colorado|Arvada West, Colorado]], he was trained by David Helm in drama and by Rex Nelson in music.\n\nUpon his return to [[Manila]], he was hired by advertising company [[Dentsu]] to join its copy department and within three months, he was promoted to copy chief at the age of eighteen. After two years he moved to working in theatre.\n\nHe was mentored in voice by his uncle, the baritone Aurelio Santos Estanislao, who at that time headed the Voice Department at the College of Music, [[University of the Philippines]]. Santos joined Repertory Philippines<ref name=\"Valle\">Valle, Jet (1996) \"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ip8VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1goEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3518,338873&dq=freddie-santos&hl=en The Audacious Freddie Santos]\", ''[[Manila Standard]]'', March 2, 1996, p. 31B, retrieved 2011-06-27</ref> as well as Teatro Pilipino, Musical Theater Philippines, and SRO Philippines.\n\nAt 20, he was awarded ''Most Outstanding Youth'' in Theatre. He was professionally involved, either as actor, coach, assistant director or director in more than a hundred stage plays and musicales. After five years with Repertory Philippines where he was also active in the research and publicity committees, he eventually moved to SRO Philippines where the focus was on [[dinner theater]] and where he found the freedom to further develop his other skills. Here, Santos wrote an original play adapted from the book ''Paper Moon'' and headlined by a very young [[Lea Salonga]] during its premiere run. He also nurtured his skill in [[stage lighting]], [[make-up]] and [[choreography]].\n\nA major highlight of his theater career came in the early 80's where he toured the musical ''Walang Sugat'' (No Wound) through 10 cities in America as Technical Director, honing his craft as he worked the technical controls of places like the San Francisco Opera House, the Chicago Civic Opera House, and Avery Fisher Hall at the Lincoln Center, among others.\n\nAll told, Freddie Santos has been involved with the [[performing arts]] for over forty years now, winning thrice the [[Aliw Awards|Aliw Award]] for ''Best Stage Director'' in the country, the first to win the award in both categories of Stage Musical ('87, '00) and Concert ('08).\n\nHe has written and staged the musical plays ''First Name'', ''Joseph the Dreamer''<ref name=\"MS2\">\"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_5ROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2AoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3697,4107995&dq=freddie-santos&hl=en Joseph the Dreamer: A Message of Hope]\", ''[[Manila Standard]]'', December 28, 1992, p. 19, retrieved 2011-06-27</ref>, ''So David...,'' ''Widows, Orphans, and Wildebeests''<ref name=\"Valle\" />, ''Il Divino'', and ''SABEL: Love and Passion''.\n\n==Music career==\nIn the 90's, Santos also began singing in lounges, and his weekly comedy acts at Tita Lola's Caf\u00e9 Alvarado became quite popular with young professionals, garnering him rave reviews in the papers. It was then he was asked to direct a lounge show by [[jazz]] queen Jacqui Magno and its impact on his life encouraged him to abandon his performing career to fast become one of the country's top concert directors with a distinctive crossover directorial style that combines theater with [[Pop music|pop]] and cutting-edge technology. To date, he has written, designed and/or directed more than 400 pop, [[rock and roll]], and [[Classical music|classical]] concerts totaling over 1,500 performances, working with artists such as Lea Salonga, Monique Wilson, Regine Velasquez<ref name=\"Valle\" />, Joey Albert, Gary Valenciano, [[Jamie Rivera]],<ref name=\"MS1\">\"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eZkVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kAsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5977,2620520&dq=freddie-santos&hl=en Jamie Sings]\", ''[[Manila Standard]]'', June 15, 1989, p. 27, retrieved 2011-06-27</ref> Janno Gibbs, Ogie Alcasid, The Dawn, NeoColours, Introvoys, Raymond Lauchengco, Rico J.

He has directed over two dozen reunion homecomings of the country's most prestigious schools like La Salle, St. Scholastica's, Assumption, and St. Therese's College, Manila.\n\nHe has done quite a number of [[spoken word]] recordings, several of which serve as vocal guide for the permanent exhibits of the Ayala Museum in Makati, and the Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite. His recordings were aired as well in several countries on European Radio. Several of his sessions were aired on national television in two high-rating weekly musical shows and in a well-received podcast -- one of the first Filipinos to air one.\n\nHe was regularly viewed on GMA-7 as one of the judges in the high-rating Starstruck and Celebrity Duets.\n\nIn television, Santos directed '''Yan Ang Bata'' (Ch7, Catholic Mass Media Awards Winner), ''Musikatbp.'' (Ch5, 13, CMMA Winner), ''The Manilyn Reynes Musical Show'' (Ch13), ''The CBN Drama Special'' (USA, Sequence Director), ''Mikael'' (Indonesia, Sequence Director), ''Love Lea'' (Ch4, Sequence Director), ''Triple Treat'' (Ch2 Sequence Director), and 24 music videos for Ch13.\n\nHis latest achievement in video is the 10-part documentary on the life and works of International Spanish artist, Philippine Presidential Order of Merit Recipient, and Cross of Isabella Awardee -- Juvenal Sanso.\n\nSince the 1990s, he has also been a board member of House of Refuge, a shelter devoted to looking after abused and abandoned streetchildren. \n\nIn exploring new techniques and formats, Santos wrote ''Sabel:Love and Passion''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/97150-iza-calzado-bencab-sabel-love-and-passion|title=Iza Calzado on her role in 'Sabel: Love and Passion'|last=Villano|first=Alexa|website=Rappler|language=en|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> which combined poetry/ballet/pop singing/telenovela into a 1 \u00bd-hour spectacle.

But for several straight years, he served as director of the annual anniversary staging of the Aliw Awards, headlining its Hall of Famers.\n\nOver the decades, unsurprisingly, Santos was part of the formation of several crucial coalitions, among them, the ''Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-Aawit'' (Organization of Philippine Singers), ''Philstage'' (composed of various professional theater and dance companies), and ''Trumpets'', Asia's first fully-professional gospel theatre group. \n\nIn 2018, he shifted once more in his career path and joined Manila Hotel, one of Asia's oldest and most prestigious hotels, to become its Events Consultant primarily handling entertainment. In line with this, he took charge of Manila Hotel's CSR campaign involving  the clean-up of Manila Bay, and for which Santos directed nearly 3 dozen short videos in 2019 featuring local art and showbiz personalities. With National Artist Ryan Cayabyab writing the music, Santos penned the lyrics of the theme song of the campaign: ''Manila Bay, Atin 'to!'' (This is ours!). In the same year, Santos wrote three dozen poems which he produced into a video book with the help of Strong Media Corporation of Enar and Sisa Karlsson. Entitled ''Random:Unsung,'' the poems were done in spoken word by Santos, Isabella Gonzales, and Jamie Wilson.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, he was granted his own star in the Eastwood Walk of Fame, and in 2020, he was unanimously voted to be given the Natatanging Buhay (Distinguished Life) Award by Philstage. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Santos, Direk Freddie}}\n[[Category:Filipino male actors]]\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Cebu City]]\n[[Category:Male actors from Cebu]]\n[[Category:Singers from Cebu]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{BLP sources|date=June 2011}}\n{{COI|date=February 2020}}\n}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name               = Direk Freddie Santos\n| image              = \n| imagesize          = \n| caption            = Direk Freddie Santos\n| birth_name         = \n| birth_date         = {{birth date and age|mf=yes|1956|2|29}}\n| birth_place        = [[Cebu City]], [[Philippines]]\n| death_date         = \n| death_place        = \n| occupation         = Theatre and Concert Director|\n}}\n\n'''Direk Freddie Santos''' (born February 29, 1956) is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] theatre and concert director.\n\n==Theatre career==\nSantos was born in Quezon City, Metro Manila.

He also nurtured his skill in [[stage lighting]], [[make-up]] and [[choreography]].\n\nA major highlight of his theater career came in the early 80's where he toured the musical ''Walang Sugat'' (No Wound) through 10 cities in America as Technical Director, honing his craft as he worked the technical controls of places like the San Francisco Opera House, the Chicago Civic Opera House, and Avery Fisher Hall at the Lincoln Center, among others.\n\nAll told, Freddie Santos has been involved with the [[performing arts]] for over forty years now, winning thrice the [[Aliw Awards|Aliw Award]] for ''Best Stage Director'' in the country, the first to win the award in both categories of Stage Musical ('87, '00) and Concert ('08).\n\nHe has written and staged the musical plays ''First Name'', ''Joseph the Dreamer''<ref name=\"MS2\">\"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_5ROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2AoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3697,4107995&dq=freddie-santos&hl=en Joseph the Dreamer: A Message of Hope]\", ''[[Manila Standard]]'', December 28, 1992, p. 19, retrieved 2011-06-27</ref>, ''So David...,'' ''Widows, Orphans, and Wildebeests''<ref name=\"Valle\" />, ''Il Divino'', and ''SABEL: Love and Passion''.\n\n==Music career==\nIn the 90's, Santos also began singing in lounges, and his weekly comedy acts at Tita Lola's Caf\u00e9 Alvarado became quite popular with young professionals, garnering him rave reviews in the papers. It was then he was asked to direct a lounge show by [[jazz]] queen Jacqui Magno and its impact on his life encouraged him to abandon his performing career to fast become one of the country's top concert directors with a distinctive crossover directorial style that combines theater with [[Pop music|pop]] and cutting-edge technology. To date, he has written, designed and/or directed more than 400 pop, [[rock and roll]], and [[Classical music|classical]] concerts totaling over 1,500 performances, working with artists such as Lea Salonga, Monique Wilson, Regine Velasquez<ref name=\"Valle\" />, Joey Albert, Gary Valenciano, [[Jamie Rivera]],<ref name=\"MS1\">\"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eZkVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kAsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5977,2620520&dq=freddie-santos&hl=en Jamie Sings]\", ''[[Manila Standard]]'', June 15, 1989, p. 27, retrieved 2011-06-27</ref> Janno Gibbs, Ogie Alcasid, The Dawn, NeoColours, Introvoys, Raymond Lauchengco, Rico J.

He has directed over two dozen reunion homecomings of the country's most prestigious schools like La Salle, St. Scholastica's, Assumption, and St. Therese's College, Manila.\n\nHe has done quite a number of [[spoken word]] recordings, several of which serve as vocal guide for the permanent exhibits of the Ayala Museum in Makati, and the Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite. His recordings were aired as well in several countries on European Radio. Several of his sessions were aired on national television in two high-rating weekly musical shows and in a well-received podcast -- one of the first Filipinos to air one.\n\nHe was regularly viewed on GMA-7 as one of the judges in the high-rating Starstruck and Celebrity Duets.\n\nIn television, Santos directed '''Yan Ang Bata'' (Ch7, Catholic Mass Media Awards Winner), ''Musikatbp.'' (Ch5, 13, CMMA Winner), ''The Manilyn Reynes Musical Show'' (Ch13), ''The CBN Drama Special'' (USA, Sequence Director), ''Mikael'' (Indonesia, Sequence Director), ''Love Lea'' (Ch4, Sequence Director), ''Triple Treat'' (Ch2 Sequence Director), and 24 music videos for Ch13.\n\nHis latest achievement in video is the 10-part documentary on the life and works of International Spanish artist, Philippine Presidential Order of Merit Recipient, and Cross of Isabella Awardee -- Juvenal Sanso.\n\nSince the 1990s, he has also been a board member of House of Refuge, a shelter devoted to looking after abused and abandoned streetchildren. \n\nIn exploring new techniques and formats, Santos wrote ''Sabel:Love and Passion''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/97150-iza-calzado-bencab-sabel-love-and-passion|title=Iza Calzado on her role in 'Sabel: Love and Passion'|last=Villano|first=Alexa|website=Rappler|language=en|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> which combined poetry/ballet/pop singing/telenovela into a 1 \u00bd-hour spectacle.

But for several straight years, he served as director of the annual anniversary staging of the Aliw Awards, headlining its Hall of Famers.\n\nOver the decades, unsurprisingly, Santos was part of the formation of several crucial coalitions, among them, the ''Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-Aawit'' (Organization of Philippine Singers), ''Philstage'' (composed of various professional theater and dance companies), and ''Trumpets'', Asia's first fully-professional gospel theatre group. \n\nIn 2018, he shifted once more in his career path and joined Manila Hotel, one of Asia's oldest and most prestigious hotels, to become its Events Consultant primarily handling entertainment. In line with this, he took charge of Manila Hotel's CSR campaign involving  the clean-up of Manila Bay, and for which Santos directed nearly 3 dozen short videos in 2019 featuring local art and showbiz personalities. With National Artist Ryan Cayabyab writing the music, Santos penned the lyrics of the theme song of the campaign: ''Manila Bay, Atin 'to!'' (This is ours!). In the same year, Santos wrote three dozen poems which he produced into a video book with the help of Strong Media Corporation of Enar and Sisa Karlsson. Entitled ''Random:Unsung,'' the poems were done in spoken word by Santos, Isabella Gonzales, and Jamie Wilson.\n\nIn the mid-2010's, he was granted his own star in the Eastwood Walk of Fame, and in 2020, he was unanimously voted to be given the Natatanging Buhay (Distinguished Life) Award by Philstage. \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Santos, Direk Freddie}}\n[[Category:Filipino male actors]]\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Cebu City]]\n[[Category:Male actors from Cebu]]\n[[Category:Singers from Cebu]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direk_Freddie_Santos"}

DeGowin and his team were able to refrigerate, ship and use banked blood. \n*In 1971, the world's first horizontal gastroplasty surgery for [[morbid obesity]] was performed at the hospital. \n*In 1982, UI Hospitals and Clinics otolaryngologists were the first in the U.S. to implant a multichannel [[cochlear implant]], a device meant to help deaf patients hear sounds that can be interpreted as speech.\n* First research center to discover the gene for open-angle glaucoma.\n* First hospital in the world to use robotic surgery for removal of an adrenal carcinoma (an aggressive deadly tumor) and an adrenal mass from a pediatric patient.\n* World's smallest patient (Nissen fundoplication in a 5.7 pound infant) to undergo gastric reflux surgery using the da Vinci robotic surgical system.\n* First hospital in the U.S. to perform digital breast [[tomosynthesis]] imaging, which allows physicians to \"page through\" the interior of the breast without the superimposition of the other tissues.\n*Development of the [[Ponseti method]], a non-surgical method of correcting congenital [[clubfoot]], which had previously been treated through surgeries to infants or children at a young age. The Ponseti method is a way to treat clubfoot through a series of manipulating bones and tendons in the foot and holding them in place through a series of casts. It is a treatment technique that is still used worldwide to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uichildrens.org/|title=University of Iowa Children's Hospital|website=University of Iowa Children's Hospital}}</ref>\n\n==Related institutions==\n===Carver College of Medicine===\n{{See also|Roy J. and Lucille A.

Historically, they have sometimes taken the form of [[anagram]]s, Graecisms, and [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinisations]], although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.<ref>Peschke (2006, vii).</ref>\n\nPseudonyms should not be confused with new names that replace old ones and become the individual's full-time name. Pseudonyms are \"part-time\" names, used only in certain contexts \u2013 to provide a more clear-cut separation between one's private and professional lives, to showcase or enhance a particular persona, or to hide an individual's real identity, as with writers' [[pen name]]s, [[graffiti]] artists' tags, [[Resistance movement|resistance fighters']] or [[terrorist|terrorists']] ''noms de guerre'', and computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]' [[User (computing)|handles]]. [[Actor]]s, voice-over artists, musicians, and other performers sometimes use [[stage name]]s, for example, to better channel a relevant energy, gain a greater sense of security and comfort via privacy, more easily avoid troublesome fans/\"stalkers\", or to mask their ethnic backgrounds.\n\nIn some cases, pseudonyms are adopted because they are part of a cultural or organisational tradition: for example [[Religious name|devotional names]] used by members of some [[religious institute]]s, and \"cadre names\" used by [[Communist party]] leaders such as [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].\n\nA pseudonym may also be used for personal reasons: for example, an individual may prefer to be called or known by a name that differs from their given or [[legal name]], but is not ready to take the numerous steps to get their name [[Name change|legally changed]]; or an individual may simply feel that the context and content of an exchange offer no rceason, legal or otherwise, to provide their given or legal name.\n\nA ''collective name'' or ''collective pseudonym'' is one shared by two or more persons, for example the co-authors of a work, such as [[Carolyn Keene]], [[Ellery Queen]], [[Nicolas Bourbaki]], or [[James S. A. Corey]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''pseudonym'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|\u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd}} (''pseud\u1e53nymon''), literally \"false name\", from {{lang|grc|\u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}} (''pse\u00fbdos''), \"lie, falsehood\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dyeu%3Ddos \u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2],\nHenry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project</ref> and {{lang|grc|\u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1}} (''\u00f3noma''), \"name\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29%2Fnoma \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project</ref> The term ''alias'' is a Latin [[adverb]] meaning \"at another time, elsewhere\".<ref>Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928</ref>\n\n==Distinction from allonyms, ghost writers and pseudepigrapha==\n\nA pseudonym is distinct from an ''allonym'', which is the (real) name of another person, assumed by the author of a work of art.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turco|first1=Lewis|title=The Book of Literary Terms: The Genres of Fiction, Drama, Nonfiction, Literary Criticism, and Scholarship|date=1999|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover and London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofliteraryte0000turc/page/182 182]|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofliteraryte0000turc|url-access=registration|quote=allonym.|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> This may occur when someone is [[ghostwriting]] a book or play, or in [[parody]], or when using a \"front\" name, such as by [[screenwriter]]s [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] in [[Hollywood]] in the 1950s and 1960s. See also [[pseudepigraph]], for ''falsely'' attributed authorship.\n\n==Usage==\n===Legal name change===\nSometimes people change their name in such a manner that the new name becomes permanent and is used by all who know the person. This is not an alias or pseudonym, but in fact a new name. In many countries, including [[common law]] countries, a name change can be ratified by a court and become a person's new legal name.\n\nFor example, in the 1960s, black civil rights campaigner [[Malcolm X|Malcolm Little]] changed his surname to \"X\", to represent his unknown African ancestral name that had been lost when his ancestors were brought to North America as slaves. He then changed his name again to Malik El-Shabazz when he converted to Islam.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Likewise some Jews adopted Hebrew family names upon immigrating to [[Israel]], dropping surnames that had been in their families for generations. The politician [[David Ben-Gurion]], for example, was born David Gr\u00fcn in Poland. He adopted his Hebrew name in 1910, when he published his first article in a Zionist journal in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/biography-david-ben-gurion/5810.aspx|title= Biography David Ben-Gurion: For the Love of Zion|access-date=2017-06-01}}</ref> Many [[transgender]] people also choose to adopt a new name, typically around the time of their [[Transitioning (transgender)|social transitioning]], to match their desired gender better than their birth name.\n\n===Concealing identity===\n====Business====\nBusinesspersons of ethnic minorities in some parts of the world are sometimes advised by an employer to use a pseudonym that is common or acceptable in that area when conducting business, to overcome [[racial bias|racial]] or religious [[Bias#Prejudices|bias]].<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and ''The New York Times (N.Y.: Random House, [2nd printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-394-58452-X}})), p. 221. In 1968, one such employer was [[The New York Times]], the affected workers were classified-advertising takers, and the renaming was away from [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Italian people|Italian]] names to ones \"with a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] flavor\".</ref>\n\n====Criminal activity====\nCriminals may use aliases, [[fictitious business names]], and [[dummy corporations]] ([[corporate shells]]) to hide their identity, or to impersonate other persons or entities in order to commit fraud. Aliases and fictitious business names used for dummy corporations may become so complex that, in the words of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', \"getting to the truth requires a walk down a bizarre labyrinth\" and multiple government agencies may become involved to uncover the truth.<ref name=RTR>The Ruse That Roared, ''The Washington Post'', 5 November 1995, Richard Leiby, James Lileks</ref>\n\n====Literature====\n[[File:Die junge George Sand.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A young [[George Sand]] (real name \"Amantine Lucile Dupin\")]]\n\nA [[pen name]], or ''\"nom de plume\"'' (French for \"pen name\"), is a pseudonym (sometimes a particular form of the real name) adopted by an [[author]] (or on the author's behalf by their publishers).\n\nSome female authors used male pen names, in particular in the 19th century, when writing was a male-dominated profession. The [[Bront\u00eb family|Bront\u00eb sisters]] used pen names for their early work, so as not to reveal their gender (see below) and so that local residents would not know that the books related to people of the neighbourhood. The Bront\u00ebs used their neighbours as inspiration for characters in many of their books. [[Anne Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848) was published under the name Acton Bell, while [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] used the name Currer Bell for ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847) and ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' (1849), and [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] adopted Ellis Bell as cover for ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' (1847). Other examples from the nineteenth-century are the novelist Mary Ann Evans ([[George Eliot]]) and the French writer Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin ([[George Sand]]). Pseudonyms may also be used due to cultural or organization or political prejudices.\n\nOn the other hand, some 20th and 21st-century male romance novelists have used female pen names.<ref name=maleauthors>{{cite news |last=Naughton |first=Julie |title=Yes, Virgil, There Are Men Writing Romance: Focus on Romance 2012 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/52473-yes-virgil-there-are-men-writing-romance-focus-on-romance-2012.html |accessdate=6 May 2014 |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=1 June 2012}}</ref> A few examples are Brindle Chase, [[Peter O'Donnell]] (as Madeline Brent), [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] (as Penny Sutton and Rosie Dixon), and [[Hugh C. Rae]] (as Jessica Sterling).<ref name=\"maleauthors\" />\n\nA pen name may be used if a writer's real name is likely to be confused with the name of another writer or notable individual, or if the real name is deemed unsuitable.\n\nAuthors who write both fiction and non-fiction, or in different [[genres]], may use different pen names to avoid confusing their readers. For example, the romance writer [[Nora Roberts]] writes mystery novels under the name [[J. D. Robb]].\n\nIn some cases, an author may become better known by his pen name than his real name. A famous example is Samuel Clemens, writing as [[Mark Twain]]. The British [[mathematician]] Charles Dodgson wrote fantasy novels as [[Lewis Carroll]] and mathematical treatises under his own name.\n\nSome authors, such as [[Harold Robbins]], use several literary pseudonyms.<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/books/pseud_r.htm Rubin, Harold Francis (1916\u2013)], Author Pseudonyms: R. Accessed 27 November 2009.</ref>\n\nSome pen names have been used for long periods, even decades, without the author's true identity being discovered, as with [[Elena Ferrante]] and [[Torsten Krol]].\n\nSome pen names are not strictly pseudonyms, as they are simply variants of the authors' actual names. The authors [[C. L. Moore|C.L. Moore]] and [[S. E. Hinton|S.E. Hinton]] were female authors who used the initialled forms of their full names, Moore being Catherine Lucille Moore, writing in the 1930s male-dominated science fiction genre, and Hinton, (author of ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'') Susan Eloise Hinton. ''[[Star Trek]]'' writer [[D. C. Fontana|D.C. Fontana]] (Dorothy Catherine) wrote using her own abbreviated name and under the pen names Michael Richards and J. Michael Bingham. Author [[V. C.

Some prolific authors adopt a pseudonym to disguise the extent of their published output, e. g. [[Stephen King]] writing as [[Richard Bachman]]. Co-authors may choose to publish under a collective pseudonym, e. g., [[P. J. Tracy]] and [[Perri O'Shaughnessy]]. [[Frederic Dannay]] and [[Manfred Lee]] used the name [[Ellery Queen]] as a pen name for their collaborative works and as the name of their main character.\n\n\"Why do authors choose pseudonyms?

They were: \u00c9mile Ajar, like Romain Gary before him, was awarded the prestigious [[Prix Goncourt]] by a jury unaware that they were the same person. Similarly, TV actor [[Ronnie Barker]] submitted comedy material under the name Gerald Wiley.\n\nA collective pseudonym may represent an entire publishing house, or any contributor to a long-running series, especially with juvenile literature. Examples include [[Watty Piper]], [[Victor Appleton]], [[Erin Hunter]], and Kamiru M. Xhan.\n\nAnother use of a pseudonym in literature is to present a story as being written by the fictional characters in the story. The series of novels known as ''[[A Series Of Unfortunate Events]]'' are written by [[Daniel Handler]] under the pen name of [[Lemony Snicket]], a character in the series. This applies also to some of the several 18th-century English and American writers who used the name [[Fidelia (pseudonym)|Fidelia]].\n\nAn '''anonymity pseudonym''' or [[multiple-use name]] is a name used by many different people to protect anonymity.<ref Name=\"Home\">{{cite book\n|title= Mind Invaders: A Reader in Psychic Warfare, Cultural Sabotage and Semiotic Terrorism\n|last= Home\n|first= Stewart\n|authorlink= Stewart Home\n|year= 1997\n|publisher= Serpent's Tail\n|location= Indiana University\n|isbn= 1-85242-560-1\n|page= 119\n|url= https://books.google.com/?id=xdXfAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Multiple-use+name%22&dq=%22Multiple-use+name%22}}</ref> It is a strategy that has been adopted by many unconnected radical groups and by cultural groups, where the construct of personal identity has been criticised.

These pseudonyms had an official character and were the predecessor of [[Dog tag|identification numbers]]: soldiers were identified by their first names, their family names, and their ''noms de guerre'' (e. g. ''Jean Amarault dit Lafid\u00e9lit\u00e9''). These pseudonyms were usually related to the soldier's place of origin (e. g. ''Jean Deslandes dit Champigny'', for a soldier coming from a town named [[Champigny (disambiguation)|Champigny]]), or to a particular physical or personal trait (e. g. ''Antoine Bonnet dit Prettaboire'', for a soldier ''pr\u00eat \u00e0 boire'', ready to drink). In 1716, a ''nom de guerre'' was mandatory for every soldier; officers did not adopt ''noms de guerre'' as they considered them derogatory. In daily life, these aliases could replace the real family name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.histori.ca/prodev/article.do?id=15333 |title=Home &#124; Historica \u2013 Dominion |publisher=Historica |date= |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n''Noms de guerre'' were adopted for security reasons by members of the [[World War II]] [[French resistance]] and [[Polish underground state|Polish resistance]]. Such pseudonyms are often adopted by military special-forces soldiers, such as members of the SAS and similar units of [[Resistance movement|resistance fighters]], [[terrorism|terrorists]], and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]]. This practice hides their identities and may protect their families from reprisals; it may also be a form of [[wikt:dissociation|dissociation]] from domestic life. Some well-known men who adopted ''noms de guerre'' include Carlos, for [[Ilich Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez]]; [[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] of [[West Germany]]; and [[Subcomandante Marcos]], spokesman of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} During [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]'s underground fight against the British in [[Mandatory Palestine]], the organization's commander [[Yitzchak Shamir]] (later [[Prime Minister of Israel]]) adopted the ''nom de guerre'' \"Michael\", in honour of [[Ireland]]'s [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]].\n\nRevolutionaries and resistance leaders, such as [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], [[Golda Meir]], [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], and [[Josip Broz Tito]], often adopted their ''noms de guerre'' as their proper names after the struggle. [[George Grivas]], the Greek-Cypriot [[EOKA]] militant, adopted the ''nom de guerre'' Digenis (\u0394\u03b9\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2). In the [[French Foreign Legion]], recruits can adopt a pseudonym to break with their past lives. Mercenaries have long used \"noms de guerre\", sometimes even multiple identities, depending on country, conflict and circumstance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Some of the most familiar noms de guerre today are the [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]] used by Islamic [[mujahideen]]. These take the form of a [[teknonym]], either literal or figurative.\n\n====Online activity====\nIndividuals using a computer [[online]] may adopt or be required to use a form of pseudonym known as a \"handle\" (a term deriving from [[CB slang]]), \"[[User (computing)|user]] name\", \"[[Logging (computer security)|login]] name\", \"[[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]\", or, sometimes, \"[[Screen name (computing)|screen name]]\", \"[[gamertag]]\" \"IGN ('''I'''n '''G'''ame ('''N'''ick)'''N'''ame)\" or \"[[nickname]]\". On the Internet, [[pseudonymous remailer]]s use [[cryptography]] that achieves persistent [[pseudonymity]], so that two-way communication can be achieved, and reputations can be established, without linking physical [[identity theft|identities]] to their respective pseudonyms. [[Aliasing (computing)|Aliasing]] is the use of multiple names for the same data location.\n\nMore sophisticated cryptographic systems, such as anonymous [[digital credential]]s, enable users to communicate pseudonymously (i. e., by identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms). In well-defined abuse cases, a designated authority may be able to revoke the pseudonyms and reveal the individuals' real identity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nUse of pseudonyms is common among professional [[eSports]] players, despite the fact that many professional games are played on [[LAN]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ongamers.com/articles/why-esports-needs-to-ditch-online-aliases/1100-205/ |title=Why esports needs to ditch online aliases |first=Taylor |last=Cocke |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Privacy====\nPeople seeking privacy often use pseudonyms to make appointments and reservations.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Harriet |last1=Ryan |first2=Kimi |last2=Yoshino |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-jackson17-2009jul17,0,3782664.story |title=Investigators target Michael Jackson's pseudonyms |publisher=Latimes.com |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> Those writing to [[advice column]]s in newspapers and magazines may use pseudonyms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?nid=4TOpqqG69KYC&dat=18830407&printsec=frontpage |title=''Toronto Daily Mail, \"Women's Kingdom\", \"A Delicate Question\", April 7, 1883, page 5 |date= |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> [[Steve Wozniak]] used a pseudonym when attending the [[University of California, Berkeley]] after co-founding [[Apple Computer]], because \"I knew I wouldn't have time enough to be an A+ student.\"<ref name=\"stix19860514\">{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1986-05-14/news/vw-5389_1_steve-wozniak |title=A UC Berkeley Degree Is Now the Apple of Steve Wozniak's Eye |work=Los Angeles Times |date=14 May 1986 |accessdate=5 January 2015 |author=Stix, Harriet}}</ref>\n\n===Stage names===\n{{main|Stage name}}\nWhen used by an [[actor]], [[musician]], radio [[disc jockey]], [[model (person)|model]], or other performer or \"[[show business]]\" personality a pseudonym is called a ''stage name'', or, occasionally, a ''professional name'', or ''screen name''.\n\n====Film, theatre, and related activities====\nMembers of a marginalized ethnic or religious group have often adopted stage names, typically changing their surname or entire name to mask their original background.\n\nStage names are also used to create a more marketable name, as in the case of Creighton Tull Chaney, who adopted the pseudonym [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], a reference to his famous father [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]\n\n[[Chris Curtis]] of [[Deep Purple]] fame was christened as Christopher Crummey (\"crumby\" is UK slang for poor quality). In this and similar cases a stage name is adopted simply to avoid an unfortunate [[pun]].\n\nPseudonyms are also used to comply with the rules of [[performing arts]] [[guild]]s ([[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG), [[Writers Guild of America, East]] (WGA), [[AFTRA]], etc.), which do not allow performers to use an existing name, in order to avoid confusion. For example, these rules required film and television actor Michael Fox to add a middle initial and become [[Michael J. Fox]], to avoid being confused with another actor named [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]]. This was also true of author and actress [[Fannie Flagg]], who chose this pseudonym; her real name, Patricia Neal, being the name of [[Patricia Neal|another well-known actress]]; and British actor [[Stewart Granger]], whose real name was James Stewart. The film-making team of [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]], for instance, share credit for editing under the alias Roderick Jaynes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/01/roderick_jaynes_imaginary_osca.html |title=Roderick Jaynes, Imaginary Oscar Nominee for 'No Country' \u2013 Vulture |publisher=Nymag.com |date= |accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome stage names are used to conceal a person's identity, such as the pseudonym [[Alan Smithee]], which was used by directors in the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA) to remove their name from a film they feel was edited or modified beyond their artistic satisfaction.

Some such names have additional meanings, like that of Brian Hugh Warner, more commonly known as [[Marilyn Manson]]: Marilyn coming from [[Marilyn Monroe]] and Manson from convicted serial killer [[Charles Manson]]. [[Jacoby Shaddix]] of [[Papa Roach]] went under the name \"Coby Dick\" during the ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' era.

He also wrote songs as Skipper Adams. Danish pop pianist [[Bent Fabric]], whose full name is Bent Fabricius-Bjerre, wrote his biggest instrumental hit \"[[Alley Cat (song)|Alley Cat]]\" as Frank Bjorn.\n\nFor a time, the musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] used an unpronounceable \"[[Prince (musician)#Stage names|Love Symbol]]\" as a pseudonym (\"Prince\" is his actual first name rather than a stage name). He wrote the song \"[[Sugar Walls]]\" for [[Sheena Easton]] as \"Alexander Nevermind\" and \"[[Manic Monday]]\" for [[The Bangles]] as \"Christopher Tracy\". (He also produced albums early in his career as \"Jamie Starr\").\n\nMany Italian-American singers have used stage names, as their birth names were difficult to pronounce or considered too ethnic for American tastes. Singers changing their names included [[Dean Martin]] (born Dino Paul Crocetti), [[Connie Francis]] (born Concetta Franconero), [[Frankie Valli]] (born Francesco Castelluccio), [[Tony Bennett]] (born Anthony Benedetto), and [[Lady Gaga]] (born Stefani Germanotta)\n\nIn 2009, the British rock band [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] briefly changed its name to [[Renegades (band)|Renegades]] so it could play a whole show featuring a set list in which 95 per cent of the songs played were from their forthcoming new album of the same name, with none of their singles included. Front man [[Grant Nicholas]] felt that if they played as Feeder, there would be uproar over him not playing any of the singles, so used the pseudonym as a hint. A series of small shows were played in 2010, at 250- to 1,000-capacity venues with the plan not to say who the band really are and just announce the shows as if they were a new band.\n\nIn many cases, hip-hop and rap artist prefer to use pseudonyms that represents some variation of their name, personality, or interests. Examples include [[Iggy Azalea]] (her name comes from her dog name, Iggy, and her home street in [[Mullumbimby]], Azalea Street), [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] (who was known under at least six aliases), [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] (previously known at various times as Puffy, P. Diddy, and Puff Daddy), [[Ludacris]], [[Flo Rida]] (his name is a tribute to his home state, [[Florida]]), British-Jamaican hip-hop artist [[Stefflon Don]] (real name Stephanie Victoria Allen), [[LL Cool J]], and [[Chingy]]. [[Black metal]] artists also adopt pseudonyms, usually symbolizing dark values, such as [[Nocturno Culto]], [[Gaahl]], Abbath, and Silenoz. In punk and hardcore punk, singers and band members often replace real names with tougher-sounding stage names such as [[Sid Vicious]] (real name John Simon Ritchie) of the late 1970s band [[Sex Pistols]] and \"Rat\" of the early 1980s band [[The Varukers]] and the 2000s re-formation of [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]].

Pseudonyms are \"part-time\" names, used only in certain contexts \u2013 to provide a more clear-cut separation between one's private and professional lives, to showcase or enhance a particular persona, or to hide an individual's real identity, as with writers' [[pen name]]s, [[graffiti]] artists' tags, [[Resistance movement|resistance fighters']] or [[terrorist|terrorists']] ''noms de guerre'', and computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]' [[User (computing)|handles]]. [[Actor]]s, voice-over artists, musicians, and other performers sometimes use [[stage name]]s, for example, to better channel a relevant energy, gain a greater sense of security and comfort via privacy, more easily avoid troublesome fans/\"stalkers\", or to mask their ethnic backgrounds.\n\nIn some cases, pseudonyms are adopted because they are part of a cultural or organisational tradition: for example [[Religious name|devotional names]] used by members of some [[religious institute]]s, and \"cadre names\" used by [[Communist party]] leaders such as [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].\n\nA pseudonym may also be used for personal reasons: for example, an individual may prefer to be called or known by a name that differs from their given or [[legal name]], but is not ready to take the numerous steps to get their name [[Name change|legally changed]]; or an individual may simply feel that the context and content of an exchange offer no reason, legal or otherwise, to provide their given or legal name.\n\nA ''collective name'' or ''collective pseudonym'' is one shared by two or more persons, for example the co-authors of a work, such as [[Carolyn Keene]], [[Ellery Queen]], [[Nicolas Bourbaki]], or [[James S.

Corey]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''pseudonym'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|\u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd}} (''pseud\u1e53nymon''), literally \"false name\", from {{lang|grc|\u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}} (''pse\u00fbdos''), \"lie, falsehood\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dyeu%3Ddos \u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2],\nHenry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project</ref> and {{lang|grc|\u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1}} (''\u00f3noma''), \"name\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29%2Fnoma \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project</ref> The term ''alias'' is a Latin [[adverb]] meaning \"at another time, elsewhere\".<ref>Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928</ref>\n\n==Distinction from allonyms, ghost writers and pseudepigrapha==\n\nA pseudonym is distinct from an ''allonym'', which is the (real) name of another person, assumed by the author of a work of art.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turco|first1=Lewis|title=The Book of Literary Terms: The Genres of Fiction, Drama, Nonfiction, Literary Criticism, and Scholarship|date=1999|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover and London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofliteraryte0000turc/page/182 182]|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofliteraryte0000turc|url-access=registration|quote=allonym.|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> This may occur when someone is [[ghostwriting]] a book or play, or in [[parody]], or when using a \"front\" name, such as by [[screenwriter]]s [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] in [[Hollywood]] in the 1950s and 1960s. See also [[pseudepigraph]], for ''falsely'' attributed authorship.\n\n==Usage==\n===Legal name change===\nSometimes people change their name in such a manner that the new name becomes permanent and is used by all who know the person. This is not an alias or pseudonym, but in fact a new name. In many countries, including [[common law]] countries, a name change can be ratified by a court and become a person's new legal name.\n\nFor example, in the 1960s, black civil rights campaigner [[Malcolm X|Malcolm Little]] changed his surname to \"X\", to represent his unknown African ancestral name that had been lost when his ancestors were brought to North America as slaves. He then changed his name again to Malik El-Shabazz when he converted to Islam.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Likewise some Jews adopted Hebrew family names upon immigrating to [[Israel]], dropping surnames that had been in their families for generations. The politician [[David Ben-Gurion]], for example, was born David Gr\u00fcn in Poland. He adopted his Hebrew name in 1910, when he published his first article in a Zionist journal in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/biography-david-ben-gurion/5810.aspx|title= Biography David Ben-Gurion: For the Love of Zion|access-date=2017-06-01}}</ref> Many [[transgender]] people also choose to adopt a new name, typically around the time of their [[Transitioning (transgender)|social transitioning]], to match their desired gender better than their birth name.\n\n===Concealing identity===\n====Business====\nBusinesspersons of ethnic minorities in some parts of the world are sometimes advised by an employer to use a pseudonym that is common or acceptable in that area when conducting business, to overcome [[racial bias|racial]] or religious [[Bias#Prejudices|bias]].<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and ''The New York Times (N.Y.: Random House, [2nd printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-394-58452-X}})), p. 221.

Aliases and fictitious business names used for dummy corporations may become so complex that, in the words of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', \"getting to the truth requires a walk down a bizarre labyrinth\" and multiple government agencies may become involved to uncover the truth.<ref name=RTR>The Ruse That Roared, ''The Washington Post'', 5 November 1995, Richard Leiby, James Lileks</ref>\n\n====Literature====\n[[File:Die junge George Sand.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A young [[George Sand]] (real name \"Amantine Lucile Dupin\")]]\n\nA [[pen name]], or ''\"nom de plume\"'' (French for \"pen name\"), is a pseudonym (sometimes a particular form of the real name) adopted by an [[author]] (or on the author's behalf by their publishers).\n\nSome female authors used male pen names, in particular in the 19th century, when writing was a male-dominated profession. The [[Bront\u00eb family|Bront\u00eb sisters]] used pen names for their early work, so as not to reveal their gender (see below) and so that local residents would not know that the books related to people of the neighbourhood. The Bront\u00ebs used their neighbours as inspiration for characters in many of their books. [[Anne Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848) was published under the name Acton Bell, while [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] used the name Currer Bell for ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847) and ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' (1849), and [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] adopted Ellis Bell as cover for ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' (1847). Other examples from the nineteenth-century are the novelist Mary Ann Evans ([[George Eliot]]) and the French writer Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin ([[George Sand]]). Pseudonyms may also be used due to cultural or organization or political prejudices.\n\nOn the other hand, some 20th and 21st-century male romance novelists have used female pen names.<ref name=maleauthors>{{cite news |last=Naughton |first=Julie |title=Yes, Virgil, There Are Men Writing Romance: Focus on Romance 2012 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/52473-yes-virgil-there-are-men-writing-romance-focus-on-romance-2012.html |accessdate=6 May 2014 |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=1 June 2012}}</ref> A few examples are Brindle Chase, [[Peter O'Donnell]] (as Madeline Brent), [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] (as Penny Sutton and Rosie Dixon), and [[Hugh C.

For example, the romance writer [[Nora Roberts]] writes mystery novels under the name [[J. D. Robb]].\n\nIn some cases, an author may become better known by his pen name than his real name. A famous example is Samuel Clemens, writing as [[Mark Twain]]. The British [[mathematician]] Charles Dodgson wrote fantasy novels as [[Lewis Carroll]] and mathematical treatises under his own name.\n\nSome authors, such as [[Harold Robbins]], use several literary pseudonyms.<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/books/pseud_r.htm Rubin, Harold Francis (1916\u2013)], Author Pseudonyms: R. Accessed 27 November 2009.</ref>\n\nSome pen names have been used for long periods, even decades, without the author's true identity being discovered, as with [[Elena Ferrante]] and [[Torsten Krol]].\n\nSome pen names are not strictly pseudonyms, as they are simply variants of the authors' actual names. The authors [[C. L. Moore|C.L. Moore]] and [[S. E. Hinton|S.E. Hinton]] were female authors who used the initialled forms of their full names, Moore being Catherine Lucille Moore, writing in the 1930s male-dominated science fiction genre, and Hinton, (author of ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'') Susan Eloise Hinton. ''[[Star Trek]]'' writer [[D. C. Fontana|D.C. Fontana]] (Dorothy Catherine) wrote using her own abbreviated name and under the pen names Michael Richards and J. Michael Bingham. Author [[V. C. Andrews|V.C. Andrews]] intended to publish under her given name, Virginia Andrews, but was told that, due to a production error, her first novel was being released under the name of \"V.C.

Some prolific authors adopt a pseudonym to disguise the extent of their published output, e. g. [[Stephen King]] writing as [[Richard Bachman]]. Co-authors may choose to publish under a collective pseudonym, e. g., [[P. J. Tracy]] and [[Perri O'Shaughnessy]]. [[Frederic Dannay]] and [[Manfred Lee]] used the name [[Ellery Queen]] as a pen name for their collaborative works and as the name of their main character.\n\n\"Why do authors choose pseudonyms? It is rarely because they actually hope to stay anonymous forever,\" mused writer and columnist [[Russell Smith (writer)|Russell Smith]] in his review of the Canadian novel ''Into That Fire'' by the pseudonymous M.

Already a well-known writer, he started publishing books as [[\u00c9mile Ajar]] to test whether his new books would be well received on their own merits, without the aid of his established reputation. They were: \u00c9mile Ajar, like Romain Gary before him, was awarded the prestigious [[Prix Goncourt]] by a jury unaware that they were the same person. Similarly, TV actor [[Ronnie Barker]] submitted comedy material under the name Gerald Wiley.\n\nA collective pseudonym may represent an entire publishing house, or any contributor to a long-running series, especially with juvenile literature. Examples include [[Watty Piper]], [[Victor Appleton]], [[Erin Hunter]], and Kamiru M. Xhan.\n\nAnother use of a pseudonym in literature is to present a story as being written by the fictional characters in the story. The series of novels known as ''[[A Series Of Unfortunate Events]]'' are written by [[Daniel Handler]] under the pen name of [[Lemony Snicket]], a character in the series. This applies also to some of the several 18th-century English and American writers who used the name [[Fidelia (pseudonym)|Fidelia]].\n\nAn '''anonymity pseudonym''' or [[multiple-use name]] is a name used by many different people to protect anonymity.<ref Name=\"Home\">{{cite book\n|title= Mind Invaders: A Reader in Psychic Warfare, Cultural Sabotage and Semiotic Terrorism\n|last= Home\n|first= Stewart\n|authorlink= Stewart Home\n|year= 1997\n|publisher= Serpent's Tail\n|location= Indiana University\n|isbn= 1-85242-560-1\n|page= 119\n|url= https://books.google.com/?id=xdXfAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Multiple-use+name%22&dq=%22Multiple-use+name%22}}</ref> It is a strategy that has been adopted by many unconnected radical groups and by cultural groups, where the construct of personal identity has been criticised.

These pseudonyms had an official character and were the predecessor of [[Dog tag|identification numbers]]: soldiers were identified by their first names, their family names, and their ''noms de guerre'' (e. g. ''Jean Amarault dit Lafid\u00e9lit\u00e9''). These pseudonyms were usually related to the soldier's place of origin (e. g. ''Jean Deslandes dit Champigny'', for a soldier coming from a town named [[Champigny (disambiguation)|Champigny]]), or to a particular physical or personal trait (e. g. ''Antoine Bonnet dit Prettaboire'', for a soldier ''pr\u00eat \u00e0 boire'', ready to drink). In 1716, a ''nom de guerre'' was mandatory for every soldier; officers did not adopt ''noms de guerre'' as they considered them derogatory.

Such pseudonyms are often adopted by military special-forces soldiers, such as members of the SAS and similar units of [[Resistance movement|resistance fighters]], [[terrorism|terrorists]], and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]]. This practice hides their identities and may protect their families from reprisals; it may also be a form of [[wikt:dissociation|dissociation]] from domestic life. Some well-known men who adopted ''noms de guerre'' include Carlos, for [[Ilich Ram\u00edrez S\u00e1nchez]]; [[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] of [[West Germany]]; and [[Subcomandante Marcos]], spokesman of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} During [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]'s underground fight against the British in [[Mandatory Palestine]], the organization's commander [[Yitzchak Shamir]] (later [[Prime Minister of Israel]]) adopted the ''nom de guerre'' \"Michael\", in honour of [[Ireland]]'s [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]].\n\nRevolutionaries and resistance leaders, such as [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], [[Golda Meir]], [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], and [[Josip Broz Tito]], often adopted their ''noms de guerre'' as their proper names after the struggle. [[George Grivas]], the Greek-Cypriot [[EOKA]] militant, adopted the ''nom de guerre'' Digenis (\u0394\u03b9\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2). In the [[French Foreign Legion]], recruits can adopt a pseudonym to break with their past lives. Mercenaries have long used \"noms de guerre\", sometimes even multiple identities, depending on country, conflict and circumstance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Some of the most familiar noms de guerre today are the [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]] used by Islamic [[mujahideen]].

A number of popular budget LPs of piano music were released under the pseudonym [[Paul Procopolis]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Another example is that [[Paul McCartney]] used his fictional name \"Bernerd Webb\" for [[Peter and Gordon]]'s song [[Woman (Paul McCartney song)|Woman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/5579 |title=45cat - Peter And Gordon - Woman / Wrong From The Start - Capitol - USA - 5579 |publisher=45cat |accessdate=30 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nPseudonyms are used as stage names in [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, such as [[Tracii Guns]] in [[LA Guns]], [[Axl Rose]] and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] in [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Mick Mars]] in [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Dimebag Darrell]] in [[Pantera]], or [[C.C. Deville]] in [[Poison (American band)|Poison]]. Some such names have additional meanings, like that of Brian Hugh Warner, more commonly known as [[Marilyn Manson]]: Marilyn coming from [[Marilyn Monroe]] and Manson from convicted serial killer [[Charles Manson]]. [[Jacoby Shaddix]] of [[Papa Roach]] went under the name \"Coby Dick\" during the ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' era. He changed back to his birth name when ''[[lovehatetragedy]]'' was released.\n\n[[David Johansen]], front man for the hard rock band [[New York Dolls]], recorded and performed pop and lounge music under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The music video for Poindexter's debt single, [[Hot Hot Hot (Arrow song)#Buster Poindexter version|Hot Hot Hot]], opens with a monologue from Johansen where he notes his time with the New York Dolls and explains his desire to create more sophisticated music. \n\n[[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.]], creator of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], wrote original songs, arranged, and produced the records under his real name, but performed on them as [[David Seville]]. He also wrote songs as Skipper Adams. Danish pop pianist [[Bent Fabric]], whose full name is Bent Fabricius-Bjerre, wrote his biggest instrumental hit \"[[Alley Cat (song)|Alley Cat]]\" as Frank Bjorn.\n\nFor a time, the musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] used an unpronounceable \"[[Prince (musician)#Stage names|Love Symbol]]\" as a pseudonym (\"Prince\" is his actual first name rather than a stage name). He wrote the song \"[[Sugar Walls]]\" for [[Sheena Easton]] as \"Alexander Nevermind\" and \"[[Manic Monday]]\" for [[The Bangles]] as \"Christopher Tracy\". (He also produced albums early in his career as \"Jamie Starr\").\n\nMany Italian-American singers have used stage names, as their birth names were difficult to pronounce or considered too ethnic for American tastes. Singers changing their names included [[Dean Martin]] (born Dino Paul Crocetti), [[Connie Francis]] (born Concetta Franconero), [[Frankie Valli]] (born Francesco Castelluccio), [[Tony Bennett]] (born Anthony Benedetto), and [[Lady Gaga]] (born Stefani Germanotta)\n\nIn 2009, the British rock band [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] briefly changed its name to [[Renegades (band)|Renegades]] so it could play a whole show featuring a set list in which 95 per cent of the songs played were from their forthcoming new album of the same name, with none of their singles included. Front man [[Grant Nicholas]] felt that if they played as Feeder, there would be uproar over him not playing any of the singles, so used the pseudonym as a hint. A series of small shows were played in 2010, at 250- to 1,000-capacity venues with the plan not to say who the band really are and just announce the shows as if they were a new band.\n\nIn many cases, hip-hop and rap artist prefer to use pseudonyms that represents some variation of their name, personality, or interests. Examples include [[Iggy Azalea]] (her name comes from her dog name, Iggy, and her home street in [[Mullumbimby]], Azalea Street), [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] (who was known under at least six aliases), [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] (previously known at various times as Puffy, P. Diddy, and Puff Daddy), [[Ludacris]], [[Flo Rida]] (his name is a tribute to his home state, [[Florida]]), British-Jamaican hip-hop artist [[Stefflon Don]] (real name Stephanie Victoria Allen), [[LL Cool J]], and [[Chingy]]. [[Black metal]] artists also adopt pseudonyms, usually symbolizing dark values, such as [[Nocturno Culto]], [[Gaahl]], Abbath, and Silenoz. In punk and hardcore punk, singers and band members often replace real names with tougher-sounding stage names such as [[Sid Vicious]] (real name John Simon Ritchie) of the late 1970s band [[Sex Pistols]] and \"Rat\" of the early 1980s band [[The Varukers]] and the 2000s re-formation of [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]. The punk rock band [[The Ramones]] had every member take the last name of Ramone.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nHenry John Deutschendorf Jr., an American [[singer-songwriter]] used the stage name [[John Denver]]. The Australian country musician born Robert Lane changed his name to [[Tex Morton]].
