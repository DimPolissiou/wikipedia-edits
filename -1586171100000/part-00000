The writer V/D wrote of her for the punk [[Fanzines|fanzine]] ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'', \"On stage, Phranc looks like a 14-year-old runaway from a boys' reform school.\" The band was influential in the development of what later came to be known as '[[electropunk]]'.

She had a bleached blonde crewcut and wore male attire, creating an [[androgynous]] persona for her first band, [[Nervous Gender]], which formed in 1978. The writer V/D wrote of her for the punk [[Fanzines|fanzine]] ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'', \"On stage, Phranc looks like a 14-year-old runaway from a boys' reform school.\" The band was influential in the development of what later came to be known as '[[electropunk]]'. In 1980 she left Nervous Gender to join the punk band [[Catholic Discipline]], in which Craig Lee ([[Bags (Los Angeles band)|Bags]]) and [[Claude Bessy (singer)|Claude Bessy]], journalist for ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'' punk fanzine, were the lead singers. She was also in Castration Squad, a feminist, all-girl punk band which featured [[Dinah Cancer]] of [[45 Grave]], Elissa Bello of [[The Go-Go's]], [[Alice Bag]] of the [[Bags (Los Angeles band)|Bags]], Tracy Lea of [[Redd Kross]], and Shannon Wilhelm. Phranc appears with Catholic Discipline in the 1980 documentary ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s Phranc pursued a solo career. She performs in [[Paul Morrissey]]'s film ''Madame Wang's'' (1981) as Phranque.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. ''The Beatles'' is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including [[folk music|folk]], [[British blues]], [[ska]], [[music hall]] and the [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]]. It has since been viewed by some critics as a [[postmodern]] work, as well as among the greatest albums of all time.\n\nMost of the songs on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a [[Transcendental Meditation]] course in [[Rishikesh]], India. There, the only western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar; some of these songs remained acoustic on ''The Beatles'' and were recorded solo, or only by part of the group. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled-down and less reliant on studio innovation than all their releases since 1966's ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''. ''The Beatles'' also broke with the band's recent tradition of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre.\n\nAt the end of May 1968, the Beatles returned to [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in London to commence recording sessions that lasted until mid-October. During these sessions, arguments broke out among the foursome over creative differences and [[John Lennon]]'s new partner, [[Yoko Ono]], whose constant presence subverted the Beatles' policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio. After a series of problems, including producer [[George Martin]] taking a sudden leave of absence (and placing 21-year-old [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] in charge of production) and engineer [[Geoff Emerick]] suddenly quitting, [[Ringo Starr]] left the band briefly in August. The same tensions continued throughout the following year and led to the [[break-up of the Beatles|band's break-up]].\n\nUpon release, ''The Beatles'' received favourable reviews from the majority of [[music criticism|music critics]]; detractors found its satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid the turbulent political and social climate of 1968. Nonetheless, ''The Beatles'' topped record charts in Britain and the United States. Although no singles were issued in either territory, the songs \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\" originated from the same recording sessions and were issued on a single in August 1968.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|The Beatles in India}}\n\nBy 1968, the Beatles had achieved commercial and critical success.

Clapton was unsure about guesting on a Beatles record, but Harrison said the decision was \"nothing to do with them. It's my song.\"{{sfn|Badman|2009|p=638}} Clapton's solo was treated with [[automatic double tracking]] to attain the desired effect; he gave Harrison the guitar he used, which Harrison later named \"[[Lucy (guitar)|Lucy]]\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|pp=263, 264}}{{efn|Harrison soon reciprocated by collaborating with Clapton on the song \"[[Badge (song)|Badge]]\" for [[Cream (band)|Cream's]] final studio album, ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye]]''. Harrison, too, was not formally credited at first, but was identified as \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" on the cover.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=305}}}}\n\n\"[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]\" evolved out of several song fragments that Lennon compiled into one piece, having previewed two of the segments in his May 1968 demo.{{sfn|Winn|2009|pp=170\u201371, 214}} According to MacDonald, this approach was possibly inspired by the [[Incredible String Band]]'s songwriting.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=279}} The basic backing track ran to 95 takes, due to the irregular time signatures and variations in style throughout the song. The final version consisted of the best halves of two takes edited together.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=157}} Lennon later described the song as one of his favourites,{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=280}} while the rest of the band found the recording rejuvenating, as it forced them to re-hone their skills as a group playing together to get it right.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=287}} Apple's press officer [[Derek Taylor]] made an uncredited contribution to the song's lyrics.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=317}}\n\n===Side two===\nMcCartney got the title of \"[[Martha My Dear]]\" from his sheepdog, but the lyrics are otherwise unrelated.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=159}} The entire track is played by him backed with session musicians, and features no other Beatles.

The song was taped in a single session, and was one of the tracks that Martin felt was \"[[Filler (media)|filler]]\" and only put on because the album was a double.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=270}}\n\n\"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\" was Starr's first solo composition for the band;{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=251}} he had been toying with the idea of writing a self-reflective song for some time, possibly as far back as 1963.{{sfn|Badman|2009|p=643}} It went by the working titles of \"Ringo's Tune\" and \"This Is Some Friendly\". The basic track consisted of Starr drumming while McCartney played piano.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=175}} Martin composed an orchestral introduction to the song but it was rejected as being \"too bizarre\" and left off the album.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=251}} Instead, [[Jack Fallon]] played a bluegrass fiddle part.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p75003/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jack Fallon: Biography |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Why Don't We Do It in the Road?]]\" was written by McCartney in India after he saw two monkeys [[copulating]] in the street and wondered why humans were too civilised to do the same.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=499}} He played all the instruments except drums, which were contributed by Starr. The simple lyric was very much in Lennon's style, and Lennon was annoyed about not being asked to play on it. McCartney suggested it was \"tit for tat\" as he had not contributed to \"Revolution 9\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=155}}\n\n\"[[I Will]]\" was written and sung by McCartney, with Lennon and Starr accompanying on percussion.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=276}} In between numerous takes, the three Beatles broke off to busk some other songs. A snippet of a track known as \"Can You Take Me Back?\" was put between \"[[Cry Baby Cry]]\" and \"[[Revolution 9]]\",{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=155}} while recordings of [[Cilla Black]]'s hit \"[[Step Inside Love]]\" and a joke number, \"Los Paranoias\", were released on ''Anthology 3''.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|pp=276\u2013277}}\n\n\"[[Julia (Beatles song)|Julia]]\" was the last track to be recorded for the album and features Lennon on solo acoustic guitar which he played in a style similar to McCartney's on \"Blackbird\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=285}} This is the only Beatles song on which Lennon performs alone{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=161}} and it was a tribute to his mother [[Julia Lennon]], who was killed in 1958 in a road accident while Lennon was only seventeen, and the lyrics deal with the loss of his mother and his relationship with Ono, the \"ocean child\" referred to in the lyrics.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=285}} Ono helped with the lyrics, but the song was still credited to Lennon-McCartney as expected.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=286}}\n\n===Side three===\nAccording to McCartney, the authorship of \"[[Birthday (Beatles song)|Birthday]]\" was \"50\u201350 John and me, made up on the spot and recorded all on the same evening\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=496}} He and Lennon were inspired to write the song after seeing the first UK showing of the [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' on television, and sang the lead vocal in the style of the film's musical star, [[Little Richard]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=277}} After the Beatles had taped the track, Ono and Pattie Harrison added backing vocals.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=157}}\n\n\"[[Yer Blues]]\" was written by Lennon in India. Despite meditating and the tranquil atmosphere, he still felt unhappy, which was reflected in the lyrics.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/yer-blues-19691231|title=100 Greatest Beatles Songs \u2013 Yer Blues|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref> The style was influenced by the [[British blues#The British Blues Boom|British Blues Boom]] of 1968, which included groups such as [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Chicken Shack]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=269}} The backing track was recorded in a small room next to the Studio 2 control room at Abbey Road. Unusually for a Beatles recording, the four-track source tape was edited directly, resulting in an abrupt cut-off at 3'17\" into the start of another take (which ran into the fade out).{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=148}}{{efn|\"Yer Blues\" was one of the few late-period Beatles songs that Lennon performed live. Backed by Clapton, [[Keith Richards]] and [[Mitch Mitchell]], he first played it on 11 December 1968 at ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]''; a version recorded with the [[Plastic Ono Band]] in September 1969 appears on the live album ''[[Live Peace in Toronto]]''.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=269}}}}\n\n[[File:Maharishi Huntsville Jan 1978A.JPG|thumb|upright|\"[[Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey]]\" and \"[[Sexy Sadie]]\" were both written in reference to [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].]]\n\nMcCartney wrote \"[[Mother Nature's Son]]\" in India, and worked on it in isolation from the other members of the band. He performed the track solo alongside a Martin-scored brass arrangement.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=267}}\n\n\"[[Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey]]\" evolved from a jam session and was originally untitled. The final mix was sped up by mixing the tape running at 43 [[cycles per second|hertz]] instead of the usual 50.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=139}} Harrison claimed the title came from one of the Maharishi's sayings (with \"and my monkey\" added later).{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=257}}\n\n\"[[Sexy Sadie]]\" was written as \"Maharishi\" by Lennon, shortly after he decided to leave Rishikesh.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=262}} In a 1980 interview, Lennon acknowledged that the Maharishi was the inspiration for the song: \"I just called him 'Sexy Sadie'.\"<ref name=\"The Playboy Interviews with John Lennon and Yoko Ono\">{{cite book |last=Sheff |first=David |title=The Playboy Interviews with John Lennon & Yoko Ono |publisher=Playboy Press |year=1981}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\" was written by McCartney and was initially recorded in July as a blues number. The initial takes were performed by the band live and included long passages during which they [[jam session|jammed]] on their instruments.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=143}} Because these takes were too long to practically fit on an LP, the song was shelved until September, when a new, shorter, version was made. By all accounts, the session was chaotic, but nobody dared suggest to any of the Beatles that they were out of control. Harrison reportedly ran around the studio while holding a flaming ashtray above his head, \"doing an [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]]\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=154}} The stereo version of the LP includes almost a minute more of music than the mono, which culminates in Starr famously shouting \"I've got blisters on my fingers!\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=154}} Cult leader and mass murderer [[Charles Manson]] was unaware that the term ''[[Helter skelter (ride)|helter skelter]]'' is British English for a spiral slide found on a playground or funfair, and he assumed the track had something to do with [[hell]]. This was one of the key tracks that led Manson to believe the album had coded messages referring to apocalyptic war, and led to his [[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)|movement of the same name]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=262}}\n\nThe final song on side three is Harrison's \"[[Long, Long, Long]]\", part of a [[chord progression]] which he took from [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands]]\".{{sfn|Harrison|2002|p=132}} MacDonald describes the song as Harrison's \"touching token of exhausted, relieved reconciliation with God\" and considered it to be his \"finest moment on ''The Beatles''\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=283}} The recording session for the basic track was one of the longest the Beatles ever undertook, running from the afternoon of 7 October through the night until 7&nbsp;am the next day. McCartney played [[Hammond organ]] on the track, and an \"eerie rattling\" effect at the end was created by a note causing a wine bottle on top of the organ's [[Leslie speaker]] to resonate.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=283}}{{sfn|Shea|Rodriguez|2007|p=170}}\n\n===Side four===\n\"Revolution 1\" was the first track recorded for the album, with sessions for the backing track starting on 30 May.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=246}} The initial takes were recorded with the aim of it being a possible single, but as the session progressed, the arrangement became slower, with more of a laid-back groove. The group ended the chosen take with a six-minute improvisation that had further overdubs added, before being cut to the length heard on the album. The brass arrangement was added later.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=247}}\n\n\"[[Honey Pie]]\" was written by McCartney as a pastiche of the [[flapper]] dance style from the 1920s. The opening section of the track had the sound of an old [[78 RPM]] record overdubbed{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=189}} while Martin arranged a saxophone and clarinet part in the same style. Lennon played the guitar solo on the track, but later said he hated the song, calling it \"beyond redemption\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=281}}\n\n\"[[Savoy Truffle]]\" was named after one of the types of chocolate found in a box of [[Mackintosh's]] Good News, which Clapton enjoyed eating. The track featured a saxophone sextet arranged by Thomas, who also played keyboards.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=281}} Harrison later said that Derek Taylor helped him finish the lyrics.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=320}}\n\nLennon began writing \"[[Cry Baby Cry]]\" in late 1967 and the lyrics were partly derived from the tagline of an old television commercial. Martin played [[Pump organ|harmonium]] on the track.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=260}}\n\n\"[[Revolution 9]]\" evolved from the overdubs from the \"Revolution 1\" coda. Lennon, Harrison and Ono added further tape collages and spoken word extracts, in the style of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. The track opens with an extract of a piano theme from a [[Royal Schools of Music]] examination tape, and climaxes with Ono's comment, \"you become naked\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|pp=254\u2013255}} Ono was heavily involved in the production, and advised Lennon on what tape loops to use.{{sfn|Beatles|2000|p=307}} McCartney was out of the country at the time and did not contribute to the track, and was reportedly unhappy on it being included. McCartney had led similar tape experiments such as \"[[Carnival of Light]]\" in January 1967.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=138}} The track has attracted both interest and disapproval from fans and music critics over the years.<ref name=\"erlewine\" />\n\n\"[[Good Night (Beatles song)|Good Night]]\" was a lullaby written by Lennon for his son [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], and he specifically wanted Starr to sing it. The early takes featured just Lennon on acoustic guitar and Starr singing.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=139}} Martin scored an orchestral and choral arrangement that replaced the guitar in the final mix, and also played the [[celesta]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=258}}\n\n===Singles===\n\"[[Hey Jude]]\" was recorded at the end of July 1968 during the sessions for ''The Beatles'' but was issued separately as a single nearly three months before the album's release.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=264}} The B-side, \"Revolution\", was a different version of the album's \"Revolution&nbsp;1\". Lennon desired the original version of \"Revolution\" to be released as a single, but the other three Beatles objected on the grounds that it was too slow. Instead, the single featured a new, faster version, with heavily distorted guitar and an electric piano solo from [[Nicky Hopkins]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=259}} This was the first release on Apple Records and ultimately the band's most successful single in the US.{{sfn|Macdonald|1997|p=266}}\n\nThe convention in the British music industry at the time was that singles and albums were distinct entities and should not duplicate songs.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=201}}{{efn|In February 1967, the Beatles had been unhappy about having to accede to [[Capitol Records]]' demand for a new single, because the two tracks, \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Penny Lane]]\", were therefore ineligible for inclusion on ''Sgt.

Its plain white sleeve has no graphics or text other than the band's name [[Paper embossing|embossed]],{{efn|Early LP and CD releases include a unique serial number.}} which was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band's previous LP ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. ''The Beatles'' is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including [[folk music|folk]], [[British blues]], [[ska]], [[music hall]] and the [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]]. It has since been viewed by some critics as a [[postmodern]] work, as well as among the greatest albums of all time.\n\nMost of the songs on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a [[Transcendental Meditation]] course in [[Rishikesh]], India. There, the only western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar; some of these songs remained acoustic on ''The Beatles'' and were recorded solo, or only by part of the group. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled-down and less reliant on studio innovation than all their releases since 1966's ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''. ''The Beatles'' also broke with the band's recent tradition of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre.\n\nAt the end of May 1968, the Beatles returned to [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in London to commence recording sessions that lasted until mid-October. During these sessions, arguments broke out among the foursome over creative differences and [[John Lennon]]'s new partner, [[Yoko Ono]], whose constant presence subverted the Beatles' policy regarding wives and girlfriends in the studio. After a series of problems, including producer [[George Martin]] taking a sudden leave of absence and engineer [[Geoff Emerick]] suddenly quitting, [[Ringo Starr]] left the band briefly in August. The same tensions continued throughout the following year and led to the [[break-up of the Beatles|band's break-up]].\n\nUpon release, ''The Beatles'' received favourable reviews from the majority of [[music criticism|music critics]]; detractors found its satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid the turbulent political and social climate of 1968. Nonetheless, ''The Beatles'' topped record charts in Britain and the United States. Although no singles were issued in either territory, the songs \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\" originated from the same recording sessions and were issued on a single in August 1968.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|The Beatles in India}}\n\nBy 1968, the Beatles had achieved commercial and critical success. The group's mid-1967 release, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', was number one in the UK for 27 weeks, until the start of February 1968,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Beatles| title= The Beatles\" > \"Albums\" > \"The Beatles\" > \"Chart Facts| publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref> having sold 250,000 copies in the first week after release.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=123}} ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declared that ''Sgt.

Harrison, too, was not formally credited at first, but was identified as \"L'Angelo Misterioso\" on the cover.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=305}}}}\n\n\"[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]\" evolved out of several song fragments that Lennon compiled into one piece, having previewed two of the segments in his May 1968 demo.{{sfn|Winn|2009|pp=170\u201371, 214}} According to MacDonald, this approach was possibly inspired by the [[Incredible String Band]]'s songwriting.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=279}} The basic backing track ran to 95 takes, due to the irregular time signatures and variations in style throughout the song. The final version consisted of the best halves of two takes edited together.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=157}} Lennon later described the song as one of his favourites,{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=280}} while the rest of the band found the recording rejuvenating, as it forced them to re-hone their skills as a group playing together to get it right.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=287}} Apple's press officer [[Derek Taylor]] made an uncredited contribution to the song's lyrics.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=317}}\n\n===Side two===\nMcCartney got the title of \"[[Martha My Dear]]\" from his sheepdog, but the lyrics are otherwise unrelated.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=159}} The entire track is played by him backed with session musicians, and features no other Beatles.

The song was taped in a single session, and was one of the tracks that Martin felt was \"[[Filler (media)|filler]]\" and only put on because the album was a double.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=270}}\n\n\"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\" was Starr's first solo composition for the band;{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=251}} he had been toying with the idea of writing a self-reflective song for some time, possibly as far back as 1963.{{sfn|Badman|2009|p=643}} It went by the working titles of \"Ringo's Tune\" and \"This Is Some Friendly\". The basic track consisted of Starr drumming while McCartney played piano.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=175}} Martin composed an orchestral introduction to the song but it was rejected as being \"too bizarre\" and left off the album.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=251}} Instead, [[Jack Fallon]] played a bluegrass fiddle part.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p75003/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jack Fallon: Biography |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Why Don't We Do It in the Road?]]\" was written by McCartney in India after he saw two monkeys [[copulating]] in the street and wondered why humans were too civilised to do the same.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=499}} He played all the instruments except drums, which were contributed by Starr. The simple lyric was very much in Lennon's style, and Lennon was annoyed about not being asked to play on it. McCartney suggested it was \"tit for tat\" as he had not contributed to \"Revolution 9\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=155}}\n\n\"[[I Will]]\" was written and sung by McCartney, with Lennon and Starr accompanying on percussion.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=276}} In between numerous takes, the three Beatles broke off to busk some other songs. A snippet of a track known as \"Can You Take Me Back?\" was put between \"[[Cry Baby Cry]]\" and \"[[Revolution 9]]\",{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=155}} while recordings of [[Cilla Black]]'s hit \"[[Step Inside Love]]\" and a joke number, \"Los Paranoias\", were released on ''Anthology 3''.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|pp=276\u2013277}}\n\n\"[[Julia (Beatles song)|Julia]]\" was the last track to be recorded for the album and features Lennon on solo acoustic guitar which he played in a style similar to McCartney's on \"Blackbird\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=285}} This is the only Beatles song on which Lennon performs alone{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=161}} and it was a tribute to his mother [[Julia Lennon]], who was killed in 1958 in a road accident while Lennon was only seventeen, and the lyrics deal with the loss of his mother and his relationship with Ono, the \"ocean child\" referred to in the lyrics.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=285}} Ono helped with the lyrics, but the song was still credited to Lennon-McCartney as expected.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=286}}\n\n===Side three===\nAccording to McCartney, the authorship of \"[[Birthday (Beatles song)|Birthday]]\" was \"50\u201350 John and me, made up on the spot and recorded all on the same evening\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=496}} He and Lennon were inspired to write the song after seeing the first UK showing of the [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' on television, and sang the lead vocal in the style of the film's musical star, [[Little Richard]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=277}} After the Beatles had taped the track, Ono and Pattie Harrison added backing vocals.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=157}}\n\n\"[[Yer Blues]]\" was written by Lennon in India. Despite meditating and the tranquil atmosphere, he still felt unhappy, which was reflected in the lyrics.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/yer-blues-19691231|title=100 Greatest Beatles Songs \u2013 Yer Blues|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref> The style was influenced by the [[British blues#The British Blues Boom|British Blues Boom]] of 1968, which included groups such as [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Chicken Shack]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=269}} The backing track was recorded in a small room next to the Studio 2 control room at Abbey Road. Unusually for a Beatles recording, the four-track source tape was edited directly, resulting in an abrupt cut-off at 3'17\" into the start of another take (which ran into the fade out).{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=148}}{{efn|\"Yer Blues\" was one of the few late-period Beatles songs that Lennon performed live. Backed by Clapton, [[Keith Richards]] and [[Mitch Mitchell]], he first played it on 11 December 1968 at ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]''; a version recorded with the [[Plastic Ono Band]] in September 1969 appears on the live album ''[[Live Peace in Toronto]]''.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=269}}}}\n\n[[File:Maharishi Huntsville Jan 1978A.JPG|thumb|upright|\"[[Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey]]\" and \"[[Sexy Sadie]]\" were both written in reference to [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].]]\n\nMcCartney wrote \"[[Mother Nature's Son]]\" in India, and worked on it in isolation from the other members of the band. He performed the track solo alongside a Martin-scored brass arrangement.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=267}}\n\n\"[[Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey]]\" evolved from a jam session and was originally untitled. The final mix was sped up by mixing the tape running at 43 [[cycles per second|hertz]] instead of the usual 50.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=139}} Harrison claimed the title came from one of the Maharishi's sayings (with \"and my monkey\" added later).{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=257}}\n\n\"[[Sexy Sadie]]\" was written as \"Maharishi\" by Lennon, shortly after he decided to leave Rishikesh.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=262}} In a 1980 interview, Lennon acknowledged that the Maharishi was the inspiration for the song: \"I just called him 'Sexy Sadie'.\"<ref name=\"The Playboy Interviews with John Lennon and Yoko Ono\">{{cite book |last=Sheff |first=David |title=The Playboy Interviews with John Lennon & Yoko Ono |publisher=Playboy Press |year=1981}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\" was written by McCartney and was initially recorded in July as a blues number. The initial takes were performed by the band live and included long passages during which they [[jam session|jammed]] on their instruments.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=143}} Because these takes were too long to practically fit on an LP, the song was shelved until September, when a new, shorter, version was made. By all accounts, the session was chaotic, but nobody dared suggest to any of the Beatles that they were out of control. Harrison reportedly ran around the studio while holding a flaming ashtray above his head, \"doing an [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]]\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=154}} The stereo version of the LP includes almost a minute more of music than the mono, which culminates in Starr famously shouting \"I've got blisters on my fingers!\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=154}} Cult leader and mass murderer [[Charles Manson]] was unaware that the term ''[[Helter skelter (ride)|helter skelter]]'' is British English for a spiral slide found on a playground or funfair, and he assumed the track had something to do with [[hell]]. This was one of the key tracks that led Manson to believe the album had coded messages referring to apocalyptic war, and led to his [[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)|movement of the same name]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=262}}\n\nThe final song on side three is Harrison's \"[[Long, Long, Long]]\", part of a [[chord progression]] which he took from [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands]]\".{{sfn|Harrison|2002|p=132}} MacDonald describes the song as Harrison's \"touching token of exhausted, relieved reconciliation with God\" and considered it to be his \"finest moment on ''The Beatles''\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=283}} The recording session for the basic track was one of the longest the Beatles ever undertook, running from the afternoon of 7 October through the night until 7&nbsp;am the next day. McCartney played [[Hammond organ]] on the track, and an \"eerie rattling\" effect at the end was created by a note causing a wine bottle on top of the organ's [[Leslie speaker]] to resonate.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=283}}{{sfn|Shea|Rodriguez|2007|p=170}}\n\n===Side four===\n\"Revolution 1\" was the first track recorded for the album, with sessions for the backing track starting on 30 May.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=246}} The initial takes were recorded with the aim of it being a possible single, but as the session progressed, the arrangement became slower, with more of a laid-back groove. The group ended the chosen take with a six-minute improvisation that had further overdubs added, before being cut to the length heard on the album. The brass arrangement was added later.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=247}}\n\n\"[[Honey Pie]]\" was written by McCartney as a pastiche of the [[flapper]] dance style from the 1920s. The opening section of the track had the sound of an old [[78 RPM]] record overdubbed{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=189}} while Martin arranged a saxophone and clarinet part in the same style. Lennon played the guitar solo on the track, but later said he hated the song, calling it \"beyond redemption\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=281}}\n\n\"[[Savoy Truffle]]\" was named after one of the types of chocolate found in a box of [[Mackintosh's]] Good News, which Clapton enjoyed eating. The track featured a saxophone sextet arranged by Thomas, who also played keyboards.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=281}} Harrison later said that Derek Taylor helped him finish the lyrics.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=320}}\n\nLennon began writing \"[[Cry Baby Cry]]\" in late 1967 and the lyrics were partly derived from the tagline of an old television commercial. Martin played [[Pump organ|harmonium]] on the track.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=260}}\n\n\"[[Revolution 9]]\" evolved from the overdubs from the \"Revolution 1\" coda. Lennon, Harrison and Ono added further tape collages and spoken word extracts, in the style of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. The track opens with an extract of a piano theme from a [[Royal Schools of Music]] examination tape, and climaxes with Ono's comment, \"you become naked\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|pp=254\u2013255}} Ono was heavily involved in the production, and advised Lennon on what tape loops to use.{{sfn|Beatles|2000|p=307}} McCartney was out of the country at the time and did not contribute to the track, and was reportedly unhappy on it being included. McCartney had led similar tape experiments such as \"[[Carnival of Light]]\" in January 1967.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=138}} The track has attracted both interest and disapproval from fans and music critics over the years.<ref name=\"erlewine\" />\n\n\"[[Good Night (Beatles song)|Good Night]]\" was a lullaby written by Lennon for his son [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], and he specifically wanted Starr to sing it. The early takes featured just Lennon on acoustic guitar and Starr singing.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=139}} Martin scored an orchestral and choral arrangement that replaced the guitar in the final mix, and also played the [[celesta]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=258}}\n\n===Singles===\n\"[[Hey Jude]]\" was recorded at the end of July 1968 during the sessions for ''The Beatles'' but was issued separately as a single nearly three months before the album's release.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=264}} The B-side, \"Revolution\", was a different version of the album's \"Revolution&nbsp;1\". Lennon desired the original version of \"Revolution\" to be released as a single, but the other three Beatles objected on the grounds that it was too slow. Instead, the single featured a new, faster version, with heavily distorted guitar and an electric piano solo from [[Nicky Hopkins]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=259}} This was the first release on Apple Records and ultimately the band's most successful single in the US.{{sfn|Macdonald|1997|p=266}}\n\nThe convention in the British music industry at the time was that singles and albums were distinct entities and should not duplicate songs.{{sfn|MacDonald|1997|p=201}}{{efn|In February 1967, the Beatles had been unhappy about having to accede to [[Capitol Records]]' demand for a new single, because the two tracks, \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Penny Lane]]\", were therefore ineligible for inclusion on ''Sgt.

{"title_page": "Road signs in Thailand", "text_new": "[[File:SIM CAVE PHU MAK PRIK PHU HIN PUN.png|thumb|A directional signboard]]\n\n'''Road signs in Thailand''' are standardized [[traffic signs|road signs]] similar to those used in other nations but with certain differences. Until the early 1980s, [[Thailand]] closely followed US, [[Australia]]n, and [[Japan]]ese practices in road sign design, with diamond-shaped warning signs and circular restrictive signs to regulate traffic. Signs usually use the [[FHWA Series fonts]] (\"Highway Gothic\") typeface also used in the [[United States]]. \n\nThai traffic signs use [[Thai language|Thai]], the [[national language]] of Thailand. However, [[English language|English]] is also used for important public places such as [[Tourist|tourist attraction]]s, [[airport]]s, [[railway station]]s, and [[civilian checkpoint|immigration checkpoint]]s. Both Thai and English are used on directional signage.\n\n[[Thailand]] is a signatory to the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]], but has yet to fully ratify the convention.\n\n== Regulatory signs ==\nWith the exception of the special designs used for Stop, Yield, and No Entry signs, mandatory signs (e.g., Must Turn Left) are round with a blue background, white border, and a white pictogram. Those which express a prohibition (e.g., No Left Turn) show the pictogram crossed out by a red diagonal bar. This is in accordance with the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]] (Type A variants).<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to driving in Thailand; Regulatory

Until the early 1980s, [[Thailand]] closely followed US, [[Australia]]n, and [[Japan]]ese practices in road sign design, with diamond-shaped warning signs and circular restrictive signs to regulate traffic. Signs usually use the [[FHWA Series fonts]] (\"Highway Gothic\") typeface also used in the [[United States]]. \n\nThai traffic signs use [[Thai language|Thai]], the [[national language]] of Thailand. However, [[English language|English]] is also used for important public places such as [[Tourist|tourist attraction]]s, [[airport]]s, [[railway station]]s, and [[civilian checkpoint|immigration checkpoint]]s. Both Thai and English are used on directional signage.\n\n[[Thailand]] is a signatory to the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]], but has yet to fully ratify the convention.\n\n== Regulatory signs ==\nWith the exception of the special designs used for Stop, Yield, and No Entry signs, mandatory signs (e.g., Must Turn Left) are round with a blue background, white border, and a white pictogram. Those which express a prohibition (e.g., No Left Turn) show the pictogram crossed out by a red diagonal bar. This is in accordance with the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]] (Type A variants).<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to driving in Thailand; Regulatory

The gyrator is the complement of the [[transformer]]; whereas in a transformer, a voltage on one port will transform to a proportional voltage on the other port, in a gyrator, a voltage on one port will transform to a current on the other port, and vice versa.\n\nThe role gyrators play in the gyrator\u2013capacitor model is as [[transducer]]s between the electrical energy domain and the magnetic energy domain.  An emf in the electrical domain is analogous to an mmf in the magnetic domain, and a transducer doing such a conversion would be represented as a transformer.  However, real electro-magnetic transducers usually behave as gyrators.  A transducer from the magnetic domain to the electrical domain will obey [[Faraday's law of induction]], that is, a rate of change of magnetic flux (a magnetic current in this analogy) produces a proportional emf in the electrical domain.  Similarly, a transducer from the electrical domain to the magnetic domain will obey [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law]], that is, an electric current will produce a mmf.\n\nA winding of N turns is modeled by a gyrator with a gyration resistance of N ohms.<ref name=\"Hamill\"/>{{rp|100}}\n\n==Examples==\n===Three phase transformer===\n[[File:Gyrator-Capacitor Model Example Three Phase Transformer.png|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Three phase transformer with windings and permeance elements.]]\n[[File:Gyrator-Capacitor Model Example Three Phase Transformer Schematic.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Schematic using gyrator-capacitor model for transformer windings and capacitors for permeance elements]]\nThis example shows a [[three-phase]] [[transformer]] modeled by the gyrator-capacitor approach.

Most of the toys are a variety of foam-based weaponry, with other Nerf products including balls for sports like [[American football]], basketball and baseball. The most notable of the toys are the dart guns (referred to by Hasbro as \"blasters\") that shoot ammunition made from Nerf foam. Since many such items were released during the 1970s, Nerf products often feature bright neon colors and soft textures similar to the flagship Nerf ball. The slogan, which has been frequently used since advertising in the 1990s, is ''\"It's Nerf or Nothin'!\"''.

They cannot be fired from any previous Nerf line or off-brand compatible blasters, nor can any other lines' darts be fired from Ultra blasters.

The blaster is painted in a white, black and orange color scheme with a distinctive raised gold \"ULTRA\" label on the right side (the raised logo is repeated on the left side, but in white, rather than gold). The second blaster was the Ultra ''Two'', which is a 6-round capacity flywheel system revolver, which loads from the back of the blaster, as there is no open place in front.

Since many such items were released during the 1970s, Nerf products often feature bright neon colors and soft textures similar to the flagship Nerf ball.

The official plot explains that, after Earth was hit by a deadly asteroid, life and civilization begins anew, and survivors must fend off raiders and new monstrous creatures.

In Phantom Corps, the series has its own Nerf blasters, but also sports white reshells of some of the original red and blue blasters, which are altered slightly but are still recognizable as the originals.

This construction allows for fins to be molded into the rear of the darts.  Size-wise, Ultra darts are between N-Strike Elite darts and Mega darts in diameter, but shorter than both in length.  They cannot be fired from any previous Nerf line or off-brand compatible blasters, nor can any other lines' darts be fired from Ultra blasters. This design was created in response to the growing number of third-party darts, including exact knockoffs from China, available for N-Strike Elite blasters at a much lower cost than Nerf-brand darts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |title=Parents, Beware: Nerf\u2019s Newest Blasters Won\u2019t Fire Knockoff Darts |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2019-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003131215/https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |archive-date=2019-10-03 |url-status=live }}https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003131215/https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-beware-nerfs-newest-blasters-wont-fire-knockoff-darts-11569240001 |date=2019-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe first blaster in the Ultra line was the Nerf Ultra ''One'', a drum-fed (25-dart capacity), flywheel design with integral (non-detachable) stock and fixed barrel with no N-Strike barrel attachments. It is compatible with rail-mounted Nerf attachments via two tactical rails on top.  The blaster is painted in a white, black and orange color scheme with a distinctive raised gold \"ULTRA\" label on the right side (the raised logo is repeated on the left side, but in white, rather than gold). The second blaster was the Ultra ''Two'', which is a 6-round capacity flywheel system revolver, which loads from the back of the blaster, as there is no open place in front. Like the One, the Two comes in the same white, black and orange color scheme, and the \"ULTRA'\" label on the side. It is also the first electronic revolver-style blaster since the 2012 N-Strike Elite Stockade.\n\n===Nerf N-Force===\nThe N-Force line consisted of foam swords and melee weapons.
