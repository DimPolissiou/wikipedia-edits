Considered one of the [[Classic Chinese Novels|Four Great Classical Novels]] of [[Chinese literature]], the novel is written in [[Written vernacular Chinese|vernacular Chinese]] rather than [[Classical Chinese]].<ref name=\"Wu Vernacular Fiction\">Yenna Wu, \"Full-Length Vernacular Fiction,\" in [[Victor Mair]], (ed.), ''[[The Columbia History of Chinese Literature]]''  (NY: [[Columbia University Press]],  2001), pp. 627\u2013629.</ref>\n\nThe story, set in the [[Song dynasty]], tells of how a group of 108 outlaws gather at [[Mount Liang]] (or Liangshan Marsh) to form a sizable army before they are eventually granted amnesty by the government and sent on campaigns to resist foreign invaders and suppress rebel forces. It has introduced to readers many of the best-known characters in Chinese literature, such as [[Wu Song]], [[Lin Chong]] and [[Lu Zhishen]].\n\n==Historical context and development==\n''Water Margin'' was based on the exploits of the outlaw [[Song Jiang]] and his 108 companions (The 36 \"Heavenly Spirits\" and the 72 \"Earthly Demons\"). The group was active in the [[Huainan]] region and surrendered to the [[Song dynasty|Song]] government in 1121. They were recorded in the historical text ''[[History of Song]]''. The name of \"Song Jiang\" also appeared in the biography of [[Emperor Huizong of Song]], which stated:\n{{quote|The outlaw Song Jiang of Huainan and others attacked the army at [[Huaiyang County|Huaiyang]], (the Emperor) sent generals to attack and arrest them. (The outlaws) infringed on the east of the capital ([[Kaifeng]]), [[Hebei]], and entered the boundaries of Chu (referring to present-day [[Hubei]] and [[Hunan]]) and Haizhou (covering parts of present-day [[Jiangsu]]). The prefect Zhang Shuye was ordered to pacify them.<ref>Toktoghan et al. ''History of Song'', Volume 22, Biography of Emperor Huizong (Part Four).</ref>}}\nZhang Shuye's biography further described Song Jiang and the outlaws' activities and how they were eventually defeated by Zhang.<ref>Toktoghan et al. ''History of Song'', Volume 353, Biography of Zhang Shuye.</ref>\n\nFolk stories of Song Jiang circulated during the [[Southern Song]]. The first source to name Song Jiang's 36 companions was ''Miscellaneous observations from the year of Guixin'' (\u7678\u8f9b\u96dc\u8b58) by Zhou Mi, written in the 13th century. Among the 36 were [[Lu Junyi]], [[Guan Sheng]], [[Ruan Xiao'er]], [[Ruan Xiaowu]], [[Ruan Xiaoqi]], [[Liu Tang]], [[Hua Rong]] and [[Wu Yong]]. Some of the characters who later became associated with Song Jiang also appeared around this time. They include [[Sun Li (Water Margin)|Sun Li]], [[Yang Zhi (Water Margin)|Yang Zhi]], [[Lin Chong]], [[Lu Zhishen]] and [[Wu Song]].\n\nA palace memorial by Hou Meng is included in the historical record History of Song, which states: \"Song Jiang and 36 others cross Qi and Wei (the central belt of the North China Plain) at will. Government troops number tens of thousands but no one dare oppose him. His abilities must be extraordinary. Since we also face plunders by Fang La and his outlaws from Qingxi, why not grant Song Jiang and his men amnesty and allow them to lead a campaign against Fang La to redeem themselves?\"\n\nA direct precursor of ''Water Margin'' was the ''Old incidents in the Xuanhe period of the great Song dynasty'' (\u5927\u5b8b\u5ba3\u548c\u907a\u4e8b), which appeared around the mid 13th century. The text is a written version of storytellers' tales, based on supposed historical events. It is divided into ten chapters, roughly covering the history of the Song dynasty from the early 11th century to the establishment of the Southern Song regime in 1127. The fourth chapter covers the adventures of Song Jiang and his 36 companions, and their eventual defeat by Zhang Shuye. Some of the more well-known stories and characters in ''Water Margin'' are clearly visible, including \"Yang Zhi sells his precious sabre\", \"Robbing the convoy of birthday gifts\", \"Song Jiang kills Yan Poxi\", \"Fighting [[Fang La]]\", among others. Song Jiang and his outlaws were said to operate in the [[Taihang Mountains]].\n\nStories about the outlaws became a popular subject for [[Yuan dynasty]] drama. During this time, the material on which ''Water Margin'' was based evolved into what it is in the present. The number of outlaws increased to 108. Even though they came from different backgrounds (including scholars, fishermen, imperial drill instructors etc.), all of them eventually came to occupy [[Mount Liang]] (or Liangshan Marsh). There is a theory that ''Water Margin'' became popular during the Yuan era as the common people (predominantly [[Han Chinese]]) resented the [[Mongols|Mongol]] rulers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Miyamoto |first1=Yoko |title=Water Margin: Chinese Robin Hood and His Bandits |url=http://www.demystifyingconfucianism.info/water-margin |website=Demystifying Confucianism |accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref> The outlaws' rebellion was deemed \"safe\" to promote as it was supposedly a negative reflection of the fallen Song dynasty. Concurrently, the rebellion was also a call for the common people to rise up against corruption in the government. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]], acting on the advice of his ministers, banned the book as a means of preventing revolts.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_476624c9010008qf.html \u660e\u4ee3\u6587\u5b66\u6559\u6848\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ae0\u300a\u6c34\u6d52\u4f20\u300b\uff08\u4e4b\u4e00\uff09]</ref>\n\nThe novel, praised as an early \"masterpiece\" of [[Vernacular literature|vernacular fiction]],<ref name=Findlay>{{cite book|title=Frae ither tongues: essays on modern translations into Scots|author=Findlay, Bill|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2004|isbn=1-85359-700-7|page=21}}</ref> is renowned for the \"mastery and control\" of its mood and tone.<ref name=Findlay/> The work is also known for its use of vivid, humorous and especially racy language.<ref name=Findlay/> However, it has been denounced as \"obscene\" by various critics since the Ming dynasty.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chinese literature|publisher=Foreign Languages Press, original from [[University of Michigan]]|year=1998|page=138}}</ref>\n{{quote|\"These seduction cases are the hardest of all.

Gao abuses his status as a Grand Marshal by oppressing Wang Jin; Wang's father taught Gao a painful lesson when the latter was still a street-roaming ruffian. Wang Jin flees from the capital with his mother and by chance he meets [[Shi Jin]], who becomes his apprentice. The next few chapters tell the story of Shi Jin's friend [[Lu Zhishen]], followed by the story of Lu's sworn brother [[Lin Chong]]. Lin Chong is framed by Gao Qiu for attempting to assassinate him, and almost dies in a fire at a supply depot set by Gao's henchmen. He slays his foes and abandons the depot, eventually making his way to Liangshan Marsh, where he becomes an outlaw. Meanwhile, the \"Original Seven\", led by [[Chao Gai]], rob a convoy of birthday gifts for the Imperial Tutor [[Cai Jing]], another primary antagonist in the novel. They flee to Liangshan Marsh after defeating a group of soldiers sent by the authorities to arrest them, and settle there as outlaws with Chao Gai as their chief. As the story progresses, more people come to join the outlaw band, including military personnel and civil officials who grew tired of serving the corrupt government, as well as men with special skills and talents. Stories of the outlaws are told in separate sections in the following chapters. Connections between characters are vague, but the individual stories are eventually pieced together by chapter 60 when [[Song Jiang]] succeeds Chao Gai as the leader of the band after the latter is killed in a battle against the Zeng Family Fortress.\n\nThe plot further develops by illustrating the conflicts between the outlaws and the Song government after the Grand Assembly of the 108 outlaws. Song Jiang strongly advocates making peace with the government and seeking redress for the outlaws. After defeating the imperial army in a great battle at Liangshan Marsh, the outlaws eventually receive amnesty from [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]]. The emperor recruits them to form a military contingent and sends them on campaigns against invaders from the [[Liao dynasty]] and rebel forces led by [[Tian Hu]], [[Wang Qing (Water Margin)|Wang Qing]] and [[Fang La]] within the Song dynasty's domain. Although the former outlaws eventually emerge victorious against the rebels and Liao invaders, the campaigns also led to the tragic dissolution of the 108 heroes. At least two-thirds of them died in battle while the surviving ones either return to the imperial capital to receive honours from the emperor and continue serving the Song government, or leave and spend the rest of their lives as commoners elsewhere. Song Jiang himself is eventually poisoned to death by the \"Four Treacherous Ministers\" \u2013 [[Gao Qiu]], [[Yang Jian (Song dynasty)|Yang Jian]] (\u694a\u6229), [[Tong Guan]] and [[Cai Jing]].\n\n===Outline of chapters===\n[[File:Lu Zhishen Water Margin 2.jpg|thumb|250px|A 19th-century mural depicting [[Lu Zhishen]] uprooting a tree, a scene from the novel]]\n\nThe following outline of chapters is based on a 100 chapters edition.

The authorship of ''Water Margin'' is still uncertain, and in any case derived from many sources and involved many editorial hands. While the novel was traditionally attributed to [[Shi Nai'an]], of whose life nothing is reliably known, recent scholars think that the novel, or portions of it, may have been written or revised by [[Luo Guanzhong]] (the author of ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'').<ref name=Wilt>Wilt Idema and Lloyd Haft. ''A Guide to Chinese Literature.'' (Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, The University of Michigan,  1997; {{ISBN|0-89264-123-1}}), p. 203.</ref> Other contenders include Shi Hui (\u65bd\u60e0) and Guo Xun (\u90ed\u52db).\n\n===Shi Nai'an===\nMany scholars believe that the first 70 chapters were indeed written by Shi Nai'an; however the authorship of the final 30 chapters is often questioned, with some speculating that it was instead written by Luo Guanzhong, who may have been a student of Shi.<ref name=Wilt/> Another theory, which first appeared in Gao Ru's ''Baichuan Shuzhi'' (\u767e\u5ddd\u66f8\u5fd7) during the Ming dynasty, suggests that the whole novel was written and compiled by Shi, and then edited by Luo.\n\nShi appropriated oral and written texts accumulated over time. Stories of the Liangshan outlaws first appeared in ''Old incidents in the Xuanhe period of the great Song dynasty'' (\u5927\u5b8b\u5ba3\u548c\u907a\u4e8b) and have been circulating since the Southern Song dynasty, while folk tales and opera related to ''Water Margin'' have already existed long before the novel itself came into existence. This theory suggests that Shi Nai'an gathered and compiled these pieces of information to write ''Water Margin''.\n\n===Luo Guanzhong===\nSome believe that ''Water Margin'' was written entirely by Luo Guanzhong. Wang Daokun (\u6c6a\u9053\u6606), who lived during the reign of the [[Jiajing Emperor]] in the [[Ming dynasty]], first mentioned in ''Classification of Water Margin'' (\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3\u6558) that: \"someone with the family name Luo, who was a native of [[Wu (region)|Wuyue]] (Yue (a reference to the southern China region covering [[Zhejiang]]), wrote the 100-chapter novel.\" Several scholars from the Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, after Wang Daokun's time, also pointed out that Luo was the author of ''Water Margin''. During the early [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republican era]], [[Lu Xun]] and [[Yu Pingbo]] suggested that the simplified edition of ''Water Margin'' was written by Luo, while the traditional version was by Shi Nai'an.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nHowever, Huikang Yesou (\u60e0\u5eb7\u91ce\u53df) in ''Shi Yu'' (\u8b58\u9918) disagree with Wang Daokun's view on the grounds that there were significant differences between ''Water Margin'' and ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', therefore these two novels could not have been written by the same person.\n\n[[Hu Shih]] felt that the draft of ''Water Margin'' was done by Luo Guanzhong, and could have contained the chapters on the outlaws' campaigns against [[Tian Hu]], [[Wang Qing (Water Margin)|Wang Qing]] and [[Fang La]], but not invaders from the [[Liao dynasty]].<ref>Hu Shih. ''Research on Water Margin'' (\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3\u8003\u8b49).</ref>\n\nAnother theory states that Luo Guanzhong was from the Southern Song period vice the Ming dynasty. Cheng Muheng (\u7a0b\u7a46\u8861) suggested in ''Notes on Water Margin'' (\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3\u6ce8\u7565) that Luo lived in the late Southern Song dynasty and early Yuan era. Huang Lin'gen (\u9ec3\u9716\u6839) pointed out that the name of one of the compilers of ''Anecdotes of Jingkang'' (\u9756\u5eb7\u7a17\u53f2) was Nai'an, and suggested that this \"Nai'an\", who lived during the Southern Song dynasty, was Shi Nai'an. He also felt that Shi wrote a simplified version of ''Water Margin'', which is not the current edition.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Shi Hui===\nAnother candidate is Shi Hui (\u65bd\u60e0), a ''[[Nanxi (Chinese opera)|nanxi]]'' (''southern opera'') playwright who lived between the late [[Yuan dynasty]] and early [[Ming dynasty]]. Xu Fuzuo (\u5f90\u5fa9\u795a) of the Ming dynasty mentioned in ''Sanjia Cunlao Weitan'' (\u4e09\u5bb6\u6751\u8001\u59d4\u8ac7) that Junmei (\u541b\u7f8e; Shi Hui's [[courtesy name]])'s intention in writing ''Water Margin'' was to entertain people, and not to convey any message. During the [[Qing dynasty]], Shi Hui and Shi Nai'an were linked, suggesting that they are actually the same person. An unnamed writer wrote in ''Chuanqi Huikao Biaomu'' (\u50b3\u5947\u6703\u8003\u6a19\u76ee) that Shi Nai'an's given name was actually \"Hui\", courtesy name \"Juncheng\" (\u541b\u627f), and he was a native of [[Hangzhou]]. Sun Kaidi (\u5b6b\u6977\u7b2c) also wrote in ''Bibliography of Chinese Popular Fiction'' that \"Nai'an\" was Shi Hui's pseudonym. Later studies revealed that ''Water Margin'' contained lines in the [[Wu Chinese|Jiangsu and Zhejiang variety of Chinese]], and that ''You Gui Ji'' (\u5e7d\u95fa\u8bb0), a work of Shi Hui, bore some resemblance to ''Water Margin'', hence the theory that ''Water Margin'' was authored by Shi Hui.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Guo Xun===\nAnother theory attributes the authorship to Guo Xun (\u90ed\u52db), a politician who lived in the Ming dynasty. Shen Defu (\u6c88\u5fb7\u7b26) mentioned in ''Wanli Yehuo Bian'' (\u842c\u66c6\u91ce\u7372\u7de8) that Guo wrote ''Water Margin''. Shen Guoyuan (\u6c88\u570b\u5143) added in ''Huangming Congxin Lu'' (\u7687\u660e\u5f9e\u4fe1\u9304) that Guo mimicked the writing styles of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' and ''Water Margin'' to write ''Guochao Yinglie Ji'' (\u570b\u671d\u82f1\u70c8\u8a18). Qian Xiyan (\u9322\u5e0c\u8a00) also stated in ''Xi Gu'' (\u6232\u560f) that Guo edited ''Water Margin'' before.  [[Hu Shih]] countered in his ''Research on Water Margin'' (\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3\u65b0\u8003) that Guo Xun's name was used as a disguise for the real author of ''Water Margin''. Dai Bufan (\u6234\u4e0d\u51e1) had a differing view, as he suspected that Guo wrote ''Water Margin'', and then used \"Shi Nai'an\" to conceal his identity as the author of the novel.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Editions==\nThe textual history of the novel is extraordinarily complex for it includes oral folklore, storytellers' tales, and printed versions of different parts and variations. Not until the 1920s were there studies which began to set these questions in order, and there is still disagreement.<ref name=\"Wu Vernacular Fiction\" /> The earliest components of the ''Water Margin'' (in manuscript copies) were from the late 14th century. The earliest extant complete printed edition of ''Water Margin'' is a 100-chapter book dating from the late-16th century in 1589.<ref>Endymion Wilkinson. ''Chinese History: A New Manual.''

Yet other editions were published since this era to the early [[Qing dynasty]], including a 70-chapter edition by [[Jin Shengtan]].\n\nA printed copy of the ''Water Margin'', dating from the [[Jiajing Emperor]]'s reign in the [[Ming dynasty]], titled ''Jingben Zhongyi Zhuan'' (\u4eac\u672c\u5fe0\u7fa9\u50b3), is currently preserved in the [[Shanghai Library]]. The various editions of ''Water Margin'' can roughly be classified into two groups - simplified and traditional.\n\n===Simplified editions===\nThe simplified editions include stories on the outlaws being granted amnesty, followed by their campaigns against the [[Liao dynasty]], [[Tian Hu]], [[Wang Qing (Water Margin)|Wang Qing]] and [[Fang La]], all the way until [[Song Jiang]]'s death. At one point, the later chapters were compiled into a separate novel, titled ''Sequel to Water Margin'' (\u7e8c\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3), which is attributed to [[Luo Guanzhong]].\n\nKnown simplified editions of ''Water Margin'' include:\n\n* A 115-chapter edition, ''Masterpieces of the Han and Song dynasties'' (\u6f22\u5b8b\u5947\u66f8)\n* A 110-chapter edition, ''Chronicles of Heroes'' (\u82f1\u96c4\u8b5c)\n* A 164-chapter edition, combined with ''Sequel to Water Margin''\n\n===Complex editions===\nThe complex editions are more descriptive and circulated more widely than their simplified counterparts. The three main versions of the complex editions are a 100-chapter, a 120-chapter and a 70-chapter edition. The most commonly modified parts of the complex editions are the stories on what happened after the outlaws are granted amnesty.\n\n* 100-chapter edition: Includes the outlaws' campaigns against the [[Liao dynasty]] and [[Fang La]] after they have been granted amnesty.\n* 120-chapter edition: An extended version of the 100-chapter edition, includes the outlaws' campaigns against [[Tian Hu]] and [[Wang Qing (Water Margin)|Wang Qing]].\n* 70-chapter edition: Edited by [[Jin Shengtan]] in the late [[Ming dynasty]], this edition uses Chapter 1 as a prologue and ends at Chapter 71 of the original version, and does not include the stories about the outlaws being granted amnesty and their campaigns.\n\n==Translations==\n[[File:Suikoden.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Yang Lin (Water Margin)|Yang Lin]], a hero from the novel, from [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]'s series of woodblock prints illustrating the 108 Suikoden.]]\n\n''Water Margin'' has been translated into many languages.

The book, called the ''New Illustrated Edition of the Suikoden'' (''Shinpen Suikogaden''), was a success during the [[Edo period]] and spurred a Japanese \"Suikoden\" craze.\n\nIn 1827, publisher Kagaya Kichibei commissioned [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] to produce a series of woodblock prints illustrating the 108 heroes in ''Water Margin''. The 1827\u20131830 series, called ''108 Heroes of the Water Margin'' or ''Tsuzoku Suikoden goketsu hyakuhachinin no hitori'', catapulted Kuniyoshi to fame.

The novel is based on the story of [[Wu Song]] avenging his brother in ''Water Margin'', but the focus is on [[Ximen Qing]]'s sexual relations with other women, including [[Pan Jinlian]]. In ''Water Margin'', Ximen Qing is killed by Wu Song for murdering the latter's brother, while in ''Jin Ping Mei'' he dies a horrible death due to an accidental overdose of aphrodisiac pills.\n\n''Shuihu Houzhuan'' (\u6c34\u6ef8\u5f8c\u50b3), which roughly translates to ''The Later Story of Water Margin'', is a novel written by Chen Chen (\u9673\u5ff1) in the [[Qing dynasty]]. The story is set after the end of the original ''Water Margin'', with [[Li Jun (Water Margin)|Li Jun]] as the protagonist. It tells of how the surviving Liangshan heroes are forced to become outlaws again due to corruption in the government. When the armies of the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-ruled [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] invade the Song dynasty, the heroes rise up to defend their nation from the invaders. The heroes eventually decide to leave China for good and sail to distant lands. Apart from the surviving Liangshan heroes from the original novel, ''Shuihu Houzhuan'' also introduces new characters such as [[Hua Rong]]'s son Hua Fengchun (\u82b1\u9022\u6625), [[Xu Ning]]'s son Xu Sheng (\u5f90\u665f) and [[Huyan Zhuo]]'s son Huyan Yu (\u547c\u5ef6\u923a).\n\n''Dang Kou Zhi'' (\u8569\u5bc7\u5fd7), which roughly translates to ''The Tale of Eliminating Bandits'', is a novel written by Yu Wanchun (\u4fde\u842c\u6625) during the reign of the [[Daoguang Emperor]] in the Qing dynasty. Yu disagreed that the Liangshan outlaws are loyal and righteous heroes, and was determined to portray them as ruthless mass murderers and destroyers, hence he wrote ''Dang Kou Zhi''. The novel, which starts at the Grand Assembly of the 108 outlaws at Liangshan Marsh, tells of how the outlaws plundered and pillaged cities before they are eventually eliminated by government forces led by [[Zhang Shuye]] (\u5f35\u53d4\u591c) and his lieutenants Chen Xizhen (\u9673\u5e0c\u771f) and Yun Tianbiao (\u96f2\u5929\u5f6a).\n\nThe Qing dynasty writer Qian Cai intertwined the life stories of [[Yue Fei]] and the outlaws [[Lin Chong]] and [[Lu Junyi]] in ''[[Media about Yue Fei#The Story of Yue Fei|The Story of Yue Fei]]'' (1684).

Considered one of the [[Classic Chinese Novels|Four Great Classical Novels]] of [[Chinese literature]], the novel is written in [[Written vernacular Chinese|vernacular Chinese]] rather than [[Classical Chinese]].<ref name=\"Wu Vernacular Fiction\">Yenna Wu, \"Full-Length Vernacular Fiction,\" in [[Victor Mair]], (ed.), ''[[The Columbia History of Chinese Literature]]''  (NY: [[Columbia University Press]],  2001), pp. 627\u2013629.</ref>\n\nThe story, set in the [[Song dynasty]], tells of how a group of 108 outlaws gather at [[Mount Liang]] (or Liangshan Marsh) to form a sizable army before they are eventually granted amnesty by the government and sent on campaigns to resist foreign invaders and suppress rebel forces. It has introduced to readers many of the best-known characters in Chinese literature, such as [[Wu Song]], [[Lin Chong]] and [[Lu Zhishen]].\n\n==Historical context and development==\n''Water Margin'' was based on the exploits of the outlaw [[Song Jiang]] and his 108 companions (The 36 \"Heavenly Spirits\" and the 72 \"Earthly Demons\"). The group was active in the [[Huainan]] region and surrendered to the [[Song dynasty|Song]] government in 1121. They were recorded in the historical text ''[[History of Song]]''. The name of \"Song Jiang\" also appeared in the biography of [[Emperor Huizong of Song]], which stated:\n{{quote|The outlaw Song Jiang of Huainan and others attacked the army at [[Huaiyang County|Huaiyang]], (the Emperor) sent generals to attack and arrest them. (The outlaws) infringed on the east of the capital ([[Kaifeng]]), [[Hebei]], and entered the boundaries of Chu (referring to present-day [[Hubei]] and [[Hunan]]) and Haizhou (covering parts of present-day [[Jiangsu]]). The prefect Zhang Shuye was ordered to pacify them.<ref>Toktoghan et al. ''History of Song'', Volume 22, Biography of Emperor Huizong (Part Four).</ref>}}\nZhang Shuye's biography further described Song Jiang and the outlaws' activities and how they were eventually defeated by Zhang.<ref>Toktoghan et al. ''History of Song'', Volume 353, Biography of Zhang Shuye.</ref>\n\nFolk stories of Song Jiang circulated during the [[Southern Song]]. The first source to name Song Jiang's 36 companions was ''Miscellaneous observations from the year of Guixin'' (\u7678\u8f9b\u96dc\u8b58) by Zhou Mi, written in the 13th century. Among the 36 were [[Lu Junyi]], [[Guan Sheng]], [[Ruan Xiao'er]], [[Ruan Xiaowu]], [[Ruan Xiaoqi]], [[Liu Tang]], [[Hua Rong]] and [[Wu Yong]]. Some of the characters who later became associated with Song Jiang also appeared around this time. They include [[Sun Li (Water Margin)|Sun Li]], [[Yang Zhi (Water Margin)|Yang Zhi]], [[Lin Chong]], [[Lu Zhishen]] and [[Wu Song]].\n\nA palace memorial by Hou Meng is included in the historical record History of Song, which states: \"Song Jiang and 36 others cross Qi and Wei (the central belt of the North China Plain) at will. Government troops number tens of thousands but no one dare oppose him. His abilities must be extraordinary. Since we also face plunders by Fang La and his outlaws from Qingxi, why not grant Song Jiang and his men amnesty and allow them to lead a campaign against Fang La to redeem themselves?\"\n\nA direct precursor of ''Water Margin'' was the ''Old incidents in the Xuanhe period of the great Song dynasty'' (\u5927\u5b8b\u5ba3\u548c\u907a\u4e8b), which appeared around the mid 13th century. The text is a written version of storytellers' tales, based on supposed historical events. It is divided into ten chapters, roughly covering the history of the Song dynasty from the early 11th century to the establishment of the Southern Song regime in 1127. The fourth chapter covers the adventures of Song Jiang and his 36 companions, and their eventual defeat by Zhang Shuye. Some of the more well-known stories and characters in ''Water Margin'' are clearly visible, including \"Yang Zhi sells his precious sabre\", \"Robbing the convoy of birthday gifts\", \"Song Jiang kills Yan Poxi\", \"Fighting [[Fang La]]\", among others. Song Jiang and his outlaws were said to operate in the [[Taihang Mountains]].\n\nStories about the outlaws became a popular subject for [[Yuan dynasty]] drama. During this time, the material on which ''Water Margin'' was based evolved into what it is in the present. The number of outlaws increased to 108. Even though they came from different backgrounds (including scholars, fishermen, imperial drill instructors etc.), all of them eventually came to occupy [[Mount Liang]] (or Liangshan Marsh). There is a theory that ''Water Margin'' became popular during the Yuan era as the common people (predominantly [[Han Chinese]]) resented the [[Mongols|Mongol]] rulers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Miyamoto |first1=Yoko |title=Water Margin: Chinese Robin Hood and His Bandits |url=http://www.demystifyingconfucianism.info/water-margin |website=Demystifying Confucianism |accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref> The outlaws' rebellion was deemed \"safe\" to promote as it was supposedly a negative reflection of the fallen Song dynasty. Concurrently, the rebellion was also a call for the common people to rise up against corruption in the government. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]], acting on the advice of his ministers, banned the book as a means of preventing revolts.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_476624c9010008qf.html \u660e\u4ee3\u6587\u5b66\u6559\u6848\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ae0\u300a\u6c34\u6d52\u4f20\u300b\uff08\u4e4b\u4e00\uff09]</ref>\n\nThe novel, praised as an early \"masterpiece\" of [[Vernacular literature|vernacular fiction]],<ref name=Findlay>{{cite book|title=Frae ither tongues: essays on modern translations into Scots|author=Findlay, Bill|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2004|isbn=1-85359-700-7|page=21}}</ref> is renowned for the \"mastery and control\" of its mood and tone.<ref name=Findlay/> The work is also known for its use of vivid, humorous and especially racy language.<ref name=Findlay/> However, it has been denounced as \"obscene\" by various critics since the Ming dynasty.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chinese literature|publisher=Foreign Languages Press, original from [[University of Michigan]]|year=1998|page=138}}</ref>\n{{quote|\"These seduction cases are the hardest of all.

Gao abuses his status as a Grand Marshal by oppressing Wang Jin; Wang's father taught Gao a painful lesson when the latter was still a street-roaming ruffian. Wang Jin flees from the capital with his mother and by chance he meets [[Shi Jin]], who becomes his apprentice. The next few chapters tell the story of Shi Jin's friend [[Lu Zhishen]], followed by the story of Lu's sworn brother [[Lin Chong]]. Lin Chong is framed by Gao Qiu for attempting to assassinate him, and almost dies in a fire at a supply depot set by Gao's henchmen. He slays his foes and abandons the depot, eventually making his way to Liangshan Marsh, where he becomes an outlaw. Meanwhile, the \"Original Seven\", led by [[Chao Gai]], rob a convoy of birthday gifts for the Imperial Tutor [[Cai Jing]], another primary antagonist in the novel. They flee to Liangshan Marsh after defeating a group of soldiers sent by the authorities to arrest them, and settle there as outlaws with Chao Gai as their chief. As the story progresses, more people come to join the outlaw band, including military personnel and civil officials who grew tired of serving the corrupt government, as well as men with special skills and talents. Stories of the outlaws are told in separate sections in the following chapters. Connections between characters are vague, but the individual stories are eventually pieced together by chapter 60 when [[Song Jiang]] succeeds Chao Gai as the leader of the band after the latter is killed in a battle against the Zeng Family Fortress.\n\nThe plot further develops by illustrating the conflicts between the outlaws and the Song government after the Grand Assembly of the 108 outlaws. Song Jiang strongly advocates making peace with the government and seeking redress for the outlaws. After defeating the imperial army in a great battle at Liangshan Marsh, the outlaws eventually receive amnesty from [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]]. The emperor recruits them to form a military contingent and sends them on campaigns against invaders from the [[Liao dynasty]] and rebel forces led by [[Tian Hu]], [[Wang Qing (Water Margin)|Wang Qing]] and [[Fang La]] within the Song dynasty's domain. Although the former outlaws eventually emerge victorious against the rebels and Liao invaders, the campaigns also led to the tragic dissolution of the 108 heroes. At least two-thirds of them died in battle while the surviving ones either return to the imperial capital to receive honours from the emperor and continue serving the Song government, or leave and spend the rest of their lives as commoners elsewhere. Song Jiang himself is eventually poisoned to death by the \"Four Treacherous Ministers\" \u2013 [[Gao Qiu]], [[Yang Jian (Song dynasty)|Yang Jian]] (\u694a\u6229), [[Tong Guan]] and [[Cai Jing]].\n\n===Outline of chapters===\n[[File:Lu Zhishen Water Margin 2.jpg|thumb|250px|A 19th-century mural depicting [[Lu Zhishen]] uprooting a tree, a scene from the novel]]\n\nThe following outline of chapters is based on a 100 chapters edition.

The authorship of ''Water Margin'' is still uncertain, and in any case derived from many sources and involved many editorial hands. While the novel was traditionally attributed to [[Shi Nai'an]], of whose life nothing is reliably known, recent scholars think that the novel, or portions of it, may have been written or revised by [[Luo Guanzhong]] (the author of ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'').<ref name=Wilt>Wilt Idema and Lloyd Haft. ''A Guide to Chinese Literature.'' (Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, The University of Michigan,  1997; {{ISBN|0-89264-123-1}}), p. 203.</ref> Other contenders include Shi Hui (\u65bd\u60e0) and Guo Xun (\u90ed\u52db).\n\n===Shi Nai'an===\nMany scholars believe that the first 70 chapters were indeed written by Shi Nai'an; however the authorship of the final 30 chapters is often questioned, with some speculating that it was instead written by Luo Guanzhong, who may have been a student of Shi.<ref name=Wilt/> Another theory, which first appeared in Gao Ru's ''Baichuan Shuzhi'' (\u767e\u5ddd\u66f8\u5fd7) during the Ming dynasty, suggests that the whole novel was written and compiled by Shi, and then edited by Luo.\n\nShi appropriated oral and written texts accumulated over time. Stories of the Liangshan outlaws first appeared in ''Old incidents in the Xuanhe period of the great Song dynasty'' (\u5927\u5b8b\u5ba3\u548c\u907a\u4e8b) and have been circulating since the Southern Song dynasty, while folk tales and opera related to ''Water Margin'' have already existed long before the novel itself came into existence. This theory suggests that Shi Nai'an gathered and compiled these pieces of information to write ''Water Margin''.\n\n===Luo Guanzhong===\nSome believe that ''Water Margin'' was written entirely by Luo Guanzhong. Wang Daokun (\u6c6a\u9053\u6606), who lived during the reign of the [[Jiajing Emperor]] in the [[Ming dynasty]], first mentioned in ''Classification of Water Margin'' (\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3\u6558) that: \"someone with the family name Luo, who was a native of [[Wu (region)|Wuyue]] (Yue (a reference to the southern China region covering [[Zhejiang]]), wrote the 100-chapter novel.\" Several scholars from the Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, after Wang Daokun's time, also pointed out that Luo was the author of ''Water Margin''. During the early [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republican era]], [[Lu Xun]] and [[Yu Pingbo]] suggested that the simplified edition of ''Water Margin'' was written by Luo, while the traditional version was by Shi Nai'an.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nHowever, Huikang Yesou (\u60e0\u5eb7\u91ce\u53df) in ''Shi Yu'' (\u8b58\u9918) disagree with Wang Daokun's view on the grounds that there were significant differences between ''Water Margin'' and ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', therefore these two novels could not have been written by the same person.\n\n[[Hu Shih]] felt that the draft of ''Water Margin'' was done by Luo Guanzhong, and could have contained the chapters on the outlaws' campaigns against [[Tian Hu]], [[Wang Qing (Water Margin)|Wang Qing]] and [[Fang La]], but not invaders from the [[Liao dynasty]].<ref>Hu Shih. ''Research on Water Margin'' (\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3\u8003\u8b49).</ref>\n\nAnother theory states that Luo Guanzhong was from the Southern Song period vice the Ming dynasty. Cheng Muheng (\u7a0b\u7a46\u8861) suggested in ''Notes on Water Margin'' (\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3\u6ce8\u7565) that Luo lived in the late Southern Song dynasty and early Yuan era. Huang Lin'gen (\u9ec3\u9716\u6839) pointed out that the name of one of the compilers of ''Anecdotes of Jingkang'' (\u9756\u5eb7\u7a17\u53f2) was Nai'an, and suggested that this \"Nai'an\", who lived during the Southern Song dynasty, was Shi Nai'an. He also felt that Shi wrote a simplified version of ''Water Margin'', which is not the current edition.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Shi Hui===\nAnother candidate is Shi Hui (\u65bd\u60e0), a ''[[Nanxi (Chinese opera)|nanxi]]'' (''southern opera'') playwright who lived between the late [[Yuan dynasty]] and early [[Ming dynasty]]. Xu Fuzuo (\u5f90\u5fa9\u795a) of the Ming dynasty mentioned in ''Sanjia Cunlao Weitan'' (\u4e09\u5bb6\u6751\u8001\u59d4\u8ac7) that Junmei (\u541b\u7f8e; Shi Hui's [[courtesy name]])'s intention in writing ''Water Margin'' was to entertain people, and not to convey any message. During the [[Qing dynasty]], Shi Hui and Shi Nai'an were linked, suggesting that they are actually the same person. An unnamed writer wrote in ''Chuanqi Huikao Biaomu'' (\u50b3\u5947\u6703\u8003\u6a19\u76ee) that Shi Nai'an's given name was actually \"Hui\", courtesy name \"Juncheng\" (\u541b\u627f), and he was a native of [[Hangzhou]]. Sun Kaidi (\u5b6b\u6977\u7b2c) also wrote in ''Bibliography of Chinese Popular Fiction'' that \"Nai'an\" was Shi Hui's pseudonym. Later studies revealed that ''Water Margin'' contained lines in the [[Wu Chinese|Jiangsu and Zhejiang variety of Chinese]], and that ''You Gui Ji'' (\u5e7d\u95fa\u8bb0), a work of Shi Hui, bore some resemblance to ''Water Margin'', hence the theory that ''Water Margin'' was authored by Shi Hui.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Guo Xun===\nAnother theory attributes the authorship to Guo Xun (\u90ed\u52db), a politician who lived in the Ming dynasty. Shen Defu (\u6c88\u5fb7\u7b26) mentioned in ''Wanli Yehuo Bian'' (\u842c\u66c6\u91ce\u7372\u7de8) that Guo wrote ''Water Margin''. Shen Guoyuan (\u6c88\u570b\u5143) added in ''Huangming Congxin Lu'' (\u7687\u660e\u5f9e\u4fe1\u9304) that Guo mimicked the writing styles of ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' and ''Water Margin'' to write ''Guochao Yinglie Ji'' (\u570b\u671d\u82f1\u70c8\u8a18). Qian Xiyan (\u9322\u5e0c\u8a00) also stated in ''Xi Gu'' (\u6232\u560f) that Guo edited ''Water Margin'' before.  [[Hu Shih]] countered in his ''Research on Water Margin'' (\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3\u65b0\u8003) that Guo Xun's name was used as a disguise for the real author of ''Water Margin''. Dai Bufan (\u6234\u4e0d\u51e1) had a differing view, as he suspected that Guo wrote ''Water Margin'', and then used \"Shi Nai'an\" to conceal his identity as the author of the novel.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Editions==\nThe textual history of the novel is extraordinarily complex for it includes oral folklore, storytellers' tales, and printed versions of different parts and variations. Not until the 1920s were there studies which began to set these questions in order, and there is still disagreement.<ref name=\"Wu Vernacular Fiction\" /> The earliest components of the ''Water Margin'' (in manuscript copies) were from the late 14th century. The earliest extant complete printed edition of ''Water Margin'' is a 100-chapter book dating from the late-16th century in 1589.<ref>Endymion Wilkinson. ''Chinese History: A New Manual.''

Yet other editions were published since this era to the early [[Qing dynasty]], including a 70-chapter edition by [[Jin Shengtan]].\n\nA printed copy of the ''Water Margin'', dating from the [[Jiajing Emperor]]'s reign in the [[Ming dynasty]], titled ''Jingben Zhongyi Zhuan'' (\u4eac\u672c\u5fe0\u7fa9\u50b3), is currently preserved in the [[Shanghai Library]]. The various editions of ''Water Margin'' can roughly be classified into two groups - simplified and traditional.\n\n===Simplified editions===\nThe simplified editions include stories on the outlaws being granted amnesty, followed by their campaigns against the [[Liao dynasty]], [[Tian Hu]], [[Wang Qing (Water Margin)|Wang Qing]] and [[Fang La]], all the way until [[Song Jiang]]'s death. At one point, the later chapters were compiled into a separate novel, titled ''Sequel to Water Margin'' (\u7e8c\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3), which is attributed to [[Luo Guanzhong]].\n\nKnown simplified editions of ''Water Margin'' include:\n\n* A 115-chapter edition, ''Masterpieces of the Han and Song dynasties'' (\u6f22\u5b8b\u5947\u66f8)\n* A 110-chapter edition, ''Chronicles of Heroes'' (\u82f1\u96c4\u8b5c)\n* A 164-chapter edition, combined with ''Sequel to Water Margin''\n\n===Complex editions===\nThe complex editions are more descriptive and circulated more widely than their simplified counterparts. The three main versions of the complex editions are a 100-chapter, a 120-chapter and a 70-chapter edition. The most commonly modified parts of the complex editions are the stories on what happened after the outlaws are granted amnesty.\n\n* 100-chapter edition: Includes the outlaws' campaigns against the [[Liao dynasty]] and [[Fang La]] after they have been granted amnesty.\n* 120-chapter edition: An extended version of the 100-chapter edition, includes the outlaws' campaigns against [[Tian Hu]] and [[Wang Qing (Water Margin)|Wang Qing]].\n* 70-chapter edition: Edited by [[Jin Shengtan]] in the late [[Ming dynasty]], this edition uses Chapter 1 as a prologue and ends at Chapter 71 of the original version, and does not include the stories about the outlaws being granted amnesty and their campaigns.\n\n==Translations==\n[[File:Suikoden.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Yang Lin (Water Margin)|Yang Lin]], a hero from the novel, from [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]'s series of woodblock prints illustrating the 108 Suikoden.]]\n\n''Water Margin'' has been translated into many languages.

The 1827\u20131830 series, called ''108 Heroes of the Water Margin'' or ''Tsuzoku Suikoden goketsu hyakuhachinin no hitori'', catapulted Kuniyoshi to fame.

The novel is based on the story of [[Wu Song]] avenging his brother in ''Water Margin'', but the focus is on [[Ximen Qing]]'s sexual relations with other women, including [[Pan Jinlian]]. In ''Water Margin'', Ximen Qing is killed by Wu Song for murdering the latter's brother, while in ''Jin Ping Mei'' he dies a horrible death due to an accidental overdose of aphrodisiac pills.\n\n''Shuihu Houzhuan'' (\u6c34\u6ef8\u5f8c\u50b3), which roughly translates to ''The Later Story of Water Margin'', is a novel written by Chen Chen (\u9673\u5ff1) in the [[Qing dynasty]]. The story is set after the end of the original ''Water Margin'', with [[Li Jun (Water Margin)|Li Jun]] as the protagonist. It tells of how the surviving Liangshan heroes are forced to become outlaws again due to corruption in the government. When the armies of the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-ruled [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] invade the Song dynasty, the heroes rise up to defend their nation from the invaders. The heroes eventually decide to leave China for good and sail to distant lands. Apart from the surviving Liangshan heroes from the original novel, ''Shuihu Houzhuan'' also introduces new characters such as [[Hua Rong]]'s son Hua Fengchun (\u82b1\u9022\u6625), [[Xu Ning]]'s son Xu Sheng (\u5f90\u665f) and [[Huyan Zhuo]]'s son Huyan Yu (\u547c\u5ef6\u923a).\n\n''Dang Kou Zhi'' (\u8569\u5bc7\u5fd7), which roughly translates to ''The Tale of Eliminating Bandits'', is a novel written by Yu Wanchun (\u4fde\u842c\u6625) during the reign of the [[Daoguang Emperor]] in the Qing dynasty. Yu disagreed that the Liangshan outlaws are loyal and righteous heroes, and was determined to portray them as ruthless mass murderers and destroyers, hence he wrote ''Dang Kou Zhi''. The novel, which starts at the Grand Assembly of the 108 outlaws at Liangshan Marsh, tells of how the outlaws plundered and pillaged cities before they are eventually eliminated by government forces led by [[Zhang Shuye]] (\u5f35\u53d4\u591c) and his lieutenants Chen Xizhen (\u9673\u5e0c\u771f) and Yun Tianbiao (\u96f2\u5929\u5f6a).\n\nThe Qing dynasty writer Qian Cai intertwined the life stories of [[Yue Fei]] and the outlaws [[Lin Chong]] and [[Lu Junyi]] in ''[[Media about Yue Fei#The Story of Yue Fei|The Story of Yue Fei]]'' (1684).

Zhou tutors Wu in the \"rolling dragon\" style of swordplay during his one-month stay in the capital city. It also said that Zhou is a [[Blood brother|sworn brother]] of [[Lu Zhishen]] and shares the same nickname with the executioner-turned-outlaw [[Cai Fu]].<ref>Hsia: pp. 448\u2013449, footnote #31</ref>\n\n[[Frank Chin]]'s novel, ''[[Donald Duk]]'', contains many references to the ''Water Margin''. [[Song Jiang]] and [[Li Kui (Water Margin)|Li Kui]] make several appearances in the protagonist's dreams.\n\n[[Eiji Yoshikawa]] wrote ''Shin Suikoden'' (\u65b0\u6c34\u6ef8\u4f1d), which roughly translates to \"New Tales from the Water Margin\".\n\n===Comics===\n''Water Margin'' is referred to in numerous Japanese [[manga]], such as [[Tetsuo Hara]] and [[Buronson]]'s ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'', and [[Masami Kurumada]]'s ''[[F\u016bma no Kojir\u014d]]'', ''Otokozaka'' and ''[[Saint Seiya]]''. In both works of fiction, characters bearing the same stars of the ''Water Margin'' characters as personal emblems of destiny are featured prominently. A Japanese manga called ''[[Akaboshi: Ibun Suikoden]]'', based on the story of ''Water Margin'', was serialised in ''Weekly Shonen Jump''.\n\nA Hong Kong [[manhua]] series based on ''Water Margin'' was also created by the artist [[Lee Chi Ching]]. A reimagined series based on ''Water Margin'', ''108 Fighters'', was created by [[Andy Seto]].\n\nBetween 1978 and 1988, the Italian artist [[Roberto Raviola|Magnus]] published four acts of his work ''I Briganti'', which places the ''Water Margin'' story in a setting that mixes Chinese, Western and [[science fiction]] (in [[Flash Gordon]] style) elements. Before his death in 1996, the four completed \"acts\" were published in a volume by Granata Press; two following \"acts\" were planned but never completed.\n\nIn 2007, Asiapac Books published a graphic narrative version of portions of the novel.<ref>{{cite book|title=Water Margin Compact Classic|year=2007|edition=reprint|last=Shi|first=Nai'an|authorlink=Shi Nai'an|editor-last=Ng|editor-first=Keng Yeow|isbn=9812294589|publisher=Asiapac Books|accessdate=2018-08-22|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Water_Margin.html?id=7oPpAgAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|header=''Water Margin'' stories in [[Chinese opera]]\n|direction=vertical\n|width=250\n|image1=IMGP9843 (19677562944).jpg \n|caption1=[[Wang Ying (Water Margin)|Wang Ying]] and [[Hu Sanniang]] in [[Peking opera]]\n|image2=\u5750\u697c\u6740\u60dc142326.jpg\n|caption2=Yan Xijiao (Yan Poxi) and [[Song Jiang]] in [[Yangzhou opera]]\n|image3=\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u719f\u6089\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u800c\u53bb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u4e86\u6606\u66f2\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u662f\u771f\u5fc3\u61c2\u5f97\u548c\u559c\u7231\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u603b\u662f\u81ea\u5df1\u5bb6\u4e61\u7684\u827a\u672f\u3002 (16963519006).jpg\n|caption3=[[Pan Jinlian]] in [[Kunqu]]\n}}\n\n===Film===\nMost film adaptations of ''Water Margin'' were produced by Hong Kong's [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] and mostly released in the 1970s and 1980s.

The film stars Edward Norton and [[Edward Furlong]], as two brothers from Los Angeles who are involved in the [[white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for [[voluntary manslaughter]], and during this time, he is rehabilitated, and then tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path. The supporting cast includes [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Ethan Suplee]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]]. \n\nThe story is fictional, but the characters are based on McKenna's childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. Eager to adapt it into a film, he then sold the script to [[New Line Cinema]], who were impressed by the writing. ''American History X'' was Kaye's first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film's release, Kaye and the film studio were hampered by a number of disputes about the final cut of the film. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film, and hurting his own career in Hollywood.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 and distributed by New Line Cinema. Despite lukewarm success at the box office, grossing only $24 million worldwide, ''American History X'' was acclaimed by critics. In particular, Norton was praised for his compelling and realistic performance, which earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. The film has stayed relevant over the years, especially because of the rise of [[white nationalism]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school student Danny Vinyard antagonizes his [[Jewish]] history teacher Mr. Murray by choosing to write a civil rights essay on ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. [[African-American]] principal and [[outreach]] worker Dr. Bob Sweeney tells Danny that he will study history through [[current event]]s under Sweeney's direction or be expelled, calling their class ''American History X''. Danny's first assignment is a paper on his older brother Derek, a former [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] leader released from prison that day. In the bathroom, Danny finds three African-American students bullying a white student and intervenes, openly disrespecting the black students.\n\nDr. Sweeney meets with police officers being briefed on Derek's release. Years earlier, Danny and Derek's father, a [[firefighter]], was shot and killed by African-American drug dealers while putting out a fire at their home. In a television interview after his father's death, Derek erupts in a racist tirade. High-profile racist Cameron Alexander becomes Derek's [[mentor]] and they form their own violent white supremacist gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.), in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]]. A skilled basketball player, Derek is dragged into a game against several [[Crips]], winning control of the local courts. Derek leads a violent attack on a supermarket owned by a Korean man employing [[Illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States|illegal Mexican immigrants]], which Danny records on a [[camcorder]].\n\nDerek's mother Doris, invites Murray, her boyfriend, for dinner where a heated argument about [[Rodney King]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] occurs. Derek assaults his sister Davina, and Doris tells Derek to leave home. That night, the same group of Crips that Derek had beaten in the basketball game earlier attempt to steal his truck. Derek shoots and kills one of them and [[curb stomp]]s another. He is sentenced to three years in the [[California Institution for Men]] for [[voluntary manslaughter]].\n\nIn prison, Derek joins the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and works in the laundry, partnered with Lamont, an African-American. Derek is initially unfriendly, but develops rapport with him over their shared interest of basketball. Derek becomes disillusioned by [[prison gang]] politics; he believes in the ideology, but disapproves of his gang's dealings with non-white gangs. Turning his back on them, he is beaten and [[prison rape|raped]] in the shower by the Aryan Brotherhood. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison. Sweeney warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. gang. Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood, and Lamont warns that he may be targeted by African-American gangs. An attack never comes, and Derek spends the remainder of his sentence alone, reading books from Sweeney. Upon his release, he says goodbye to Lamont, deducing he was the reason Derek was not attacked.\n\nReturning home, Derek finds Danny emulating him, sporting a D.O.C. [[tattoo]] and a [[White power skinhead|skinhead]]. Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, but Danny feels betrayed. Derek's best friend Seth, also a D.O.C. member, frequently disrespects Derek's mother and sister, while grooming Danny for the gang; Seth and Danny are closely controlled by Cameron. At a neo-Nazi party, Derek confronts Cameron for his manipulative behavior, and says that he and Danny will no longer be associated with the movement. Cameron, Derek's former girlfriend Stacy, and the others turn on Derek, who assaults Cameron for insisting Danny will remain under his influence. Seth holds Derek at gunpoint, but Derek disarms him and flees. \n\nAfterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. The pair return home and remove hateful posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on his reasons for adopting white supremacist values, and their flaws. He says that although Derek's racist views may seem to have arisen from anger over his father's death, Danny believes that the seed for his brother's views was planted years earlier; his father often delivered racist rants and [[epithet]]<nowiki/>s, and his death misdirected Derek's anger into racism. Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a [[diner]] for breakfast.\n\nSweeney and a police officer inform Derek that Seth and Cameron are in [[intensive care unit]] after an attack. Derek reluctantly agrees to talk with the people he denounced; walking Danny to school, Derek notices a car may be following him. At school, Danny is shot dead by an African-American student from the previous day's incident. Derek runs to the school and cradles Danny's bloodied body, blaming himself for influencing Danny's views that led him to a conflict with the student. In a [[narration|voiceover]], Danny reads the final lines of his paper for Dr. Sweeney, quoting the final stanza of [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Derek Vinyard\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Danny Vinyard\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Doris Vinyard\n* [[Jennifer Lien]] as Davina Vinyard\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Seth Ryan\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Stacey\n* [[Avery Brooks]] as Dr. Bob Sweeney\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Murray\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cameron Alexander\n* [[William Russ]] as Dennis Vinyard\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Lamont \n* [[Joseph Cortese]] as Rasmussen\n* Antonio David Lyons as Lawrence\n* [[Keram Malicki-S\u00e1nchez]] as Chris\n* [[Giuseppe Andrews]] as Jason\n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Daryl Dawson\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as McMahon\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Michael De Luca 2012.jpg|alt=Michael De Luca, former president of productions at New Line Cinema|thumb|187x187px|[[Michael De Luca]], former production president at New Line Cinema.]]\nScreenwriter [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] wrote the screenplay for ''American History X'' and sold the rights to it when he was 26. The inspiration for the story came from his childhood, where he grew up in a [[Punk rock|punk-rock]] scene, often witnessing violent behavior. \"I saw a lot of bigotry growing up, and it made me think about writing something about the world of hate-mongers. The point I tried to make in the script is that a person is not born a racist. It is learned through environment and the people that surround you. The question that intrigued me is: why do people hate and how does one go about changing that?

He said, \"I had seen documentaries that just didn't ring true to me, and I wanted to write an accurate portrayal of how good kids from good families can get so terribly lost\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nProducer John Morrissey was impressed by the script's intense characters and dialogue, and brought it to the attention of [[Michael De Luca]], then-production president of New Line Cinema, who purchased the script.

The film stars Edward Norton and [[Edward Furlong]], as two brothers from Los Angeles who are involved in the [[white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for [[voluntary manslaughter]], and during this time, he is rehabilitated, and then tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path. The supporting cast includes [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Ethan Suplee]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]]. \n\nThe story is fictional, but the characters are based on McKenna's childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. Eager to adapt it into a film, he then sold the script to [[New Line Cinema]], who were impressed by the writing. ''American History X'' was Kaye's first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film's release, Kaye and the film studio were hampered by a number of disputes about the final cut of the film. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film, and hurting his own career in Hollywood.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 and distributed by New Line Cinema. Despite lukewarm success at the box office, grossing only $24 million worldwide, ''American History X'' was acclaimed by critics. In particular, Norton was praised for his compelling and realistic performance, which earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. The film has stayed relevant over the years, especially because of the rise of [[white nationalism]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school student Danny Vinyard antagonizes his [[Jewish]] history teacher Mr. Murray by choosing to write a civil rights essay on ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. [[African-American]] principal and [[outreach]] worker Dr. Bob Sweeney tells Danny that he will study history through [[current event]]s under Sweeney's direction or be expelled, calling their class ''American History X''. Danny's first assignment is a paper on his older brother Derek, a former [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] leader released from prison that day. In the bathroom, Danny finds three African-American students bullying a white student and intervenes, openly disrespecting the black students.\n\nDr. Sweeney meets with police officers being briefed on Derek's release. Years earlier, Danny and Derek's father, a [[firefighter]], was shot and killed by African-American drug dealers while putting out a fire at their home. In a television interview after his father's death, Derek erupts in a racist tirade. High-profile racist Cameron Alexander becomes Derek's [[mentor]] and they form their own violent white supremacist gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.), in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]]. A skilled basketball player, Derek is dragged into a game against several [[Crips]], winning control of the local courts. Derek leads a violent attack on a supermarket owned by a Korean man employing [[Illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States|illegal Mexican immigrants]], which Danny records on a [[camcorder]].\n\nDerek's mother Doris, invites Murray, her boyfriend, for dinner where a heated argument about [[Rodney King]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] occurs. Derek assaults his sister Davina, and Doris tells Derek to leave home. That night, the same group of Crips that Derek had beaten in the basketball game earlier attempt to steal his truck. Derek shoots and kills one of them and [[curb stomp]]s another. He is sentenced to three years in the [[California Institution for Men]] for [[voluntary manslaughter]].\n\nIn prison, Derek joins the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and works in the laundry, partnered with Lamont, an African-American. Derek is initially unfriendly, but develops rapport with him over their shared interest of basketball. Derek becomes disillusioned by [[prison gang]] politics; he believes in the ideology, but disapproves of his gang's dealings with non-white gangs. Turning his back on them, he is beaten and [[prison rape|raped]] in the shower by the Aryan Brotherhood. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison. Sweeney warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. gang. Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood, and Lamont warns that he may be targeted by African-American gangs. An attack never comes, and Derek spends the remainder of his sentence alone, reading books from Sweeney. Upon his release, he says goodbye to Lamont, deducing he was the reason Derek was not attacked.\n\nReturning home, Derek finds Danny emulating him, sporting a D.O.C. [[tattoo]] and a [[White power skinhead|skinhead]]. Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, but Danny feels betrayed. Derek's best friend Seth, also a D.O.C. member, frequently disrespects Derek's mother and sister, while grooming Danny for the gang; Seth and Danny are closely controlled by Cameron. At a neo-Nazi party, Derek confronts Cameron for his manipulative behavior, and says that he and Danny will no longer be associated with the movement. Cameron, Derek's former girlfriend Stacy, and the others turn on Derek, who assaults Cameron for insisting Danny will remain under his influence. Seth holds Derek at gunpoint, but Derek disarms him and flees. \n\nAfterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. The pair return home and remove hateful posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on his reasons for adopting white supremacist values, and their flaws. He says that although Derek's racist views may seem to have arisen from anger over his father's death, Danny believes that the seed for his brother's views was planted years earlier; his father often delivered racist rants and [[epithet]]<nowiki/>s, and his death misdirected Derek's anger into racism. Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a [[diner]] for breakfast.\n\nSweeney and a police officer inform Derek that Seth and Cameron are in [[intensive care unit]] after an attack. Derek reluctantly agrees to talk with the people he denounced; walking Danny to school, Derek notices a car may be following him. At school, Danny is shot dead by an African-American student from the previous day's incident. Derek runs to the school and cradles Danny's bloodied body, blaming himself for influencing Danny's views that led him to a conflict with the student. In a [[narration|voiceover]], Danny reads the final lines of his paper for Dr. Sweeney, quoting the final stanza of [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Derek Vinyard\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Danny Vinyard\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Doris Vinyard\n* [[Jennifer Lien]] as Davina Vinyard\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Seth Ryan\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Stacey\n* [[Avery Brooks]] as Dr. Bob Sweeney\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Murray\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cameron Alexander\n* [[William Russ]] as Dennis Vinyard\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Lamont \n* [[Joseph Cortese]] as Rasmussen\n* Antonio David Lyons as Lawrence\n* [[Keram Malicki-S\u00e1nchez]] as Chris\n* [[Giuseppe Andrews]] as Jason\n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Daryl Dawson\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as McMahon\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Michael De Luca 2012.jpg|alt=Michael De Luca, former president of productions at New Line Cinema|thumb|187x187px|[[Michael De Luca]], former production president at New Line Cinema.]]\nScreenwriter [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] wrote the screenplay for ''American History X'' and sold the rights to it when he was 26. The inspiration for the story came from his childhood, where he grew up in a [[Punk rock|punk-rock]] scene, often witnessing violent behavior. \"I saw a lot of bigotry growing up, and it made me think about writing something about the world of hate-mongers. The point I tried to make in the script is that a person is not born a racist. It is learned through environment and the people that surround you.

Later, this pen name of his became so famous that once, at an interview, when he was asked his name, he himself had to pause for a moment to remember his real name!

This was the era when India was vehemently trying to get out of snare of [[British raj|British rule]]. Being an Indian he started writing [[Urdu poetry|poems]] that conveyed the moral of adhesion to one's own country. These poems became so influential that his popular revolutionary [[Nazm|'Nazms']] and 'Naghmas' ('Geets') were sung in the 'Prabhat-Pheris' taken out on the streets of cities like [[Lucknow]] and [[Varanasi]] during the [[India's independence|freedom struggle]].\n[[File:Letter from Jawaharlal Nehru to Shamim Karhani.JPG|thumb|left| Letter from [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first [[Prime minister]] of [[India]], to Shamim Karhani.

It was through this nationalist platform that he joined the [[Progressive Writers' Movement]]. In 1948 he composed a [[Nazm|poem]] entitled [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B3WdJB4l6_3hNmE5ZTU4NmEtOTY0Ni00ZGIxLWI5N2UtMjkwOTgxZjc5NTRl&hl=en_US ''Jagao Na Bapu Ko Neend Aa Gayi Hai''] just after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The above poem had such an emotional appeal that it spread like the jungle fire.<ref name=\"Ali Anjum 1986\"/> Once, Shamim Karhani had the opportunity to recite the poem in the presence of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. Nehru, after listening to the poem, got impressed by Shamim's work and asked him to come to [[Lucknow]] to recite his poems in [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] election meetings. Later, after independence, Nehru asked Shamim to come to [[Delhi]]. He migrated to [[Delhi]] in 1950 and met [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] at 'Teen-Murti'. Nehru asked him to compose an epic in Urdu on the [[India's independence|freedom movement of India]] and started giving him a stipend for the job from his personal pocket. On 7 February 1950 he wrote in Shamim's diary:\n\n{{cquote| \"A poet should make his life itself a poem. Shamim Karhani has sung of India's freedom.

His real name was 'Syed Shamsuddin Haider'. He himself chose 'Shamim Karhani' as his pen name ([[Urdu poetry#Pen names .28Takhallus.29|'Takhallus']]). Later, this pen name of his became so famous that once, at an interview, when he was asked his name, he himself had to pause for a moment to remember his real name! He did his secondary education from [[Aligarh Muslim University]] and also did 'Maulvi Kamil Munshi'. For his profession, he chose to be a teacher.<ref name=\"Ali Anjum 1986\">Ali Anjum, Syed Khwaja: ''Shamim Karhani: Hayaat, Shaksiyat aur Shayari'', Syed Sikandar Ali & co., 1986.</ref> He worked with [[Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Schools System]], Kaumi Awaz and [[Anglo Arabic Senior Secondary School|Anglo Arabic School]] (New Delhi).<ref name=\"Ali Anjum 1986\"/> He was a scholar of the [[Persian language|Persian]] language; however he did all his poetry in [[Urdu]].\n\n==Poetry and India's freedom struggle==\n\nShamim had a taste in poetry since he was a kid.  He composed his first couplet at the age of eight.<ref name=\"Ali Anjum 1986\"/> He now was aware what he was born for.  He started writing and was adored all over [[Uttar Pradesh]]. This was the era when India was vehemently trying to get out of snare of [[British raj|British rule]]. Being an Indian he started writing [[Urdu poetry|poems]] that conveyed the moral of adhesion to one's own country. These poems became so influential that his popular revolutionary [[Nazm|'Nazms']] and 'Naghmas' ('Geets') were sung in the 'Prabhat-Pheris' taken out on the streets of cities like [[Lucknow]] and [[Varanasi]] during the [[India's independence|freedom struggle]].\n[[File:Letter from Jawaharlal Nehru to Shamim Karhani.JPG|thumb|left| Letter from [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first [[Prime minister]] of [[India]], to Shamim Karhani. It reads:'''A poet should make his life itself a poem. Shamim Karhani has sung of India's freedom. I hope he will continue to do so and enjoy this freedom''']]\nSoon Shamim Karhani's nationalist and revolutionary poetry started attracting the attention of both the common people and the literati. It was through this nationalist platform that he joined the [[Progressive Writers' Movement]]. In 1948 he composed a [[Nazm|poem]] entitled [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B3WdJB4l6_3hNmE5ZTU4NmEtOTY0Ni00ZGIxLWI5N2UtMjkwOTgxZjc5NTRl&hl=en_US ''Jagao Na Bapu Ko Neend Aa Gayi Hai''] just after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The above poem had such an emotional appeal that it spread like the jungle fire.<ref name=\"Ali Anjum 1986\"/> Once, Shamim Karhani had the opportunity to recite the poem in the presence of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. Nehru, after listening to the poem, got impressed by Shamim's work and asked him to come to [[Lucknow]] to recite his poems in [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] election meetings. Later, after independence, Nehru asked Shamim to come to [[Delhi]]. He migrated to [[Delhi]] in 1950 and met [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] at 'Teen-Murti'. Nehru asked him to compose an epic in Urdu on the [[India's independence|freedom movement of India]] and started giving him a stipend for the job from his personal pocket. On 7 February 1950 he wrote in Shamim's diary:\n\n{{cquote| \"A poet should make his life itself a poem. Shamim Karhani has sung of India's freedom. I hope he will continue to do so and enjoy this freedom\"}}\n\nHis collection entitled \"Roshan Andhera\" was entirely devoted to the \"Quit India Movement\".<ref>Gujral, I.K.: ''P.I.B.
