They allow the designer to make quick changes to the circuit during development.\n\n==Analog circuits==\n{{Main|Analogue electronics}}\n[[File:Common Base amplifier.png|thumb|A [[circuit diagram]] representing an analog circuit, in this case a simple amplifier]] \n\n[[analog electronics|Analog electronic circuits]] are those in which current or [[voltage]] may vary continuously with time to correspond to the information being represented. Analog circuitry is constructed from two fundamental building blocks: [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] and [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]] circuits.\n\nIn a series circuit, the same current passes through a series of components. A string of Christmas lights is a good example of a series circuit: if one goes out, they all do.\n\nIn a parallel circuit, all the components are connected to the same voltage, and the current divides between the various components according to their resistance.\n\n[[File:Simple electrical schematic with Ohms law.png|right|thumb|width200| A simple schematic showing wires, a resistor, and a battery]]\n\nThe basic components of analog circuits are wires, resistors, capacitors, inductors, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s. (In 2012 it was demonstrated that [[memristor]]s can be added to the list of available components.) Analog circuits are very commonly represented in [[schematic diagram]]s, in which wires are shown as lines, and each component has a unique symbol. Analog circuit analysis employs [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]]: all the currents at a node (a place where wires meet), and the voltage around a closed loop of wires is 0. Wires are usually treated as ideal zero-voltage interconnections; any resistance or reactance is captured by explicitly adding a parasitic element, such as a discrete resistor or inductor. Active components such as transistors are often treated as controlled current or voltage sources: for example, a [[field-effect transistor]] can be modeled as a current source from the source to the drain, with the current controlled by the gate-source voltage.\n\nAn alternative model is to take independent power sources and [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] as basic electronic units; this allows modeling frequency dependent [[Negative resistance|negative resistors]], [[gyrator]]s, [[negative impedance converter]]s, and [[dependent source]]s as secondary electronic components.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nWhen the circuit size is comparable to a wavelength of the relevant signal frequency, a more sophisticated approach must be used, the [[distributed-element model]].  Wires are treated as transmission lines, with nominally constant [[characteristic impedance]], and the [[electrical impedance|impedances]] at the start and end determine transmitted and reflected waves on the line.  Circuits designed according to this approach are [[distributed-element circuit]]s. Such considerations typically become important for circuit boards at frequencies above a GHz; integrated circuits are smaller and can be treated as lumped elements for frequencies less than 10GHz or so.\n\n==Digital circuits==\n{{Main|Digital electronics}}\n\nIn [[digital electronics|digital electronic circuits]], electric signals take on discrete values, to represent logical and numeric values.<ref name=\"Hayes\">{{cite journal|title=Introduction to Digital Logic Design|author=John Hayes|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1993}}</ref> These values represent the information that is being processed. In the vast majority of cases, binary encoding is used: one voltage (typically the more positive value) represents a binary '1' and another voltage (usually a value near the ground potential, 0 V) represents a binary '0'.  Digital circuits make extensive use of [[transistor]]s, interconnected to create [[logic gate]]s that provide the functions of [[Boolean logic]]: AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR and combinations thereof.  Transistors interconnected so as to provide positive feedback are used as latches and flip flops, circuits that have two or more metastable states, and remain in one of these states until changed by an external input.  Digital circuits therefore can provide logic and memory, enabling them to perform arbitrary computational functions.  (Memory based on [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] is known as [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM).  Memory based on the storage of charge in a capacitor, [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) is also widely used.)\n\nThe design process for digital circuits is fundamentally different from the process for analog circuits. Each logic gate regenerates the binary signal, so the designer need not account for distortion, gain control, offset voltages, and other concerns faced in an analog design.  As a consequence, extremely complex digital circuits, with billions of logic elements integrated on a single silicon chip, can be fabricated at low cost.  Such digital integrated circuits are ubiquitous in modern electronic devices, such as calculators, mobile phone handsets, and computers.  As digital circuits become more complex, issues of time delay, [[race condition|logic races]], power dissipation, non-ideal switching, on-chip and inter-chip loading, and leakage currents, become limitations to circuit density, speed and performance. \n\nDigital circuitry is used to create general purpose computing chips, such as [[microprocessor]]s, and custom-designed logic circuits, known as [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASICs). [[Field-programmable gate arrays]] (FPGAs), chips with logic circuitry whose configuration can be modified after fabrication, are also widely used in prototyping and development. <!-- and to be done through it -->\n\n==Mixed-signal circuits==\n{{main | Mixed-signal integrated circuit }}\n\nMixed-signal or hybrid circuits contain elements of both analog and digital circuits.  Examples include [[comparator]]s, [[timers]], [[phase-locked loop]]s, [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s.  Most modern radio and communications circuitry uses mixed signal circuits.  For example, in a receiver,  analog circuitry is used to amplify and frequency-convert signals so that they reach a suitable state to be converted into digital values, after which further signal processing can be performed in the digital domain.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Electronic circuit design]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Electronic circuits}}\n* [http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/ Electronics Circuits Textbook]\n* [http://www.rohm.com/web/global/en_index/ Electronics Fundamentals]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electronic Circuit}}\n[[Category:Electronic engineering]]\n[[Category:Electronic circuits| ]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n\n[[es:Circuito electr\u00f3nico]]\n[[hu:\u00c1ramk\u00f6r]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:153056995 5ef8b01016 o.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] from an [[Intel]] 8742, an 8-bit [[microcontroller]] that includes a [[CPU]], 128 [[byte]]s of [[RAM]], 2048 bytes of [[EPROM]], and [[Input/output|I/O]] \"data\" on current chip.]]\n[[File:PExdcr01CJC.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A circuit built on a printed circuit board (PCB).]]\n\nAn '''electronic circuit''' is composed of individual [[electronic component]]s, such as [[resistor]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s and [[diode]]s, connected by conductive [[wire]]s or [[Conductive trace|traces]] through which [[electric current]] can flow.

Wires are usually treated as ideal zero-voltage interconnections; any resistance or reactance is captured by explicitly adding a parasitic element, such as a discrete resistor or inductor. Active components such as transistors are often treated as controlled current or voltage sources: for example, a [[field-effect transistor]] can be modeled as a current source from the source to the drain, with the current controlled by the gate-source voltage.\n\nAn alternative model is to take independent power sources and [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] as basic electronic units; this allows modeling frequency dependent [[Negative resistance|negative resistors]], [[gyrator]]s, [[negative impedance converter]]s, and [[dependent source]]s as secondary electronic components.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nWhen the circuit size is comparable to a wavelength of the relevant signal frequency, a more sophisticated approach must be used, the [[distributed-element model]].  Wires are treated as transmission lines, with nominally constant [[characteristic impedance]], and the [[electrical impedance|impedances]] at the start and end determine transmitted and reflected waves on the line.  Circuits designed according to this approach are [[distributed-element circuit]]s. Such considerations typically become important for circuit boards at frequencies above a GHz; integrated circuits are smaller and can be treated as lumped elements for frequencies less than 10GHz or so.\n\n==Digital circuits==\n{{Main|Digital electronics}}\n\nIn [[digital electronics|digital electronic circuits]], electric signals take on discrete values, to represent logical and numeric values.<ref name=\"Hayes\">{{cite journal|title=Introduction to Digital Logic Design|author=John Hayes|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1993}}</ref> These values represent the information that is being processed. In the vast majority of cases, binary encoding is used: one voltage (typically the more positive value) represents a binary '1' and another voltage (usually a value near the ground potential, 0 V) represents a binary '0'.  Digital circuits make extensive use of [[transistor]]s, interconnected to create [[logic gate]]s that provide the functions of [[Boolean logic]]: AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR and combinations thereof.  Transistors interconnected so as to provide positive feedback are used as latches and flip flops, circuits that have two or more metastable states, and remain in one of these states until changed by an external input.  Digital circuits therefore can provide logic and memory, enabling them to perform arbitrary computational functions.  (Memory based on [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] is known as [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM).  Memory based on the storage of charge in a capacitor, [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) is also widely used.)\n\nThe design process for digital circuits is fundamentally different from the process for analog circuits. Each logic gate regenerates the binary signal, so the designer need not account for distortion, gain control, offset voltages, and other concerns faced in an analog design.  As a consequence, extremely complex digital circuits, with billions of logic elements integrated on a single silicon chip, can be fabricated at low cost.  Such digital integrated circuits are ubiquitous in modern electronic devices, such as calculators, mobile phone handsets, and computers.  As digital circuits become more complex, issues of time delay, [[race condition|logic races]], power dissipation, non-ideal switching, on-chip and inter-chip loading, and leakage currents, become limitations to circuit density, speed and performance. \n\nDigital circuitry is used to create general purpose computing chips, such as [[microprocessor]]s, and custom-designed logic circuits, known as [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASICs). [[Field-programmable gate arrays]] (FPGAs), chips with logic circuitry whose configuration can be modified after fabrication, are also widely used in prototyping and development. <!-- and to be done through it -->\n\n==Mixed-signal circuits==\n{{main | Mixed-signal integrated circuit }}\n\nMixed-signal or hybrid circuits contain elements of both analog and digital circuits.  Examples include [[comparator]]s, [[timers]], [[phase-locked loop]]s, [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s.  Most modern radio and communications circuitry uses mixed signal circuits.  For example, in a receiver,  analog circuitry is used to amplify and frequency-convert signals so that they reach a suitable state to be converted into digital values, after which further signal processing can be performed in the digital domain.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Electronic circuit design]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Electronic circuits}}\n* [http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/ Electronics Circuits Textbook]\n* [http://www.rohm.com/web/global/en_index/ Electronics Fundamentals]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electronic Circuit}}\n[[Category:Electronic engineering]]\n[[Category:Electronic circuits| ]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n\n[[es:Circuito electr\u00f3nico]]\n[[hu:\u00c1ramk\u00f6r]]\n", "name_user": "77.103.76.124", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit"}

Roman is mentioned as tsar in several historical sources; for example the ''Annals'' by Yahya of [[Antioch]] call Roman \"Tsar\" and Samuel \"Roman's loyal military chief\". However, other historians dispute this theory, as Roman was castrated and so technically could not have claimed the crown. There was also a governor of Skopje called Roman who surrendered the city to the Byzantines in 1004, receiving the title of patrician from [[Basil II]] and becoming a Byzantine ''[[strategos]]'' in Abydus ([[John Skylitzes|Skylitzes]]-Cedr.

This was secured by the marriage of Peter with the Byzantine princess [[Eirene Lakapena|Maria Lakapina]], granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]]. However, after Maria's death in 963, the truce had been shaken and it was at this time or later that Peter I sent his sons [[Boris II of Bulgaria|Boris]] and [[Roman of Bulgaria|Roman]] to [[Constantinople]] as honorary hostages, to honor the new terms of the peace treaty.<ref>According to Zlatarski (''History of the Bulgarian state'', I, 2, [http://www.promacedonia.org/vz1b/vz1b_5_3.html pp. 544, 562.]) the sons of Peter I were sent in the Byzantine capital in 963 as one of the term to resettle the peace treaty of 927. According to other historians such as Andreev (''Who is who in Medieval Bulgaria'', p. 41.) the heirs to the Bulgarian throne became hostages per a Bulgarian-Byzantine agreement against the Kievan Rus' in 968.</ref> During these years the Byzantines and Bulgarians had entangled themselves in [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|a war]] with [[Kievan Rus']] Prince [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]], who invaded Bulgaria several times. After a defeat from Sviatoslav, Peter I suffered a stroke and abdicated his throne in 969 (he died the next year). Boris was allowed back to Bulgaria to take his father's throne, restore order and oppose Sviatoslav, but had little success. This was allegedly used by Nicholas and his sons, who were contemplating a revolt in 969.<ref>Skylitzes records:  He [Peter] himself died shortly afterwards, whereupon the sons were sent to Bulgaria to secure the ancestral throne and to restrain the 'children of the counts' from further t.

The new Byzantine Emperor [[John Tzimiskes]] used this to his advantage. He quickly invaded Bulgaria the following year, defeated the Rus, and conquered the Bulgarian capital Preslav. Boris II of Bulgaria was ritually divested of his imperial insignia in a public ceremony in Constantinople and he and his brother [[Roman of Bulgaria]] remained in captivity. Although the ceremony in 971 had been intended as a symbolic termination of the Bulgarian Empire, the Byzantines were unable to assert their control over the western provinces of Bulgaria.

[[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] resisted for weeks but was conquered following a long siege.

Since the beginning of the 9th century, the Bulgarian territory had stretched beyond the [[Carpathian Mountains]] as far as the [[Tisza]] River and the middle Danube. During the reign of Samuel, the governor of these northwestern parts was duke [[Ahtum]], the grandson of duke [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], who had been defeated by the Hungarians in the 930s. Ahtum commanded a strong army and firmly defended the northwestern borders of the Empire. He also built many churches and monasteries through which he spread Christianity in [[Transylvania]].<ref>''Legenda Saneti Gerhardi episcopi'', p. 489.</ref><ref>Venedikov, p. 150.</ref>\n\nAlthough Gavril Radomir's marriage to the daughter of the Hungarian ruler had established friendly relations between the two strongest states of the Danube area, the relationship deteriorated after G\u00e9za's death. The Bulgarians supported Gyula and Kopp\u00e1ny as rulers instead of G\u00e9za's son [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]]. As a result of this conflict, the marriage between Gavril Radomir and the Hungarian princess was dissolved. The Hungarians then attacked Ahtum, who had directly backed the pretenders for the Hungarian crown. Stephen I convinced Hanadin, Ahtum's right-hand man, to help in the attack. When the conspiracy was uncovered Hanadin fled and joined the Hungarian forces.<ref>''Legenda Saneti Gerhardi episcopi'', pp. 492\u2013493.</ref> At the same time, a strong Byzantine army besieged Vidin, Ahtum's seat. Although many soldiers were required to participate in the defense of the town, Ahtum was occupied with the war to the north.

Roman is mentioned as tsar in several historical sources; for example the ''Annals'' by Yahya of [[Antioch]] call Roman \"Tsar\" and Samuel \"Roman's loyal military chief\". However, other historians dispute this theory, as Roman was castrated and so technically could not have claimed the crown. There was also a governor of Skopje called Roman who surrendered the city to the Byzantines in 1004, receiving the title of patrician from [[Basil II]] and becoming a Byzantine ''[[strategos]]'' in Abydus ([[John Skylitzes|Skylitzes]]-Cedr.

This was secured by the marriage of Peter with the Byzantine princess [[Eirene Lakapena|Maria Lakapina]], granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]]. However, after Maria's death in 963, the truce had been shaken and it was at this time or later that Peter I sent his sons [[Boris II of Bulgaria|Boris]] and [[Roman of Bulgaria|Roman]] to [[Constantinople]] as honorary hostages, to honor the new terms of the peace treaty.<ref>According to Zlatarski (''History of the Bulgarian state'', I, 2, [http://www.promacedonia.org/vz1b/vz1b_5_3.html pp. 544, 562.]) the sons of Peter I were sent in the Byzantine capital in 963 as one of the term to resettle the peace treaty of 927. According to other historians such as Andreev (''Who is who in Medieval Bulgaria'', p. 41.) the heirs to the Bulgarian throne became hostages per a Bulgarian-Byzantine agreement against the Kievan Rus' in 968.</ref> During these years the Byzantines and Bulgarians had entangled themselves in [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|a war]] with [[Kievan Rus']] Prince [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]], who invaded Bulgaria several times. After a defeat from Sviatoslav, Peter I suffered a stroke and abdicated his throne in 969 (he died the next year). Boris was allowed back to Bulgaria to take his father's throne, restore order and oppose Sviatoslav, but had little success. This was allegedly used by Nicholas and his sons, who were contemplating a revolt in 969.<ref>Skylitzes records:  He [Peter] himself died shortly afterwards, whereupon the sons were sent to Bulgaria to secure the ancestral throne and to restrain the 'children of the counts' from further t. David, Moses, Aaron and Samuel, children of one of the powerful counts in Bulgaria, were contemplating an uprising and were unsettling the Bulgars'</ref>\n\nThe Rus' invaded Byzantine Thrace in 970, but suffered a defeat in the [[Battle of Arcadiopolis (970)|Battle of Arcadiopolis]]. The new Byzantine Emperor [[John Tzimiskes]] used this to his advantage. He quickly invaded Bulgaria the following year, defeated the Rus, and conquered the Bulgarian capital Preslav. Boris II of Bulgaria was ritually divested of his imperial insignia in a public ceremony in Constantinople and he and his brother [[Roman of Bulgaria]] remained in captivity. Although the ceremony in 971 had been intended as a symbolic termination of the Bulgarian Empire, the Byzantines were unable to assert their control over the western provinces of Bulgaria.

Since the beginning of the 9th century, the Bulgarian territory had stretched beyond the [[Carpathian Mountains]] as far as the [[Tisza]] River and the middle Danube. During the reign of Samuel, the governor of these northwestern parts was duke [[Ahtum]], the grandson of duke [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], who had been defeated by the Hungarians in the 930s. Ahtum commanded a strong army and firmly defended the northwestern borders of the Empire. He also built many churches and monasteries through which he spread Christianity in [[Transylvania]].<ref>''Legenda Saneti Gerhardi episcopi'', p. 489.</ref><ref>Venedikov, p. 150.</ref>\n\nAlthough Gavril Radomir's marriage to the daughter of the Hungarian ruler had established friendly relations between the two strongest states of the Danube area, the relationship deteriorated after G\u00e9za's death. The Bulgarians supported Gyula and Kopp\u00e1ny as rulers instead of G\u00e9za's son [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]]. As a result of this conflict, the marriage between Gavril Radomir and the Hungarian princess was dissolved. The Hungarians then attacked Ahtum, who had directly backed the pretenders for the Hungarian crown. Stephen I convinced Hanadin, Ahtum's right-hand man, to help in the attack. When the conspiracy was uncovered Hanadin fled and joined the Hungarian forces.<ref>''Legenda Saneti Gerhardi episcopi'', pp. 492\u2013493.</ref> At the same time, a strong Byzantine army besieged Vidin, Ahtum's seat.

T. Batsford, 1964), p. 14.</ref> G.F.A Best in his biography ''Shaftesbury'' writes that: \"Ashley grew up without any experience of parental love.  He saw little of his parents, and when duty or necessity compelled them to take notice of him they were formal and frightening.\"<ref name=\"Best, p. 15\">Best, p. 15.</ref> Even as an adult, he disliked his father and was known to refer to his mother as \"a devil\".\n\nThis difficult childhood was softened by the affection he received from his housekeeper Maria Millis, and his sisters.  Millis provided for Ashley a model of Christian love that would form the basis for much of his later social activism and philanthropic work, as Best explains: \"What did touch him was the reality, and the homely practicality, of the love which her Christianity made her feel towards the unhappy child.  She told him bible stories, she taught him a prayer.\"<ref>Best, p. 16.</ref>  Despite this powerful reprieve, school became another source of misery for the young Ashley, whose education at Manor House from 1808 to 1813 introduced a \"more disgusting range of horrors\".<ref name=\"Best, p. 15\"/>  Shaftesbury himself shuddered to recall those years, \"The place was bad, wicked, filthy; and the treatment was starvation and cruelty.\"<ref name=\"Best, p. 15\"/>\n\nBy his teenage years, Ashley had become a committed Christian and whilst at Harrow he had two experiences which influenced his later life. \"Once, at the foot of Harrow Hill, he was the horrified witness of a pauper\u2019s funeral. The drunken pall-bearers, stumbling along with a crudely-made coffin and shouting snatches of bawdy songs, brought home to him the existence of a whole empire of callousness which put his own childhood miseries in their context. The second incident was his unusual choice of a subject for a Latin poem. In the school grounds, there was an unsavoury mosquito-breeding pond called the Duck Puddle. He chose it as his subject because he was urgently concerned that the school authorities should do something about it, and this appeared to be the simplest way of bringing it to their attention. Soon afterwards the Duck Puddle was inspected, condemned and filled in. This little triumph was a useful fillip to his self-confidence, but it was more than that. It was a foretaste of his skill in getting people to act decisively in face of sloth or immediate self-interest. This was to prove one of his greatest assets in Parliament.\"<ref name=\"churchsociety\">[https://churchsociety.org/issues_new/history/shaftesbury/iss_history_shaftesbury_Hewitt-GoodSamaritan.asp II.

Ashley politely declined, writing in his diary that he believed that serving under Canning would be a betrayal of his allegiance to the Duke of Wellington and that he was not qualified for office.<ref>Georgina Battiscombe, ''Shaftesbury: A Biography of the Seventh Earl. 1801\u20131885'' (London: Constable, 1974), p. 28.</ref> Before he had completed one year in the Commons, he had been appointed to three parliamentary committees and he received his fourth such appointment in June 1827, when he was appointed to the Select Committee On Pauper Lunatics in the County of Middlesex and on Lunatic Asylums.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 31.</ref>\n\n===Reform of the Lunacy Laws===\n{{See also|History of psychiatric institutions}}\n[[File:Anthony Ashley-Cooper (H Hering NPG Ax39880).jpg|thumb|left|Lord Shaftesbury by Henry Hering.]]\nIn 1827, when Ashley-Cooper was appointed to the Select Committee On Pauper Lunatics in the County of Middlesex and on Lunatic Asylums, the majority of lunatics in London were kept in madhouses owned by Dr Warburton. The Committee examined many witnesses concerning one of his madhouses in [[Bethnal Green]], called the White House. Ashley visited this on the Committee's behalf. The patients were chained up, slept naked on straw, and went to toilet in their beds. They were left chained from Saturday afternoon until Monday morning when they were cleared of the accumulated excrement. They were then washed down in freezing cold water and one towel was allotted to 160 people, with no soap. It was overcrowded and the meat provided was \"that nasty thick hard muscle a dog could not eat\". The White House had been described as \"a mere place for dying\" rather than curing the insane and when the Committee asked Dr MacMichael whether he believed that \"in the lunatic asylums in the neighbourhood of London any curative process is going on with regard to pauper patients\", he replied: \"None at all\".<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n[[File:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury by George Frederic Watts.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Shaftesbury by [[George Frederick Watts]].]]\n\nThe Committee recommended that \"legislative measures of a remedial character should be introduced at the earliest period at the next session\", and the establishment of a Board of Commissioners appointed by the Home Secretary possessing extensive powers of licensing, inspection and control.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 37.</ref> When in February 1828 Robert Gordon, Liberal MP for [[Cricklade (UK Parliament constituency)|Cricklade]], introduced a bill to put these recommendations into law, Ashley seconded this and delivered his maiden speech in support of the Bill. He wrote in his diary: \"So, by God's blessing, my first effort has been for the advance of human happiness. May I improve hourly! Fright almost deprived me of recollection but again thank Heaven, I did not sit down quite a presumptuous idiot\". Ashley was also involved in framing the [[County Lunatic Asylums (England) Act 1828]] and the [[Madhouses Act 1828]]. Through these Acts, fifteen commissioners were appointed for the London area and given extensive powers of licensing and inspection, one of the commissioners being Ashley.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\nIn July 1845, Ashley sponsored two [[Lunacy Act 1845|Lunacy Acts]], \u2018For the Regulation of lunatic Asylums\u2019 and \u2018For the better Care and Treatment of Lunatics in England and Wales\u2019. They originated in the Report of the [[Commissioners in Lunacy]] which he had commended to Parliament the year before. These Acts consolidated and amended previous lunacy laws, providing better record keeping and more strict certification regulations to ensure patients against unwarranted detention. They also ordered, instead of merely permitting, the construction of country lunatic asylums with and establishing an ongoing Lunacy Commission with Ashley as its chairman.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 182.</ref> In support of these measures, Ashley gave a speech in which he claimed that although since 1828 there had been an improvement, more still needed to be done. He cited the case of a Welsh lunatic girl, Mary Jones, who had for more than a decade been locked in a tiny loft with one boarded-up window with little air and no light. The room was extremely filthy and was filled with an intolerable smell. She could only [[Squatting position|squat]] in a bent position in the room and this had caused her to become deformed.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 182\u2013183.</ref>\n[[File:7th Earl of Shaftesbury.png|thumb|The Earl of Shaftesbury by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]], 1869]]\n\nIn early 1858, a Select Committee was appointed over concerns that sane persons were detained in lunatic asylums. Lord Shaftesbury (as Ashley had become upon his father's death in 1851) was the chief witness and opposed the suggestion that the certification of insanity be made more difficult and that early treatment of insanity was essential if there was to be any prospect of a cure. He claimed that only one or two people in his time dealing with lunacy had been detained in an asylum without sufficient grounds and that commissioners should be granted more not fewer powers. The Committee's Report endorsed all of Shaftesbury's recommendations except for one: that a magistrate's signature on a certificate of lunacy be made compulsory. This was not put into law chiefly due to Shaftesbury's opposition to it. [[Clarification needed]] The Report also agreed with Shaftesbury that unwarranted detentions were \"extremely rare\".<ref>Battiscombe, p. 259.</ref>\n\nIn July 1877, Shaftesbury gave evidence before the Select Committee on the Lunacy Laws, which had been appointed in February over concerns that it was too easy for sane persons to be detained in asylums. Shaftesbury feared that because of his advanced age he would be taken over by forgetfulness whilst giving evidence and was greatly stressed in the months leading up to this: \"Shall fifty years of toil, anxiety and prayer, crowned by marvellous and unlooked-for success, bring me in the end only sorrow and disgrace?\" When \"the hour of trial\" arrived Shaftesbury defended the Lunacy Commission and claimed he was now the only person alive who could speak with personal knowledge of the state of care of lunatics before the Lunacy Commission was established in 1828. It had been \"a state of things such as would pass all belief\". In the Committee's Report, the members of the Committee agreed with Shaftesbury's evidence on all points.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 319\u2013320.</ref>\n\nIn 1884, the husband of Mrs Georgina Weldon tried to have her detained in a lunatic asylum because she believed that her pug dog had a soul and that the spirit of her dead mother had entered into her pet rabbit. She commenced legal action against Shaftesbury and other lunacy commissioners although it failed. In May, Shaftesbury spoke in the Lords against a motion declaring the lunacy laws unsatisfactory but the motion passed Parliament. The Lord Chancellor Selborne supported a Lunacy Law Amendment Bill and Shaftesbury wanted to resign from the Lunacy Commission as he believed he was honour bound not to oppose a Bill supported by the Lord Chancellor. However, Selborne implored him not to resign so Shaftesbury refrained. However, when the Bill was introduced and it contained the provision which made it compulsory for a certificate of lunacy to be signed by a magistrate or a judge, he resigned. The government fell, however, and the Bill was withdrawn and Shaftesbury resumed his chairmanship of the Lunacy Commission.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 330\u2013331.</ref>\n\nShaftesbury's work in improving the care of the insane remains one of his most important, though lesser known, achievements. He wrote: \"Beyond the circle of my own Commissioners and the lunatics that I visit, not a soul, in great or small life, not even my associates in my works of philanthropy, has any notion of the years of toil and care that, under God, I have bestowed on this melancholy and awful question\".<ref>Battiscombe, p. 318.</ref>\n\n===Child labour and factory reform===\nIn March 1833, Ashley introduced the [[Factory Acts#Labour of Children, etc., in Factories Act 1833|Ten Hours Act 1833]] into the Commons, which provided that children working in the cotton and woollen industries must be aged nine or above; no person under the age of eighteen was to work more than ten hours a day or eight hours on a Saturday; and no one under twenty-five was to work nights. However the Whig government, by a majority of 145, amended this to substitute \"thirteen\" in place of \"eighteen\" and the Act as it passed ensured that no child under thirteen worked more than nine hours, insisted they should go to school, and appointed inspectors to enforce the law.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 88, p. 91.</ref>\n\nIn June 1836, another Ten Hours act was introduced into the Commons and although Ashley considered this Bill ill-timed, he supported it. In July one member of the Lancashire committees set up to support the Bill wrote that: \"If there was one man in England more devoted to the interests of the factory people than another, it was Lord Ashley. They might always rely on him as a ready, steadfast and willing friend\".<ref name=\"Battiscombe, p. 109\">Battiscombe, p. 109.</ref> In July 1837, he accused the government of ignoring the breaches of the 1833 Act and moved the resolution that the House regretted the regulation of the working hours of children had been found to be unsatisfactory. It was lost by fifteen votes.<ref name=\"Battiscombe, p. 109\"/>\n\nThe text of ''U mums fat'' was sent to Lord Ashley and with his support was published in 1840.<ref>[http://spartacus-educational.com/IRashley.htm Lord Ashley], Spartacus, retrieved 2 January 2014</ref> Ashley employed [[William Dodd (writer)|William Dodd]] at 45 shillings a week and he wrote \"The Factory System: Illustrated\" to describe the conditions of working children in textile manufacture. This was published in 1842.<ref>[http://www.historymole.com/cgi-bin/main/results.pl?theme=10001537 Anthony Ashley Cooper], HistoryMole, retrieved 2 January 2014</ref> These books were attacked by [[John Bright]] in parliament who said that he had evidence that the books described Dodd's mistreatment but were in fact driven by Dodd's ingratitude as a disgruntled employee. Ashley sacked Dodd who emigrated to America.<ref name=wdodd>[http://spartacus-educational.com/IRdodd.htm William Dodd] in ''Spartacus Educational'', retrieved 2 January 2014</ref>\n\nIn 1842, Ashley wrote twice to the Prime Minister, [[Robert Peel]], to urge the government to support a new Factory Act. Peel wrote in reply that he would not support one and Ashley wrote to the Short Time Committees of Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire who desired a Ten Hours Act:\n<blockquote>Though painfully disappointed, I am not disheartened, nor am I at a loss either what course to take, or what advice to give. I shall persevere unto my last hour, and so must you; we must exhaust every legitimate means that the Constitution afford, in petitions to Parliament, in public meetings, and in friendly conferences with your employers; but you must infringe no law, and offend no proprieties; we must all work together as sensible men, who will one day give an account of their motives and actions; if this course is approved, no consideration shall detach me from your cause; if not, you must elect another advocate.\nI know that, in resolving on this step, I exclude myself altogether from the tenure of office; I rejoice in the sacrifice, happy to devote the remainder of my days, be they many or be they few, as God in His wisdom shall determine, to an effort, however laborious, to ameliorate your moral and social condition.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 143\u2013144.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn March 1844, Ashley moved an amendment to a Factory Bill limiting the working hours of adolescents to ten hours after Sir [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|James Graham]] had introduced a Bill aiming to limit their working hours to twelve hours. Ashley's amendment was passed by eight votes, the first time the Commons had approved of the Ten Hour principle. However, in a later vote his amendment was defeated by seven votes and the Bill was withdrawn.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 171.</ref> Later that month, Graham introduced another Bill which again would limit the employment of adolescents to twelve hours. Ashley supported this Bill except that he wanted ten hours not twelve as the limit. In May he moved an amendment to limit the hours worked to ten hours but this was lost by 138 votes.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 175.</ref>\n\nIn 1846, whilst he was out of Parliament, Ashley strongly supported [[John Fielden]]'s Ten Hours Bill, which was lost by ten votes.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 199.</ref> In January 1847, Fielden reintroduced his Bill and it finally passed through Parliament to become the [[Factory Act 1847|Ten Hours Act]].<ref>Battiscombe, p. 202.</ref>\n\n===Miners===\n\nAshley introduced the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842]] in Parliament to outlaw the employment of women and children underground in [[coal mining|coal mines]]. He made a speech in support of the Act and the [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Consort]] wrote to him afterwards, sending him the \"best wishes for your ''total'' success\". At the end of his speech, his opponent on the Ten Hours issue, Cobden, walked over to Ashley and said: \"You know how opposed I have been to your views, but I don't think I have ever been put into such a frame of mind in the whole course of my life as I have been by your speech\".<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 148\u2013149.</ref>\n\n===Climbing boys===\n\nAshley was a strong supporter of prohibiting the employment of boys as [[chimney sweeps]]. Many climbing boys were illegitimate who had been sold by their parents. They suffered from scorched and lacerated skin, their eyes and throats filled with soot, with the danger of suffocation and their occupational disease\u2014[[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma|cancer of the scrotum]].<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref> In 1840, a [[Chimney Sweepers and Chimneys Regulation Act 1840|Bill]] was introduced into the Commons outlawing the employment of boys as chimney sweeps, and strongly supported by Ashley. Despite being enforced in London, elsewhere the Act did not stop the employment of child chimney sweeps and this led to the foundation of the Climbing-Boys' Society with Ashley as its chairman. In 1851, 1853 and 1855, Shaftesbury introduced Bills into Parliament to deal with the ongoing use of boy chimney sweeps but these were all defeated. He succeeded in passing the [[Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act 1864]] but, like its predecessors, it remained ineffectual. Shaftesbury finally persuaded Parliament to pass the [[Chimney Sweepers Act 1875]] which ensured the annual licensing of chimney sweeps and the enforcement of the law by the police. This finally eradicated the employment of boys as chimney sweeps.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 126\u2013127.</ref>\n\nAfter Shaftesbury discovered that a boy chimney sweep was living behind his house in Brock Street, London, he rescued the child and sent him to \"the Union School at Norwood Hill, where, under God's blessing and special merciful grace, he will be trained in the knowledge and love and faith of our common Saviour\".<ref>Battiscombe, p. 127.</ref>\n\n===Education reform===\n\nIn 1844, Ashley became president of the [[ragged school|Ragged School Union]] that promoted ragged schools. These schools were for poor children and sprang up from volunteers. Ashley wrote that \"If the Ragged School system were to fail I should not die in the course of nature, I should die of a broken heart\".<ref>Battiscombe, p. 196.</ref>\n\n===Religion and Jewish restorationism===\n\nShaftesbury was a pre-millennial evangelical Anglican who believed in the imminent second coming of Christ. His belief underscored the urgency of immediate action.  He strongly opposed the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and any hint of Romanism or ritualism among  High Church Anglicans. He strongly opposed the [[Oxford Movement]] in the Church of England, fearful of Catholic features. He denounced the [[Maynooth College Act 1845]], which funded the Catholic seminary in Ireland that would train many priests.<ref>John Wolffe, \"Cooper, Anthony Ashley-, seventh Earl of Shaftesbury (1801\u20131885)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'',  2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6210, accessed 6 Nov 2017]</ref>\n\n[[File:Memorandum to Protestant Monarchs of Europe for the restoration of the Jews to Palestine, Colonial Times 1841.jpg|thumb|Lord Shaftesbury's \"Memorandum to Protestant Monarchs of Europe for the restoration of the Jews to Palestine\", published in the ''[[Colonial Times]]'', in 1841]]\nShaftesbury was a leading figure within 19th-century [[evangelical Anglicanism]].<ref name=Chapman>{{cite book | last = Chapman | first = Mark | author-link = | title = Anglicanism: A Very Short Introduction | publisher = Oxford University Press | series = Very Short Introductions | date = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7koSDAAAQBAJ | isbn = 9780192806932 | page = 61}}</ref> Shaftesbury was President of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (BFBS) from 1851 until his death in 1885.

The conquest of [[Greater Syria]] in 1831 by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] changed the conditions under which European power politics operated in the Near East. As a consequence of that shift, Shaftesbury was able to help persuade Foreign Minister [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] to send a British consul, [[James Finn]], to Jerusalem in 1838. Shaftesbury became president of the [[London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews]],<ref>{{Cite book|author=Wigram, Joseph Cotton bp. of Rochester|year=1866|title=Report on the conference upon the Rosenthal case, held with the representatives of the committee of the London society for promoting Christianity among the Jews, by the bishop of Rochester and others.|location=London |publisher= Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer|page=2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=zzUYUmy91t0C&dq=intitle%3AReport%20on%20the%20conference%20upon%20the%20Rosenthal%20case%20held%20with%20the%20representatives%20of%20the%20committee%20of%20the%20London%20society%20for%20promoting%20Christianity%20among%20the%20Jews%20by%20the%20bishop%20of%20Rochester%20and%20others&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false]|isbn=}}</ref> of which Finn was a prominent member. A committed Christian and a loyal Englishman, Shaftesbury argued for a Jewish return because of what he saw as the political and economic advantages to England and because he believed that it was God's will. In January 1839, Shaftesbury published an article in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'', which although initially commenting on the 1838 ''Letters on Egypt, Edom and the Holy Land (1838)'' by [[Alexander Lindsay, 25th Earl of Crawford|Lord Lindsay]], provided the first proposal by a major politician to resettle Jews in Palestine:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3YEfAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA108&output=text#c_top The London Quarterly Review, Volume 63, Number 125, pp166\u2013192.]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=6hw7TdiuGsqv8gP08ODZCA&ct=result&id=8rgpAQAAIAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22Nahum+Sokolow%22&q=masterly#search_anchor Nahum Sokolow \"History of Zionism, 1600\u20131918\" ]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe soil and climate of Palestine are singularly adapted to the growth of produce required for the exigencies of Great Britain; the finest cotton may be obtained in almost unlimited abundance; silk and madder are the staple of the country, and olive oil is now, as it ever was, the very fatness of the land. Capital and skill are alone required: the presence of a British officer, and the increased security of property which his presence will confer, may invite them from these islands to the cultivation of Palestine; and the Jews, who will betake themselves to agriculture in no other land, having found, in the English consul, a mediator between their people and the Pacha, will probably return in yet greater numbers, and become once more the husbandmen of Judaea and Galilee.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_b3oBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=Anthony+Ashley-Cooper,+7th+Earl+of+Shaftesbury+%2B+Jews&source=bl&ots=83M4i7Na0-&sig=pBa3mBhQ1yshTrTEUmPAk0lh5i0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixuNbyy4LNAhXGQD4KHffiBQsQ6AEIWDAN#v=onepage&q=Anthony%20Ashley-Cooper%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Shaftesbury%20%20%20Jews&f=false Masalha, Nur.

In July 1853, Shaftesbury wrote to the Prime Minister, [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], that Greater Syria was \"a country without a nation\u201d in need of \u201ca nation without a country... Is there such a thing? To be sure there is, the ancient and rightful lords of the soil, the Jews!\" In his diary that year he wrote \"these vast and fertile regions will soon be without a ruler, without a known and acknowledged power to claim dominion. The territory must be assigned to some one or other...

In the taking home to himself by our gracious Lord of the Earl of Shaftesbury, we have, in my judgment, lost the best man of the age. I do not know whom I should place second, but I certainly should put him first\u2014far beyond all other servants of God within my knowledge\u2014for usefulness and influence. He was a man most true in his personal piety, as I know from having enjoyed his private friendship; a man most firm in his faith in the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; a man intensely active in the cause of God and truth. Take him whichever way you please, he was admirable: he was faithful to God in all his house, fulfilling both the first and second commands of the law in fervent love to God, and hearty love to man. He occupied his high position with singleness of purpose and immovable steadfastness: where shall we find his equal? If it is not possible that he was absolutely perfect, it is equally impossible for me to mention a single fault; for I saw none. He exhibited scriptural perfection, inasmuch as he was sincere, true, and consecrated. Those things which have been regarded as faults by the loose thinkers of this age are prime virtues in my esteem. They called him narrow; and in this they bear unconscious testimony to his loyalty to truth. I rejoiced greatly in his integrity, his fearlessness, his adherence to principle, in a day when revelation is questioned, the gospel explained away, and human thought set up as the idol of the hour. He felt that there was a vital and eternal difference between truth and error; consequently, he did not act or talk as if there was much to be said on either side, and, therefore, no one could be quite sure. We shall not know for many a year how much we miss in missing him; how great an anchor he was to this drifting generation, and how great a stimulus he was to every movement for the benefit of the poor. Both man and beast may unite in mourning him: he was the friend of every living thing. He lived for the oppressed; he lived for London; he lived for the nation; he lived still more for God. He has finished his course; and though we do not lay him to sleep in the grave with the sorrow of those that have no hope, yet we cannot but mourn that a great man and a prince has fallen this day in Israel. Surely, the righteous are taken away from the evil to come, and we are left to struggle on under increasing difficulties\" (\u201cDeparted Saints Yet Living.\u201d The Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit Sermons.

T. Batsford, 1964), p. 14.</ref> G.F.A Best in his biography ''Shaftesbury'' writes that: \"Ashley grew up without any experience of parental love.  He saw little of his parents, and when duty or necessity compelled them to take notice of him they were formal and frightening.\"<ref name=\"Best, p. 15\">Best, p. 15.</ref> Even as an adult, he disliked his father and was known to refer to his mother as \"a devil\".\n\nThis difficult childhood was softened by the affection he received from his housekeeper Maria Millis, and his sisters.  Millis provided for Ashley a model of Christian love that would form the basis for much of his later social activism and philanthropic work, as Best explains: \"What did touch him was the reality, and the homely practicality, of the love which her Christianity made her feel towards the unhappy child.  She told him bible stories, she taught him a prayer.\"<ref>Best, p. 16.</ref>  Despite this powerful reprieve, school became another source of misery for the young Ashley, whose education at Manor House from 1808 to 1813 introduced a \"more disgusting range of horrors\".<ref name=\"Best, p. 15\"/>  Shaftesbury himself shuddered to recall those years, \"The place was bad, wicked, filthy; and the treatment was starvation and cruelty.\"<ref name=\"Best, p. 15\"/>\n\nBy his teenage years, Ashley had become a committed Christian and whilst at Harrow he had two experiences which influenced his later life. \"Once, at the foot of Harrow Hill, he was the horrified witness of a pauper\u2019s funeral. The drunken pall-bearers, stumbling along with a crudely-made coffin and shouting snatches of bawdy songs, brought home to him the existence of a whole empire of callousness which put his own childhood miseries in their context. The second incident was his unusual choice of a subject for a Latin poem. In the school grounds, there was an unsavoury mosquito-breeding pond called the Duck Puddle. He chose it as his subject because he was urgently concerned that the school authorities should do something about it, and this appeared to be the simplest way of bringing it to their attention. Soon afterwards the Duck Puddle was inspected, condemned and filled in. This little triumph was a useful fillip to his self-confidence, but it was more than that. It was a foretaste of his skill in getting people to act decisively in face of sloth or immediate self-interest. This was to prove one of his greatest assets in Parliament.\"<ref name=\"churchsociety\">[https://churchsociety.org/issues_new/history/shaftesbury/iss_history_shaftesbury_Hewitt-GoodSamaritan.asp II.

The Committee examined many witnesses concerning one of his madhouses in [[Bethnal Green]], called the White House. Ashley visited this on the Committee's behalf. The patients were chained up, slept naked on straw, and went to toilet in their beds. They were left chained from Saturday afternoon until Monday morning when they were cleared of the accumulated excrement. They were then washed down in freezing cold water and one towel was allotted to 160 people, with no soap. It was overcrowded and the meat provided was \"that nasty thick hard muscle a dog could not eat\". The White House had been described as \"a mere place for dying\" rather than curing the insane and when the Committee asked Dr MacMichael whether he believed that \"in the lunatic asylums in the neighbourhood of London any curative process is going on with regard to pauper patients\", he replied: \"None at all\".<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n[[File:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury by George Frederic Watts.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Shaftesbury by [[George Frederick Watts]].]]\n\nThe Committee recommended that \"legislative measures of a remedial character should be introduced at the earliest period at the next session\", and the establishment of a Board of Commissioners appointed by the Home Secretary possessing extensive powers of licensing, inspection and control.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 37.</ref> When in February 1828 Robert Gordon, Liberal MP for [[Cricklade (UK Parliament constituency)|Cricklade]], introduced a bill to put these recommendations into law, Ashley seconded this and delivered his maiden speech in support of the Bill. He wrote in his diary: \"So, by God's blessing, my first effort has been for the advance of human happiness. May I improve hourly! Fright almost deprived me of recollection but again thank Heaven, I did not sit down quite a presumptuous idiot\". Ashley was also involved in framing the [[County Lunatic Asylums (England) Act 1828]] and the [[Madhouses Act 1828]]. Through these Acts, fifteen commissioners were appointed for the London area and given extensive powers of licensing and inspection, one of the commissioners being Ashley.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\nIn July 1845, Ashley sponsored two [[Lunacy Act 1845|Lunacy Acts]], \u2018For the Regulation of lunatic Asylums\u2019 and \u2018For the better Care and Treatment of Lunatics in England and Wales\u2019. They originated in the Report of the [[Commissioners in Lunacy]] which he had commended to Parliament the year before. These Acts consolidated and amended previous lunacy laws, providing better record keeping and more strict certification regulations to ensure patients against unwarranted detention. They also ordered, instead of merely permitting, the construction of country lunatic asylums with and establishing an ongoing Lunacy Commission with Ashley as its chairman.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 182.</ref> In support of these measures, Ashley gave a speech in which he claimed that although since 1828 there had been an improvement, more still needed to be done. He cited the case of a Welsh lunatic girl, Mary Jones, who had for more than a decade been locked in a tiny loft with one boarded-up window with little air and no light. The room was extremely filthy and was filled with an intolerable smell. She could only [[Squatting position|squat]] in a bent position in the room and this had caused her to become deformed.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 182\u2013183.</ref>\n[[File:7th Earl of Shaftesbury.png|thumb|The Earl of Shaftesbury by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]], 1869]]\n\nIn early 1858, a Select Committee was appointed over concerns that sane persons were detained in lunatic asylums. Lord Shaftesbury (as Ashley had become upon his father's death in 1851) was the chief witness and opposed the suggestion that the certification of insanity be made more difficult and that early treatment of insanity was essential if there was to be any prospect of a cure. He claimed that only one or two people in his time dealing with lunacy had been detained in an asylum without sufficient grounds and that commissioners should be granted more not fewer powers. The Committee's Report endorsed all of Shaftesbury's recommendations except for one: that a magistrate's signature on a certificate of lunacy be made compulsory. This was not put into law chiefly due to Shaftesbury's opposition to it. [[Clarification needed]] The Report also agreed with Shaftesbury that unwarranted detentions were \"extremely rare\".<ref>Battiscombe, p. 259.</ref>\n\nIn July 1877, Shaftesbury gave evidence before the Select Committee on the Lunacy Laws, which had been appointed in February over concerns that it was too easy for sane persons to be detained in asylums. Shaftesbury feared that because of his advanced age he would be taken over by forgetfulness whilst giving evidence and was greatly stressed in the months leading up to this: \"Shall fifty years of toil, anxiety and prayer, crowned by marvellous and unlooked-for success, bring me in the end only sorrow and disgrace?\" When \"the hour of trial\" arrived Shaftesbury defended the Lunacy Commission and claimed he was now the only person alive who could speak with personal knowledge of the state of care of lunatics before the Lunacy Commission was established in 1828. It had been \"a state of things such as would pass all belief\". In the Committee's Report, the members of the Committee agreed with Shaftesbury's evidence on all points.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 319\u2013320.</ref>\n\nIn 1884, the husband of Mrs Georgina Weldon tried to have her detained in a lunatic asylum because she believed that her pug dog had a soul and that the spirit of her dead mother had entered into her pet rabbit. She commenced legal action against Shaftesbury and other lunacy commissioners although it failed. In May, Shaftesbury spoke in the Lords against a motion declaring the lunacy laws unsatisfactory but the motion passed Parliament. The Lord Chancellor Selborne supported a Lunacy Law Amendment Bill and Shaftesbury wanted to resign from the Lunacy Commission as he believed he was honour bound not to oppose a Bill supported by the Lord Chancellor. However, Selborne implored him not to resign so Shaftesbury refrained. However, when the Bill was introduced and it contained the provision which made it compulsory for a certificate of lunacy to be signed by a magistrate or a judge, he resigned. The government fell, however, and the Bill was withdrawn and Shaftesbury resumed his chairmanship of the Lunacy Commission.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 330\u2013331.</ref>\n\nShaftesbury's work in improving the care of the insane remains one of his most important, though lesser known, achievements. He wrote: \"Beyond the circle of my own Commissioners and the lunatics that I visit, not a soul, in great or small life, not even my associates in my works of philanthropy, has any notion of the years of toil and care that, under God, I have bestowed on this melancholy and awful question\".<ref>Battiscombe, p. 318.</ref>\n\n===Child labour and factory reform===\nIn March 1833, Ashley introduced the [[Factory Acts#Labour of Children, etc., in Factories Act 1833|Ten Hours Act 1833]] into the Commons, which provided that children working in the cotton and woollen industries must be aged nine or above; no person under the age of eighteen was to work more than ten hours a day or eight hours on a Saturday; and no one under twenty-five was to work nights. However the Whig government, by a majority of 145, amended this to substitute \"thirteen\" in place of \"eighteen\" and the Act as it passed ensured that no child under thirteen worked more than nine hours, insisted they should go to school, and appointed inspectors to enforce the law.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 88, p. 91.</ref>\n\nIn June 1836, another Ten Hours act was introduced into the Commons and although Ashley considered this Bill ill-timed, he supported it. In July one member of the Lancashire committees set up to support the Bill wrote that: \"If there was one man in England more devoted to the interests of the factory people than another, it was Lord Ashley. They might always rely on him as a ready, steadfast and willing friend\".<ref name=\"Battiscombe, p. 109\">Battiscombe, p. 109.</ref> In July 1837, he accused the government of ignoring the breaches of the 1833 Act and moved the resolution that the House regretted the regulation of the working hours of children had been found to be unsatisfactory. It was lost by fifteen votes.<ref name=\"Battiscombe, p. 109\"/>\n\nThe text of ''A Narrative of the Experience and Sufferings of William Dodd a Factory Cripple'' was sent to Lord Ashley and with his support was published in 1840.<ref>[http://spartacus-educational.com/IRashley.htm Lord Ashley], Spartacus, retrieved 2 January 2014</ref> Ashley employed [[William Dodd (writer)|William Dodd]] at 45 shillings a week and he wrote \"The Factory System: Illustrated\" to describe the conditions of working children in textile manufacture. This was published in 1842.<ref>[http://www.historymole.com/cgi-bin/main/results.pl?theme=10001537 Anthony Ashley Cooper], HistoryMole, retrieved 2 January 2014</ref> These books were attacked by [[John Bright]] in parliament who said that he had evidence that the books described Dodd's mistreatment but were in fact driven by Dodd's ingratitude as a disgruntled employee. Ashley sacked Dodd who emigrated to America.<ref name=wdodd>[http://spartacus-educational.com/IRdodd.htm William Dodd] in ''Spartacus Educational'', retrieved 2 January 2014</ref>\n\nIn 1842, Ashley wrote twice to the Prime Minister, [[Robert Peel]], to urge the government to support a new Factory Act. Peel wrote in reply that he would not support one and Ashley wrote to the Short Time Committees of Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire who desired a Ten Hours Act:\n<blockquote>Though painfully disappointed, I am not disheartened, nor am I at a loss either what course to take, or what advice to give. I shall persevere unto my last hour, and so must you; we must exhaust every legitimate means that the Constitution afford, in petitions to Parliament, in public meetings, and in friendly conferences with your employers; but you must infringe no law, and offend no proprieties; we must all work together as sensible men, who will one day give an account of their motives and actions; if this course is approved, no consideration shall detach me from your cause; if not, you must elect another advocate.\nI know that, in resolving on this step, I exclude myself altogether from the tenure of office; I rejoice in the sacrifice, happy to devote the remainder of my days, be they many or be they few, as God in His wisdom shall determine, to an effort, however laborious, to ameliorate your moral and social condition.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 143\u2013144.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn March 1844, Ashley moved an amendment to a Factory Bill limiting the working hours of adolescents to ten hours after Sir [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|James Graham]] had introduced a Bill aiming to limit their working hours to twelve hours. Ashley's amendment was passed by eight votes, the first time the Commons had approved of the Ten Hour principle. However, in a later vote his amendment was defeated by seven votes and the Bill was withdrawn.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 171.</ref> Later that month, Graham introduced another Bill which again would limit the employment of adolescents to twelve hours. Ashley supported this Bill except that he wanted ten hours not twelve as the limit. In May he moved an amendment to limit the hours worked to ten hours but this was lost by 138 votes.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 175.</ref>\n\nIn 1846, whilst he was out of Parliament, Ashley strongly supported [[John Fielden]]'s Ten Hours Bill, which was lost by ten votes.<ref>Battiscombe, p. 199.</ref> In January 1847, Fielden reintroduced his Bill and it finally passed through Parliament to become the [[Factory Act 1847|Ten Hours Act]].<ref>Battiscombe, p. 202.</ref>\n\n===Miners===\n\nAshley introduced the [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842]] in Parliament to outlaw the employment of women and children underground in [[coal mining|coal mines]]. He made a speech in support of the Act and the [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Consort]] wrote to him afterwards, sending him the \"best wishes for your ''total'' success\". At the end of his speech, his opponent on the Ten Hours issue, Cobden, walked over to Ashley and said: \"You know how opposed I have been to your views, but I don't think I have ever been put into such a frame of mind in the whole course of my life as I have been by your speech\".<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 148\u2013149.</ref>\n\n===Climbing boys===\n\nAshley was a strong supporter of prohibiting the employment of boys as [[chimney sweeps]]. Many climbing boys were illegitimate who had been sold by their parents. They suffered from scorched and lacerated skin, their eyes and throats filled with soot, with the danger of suffocation and their occupational disease\u2014[[Chimney sweeps' carcinoma|cancer of the scrotum]].<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref> In 1840, a [[Chimney Sweepers and Chimneys Regulation Act 1840|Bill]] was introduced into the Commons outlawing the employment of boys as chimney sweeps, and strongly supported by Ashley. Despite being enforced in London, elsewhere the Act did not stop the employment of child chimney sweeps and this led to the foundation of the Climbing-Boys' Society with Ashley as its chairman. In 1851, 1853 and 1855, Shaftesbury introduced Bills into Parliament to deal with the ongoing use of boy chimney sweeps but these were all defeated. He succeeded in passing the [[Chimney Sweepers Regulation Act 1864]] but, like its predecessors, it remained ineffectual. Shaftesbury finally persuaded Parliament to pass the [[Chimney Sweepers Act 1875]] which ensured the annual licensing of chimney sweeps and the enforcement of the law by the police. This finally eradicated the employment of boys as chimney sweeps.<ref>Battiscombe, pp. 126\u2013127.</ref>\n\nAfter Shaftesbury discovered that a boy chimney sweep was living behind his house in Brock Street, London, he rescued the child and sent him to \"the Union School at Norwood Hill, where, under God's blessing and special merciful grace, he will be trained in the knowledge and love and faith of our common Saviour\".<ref>Battiscombe, p. 127.</ref>\n\n===Education reform===\n\nIn 1844, Ashley became president of the [[ragged school|Ragged School Union]] that promoted ragged schools. These schools were for poor children and sprang up from volunteers. Ashley wrote that \"If the Ragged School system were to fail I should not die in the course of nature, I should die of a broken heart\".<ref>Battiscombe, p. 196.</ref>\n\n===Religion and Jewish restorationism===\n\nShaftesbury was a pre-millennial evangelical Anglican who believed in the imminent second coming of Christ. His belief underscored the urgency of immediate action.  He strongly opposed the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and any hint of Romanism or ritualism among  High Church Anglicans. He strongly opposed the [[Oxford Movement]] in the Church of England, fearful of Catholic features. He denounced the [[Maynooth College Act 1845]], which funded the Catholic seminary in Ireland that would train many priests.<ref>John Wolffe, \"Cooper, Anthony Ashley-, seventh Earl of Shaftesbury (1801\u20131885)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'',  2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6210, accessed 6 Nov 2017]</ref>\n\n[[File:Memorandum to Protestant Monarchs of Europe for the restoration of the Jews to Palestine, Colonial Times 1841.jpg|thumb|Lord Shaftesbury's \"Memorandum to Protestant Monarchs of Europe for the restoration of the Jews to Palestine\", published in the ''[[Colonial Times]]'', in 1841]]\nShaftesbury was a leading figure within 19th-century [[evangelical Anglicanism]].<ref name=Chapman>{{cite book | last = Chapman | first = Mark | author-link = | title = Anglicanism: A Very Short Introduction | publisher = Oxford University Press | series = Very Short Introductions | date = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7koSDAAAQBAJ | isbn = 9780192806932 | page = 61}}</ref> Shaftesbury was President of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (BFBS) from 1851 until his death in 1885.

The conquest of [[Greater Syria]] in 1831 by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] changed the conditions under which European power politics operated in the Near East. As a consequence of that shift, Shaftesbury was able to help persuade Foreign Minister [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] to send a British consul, [[James Finn]], to Jerusalem in 1838. Shaftesbury became president of the [[London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews]],<ref>{{Cite book|author=Wigram, Joseph Cotton bp. of Rochester|year=1866|title=Report on the conference upon the Rosenthal case, held with the representatives of the committee of the London society for promoting Christianity among the Jews, by the bishop of Rochester and others.|location=London |publisher= Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer|page=2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=zzUYUmy91t0C&dq=intitle%3AReport%20on%20the%20conference%20upon%20the%20Rosenthal%20case%20held%20with%20the%20representatives%20of%20the%20committee%20of%20the%20London%20society%20for%20promoting%20Christianity%20among%20the%20Jews%20by%20the%20bishop%20of%20Rochester%20and%20others&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false]|isbn=}}</ref> of which Finn was a prominent member. A committed Christian and a loyal Englishman, Shaftesbury argued for a Jewish return because of what he saw as the political and economic advantages to England and because he believed that it was God's will. In January 1839, Shaftesbury published an article in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'', which although initially commenting on the 1838 ''Letters on Egypt, Edom and the Holy Land (1838)'' by [[Alexander Lindsay, 25th Earl of Crawford|Lord Lindsay]], provided the first proposal by a major politician to resettle Jews in Palestine:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3YEfAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA108&output=text#c_top The London Quarterly Review, Volume 63, Number 125, pp166\u2013192.]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=6hw7TdiuGsqv8gP08ODZCA&ct=result&id=8rgpAQAAIAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22Nahum+Sokolow%22&q=masterly#search_anchor Nahum Sokolow \"History of Zionism, 1600\u20131918\" ]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe soil and climate of Palestine are singularly adapted to the growth of produce required for the exigencies of Great Britain; the finest cotton may be obtained in almost unlimited abundance; silk and madder are the staple of the country, and olive oil is now, as it ever was, the very fatness of the land. Capital and skill are alone required: the presence of a British officer, and the increased security of property which his presence will confer, may invite them from these islands to the cultivation of Palestine; and the Jews, who will betake themselves to agriculture in no other land, having found, in the English consul, a mediator between their people and the Pacha, will probably return in yet greater numbers, and become once more the husbandmen of Judaea and Galilee.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_b3oBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=Anthony+Ashley-Cooper,+7th+Earl+of+Shaftesbury+%2B+Jews&source=bl&ots=83M4i7Na0-&sig=pBa3mBhQ1yshTrTEUmPAk0lh5i0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwixuNbyy4LNAhXGQD4KHffiBQsQ6AEIWDAN#v=onepage&q=Anthony%20Ashley-Cooper%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Shaftesbury%20%20%20Jews&f=false Masalha, Nur.

In July 1853, Shaftesbury wrote to the Prime Minister, [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], that Greater Syria was \"a country without a nation\u201d in need of \u201ca nation without a country... Is there such a thing? To be sure there is, the ancient and rightful lords of the soil, the Jews!\" In his diary that year he wrote \"these vast and fertile regions will soon be without a ruler, without a known and acknowledged power to claim dominion.

In the taking home to himself by our gracious Lord of the Earl of Shaftesbury, we have, in my judgment, lost the best man of the age. I do not know whom I should place second, but I certainly should put him first\u2014far beyond all other servants of God within my knowledge\u2014for usefulness and influence. He was a man most true in his personal piety, as I know from having enjoyed his private friendship; a man most firm in his faith in the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; a man intensely active in the cause of God and truth. Take him whichever way you please, he was admirable: he was faithful to God in all his house, fulfilling both the first and second commands of the law in fervent love to God, and hearty love to man. He occupied his high position with singleness of purpose and immovable steadfastness: where shall we find his equal? If it is not possible that he was absolutely perfect, it is equally impossible for me to mention a single fault; for I saw none. He exhibited scriptural perfection, inasmuch as he was sincere, true, and consecrated. Those things which have been regarded as faults by the loose thinkers of this age are prime virtues in my esteem. They called him narrow; and in this they bear unconscious testimony to his loyalty to truth. I rejoiced greatly in his integrity, his fearlessness, his adherence to principle, in a day when revelation is questioned, the gospel explained away, and human thought set up as the idol of the hour. He felt that there was a vital and eternal difference between truth and error; consequently, he did not act or talk as if there was much to be said on either side, and, therefore, no one could be quite sure. We shall not know for many a year how much we miss in missing him; how great an anchor he was to this drifting generation, and how great a stimulus he was to every movement for the benefit of the poor. Both man and beast may unite in mourning him: he was the friend of every living thing. He lived for the oppressed; he lived for London; he lived for the nation; he lived still more for God. He has finished his course; and though we do not lay him to sleep in the grave with the sorrow of those that have no hope, yet we cannot but mourn that a great man and a prince has fallen this day in Israel. Surely, the righteous are taken away from the evil to come, and we are left to struggle on under increasing difficulties\" (\u201cDeparted Saints Yet Living.\u201d The Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit Sermons.

{"title_page": "Triangular trade", "text_new": "{{short description|Trade among three ports or regions}}\n[[Image:Triangle trade2.png|right|thumb|350px|Depiction of the classical model of the triangular trade]]\n[[Image:Triangular trade.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Depiction of the triangular trade of slaves, sugar, and rum with New England instead of Europe as the third corner]]\n\n'''Triangular trade''' or '''triangle trade''' is a historical term indicating trade among three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has [[export]] commodities that are not required in the region from which its major [[import]]s come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying [[trade imbalance]]s between the above regions.\n\nHistorically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of [[winds in the Age of Sail|winds and currents]] during the [[age of sail]].  For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going ''south'' of [[30th parallel north|30 N latitude]] and reaching the so-called \"[[trade winds]]\"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the [[Northern America|North American mainland]]. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the [[Gulf Stream]] in a northeasterly direction using the [[westerlies]]. A similar triangle to this, called the ''[[volta do mar]]'' was already being used by the Portuguese, before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage, to sail to the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. Columbutt simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.\n\n==Atlantic triangular slave trade==\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Atlantic slave trade|Slave Coast of West Africa}}\n\nThe best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic [[slave trade]] that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between [[West Africa]],  [[Caribbean]] or [[Americas|America]]n colonies and the [[Europe]]an colonial powers, with the northern colonies of [[British North America]], especially [[New England]], sometimes taking over the role of Europe.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm About.com: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]. Accessed 6 November 2007.</ref> The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial [[cash crop]]s, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to purchase African slaves, who were then brought on the [[sea lane]] west from Africa to the Americas, the so-called [[Middle Passage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Triangular Trade|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|website=[[National Maritime Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125125048/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|archivedate=25 November 2011}}</ref> Despite being driven primarily by economic needs, Europeans sometimes had a religious justification for their actions. In 1452, for instance, [[Pope Nicholas V]], in the ''[[Dum Diversas]]'', granted to the kings of Spain and Portugal \"full and free permission to invade, search out, capture, and subjugate the [[Saracens]] [Muslims] and pagans and any other unbelievers ... and to reduce their persons into perpetual slavery.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Change in Official Catholic Moral Teaching|last=Curran|first=Charles E.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2003|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=67}}</ref>\n[[Image:Slaveshipposter.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram illustrating the stowage of African slaves on a British [[slave ship]].]] \n\nA classic example is the [[colonial molasses trade]]. Merchants purchased raw [[sugar]] (often in its liquid form, [[molasses]]) from plantations in the Caribbean and shipped it to New England and Europe, where it was sold to distillery companies that produced rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase rum, furs, and lumber in New England which merchants shipped to Europe.  With the profits from the European sales, merchants purchased Europe's manufactured goods, including tools and weapons.  Then the merchants shipped those manufactured goods, along with the American sugar and rum, to West Africa where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of slaves in Brazil, the Caribbean islands, and the American South were then used to buy more sugar, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.\n[[File:Luxborough galley burnt nearly to the water, 25 June 1727.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The loss of the slaver ''[[Luxborough Galley]]'' in 1727  (\"I.C. 1760\"), lost in the last leg of the triangular trade, between the Caribbean and Britain.]]\n[[File:North Atlantic Gyre.png|thumb|[[North Atlantic Gyre]]]]\nThe first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as [[copper]], [[cloth]], trinkets, [[slave beads]], [[guns]] and [[ammunition]].<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ Scotland and the Abolition of the Slave Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172434/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ |date=2012-01-03 }}.  Accessed 28 March 2007.</ref>  When the ship arrived, its cargo would be sold or bartered for slaves. On the second leg, ships made the journey of the [[Middle Passage]] from Africa to the [[New World]]. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the [[slave ship]]s. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port,<ref>A. P. Middleton, ''Tobacco Coast''.</ref> from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from [[Virginia]], [[tobacco]] and [[hemp]].

Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has [[export]] commodities that are not required in the region from which its major [[import]]s come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying [[trade imbalance]]s between the above regions.\n\nHistorically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of [[winds in the Age of Sail|winds and currents]] during the [[age of sail]].  For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going ''south'' of [[30th parallel north|30 N latitude]] and reaching the so-called \"[[trade winds]]\"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the [[Northern America|North American mainland]]. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the [[Gulf Stream]] in a northeasterly direction using the [[westerlies]]. A similar triangle to this, called the ''[[volta do mar]]'' was already being used by the Portuguese, before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage, to sail to the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. Columbus simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.\n\n==Atlantic triangular slave trade==\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Atlantic slave trade|Slave Coast of West Africa}}\n\nThe best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic [[slave trade]] that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between [[West Africa]],  [[Caribbean]] or [[Americas|America]]n colonies and the [[Europe]]an colonial powers, with the northern colonies of [[British North America]], especially [[New England]], sometimes taking over the role of Europe.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm About.com: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]. Accessed 6 November 2007.</ref> The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial [[cash crop]]s, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to purchase African slaves, who were then brought on the [[sea lane]] west from Africa to the Americas, the so-called [[Middle Passage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Triangular Trade|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|website=[[National Maritime Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125125048/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|archivedate=25 November 2011}}</ref> Despite being driven primarily by economic needs, Europeans sometimes had a religious justification for their actions. In 1452, for instance, [[Pope Nicholas V]], in the ''[[Dum Diversas]]'', granted to the kings of Spain and Portugal \"full and free permission to invade, search out, capture, and subjugate the [[Saracens]] [Muslims] and pagans and any other unbelievers ... and to reduce their persons into perpetual slavery.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Change in Official Catholic Moral Teaching|last=Curran|first=Charles E.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2003|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=67}}</ref>\n[[Image:Slaveshipposter.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram illustrating the stowage of African slaves on a British [[slave ship]].]] \n\nA classic example is the [[colonial molasses trade]]. Merchants purchased raw [[sugar]] (often in its liquid form, [[molasses]]) from plantations in the Caribbean and shipped it to New England and Europe, where it was sold to distillery companies that produced rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase rum, furs, and lumber in New England which merchants shipped to Europe.  With the profits from the European sales, merchants purchased Europe's manufactured goods, including tools and weapons.  Then the merchants shipped those manufactured goods, along with the American sugar and rum, to West Africa where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of slaves in Brazil, the Caribbean islands, and the American South were then used to buy more sugar, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.\n[[File:Luxborough galley burnt nearly to the water, 25 June 1727.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The loss of the slaver ''[[Luxborough Galley]]'' in 1727  (\"I.C. 1760\"), lost in the last leg of the triangular trade, between the Caribbean and Britain.]]\n[[File:North Atlantic Gyre.png|thumb|[[North Atlantic Gyre]]]]\nThe first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as [[copper]], [[cloth]], trinkets, [[slave beads]], [[guns]] and [[ammunition]].<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ Scotland and the Abolition of the Slave Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172434/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ |date=2012-01-03 }}.  Accessed 28 March 2007.</ref>  When the ship arrived, its cargo would be sold or bartered for slaves. On the second leg, ships made the journey of the [[Middle Passage]] from Africa to the [[New World]]. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the [[slave ship]]s. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port,<ref>A. P. Middleton, ''Tobacco Coast''.</ref> from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from [[Virginia]], [[tobacco]] and [[hemp]].
