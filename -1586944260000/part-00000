These unique drawings represent a diaristic aspect and frequently depict events from the past for example, ''Poor Love'' (1999), ''From The Week of Hell '94'' (1995) and ''Ripped Up'' (1995), which relate to a traumatic experience after an abortion or other personal events as seen in ''Fuck You Eddy'' (1995) and ''Sad Shower in New York'' (1995) which are both part of the Tate's collection of Emin's art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/tracey-emin-2590|title=Tracey Emin |work=Tate Etc.}}</ref>\n\nOften they incorporate text as well as image, although some bear only text and others only image. The text appears as the artist's stream of consciousness voice. Some critics have compared Emin's text-only monoprints to ransom notes. The rapid, one-off technique involved in making monoprints is perfectly suited to (apparently) immediate expression, as is Emin's scratchy and informal drawing style. Emin frequently misspells words, deliberately or due to the speed at which she did each drawing. In a 2002 interview with [[Lynn Barber]], Emin said, \"It's not cute affectation. If I could spell, then I would spell correctly, but I never bothered to learn. So, rather than be inhibited and say I can't write because I can't spell, I just write and get on with it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkettart.com/qwr/set_library.php3?directory=63|title=PARKETT Books|publisher=parkettart.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmin created a key series of monoprints in 1997 with the text ''Something's Wrong''<ref>Terrebly Wrong (1997)</ref> or ''There Must Be Something Terebley Wrong With Me''<ref>''Something'' (1997)</ref> {{sic}} written with spelling mistakes intact in large capital letters alongside \"forlorn figures surrounded by space, their outlines fragile on the page.

These unique drawings represent a diaristic aspect and frequently depict events from the past for example, ''Poor Love'' (1999), ''From The Week of Hell '94'' (1995) and ''Ripped Up'' (1995), which relate to a traumatic experience after an abortion or other personal events as seen in ''Fuck You Eddy'' (1995) and ''Sad Shower in New York'' (1995) which are both part of the Tate's collection of Emin's art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/tracey-emin-2590|title=Tracey Emin |work=Tate Etc.}}</ref>\n\nOften they incorporate text as well as image, although some bear only text and others only image. The text appears as the artist's stream of consciousness voice. Some critics have compared Emin's text-only monoprints to ransom notes. The rapid, one-off technique involved in making monoprints is perfectly suited to (apparently) immediate expression, as is Emin's scratchy and informal drawing style. Emin frequently misspells words, deliberately or due to the speed at which she did each drawing. In a 2002 interview with [[Lynn Barber]], Emin said, \"It's not cute affectation. If I could spell, then I would spell correctly, but I never bothered to learn. So, rather than be inhibited and say I can't write because I can't spell, I just write and get on with it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkettart.com/qwr/set_library.php3?directory=63|title=PARKETT Books|publisher=parkettart.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmin created a key series of monoprints in 1997 with the text ''Something's Wrong''<ref>Terrebly Wrong (1997)</ref> or ''There Must Be Something Terebley Wrong With Me''<ref>''Something'' (1997)</ref> {{sic}} written with spelling mistakes intact in large capital letters alongside \"forlorn figures surrounded by space, their outlines fragile on the page.

In The Livingroom'' (1994). Emin further produced a set of monoprints detailing her memories of [[Margate]]'s iconic buildings such as ''Margate Harbour 16/5/95'' (1995), ''The Lido 16/5/95'' (1995) and ''Light House 15/5/95'' (1995).

After she is arrested for illegally charging attendees at an underground [[rave]], she calls upon her godmother, Judy Lindendorf, to bail her out. In order for Mary to repay the loan, Judy employs her as a clerk at the library where she works. Mary reluctantly begins her new job while striking up a romance with [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] street vendor and aspiring teacher, Mustafa. Though she initially has misgivings about her new line of work, she begins to learn how to deal with the [[Dewey Decimal System]] and her godmother's perception of her. Gradually, she becomes very good at her job but she gets fired after having sex with Mustafa in the library. With no money to pay the accumulating rent, she and her roommate Leo, a club DJ, face eviction from her apartment. Mary sells her clothes at a vintage shop in order to get money for the rent.\n\nShe also goes to make up with Mustafa, who she early had blown off for a date to work at the library. During one of her parties, though, Mary has a fight with Mustafa and takes drugs to forget. Her friend Nigel tries to take advantage of her, but she fights him off. The next day, she decides to get her life in order and become a librarian. Her fellow librarians help her sort out some of the areas in library sciences she could study. She invites Judy over to talk, but when they arrive Mary discovers to her horror that her friends have thrown her a surprise birthday party, complete with a male stripper. Mary tells a skeptical Judy that she has finally found her calling in life, and Mustafa and Leo tell Judy that Mary used her [[library science]] skills to help them with their careers. Impressed, Judy gives Mary her job back, and joins her god-daughter in dancing with her friends.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Parker Posey]] as Mary\n*[[Guillermo D\u00edaz (actor)|Guillermo D\u00edaz]] as Leo\n*[[Liev Schreiber]] as Nigel\n*[[Anthony DeSando]] as Derrick\n*Sasha von Scherler as Judy Lindendorf\n* Omar Townsend as Mustafa\n*[[Simon Verhoeven]] as Kurt\n\n==Music in the film==\nMuch of the film takes place in clubs and at parties, and a supporting character is a DJ.

Impressed, Judy gives Mary her job back, and joins her god-daughter in dancing with her friends.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Parker Posey]] as Mary\n*[[Guillermo D\u00edaz (actor)|Guillermo D\u00edaz]] as Leo\n*[[Liev Schreiber]] as Nigel\n*[[Anthony DeSando]] as Derrick\n*Sasha von Scherler as Judy Lindendorf\n* Omar Townsend as Mustafa\n\n==Music in the film==\nMuch of the film takes place in clubs and at parties, and a supporting character is a DJ.

Appearing live in the POPCO offices, Posey welcomed Internet viewers and then introduced the film. Fleishman recalled the event:\n:I helped launch the first official full-length [Internet] movie premiere in 1995 in my offices in Seattle. The film was broadcast to several hundred people worldwide over a [[CU-SeeMe]] reflector at Point of Presence Company's offices in downtown and then a few minutes, it was projected at The Egyptian in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Parker Posey was in our offices to hit the start button on the broadcast. I was one cog in a larger set of wheels that involved the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], Film.com (now part of [[RealNetworks]]), First Look Releasing, and the film's producers, as well as another online development company and a [[CUSeeMe]] engineering consultant, Joseph Kahan who also worked at NASA down in Texas. The launch was shown on ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' in a five-minute segment at the bottom of the Sunday broadcast that week.<ref>[https://glog.glennf.com/blog/2003/09/06/first_film_premiered_on_internet First Film Premiered on Internet?], Glenn Fleishman, September 6, 2003.</ref>\n\n==Television spin-off==\n{{Main|Party Girl (TV series)}}\nA television series based on the film was produced in 1996, starring [[Christine Taylor]] as Mary and [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as Judy.

Roca.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Julio Argentino Roca|Julio A. Roca]], then [[President of Argentina]], donated the trophy]]\nThe competition was created by former [[President of Argentina]], General [[Julio Argentino Roca]], in 1913. A football enthusiast, Roca was at the time the Argentine ambassador in [[Brazil]] and felt matches between both countries would create a healthy rivalry and help the sport to develop. The Cup would be played each year in a different country, a fact that was actually kept in spite of the many changes to the Cup's format.\n\nRoca donated a trophy to dissident body [[Federaci\u00f3n Argentina de Football]] (\"Argentine Football Federation\" \u2013 FAF) and it was agreed that the competition would be played for three consecutive years in a single-leg format and the country with two wins would conquer the trophy forever. But in 1915 the FAF merged with [[Argentine Football Association]], and the following matches were not played. In 1922, the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]] agreed to play the competition again, which Brazil won for the second time, and thus claimed the Roca Cup ownership, even though Argentina beat them the following year.\n\nIn 1938, both football associations, AFA and CBF, accepted to play the competition once again. The format was changed and the trophy would be kept by the most recent winner. In case the first two matches finished in draws or each team had a win, then a third leg had to be played. In January 1939, Argentina got a 5\u20131 victory in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The following game was packed with incidents and the visiting team left the pitch enraged after the referee awarded a penalty to Brazil. However the home side went on to score a third goal when the Argentine team had already left the field in protest. A third and fourth match were played in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], giving the victory to Argentina. The 1940 edition was played in Argentina, where Argentina won two matches (6\u20131 and 5\u20131) and Brazil won one (2\u20133).\n\nIn 1957's match, at [[Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3|Maracan\u00e3]], [[Pel\u00e9]] made his debut in Brazilian National Team, drafted by coach [[Sylvio Pirillo]], where he scored the first of many goals with the Brazilian jersey. From 1940 on, Brazil won every edition, except for the 1971 Cup, when with two draws, the Cup was also declared tied.<ref>[https://medium.com/@viejocasale/la-roca-sin-campeon-28c283e5dc8 La Roca sin campe\u00f3n], ''El Gr\u00e1fico'' n\u00b0 2704, Editorial Atl\u00e1ntida, 1971</ref>\n\n==List of champions==\n===Finals===\nThe following list includes all the editions of the Copa Julio A.

He also played in the [[Shamrock Rovers XI v Brazil]] exhibition match in July 1973, which he also helped to organise.\n\nA strong and physical [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he began his career at [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]] in his native [[Belfast]]. He helped Distillery to win the [[Irish Cup]] in 1956, before he won a \u00a34,000 move to English [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in August 1957. He was sold on to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in March 1959 for a fee of \u00a315,000, and played for the club in the [[1960 FA Cup Final]] despite handing in a transfer request the day before the final. He moved on to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for \u00a315,000 in July 1961, but struggled with injuries during a two-season stay at [[Villa Park]]. He dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] to join [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in 1963, who paid a \u00a321,000 transfer fee. He returned to the top flight in November 1965 after being sold to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for \u00a326,000. He was sold to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] for a \u00a350,000 fee in March 1967, and helped the club to win promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1966\u201367, to lift the [[Texaco Cup]] in 1970 and the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1974 Football League Cup Final|1974]], and also played on the losing side of the [[1972 UEFA Cup Final|1972]] [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] final. He also spent two summers in the United States playing for the club's sister teams, the [[Los Angeles Wolves]] and the [[Kansas City Spurs]], who he helped to win the [[United Soccer Association]] and [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|NASL International Cup]] respectively. He retired in 1975, having scored a total of 279 goals in 661 league and cup appearances across 18 seasons in [[the Football League]].\n\nHe was appointed player-manager at [[Southern Football League|Southern League Premier Division]] side [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] in 1975, a position he retained for two years. Whilst at the club he negotiated the first shirt sponsorship deal in English football. He chaired the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) from 1970 to 1978, and helped to further players' rights and set up the first PFA player awards in 1974. Also throughout the 1970s he became a football pundit and writer, and became particularly well known for his part in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s coverage of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]. After fronting a consortium that took Wolverhampton Wanderers out of liquidation, he served the club as chairman from August 1982 to January 1985. He stood as an independent politician in the [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] constituency in 1997, and later became involved in the [[UK Independence Party]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Distillery===\nAlexander Derek Dougan was born in [[Belfast]] on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan.<ref name=\"page 24\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=24}}</ref> His father worked at [[Belfast Harbour|Belfast docks]].<ref name=\"page 24\"/> His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], and two of Sandy's brothers also played for some of the leading clubs in Belfast.<ref name=\"page 24\"/> As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street.<ref>{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=26}}</ref> His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that \"on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come and see where you got the money from\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=28}}</ref> As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys.<ref name=\"page 29\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=29}}</ref> He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams.<ref name=\"page 29\"/> He instead joined [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]] in 1953.<ref name=\"page 33\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=33}}</ref> Manager [[Jimmy McIntosh]] handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0\u20130 [[Irish Cup]] first round draw with [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]].<ref name=\"page 34\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=34}}</ref> [[Maurice Tadman]], who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.<ref name=\"page 35\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=35}}</ref>\n\nWhilst playing part-time for Distillery he also worked at the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipbuilding company.<ref name=\"page 36\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=36}}</ref> Though the [[maximum wage]] in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined to leave for the [[English Football League]] at the earliest opportunity, particularly so following the death of his mother in June 1955.<ref name=\"page 37\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=37}}</ref> He began to attract scouts from England after helping Distillery beat [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] 1\u20130 in the second replay of the [[1955\u201356 Irish Cup|1956 final]] of the Irish Cup at [[Windsor Park]].<ref name=\"page 38\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=38}}</ref> He played mostly at half-back in the [[1956\u201357 Irish League|1956\u201357]] season as Distillery finished sixth in the [[Northern Ireland Football League|Irish League]] and ended up as runners-up in the [[Ulster Cup]], [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)|City Cup]], and [[County Antrim Shield]].<ref name=\"page 41\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=41}}</ref>\n\n===Portsmouth===\nDougan had trials at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], before he was signed by [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] for a fee of \u00a34,000 in August 1957.<ref name = \"death\"/> \"Pompey\" struggled to a 20th-place finish in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in the [[1957\u201358 Portsmouth F.C. season|1957\u201358]] season, and some of his teammates resented Dougan for what he himself felt was the constructive criticism he offered in the dressing room.<ref name=\"page 50\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=50}}</ref> He made his first team debut, providing an assist for [[Jackie Henderson]] in a 3\u20130 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]].<ref name=\"page 52\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=52}}</ref> He scored his first senior goal for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], though was criticised by ''[[Daily Mail]]'' journalist Jack Wood for celebrating the goal with an \"arms akimbo display of histrionics\".<ref name=\"page 53\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=53}}</ref> New manager [[Freddie Cox]], who succeeded [[Eddie Lever]] at [[Fratton Park]] in 1958, took the club to relegation with a last place finish in [[1958\u201359 Portsmouth F.C. season|1958\u201359]] season, though Dougan would miss much of the season with an ankle injury.<ref name=\"page 60\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=60}}</ref>\n\n===Blackburn Rovers===\nDougan was sold on to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a fee of \u00a315,000 in March 1959.<ref name = \"death\"/> He scored on his Rovers debut in a 1\u20131 draw away to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]].<ref name=\"page 64\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=64}}</ref> He scored twice on the opening day of the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] season, a 4\u20130 victory over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], which began a sequence of five wins and a draw from Rovers's first six matches, at the end of which the club were in second-place and Dougan tallied eleven goals, four of which came in a 6\u20132 victory over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref name=\"page 66\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=66}}</ref> Though their league campaign petered out to an eventual 17th-place finish, Rovers reached the [[1960 FA Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] after Dougan scored the winning goal past [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the semi-finals.<ref name=\"page 69\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=69}}</ref> However, he did not enjoy his time at [[Ewood Park]], and later wrote that \"the dourness of the club matched that of the town. I could not shake off the depression that caused me to wake each day regretting that I had to go to the ground. Life was grey and monotonous\".<ref name=\"page 67\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=67}}</ref> This led to him handing in a transfer request the day before the final, which he later admitted was an occasion where his \"vanity triumphed over common sense\".<ref name=\"page 70\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=70}}</ref> He was not at full fitness in the final itself, and had a quiet game as Blackburn lost 3\u20130 to Wolverhampton Wanderers.<ref name=\"page 73\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=73}}</ref> He opened the [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361]] season with a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over Manchester United and went on to withdraw his transfer request.<ref name=\"page 75\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=75}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Villa===\nDougan was signed by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in July 1961 for a fee of \u00a315,000.<ref name = \"death\"/> He was signed by manager [[Joe Mercer]] as a replacement for [[Gerry Hitchens]], who had been sold on to [[Inter Milan]] earlier in the summer for \u00a385,000.<ref name=\"page 92\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=92}}</ref> Teammate [[Peter McParland]] later commented that \"when Derek came to us at Aston Villa I think it was at a time when he was not taking the game particularly seriously\".<ref name=\"page 93\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=93}}</ref> After returning from watching his \"Villans\" teammates win the [[1961 Football League Cup Final|1961 League Cup Final]] at [[Villa Park]] on 5 September, Dougan was a passenger in a car accident which killed fellow passenger Malcolm Williams and left Dougan with a broken arm and head injuries; driver and teammate [[Bobby Thomson (footballer, born 1937)|Bobby Thomson]] was charged but found 'Not Guilty' of careless driving.<ref name=\"page 94\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=94}}</ref> In November 2010 \u2013 three years after Dougan's death, Thomson claimed that Dougan had drunkenly pulled a [[deerstalker]] hat over his eyes, causing him to crash the car.<ref>{{cite

after three months on the sidelines and ended the [[1961\u201362 Aston Villa F.C. season|1961\u201362]] season with 12 goals in 27 matches.<ref name=\"page 96\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=96}}</ref> He twisted his knee midway through the [[1962\u201363 Aston Villa F.C. season|1962\u201363]] campaign after slipping in the street, and ended the season with 14 goals from 33 games.<ref name=\"page 96\"/>\n\n===Peterborough United===\nDougan dropped down to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] to join [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] for a \u00a321,000 fee in the summer of 1963.<ref name=\"page 100\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=100}}</ref> He later admitted that \"I had made a mistake in going to the Third Division when I was a First Division player\".<ref name=\"page 103\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=103}}</ref> The move did though have its benefits, as the club's physiotherapist managed to diagnose and eventually correct an ankle injury that had troubled Dougan for the previous five years.<ref name=\"page 103\"/> He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in the [[1963\u201364 Peterborough United F.C. season|1963\u201364]] season, and at the end of the campaign manager [[Jack Fairbrother]] was replaced by [[Gordon Clark (footballer)|Gordon Clark]], who Dougan said \"renewed my sense of vocation\".<ref name=\"page 105\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=105}}</ref> He then scored seven goals in the club's [[1964\u201365 Peterborough United F.C. season|1964\u201365]] run to the sixth round of the FA Cup, including one in their 2\u20131 win over top-flight Arsenal at [[London Road Stadium|London Road]].<ref name=\"page 108\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=108}}</ref> Peterborough's league promotion campaign failed despite their cup exploits, causing Dougan to remark that \"after playing at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] it was not easy to go to places like [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on a cold Tuesday evening, where they are waiting for you with their sleeves rolled up\".<ref name=\"page 111\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=111}}</ref>\n\n===Leicester City===\nDougan returned to the First Division when he signed for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in May 1965 for a \u00a326,000 fee.<ref name=\"page 111\"/> However, he had a difficult relationship with manager [[Matt Gillies]] despite being the first choice striker at [[Filbert Street]].<ref name=\"page 116\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=116}}</ref> He scored 19 goals in 37 league games in the [[1965\u201366 Leicester City F.C. season|1965\u201366]] season to help the team to a seventh-place finish.<ref name=\"page 119\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=119}}</ref> He scored 21 goals in 35 league and cup games in the [[1966\u201367 Leicester City F.C. season|1966\u201367]] season, but his 'free spirit' nature frustrated Gillies, who sanctioned Dougan's sale despite his good form.<ref name=\"page 120\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=120}}</ref>\n\n===Wolverhampton Wanderers===\nIn March 1967, Dougan dropped into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] after being signed by Wolverhampton Wanderers manager [[Ronnie Allen]] for a \u00a350,000 fee.<ref name = \"death\"/> He marked his home debut on 25 March by scoring a hat-trick against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].<ref

to secure promotion to the First Division.<ref name=\"page 124\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=124}}</ref> He spent the summer of 1967 in the United States playing for the [[Los Angeles Wolves]] in the [[United Soccer Association]], scoring three goals in eleven games to help Wolves to win the West Division title and then captained the side and scored a goal as they beat the [[Washington Whips]] 6\u20135 in the [[USA Final 1967|USA Final]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].<ref name=\"page 126\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=126}}</ref>\n\nStrike partner [[Ernie Hunt]] was sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for \u00a380,000 in September 1967, which reduced the effectiveness of the Wolves attack, though Dougan still managed to finish as the club's top-scorer with 17 goals in 40 appearances across the [[1967\u201368 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|1967\u201368]] campaign as Wolves retained their top-flight status with a 17th-place finish.<ref name=\"page 126\"/> In November 1968,

June 2007) was a [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] international [[Association football|footballer]], football manager, football chairman, pundit, and writer. He was also known by his nickname, \"'''The Doog'''\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Ged|title=Football: Colourful life and times of Wolves hero Dougan; DEREK DOUGAN APPRECIATION. \u2013 Free Online Library|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3A+Colourful+life+and+times+of+Wolves+hero+Dougan%3B+DEREK...-a0165544836|accessdate=27 July 2016|work=The Birmingham Post|date=25 June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=OBITUARY: Derek Dougan. \u2013 Free Online Library|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/OBITUARY%3A+Derek+Dougan.-a0165658107|accessdate=27 July 2016|work=Daily Post|date=26 June 2007}}</ref> He was capped by Northern Ireland at [[Northern Ireland national under-16 football team|schoolboy]], [[Northern Ireland national under-17 football team|youth]], Amateur, and [[Northern Ireland B national football team|'B' team]] level, before he won 43 caps in a 15-year career for the senior team from 1958 to 1973, scoring eight international goals and featuring in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]]. He also played in the [[Shamrock Rovers XI v Brazil]] exhibition match in July 1973, which he also helped to organise.\n\nA strong and physical [[Forward (association football)|forward]], he began his career at [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]] in his native [[Belfast]]. He helped Distillery to win the [[Irish Cup]] in 1956, before he won a \u00a34,000 move to English [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in August 1957. He was sold on to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]  in March 1959 for a fee of \u00a315,000, and played for the club in the [[1960 FA Cup Final]] despite handing in a transfer request the day before the final. He moved on to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for \u00a315,000 in July 1961, but struggled with injuries during a two-season stay at [[Villa Park]]. He dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] to join [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in 1963, who paid a \u00a321,000 transfer fee. He returned to the top flight in November 1965 after being sold to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for \u00a326,000. He was sold to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] for a \u00a350,000 fee in March 1967, and helped the club to win promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1966\u201367, to lift the [[Texaco Cup]] in 1970 and the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1974 Football League Cup Final|1974]], and also played on the losing side of the [[1972 UEFA Cup Final|1972]] [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] final. He also spent two summers in the United States playing for the club's sister teams, the [[Los Angeles Wolves]] and the [[Kansas City Spurs]], who he helped to win the [[United Soccer Association]] and [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|NASL International Cup]] respectively. He retired in 1975, having scored a total of 279 goals in 661 league and cup appearances across 18 seasons in [[the Football League]].\n\nHe was appointed player-manager at [[Southern Football League|Southern League Premier Division]] side [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] in 1975, a position he retained for two years. Whilst at the club he negotiated the first shirt sponsorship deal in English football. He chaired the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) from 1970 to 1978, and helped to further players' rights and set up the first PFA player awards in 1974. Also throughout the 1970s he became a football pundit and writer, and became particularly well known for his part in [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s coverage of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]. After fronting a consortium that took Wolverhampton Wanderers out of liquidation, he served the club as chairman from August 1982 to January 1985. He stood as an independent politician in the [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] constituency in 1997, and later became involved in the [[UK Independence Party]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Distillery===\nAlexander Derek Dougan was born in [[Belfast]] on 20 January 1938, the son of Jackie and Josie Dougan.<ref name=\"page 24\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=24}}</ref> His father worked at [[Belfast Harbour|Belfast docks]].<ref name=\"page 24\"/> His grandfather, Sandy, had played at half-back for [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], and two of Sandy's brothers also played for some of the leading clubs in Belfast.<ref name=\"page 24\"/> As a child, Dougan would usually spend between four and eight hours a day playing football in the street.<ref>{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=26}}</ref> His family were poor, and later in life Dougan joked that \"on the street where I lived, if you paid your rent three weeks on the trot, the police used to come and see where you got the money from\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=28}}</ref> As a teenager he spent 18 months working at a toy factory whilst playing amateur football for Cregagh Boys.<ref name=\"page 29\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=29}}</ref> He also trained with Linfield, but could not break into any of their junior teams.<ref name=\"page 29\"/> He instead joined [[Lisburn Distillery F.C.|Distillery]] in 1953.<ref name=\"page 33\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=33}}</ref> Manager [[Jimmy McIntosh]] handed him his first team debut on 5 February 1955, in a 0\u20130 [[Irish Cup]] first  round draw with [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]].<ref name=\"page 34\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=34}}</ref> [[Maurice Tadman]], who succeeded McIntosh as the club's manager in the summer of 1955, preferred to use Dougan as a target man centre-forward, as Dougan's height made him adept at winning and flicking on headers in the opposition penalty area.<ref name=\"page 35\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=35}}</ref>\n\nWhilst playing part-time for Distillery he also worked at the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipbuilding company.<ref name=\"page 36\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=36}}</ref> Though the [[maximum wage]] in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined to leave for the [[English Football League]] at the earliest opportunity, particularly so following the death of his mother in June 1955.<ref name=\"page 37\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=37}}</ref> He began to attract scouts from England after helping Distillery beat [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] 1\u20130 in the second replay of the [[1955\u201356 Irish Cup|1956 final]] of the Irish Cup at [[Windsor Park]].<ref name=\"page 38\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=38}}</ref> He played mostly at half-back in the [[1956\u201357 Irish League|1956\u201357]] season as Distillery finished sixth in the [[Northern Ireland Football League|Irish League]] and ended up as runners-up in the [[Ulster Cup]], [[City Cup (Northern Ireland)|City Cup]], and [[County Antrim Shield]].<ref name=\"page 41\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=41}}</ref>\n\n===Portsmouth===\nDougan had trials at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], before he was signed by [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] for a fee of \u00a34,000 in August 1957.<ref name = \"death\"/> \"Pompey\" struggled to a 20th-place finish in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in the [[1957\u201358 Portsmouth F.C. season|1957\u201358]] season, and some of his teammates resented Dougan for what he himself felt was the constructive criticism he offered in the dressing room.<ref name=\"page 50\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=50}}</ref> He made his first team debut, providing an assist for [[Jackie Henderson]] in a 3\u20130 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]].<ref name=\"page 52\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=52}}</ref> He scored his first senior goal for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], though was criticised by ''[[Daily Mail]]'' journalist Jack Wood for celebrating the goal with an \"arms akimbo display of histrionics\".<ref name=\"page 53\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=53}}</ref> New manager [[Freddie Cox]], who succeeded [[Eddie Lever]] at [[Fratton Park]] in 1958, took the club to relegation with a last place finish in [[1958\u201359 Portsmouth F.C. season|1958\u201359]] season, though Dougan would miss much of the season with an ankle injury.<ref name=\"page 60\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=60}}</ref>\n\n===Blackburn Rovers===\nDougan was sold on to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a fee of \u00a315,000 in March 1959.<ref name = \"death\"/> He scored on his Rovers debut in a 1\u20131 draw away to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]].<ref name=\"page 64\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=64}}</ref> He scored twice on the opening day of the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]] season, a 4\u20130 victory over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], which began a sequence of five wins and a draw from Rovers's first six matches, at the end of which the club were in second-place and Dougan tallied eleven goals, four of which came in a 6\u20132 victory over [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref name=\"page 66\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=66}}</ref> Though their league campaign petered out to an eventual 17th-place finish, Rovers reached the [[1960 FA Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] after Dougan scored the winning goal past [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the semi-finals.<ref name=\"page 69\">{{harvnb|Tossell|2012|p=69}}</ref> However, he did not enjoy his time at [[Ewood Park]], and later wrote that \"the dourness of the club matched that of the town. I could not shake off the depression that caused me to wake each day regretting that I had to go to the ground.
