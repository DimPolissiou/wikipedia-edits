News|access-date=2020-03-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nThe P40 series is constructed with anodized aluminum for the frame, while the back uses Gorilla Glass on the P40 and P40 Pro or ceramic on the P40 Pro+. The display is flat on the P40 or curved on all sides on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+; Huawei calls this a Quad-Curve Overflow Display. The top left corner of the display has a pill-shaped cutout for the front-facing camera and ambient/proximity sensors; it also accommodates the infrared face unlock system on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+. As on the P30 Pro, the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ replace the traditional earpiece speaker with an \"electromagnetic levitation\" speaker that vibrates the top of the phone's screen, and have an IR blaster on the top edge. The 3.5mm audio jack has also been omitted on all models. A rectangular module houses the rear cameras, which protrudes slightly from the back panel. The P40 and P40 Pro will be available in Silver Frost, Blush Gold, Deep Sea Blue, Ice White and Black, while the P40 Pro+ will be available in Ceramic White or Ceramic Black.\n\n== Specifications ==\n=== Hardware ===\nThe P40 series is powered by the [[HiSilicon]] Kirin 990 5G processor, meaning that all models will have [[5G]] connectivity standard. Although 5G networks are supported, all models only supports \"sub-6\" 5G, meaning they are not compatible with ultra-fast [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter-wave (mmWave)]] networks. The Kirin 990 5G is assisted by the [[Mali (GPU)|Mali]]-G76 MP16 GPU. The P40's display is carried over from the P30, a 6.1\" (154.94mm) 19.5:9 [[1080p]]  (1080 \u00d7 2340) [[OLED]] with a 60\u00a0Hz [[refresh rate]]. The P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ use a larger 6.58\" (167.13mm) 19.8:9 OLED with an unorthodox resolution (1200 \u00d7 2640) and a 90Hz refresh rate, as well as support for HDR10 and DCI-P3. The P40 has 6 or 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM, while the P40 Pro & P40 Pro+ have 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM. All models have [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0: the P40 has 128 or 256 GB, the P40 Pro has 128, 256 or 512 GB and the P40 Pro+ has 256 or 512 GB. Expansion is supported up to 256 GB via Huawei's proprietary Nano Memory card. In addition to the infrared face unlock system, all P40 models have an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor; Huawei claims the sensor is 30% larger and faster than the P30's. The P40 uses a 3800mAh battery, while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ use a larger 4200mAh battery. Fast charging is supported on all models, however the P40 does not support wireless charging. The P40 can charge wired up to 22.5W while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have a max rate of 40W. Both the P40 and P40 Pro are also capable of reverse wireless charging at 27W, but the P40 Pro+ can charge faster wirelessly at 40W whereas the P40 Pro can only charge wirelessly at 27W. Additionally, the P40 has an [[IP Code|IP]]53 rating while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have an IP68 rating. \n==== Camera ====\nThe P40 series features [[Leica Camera|Leica]] optics, and the wide lens on all models is a new \"Ultra Vision\" 50 MP sensor. Like the P30, the wide lens uses a \"SuperSpectrum\" [[image sensor]], whose [[color filter array]] uses yellow sub-pixels instead of green. Huawei stated that this would allow more light to be captured, and enhanced absorption of red and green colors. The P40's rear camera array consists of a 50 MP wide lens, a 16 MP ultrawide lens and an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The P40 Pro increases the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 40 MP, replaces the standard telephoto lens with a 12 MP periscope sensor capable of 5x optical zoom, and adds a [[Time-of-flight camera|time-of-flight]] sensor. The P40 Pro+ has two 8 MP telephoto lenses, a standard sensor with 3x optical zoom and a periscope sensor with 10x optical zoom while retaining the time-of-flight sensor. The front-facing camera uses a 32 MP sensor which has autofocus on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+; an additional depth sensor allows for the face unlock. For both photo and video, pixel binning is used for improved low-light sensitivity, and video can be captured from the wide-angle and telephoto sensors simultaneously with directional audio computed from three omnidirectional microphones. The cameras benefit from an XD Fusion Image Engine which enables advanced computational photography, as well as an \"Octa\" phase-detection autofocus system for faster autofocus and improved white balance sensors on the P40 Pro+. The software is also improved with a new Golden Snap feature that takes a burst of HDR+ photos and automatically picks the best shots. A [[Profoto]] studio light will be available as an accessory as well.\n\n=== Software ===\nThe P40 series ships with [[EMUI|EMUI 10.1]] powered by Huawei Mobile Services (HMS), which is based on the [[Android 10]] source code. Due to [[Huawei#U.S. business restrictions|ongoing United States sanctions against Huawei]], international models of the P40 will not ship with or support [[Google Mobile Services]] \u2014 the proprietary software suite (including [[Google Play]]-branded software) shipped on certified Android devices, and Huawei is not allowed to market the device using the Android [[trademark]].<ref name=\":0\" /> As the P40 series are the first Huawei devices to run EMUI 10.1, they also mark the introduction of Huawei's own voice assistant Celia due to the lack of Google Assistant. Celia includes a \"Hey Celia\" feature which triggers an audio search.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5google.com/2020/03/26/huawei-celia-google-assistant-iphone-p40-pro/|title=Huawei\u2019s \u2018Celia\u2019 tries to replace Google Assistant, also wakes nearby iPhones|website=9to5Google|last=Schoon|first=Ben|date=26 March 2020|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nHuawei is promoting the use of its own in-house platforms as a substitute, including the Huawei AppGallery [[application store|store]] (which is already used on Chinese models of Huawei's devices due to Google not doing business there). Huawei stated that it would make a US$1 billion investment in promoting software development and growth of AppGallery.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Warren |first=Tom |title=Huawei confirms the

The P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ use a larger 6.58\" (167.13mm) 19.8:9 OLED with an unorthodox resolution (1200 \u00d7 2640) and a 90Hz refresh rate, as well as support for HDR10 and DCI-P3. The P40 has 6 or 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM, while the P40 Pro & P40 Pro+ have 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM. All models have [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0: the P40 has 128 or 256 GB, the P40 Pro has 128, 256 or 512 GB and the P40 Pro+ has 256 or 512 GB. Expansion is supported up to 256 GB via Huawei's proprietary Nano Memory card. In addition to the infrared face unlock system, all P40 models have an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor; Huawei claims the sensor is 30% larger and faster than the P30's. The P40 uses a 3800mAh battery, while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ use a larger 4200mAh battery. Fast charging is supported on all models, however the P40 does not support wireless charging. The P40 can charge wired up to 22.5W while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have a max rate of 40W. Both the P40 and P40 Pro are also capable of reverse wireless charging at 27W, but the P40 Pro+ can charge faster wirelessly at 40W whereas the P40 Pro can only charge wirelessly at 27W. Additionally, the P40 has an [[IP Code|IP]]53 rating while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have an IP68 rating. \n==== Camera ====\nThe P40 series features [[Leica Camera|Leica]] optics, and the wide lens on all models is a new \"Ultra Vision\" 50 MP sensor. Like the P30, the wide lens uses a \"SuperSpectrum\" [[image sensor]], whose [[color filter array]] uses yellow sub-pixels instead of green. Huawei stated that this would allow more light to be captured, and enhanced absorption of red and green colors. The P40's rear camera array consists of a 50 MP wide lens, a 16 MP ultrawide lens and an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The P40 Pro increases the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 40 MP, replaces the standard telephoto lens with a 12 MP periscope sensor capable of 5x optical zoom, and adds a [[Time-of-flight camera|time-of-flight]] sensor. The P40 Pro+ has two 8 MP telephoto lenses, a standard sensor with 3x optical zoom and a periscope sensor with 10x optical zoom while retaining the time-of-flight sensor. The front-facing camera uses a 32 MP sensor which has autofocus on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+; an additional depth sensor allows for the face unlock. For both photo and video, pixel binning is used for improved low-light sensitivity, and video can be captured from the wide-angle and telephoto sensors simultaneously with directional audio computed from three omnidirectional microphones. The cameras benefit from an XD Fusion Image Engine which enables advanced computational photography, as well as an \"Octa\" phase-detection autofocus system for faster autofocus and improved white balance sensors on the P40 Pro+. The software is also improved with a new Golden Snap feature that takes a burst of HDR+ photos and automatically picks the best shots. A [[Profoto]] studio light will be available as an accessory as well.\n\n=== Software ===\nThe P40 series ships with [[EMUI|EMUI 10.1]] powered by Huawei Mobile Services (HMS), which is based on [[Android 10]] source code. Due to [[Huawei#U.S. business restrictions|ongoing United States sanctions against Huawei]], international models of the P40 will not ship with or support [[Google Mobile Services]] \u2014 the proprietary software suite (including [[Google Play]]-branded software) shipped on certified Android devices, and Huawei is not allowed to market the device using the Android [[trademark]].<ref name=\":0\" /> As the P40 series are the first Huawei devices to run EMUI 10.1, they also mark the introduction of Huawei's own voice assistant Celia due to the lack of Google Assistant. Celia includes a \"Hey Celia\" feature which triggers an audio search.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5google.com/2020/03/26/huawei-celia-google-assistant-iphone-p40-pro/|title=Huawei\u2019s \u2018Celia\u2019 tries to replace Google Assistant, also wakes nearby iPhones|website=9to5Google|last=Schoon|first=Ben|date=26 March 2020|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nHuawei is promoting the use of its own in-house platforms as a substitute, including the Huawei AppGallery [[application store|store]] (which is already used on Chinese models of Huawei's devices due to Google not doing business there).

STAAD.Pro Physical Modeler takes advantage of physical modeling to simplify modeling of a structure, which in turn more accurately reflects the process of building a model. Beams and surfaces are placed in the model on the scale of which they would appear in the physical world. A column may span multiple floors and a surface represents an entire floor of a building, for example. A joint is then generated anywhere two physical objects meet in the model (as well as at the free ends of cantilevered members, for convenience).\n\n=== STAAD Building Planner ===\nSTAAD Building Planner is a module that enables seamless generation of building models that can be analyzed and designed thereafter in the program itself. Operations like defining geometry, making changes in the geometric specifications are matters of only few clicks in this workflow.\n\n=== Steel AutoDrafter ===\nSteel AutoDrafter workflow extracts planar drawings and material take-off from a structural steel model prepared in STAAD.Pro. It produces excellent quality plans at any level and sections in any of the orthogonal directions.\n\n=== STAAD.Beava ===\nThe general philosophy governing the design of bridges is that, subject to a set of loading rules and constraints, the worst effects due to load application should be established and designed against. The process of load application can be complex as governing rules can impose interdependent parameters such as loaded length on a lane, lane factors, and load intensity. To obtain the maximum design effects, engineers have to try many loading situations on a trial and error basis.\n\nThis leads to the generation of many live load application instances (and a large volume of output data) that then must be combined with dead load and other effects, as well. Bridge Deck is used to minimize the load application process while complying with national code requirements.\n\nThe program is based on the use of influence surfaces, which are generated by STAAD.Pro as part of the loading process. An influence surface for a given effect on a bridge deck relates its value to movement of a unit load over the point of interest. The influence surface is a three-dimensional form of an influence line for a single member (or, in other words, it is a 2D influence function).\n\nSTAAD.Pro will automatically generate influence surfaces for effects such as bending moments for elements, deflection in all the degrees of freedom of nodes, and support reactions. The user then instruct the program to utilize the relevant influence surfaces and, with due regards to code requirements, optimize load positions to obtain the maximum desired effects.\n\n=== Advanced Concrete Design ===\nThe Advanced Concrete Design workflow provides direct access for STAAD.Pro models to leverage the power of the RCDC application. This is a standalone application, which is operated outside the STAAD.Pro environment, but requires a model and results data from a suitable analysis.\nThe model should typically be formed from beams and columns (plates are currently not supported). RCDC can be used to design the following objects: Pile Caps, Footings, Columns and walls, Beams, Slabs.\n\nAs the projects progresses, each design created in RCDC is retained and displayed when RCDC is re-entered, so that previous designs can be recalled and/or continued. \nDetailed drawings and BBS of excellent quality can be generated as required and they are quite ready to be sent for execution.\n\n=== Advanced Slab Design ===\nThe STAAD.Pro Advanced Slab Design workflow is an integrated tool that works from within the STAAD.Pro environment. Concrete slabs can be defined, and the data can be transferred to RAM Concept.\nThe data passed into RAM Concept includes the geometry, section and material properties, loads and combination information, and analysis results.\n\n=== Earthquake Mode ===\nEurocode 8: Part 1 contains specific requirements and recommendations for building structures that are to be constructed in seismic regions. Essentially, these fundamental requirements have been provided to ensure that the structures can sustain the seismic loads without collapse and also \u2013 where required\u2013 avoid suffering unacceptable damage and can continue to function after an exposure to a seismic event.\nThis STAAD.Pro workflow is used to check if the structure conforms to the basic geometric recommendations made in Eurocode 8 (EC8). This workflow is in addition to the normal post-processing workflow which gives the various analysis results. These checks are intended to give you a \"feel\" for the structure and are not mandatory to proceed to the design phase.\n\n=== OpenSTAAD Macro Editor ===\n==== OpenSTAAD Macro Editor ====\nOpenSTAAD is a library of exposed functions enabling engineers access STAAD.Pro\u2019s internal functions and routines as well as its graphical commands. With OpenSTAAD, one can use VBA macros to perform such tasks as automating repetitive modeling or post-processing tasks or embedding customized design routines. Following an open architecture paradigm, OpenSTAAD was built using ATL, COM, and COM+ standards as specified by Microsoft. This allows OpenSTAAD to be used in a macro application like Microsoft Excel or Autodesk AutoCAD. OpenSTAAD can also be used to link STAAD data to Web-based applications using ActiveX, HTML, and ASP. Through the in-built Macro Editor, one can leverage the functionalities of OpenSTAAD and automate the analysis and design workflows, thereby eliminating the chance of occurrence of potential errors due to manual intervention and reducing the required time for execution of the whole workflow (as compared to the manual execution time), to a large extent.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/STAAD.Pro Bentley.com]\n\n[[Category:Computer-aided engineering software]]\n[[Category:Structural analysis]]\n[[Category:Structural engineering]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2016}}\n'''STAAD''' or ('''STAAD.Pro''') is a [[structural analysis]] and design software application originally developed by Research Engineers International in 1997.

It supports over 90 international steel, concrete, timber & aluminium design codes.\n\nIt can make use of various forms of analysis from the traditional static analysis to more recent analysis methods like [[P-Delta Effect|p-delta]] analysis, geometric non-linear analysis, Pushover analysis (Static-Non Linear Analysis) or a [[buckling]] analysis. It can also make use of various forms of dynamic analysis methods from time history analysis to response spectrum analysis. The response spectrum analysis feature is supported for both user defined spectra as well as a number of international code specified spectra.\n\nAdditionally, STAAD.Pro is interoperable with applications such as RAM Connection, AutoPIPE, SACS and many more engineering design and analysis applications to further improve collaboration between the different disciplines involved in a project.

Bridge Deck is used to minimize the load application process while complying with national code requirements.\n\nThe program is based on the use of influence surfaces, which are generated by STAAD.Pro as part of the loading process. An influence surface for a given effect on a bridge deck relates its value to movement of a unit load over the point of interest. The influence surface is a three-dimensional form of an influence line for a single member (or, in other words, it is a 2D influence function).\n\nSTAAD.Pro will automatically generate influence surfaces for effects such as bending moments for elements, deflection in all the degrees of freedom of nodes, and support reactions. The user then instruct the program to utilize the relevant influence surfaces and, with due regards to code requirements, optimize load positions to obtain the maximum desired effects.\n\n=== Advanced Concrete Design ===\nThe Advanced Concrete Design workflow provides direct access for STAAD.Pro models to leverage the power of the RCDC application. This is a standalone application, which is operated outside the STAAD.Pro environment, but requires a model and results data from a suitable analysis.\nThe model should typically be formed from beams and columns (plates are currently not supported). RCDC can be used to design the following objects: Pile Caps, Footings, Columns and walls, Beams, Slabs.\n\nAs the projects progresses, each design created in RCDC is retained and displayed when RCDC is re-entered, so that previous designs can be recalled and/or continued. \nDetailed drawings and BBS of excellent quality can be generated as required and they are quite ready to be sent for execution.\n\n=== Advanced Slab Design ===\nThe STAAD.Pro Advanced Slab Design workflow is an integrated tool that works from within the STAAD.Pro environment. Concrete slabs can be defined, and the data can be transferred to RAM Concept.\nThe data passed into RAM Concept includes the geometry, section and material properties, loads and combination information, and analysis results.\n\n=== Earthquake Mode ===\nEurocode 8: Part 1 contains specific requirements and recommendations for building structures that are to be constructed in seismic regions. Essentially, these fundamental requirements have been provided to ensure that the structures can sustain the seismic loads without collapse and also \u2013 where required\u2013 avoid suffering unacceptable damage and can continue to function after an exposure to a seismic event.\nThis STAAD.Pro workflow is used to check if the structure conforms to the basic geometric recommendations made in Eurocode 8 (EC8). This workflow is in addition to the normal post-processing workflow which gives the various analysis results. These checks are intended to give you a \"feel\" for the structure and are not mandatory to proceed to the design phase.\n\n=== OpenSTAAD Macro Editor ===\n==== OpenSTAAD Macro Editor ====\nOpenSTAAD is a library of exposed functions enabling engineers access STAAD.Pro\u2019s internal functions and routines as well as its graphical commands. With OpenSTAAD, one can use VBA macros to perform such tasks as automating repetitive modeling or post-processing tasks or embedding customized design routines. Following an open architecture paradigm, OpenSTAAD was built using ATL, COM, and COM+ standards as specified by Microsoft. This allows OpenSTAAD to be used in a macro application like Microsoft Excel or Autodesk AutoCAD. OpenSTAAD can also be used to link STAAD data to Web-based applications using ActiveX, HTML, and ASP. Through the in-built Macro Editor, one can leverage the functionalities of OpenSTAAD and automate the analysis and design workflows, thereby eliminating the chance of occurrence of potential errors due to manual intervention and reducing the required time for execution of the whole workflow (as compared to the manual execution time), to a large extent.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/STAAD.Pro Bentley.com]\n\n[[Category:Computer-aided engineering software]]\n[[Category:Structural analysis]]\n[[Category:Structural engineering]]\n", "name_user": "Astaad official", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Everything)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAAD"}
