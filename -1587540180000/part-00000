{"title_page": "Biolinguistics", "text_new": "{{short description|The study of the biology and evolution of language}}\n[[File:Palmarini Pio Manz\u00f9.jpg|thumb|Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini]]\n'''Biolinguistics''' is the study of the biological foundations of language first introduced by Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, professor of Linguistics and Cognitive Science at the [[University of Arizona]]. At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\". Hacettepe \u00fcniversitesi E\u011fitim Fak\u00fcltesi \u00d6\u011fretim \u00fcyesi.  https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/88422</ref> Chomsky and Lenneberg militated against it by arguing for the innate knowledge of language. Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained. These works were regarded as pioneers in the shaping of biolinguistic thought, in what was the beginning of a change in paradigm in the study of language.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martins |first1=Pedro Tiago |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=What we talk about when we talk about biolinguistics |journal=Linguistics Vanguard |date=27 August 2016 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0007 }}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Darwin.jpg|thumb]]\n[[Darwinism]] inspired many researchers to study language, in particular the evolution of language, mainly by means of biology. Dating all the way back to 1821, German linguist August Scheilurer was the representative pioneer of biolinguistics, discussing the evolution of language based on Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Since linguistics had been believed to be a form of historical science under the influence of [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris|the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Linguistique de Paris]], speculations of the origin of language were not permitted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New essays on the origin of language|last=Trabant|first=J\u00fcrgen|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2001|isbn=9783110849080|location=|pages=}}</ref> As a result, hardly did any prominent linguist write about the origin of language apart from German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]].  \n\nThe first official biolinguistic conference was organized by him in 1974, bringing together [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]], neuroscientists, linguists, and others interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boeckx|first1=Cedric|first2=Massimo|last2=Piattelli-Palmarini|year=2005|title=Language as a natural object, linguistics as a natural science.

Their work renewed interest in biolinguistics, catalysing many linguists to look into biolinguistics with their colleagues in adjacent scientific disciplines.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Di Sciullo |first1=Anna Maria |last2=Boeckx |first2=Cedric |title=The Biolinguistic Enterprise: New Perspectives on the Evolution and Nature of the Human Language Faculty Volume 1 of Oxford Studies in Biolinguistics |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press, 2011 |isbn=9780199553273 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6REUDAAAQBAJ&dq=origins+of+biolinguistics}}</ref> Both Jenkins and Uriagereka stressed the importance of addressing the emergence of the language faculty in humans. At around the same time, [[geneticist]]s discovered a link between the language deficit manifest by the [[KE family]] members and the gene [[FOXP2]]. Although FOXP2 is not the gene responsible for language,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Why Only Us|date=2016|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262333351|doi = 10.7551/mitpress/10684.001.0001}}</ref> this discovery brought many linguists and scientists together to interpret this data, renewing the interest of biolinguistics.\n\nAlthough many linguists have differing opinions when it comes to the history of biolinguistics, Chomsky believes that its history was simply that of [[transformational grammar]]. While Professor [[Anna Maria Di Sciullo]] claims that the interdisciplinary research of biology and linguistics in the 1950s-1960s led to the rise of biolinguistics. Furthermore, Jenkins believes that biolinguistics was the outcome of transformational grammarians studying human linguistic and biological mechanism. On the other hand, linguists [[Martin Nowak]] and [[Charles Yang (linguist)|Charles Yang]] argue that biolinguistics, originating in the 1970s, is distinct transformational grammar; rather a new branch of the linguistics-biology research paradigm initiated by transformational grammar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=Jieqiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref>\n\n==Developments==\n\n==== Darwinism ====\n\n{{Main|Darwinism}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of life (Plate (31)) BHL34392020.jpg|thumb]]\n\nDarwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by [[Charles Darwin]], stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=R.B. |title=The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist. |date=1977 |publisher=Dawson: Folkstone. |edition=2nd}}</ref> The theory has since then been adopted and applied by many researchers and scholars into various fields of research.\nIn his book [[Descent of Man]], Darwin described how language might have evolved through natural and sexual selection, comparing birds learning to sing to infants babbling. Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n=== Chomsky's Theories ===\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995. ''Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program: Principles and Parameters in Syntactic Theory''. Wiley-Blackwell; Uriagereka, Juan. 1998.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element withing a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree. In image a) you can see that the determiner ''the'' and the Noun Phrase ''pie''  are both selected. Through the process of Merge, the new formed element on the tree is the determiner Phrase (DP) which holds, ''the pie.''  <gallery>\nFile:The pie.png|a) Selection of the final two element of the phrase\nFile:DP the pie.png|b) The two selected elements are then \"merged\" and they produce one new constituent, known as the Determiner Phrase (DP)\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Biolinguistics: Challenging the Usage-Based Approach ==\nAs mentioned above, biolinguistics challenges the idea that the acquisition of language is a result of behavior based learning. This alternative approach the biolinguistics challenges is known as the usage-based (UB) approach. UB supports that idea that knowledge of human language is acquired via exposure and usage <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ibbotson|first=Paul|date=2013|title=The Scope of Usage-Based Theory|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255/full#B163|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00255|issn=1664-1078|doi-access=free}}</ref>. One of the primary issues that is highlighted when arguing against the Usage-Based approach, is that UB fails to address the issue of poverty of stimulus<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghalebi|first=Rezvan|last2=Sadighi|first2=Firooz|date=2015-08-06|title=The Usage-based Theory of Language Acquisition: A review of Major Issues|url=http://www.jallr.com/index.php/JALLR/article/view/138|journal=Journal of Applied Linguistics and Language Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=190\u2013195|issn=2376-760X}}</ref>, whereas biolinguistics addresses this by way of the Language Acquisition Device.\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nIn biolinguistics, language is recognised to be based on recursive generative procedure that retrieves words from the lexicon and applies them repeatedly to output phrases. This generative procedure was hypothesised to be a result of a minor brain mutation due to evidence that word ordering is limited to externalisation and plays no role in core syntax or semantics<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-only-us|title=Why Only Us {{!}} The MIT Press|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=mitpress.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>. Thus, different lines of inquiry to explain this were explored. The most commonly accepted of these was [[Noam Chomsky]]'s minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program|Minimalist Program]]. In 2016, Chomsky and Berwick defined the Minimalist Program under the Strong Minimalist Thesis in their book ''Why Only Us'' by saying that language is mandated by efficient computations and, thus, keeps to the simplest recursive operations. The main basic operation in the [[Minimalist program|Minimalist Program]] is [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] <ref name=\":2\" />. Merge is the simplest form of recursive generation. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representational character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.

At an international meeting at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 1971, biolinguistics was introduced as a highly interdisciplinary field,  including [[linguistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[mathematics]], and others. By embracing the [[natural science]]s, it seeks to yield a framework through which we can understand the fundamentals of [[Language faculty|the faculty of language]]. \nBiolinguistics, also called the biolinguistic enterprise or the biolinguistic approach, is believed to have its origins in [[Noam Chomsky]]\u2019s and [[Eric Lenneberg]]\u2019s work on language acquisition that began in the 1950s as a reaction to the then-dominant behaviorist paradigm. Fundamentally, biolinguistics challenges the view of human language acquisition as a behavior based on stimulus-response interactions and associations.<ref>DEMIREZEN, Mehmet (1988). \"Behaviorist theory and language learning\".

Chomsky in 1960s proposed [[Language acquisition device|the Language Acquisition Device (LAD)]] as a hypothetical tool for language acquisition that only humans are born with. Similarly, Lenneberg (1967)<ref name=\":0\" /> formulated [[Critical period hypothesis|the Critical Period Hypothesis]], the main idea of which being that language acquisition is biologically constrained.

Darwin\u2019s theory regarding the origin of language attempts to answer two important questions:\n\n* Whether individual languages undergo something like selection as they evolve, and\n* Whether selection played a role in producing the power of articulate language in humans; and, if it did, whether the selection was primarily responsible for the emergence of that power, or just one of several contributing causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Radick |first1=Gregory |title=Darwin on Language and Selection |journal=Selection |date=November 2002 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201312 |doi=10.1556/Select.3.2002.1.2 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fba79bb3c28862a33ce0ba3fe02896796e30eb2d }}</ref>\n\nDarwinism addressed the arguments of other researchers and scholars such as [[Max M\u00fcller]] by arguing that language use, while requiring a certain mental capacity, would also stimulate brain development, enabling long trains of thought and strengthening reasoning power. Darwin drew an extended analogy between the evolution of languages and species, noting in each domain the presence of rudiments, of crossing and blending, and of variation, and remarking on how each developed gradually through a process of struggle.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Plotkin |first1=Henry |title=Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge |date=25 April 1997 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674192812}}</ref>\n\n=== Chomsky's Theories ===\n\n===== Universal Grammar and Generative Grammar =====\n{{Main|Universal grammar}}\n[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2015.jpg|thumb|Noam Chomsky]]\nIn the early 1950s, Chomsky constructed the five core questions of biolinguistics\n\n* What constitutes the knowledge of language? \n* How is the knowledge acquired? \n* How is the knowledge put to use? \n* What are the relevant brain mechanisms? \n* How does this knowledge evolve (in the species)?\n\nThe first three questions were elaborated upon in Chomsky\u2019s book [[The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory]], while the fourth and the fifth ones were mentioned in Lenneberg\u2019s book Biolinguistical Foundations of Language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wu |first1=JIe Qiong |title=An Overview of Researches on Biolinguistics |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Canadian Social Science |pages=171\u2013176 |citeseerx=10.1.1.820.7700 }}</ref> In ''Aspects of the theory of Syntax'', Chomsky proposed that languages are the product of a biologically determined capacity present in all humans, located in the brain, a great deal of which must be innate, supporting his claim with the fact that speakers are capable of producing and understanding novel sentences without explicit instructions.\nChomsky proposed that the form of the grammar may merge from the mental structure afforded by the human brain and argued that formal grammatical categories such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives do not exist. The linguistic theory of [[generative grammar]] thereby proposes that sentences are generated by a subconscious set of procedures which are part of an individual\u2019s cognitive ability. These procedures are modeled through a set of formal grammatical rules which are thought to generate sentences in a language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freidin |first1=Robert |title=Generative Grammar: Theory and its History |date=5 March 2012 |publisher=Routledge Leading Linguists |isbn=9780415541336 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nChomsky focuses on the mind of the language learner or user and proposed that internal properties of the language faculty are closely linked to the physical biology of humans. He further introduced the idea of a [[Universal Grammar]] theorized to be inherent to all human beings, referring to the initial state of the faculty of language, a biologically innate organ that helps the learner make sense of the data and build up an internal grammar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=C\u0103linescu |first1=Mihaela |title=Chomsky's Biolinguistic Approach to Mind and Language |journal=Linguistic & Philosophical Investigations |date=1 January 2012 |volume=11 |pages=91\u201396 }}</ref> The theory suggests that all human languages are subject to universal principles or parameters that allow for different choices (values).

The [[Language Acquisition Device]] (LAD) was \u00a0presented as an innate structure in humans which enabled language learning. Individuals are thought to be \u201cwired\u201d with universal grammar rules enabling them to understand and evaluate complex syntactic structures. Proponents of the LAD often quote the argument of the poverty of negative stimulus, suggesting that children rely on the LAD to develop their knowledge of a language despite not being exposed to a rich linguistic environment. Later, Chomsky exchanged this notion instead for that of Universal Grammar, providing evidence for a biological basis of language. \n\n=====Minimalist Program=====\n\n{{Main|Minimalist Program}}\n\nThe Minimalist Program (MP) was introduced by Chomsky in 1993, and it focuses on the parallel between language and the design of natural concepts. Those invested in the Minimalist Program are interested in the physics and mathematics of language and its parallels with our natural world. For example, Piatelli-Palmarini <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319193580 |title=Piatelli-Palmarini, M., & Vitello, G. (2017). \"Quantum field theory and the linguistic Minimalist Program: a remarkable isomorphism\" |accessdate=2019-04-10 }}</ref> studied the isomorphic relationship between the Minimalist Program and [[Quantum Field Theory]].\nThe Minimalist Program aims to figure out how much of the [[Principles and Parameters]] model can be taken as a result of the hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty and more developed versions of the Principles and Parameters approach in turn provide technical principles from which the minimalist program can be seen to follow.<ref>Gert Webelhuth. 1995.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]</ref> \nThe program further aims to develop ideas involving the [[economy of derivation]] and [[economy of representation]], which had started to become an independent theory in the early 1990s, but were then still considered as peripherals of [[transformational grammar]].<ref>For a full description of the checking mechanism see [[David Adger|Adger, David]]. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers</ref> \n\nThe [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] operation is used by Chomsky to explain the structure of syntax trees within the Minimalist program.  Merge itself is a process which provides the basis of phrasal formation as a result of taking two element withing a phrase and combining them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sciullo|first=Anna Maria Di|last2=Isac|first2=Daniela|date=2008-09-30|title=The Asymmetry of Merge|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/53|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=260\u2013290|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> In A.M. Di Sciullo & D. Isac's ''The Asymmetry of Merge'' (2008), they highlight the two key bases of Merge by Chomsky;\n\n* Merge is binary\n* Merge is recursive\n\nIn order to understand this, take the following sentence:  ''Emma dislikes pies''\n\nThis phrase can be broken down into its lexical items: \n\n[VP [DP Emma] [V' [V dislikes] [DP [D the] [NP pie]]]\n\nThe above phrasal representation allows for an understanding of each lexical item. In order to build a tree using Merge, using bottom-up formation the two final element of the phrase are selected and then combined to form a new element on the tree. In image a) you can see that the determiner ''the'' and the Noun Phrase ''pie''  are both selected. Through the process of Merge, the new formed element on the tree is the determiner Phrase (DP) which holds, ''the pie.''  <gallery>\nFile:The pie.png|a) Selection of the final two element of the phrase\nFile:DP the pie.png|b) The two selected elements are then \"merged\" and they produce one new constituent, known as the Determiner Phrase (DP)\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn a minimalist approach, there are three core components of the language faculty proposed: Sensory-Motor system (SM), Conceptual-Intentional system (CI), and Narrow Syntax (NS).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Di Sciullo |display-authors=etal |first=Anna Maria|date=Winter 2010|title=The Biological Nature of Human Language|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c9/74fedaf9adb067941d98debad51e8c84be02.pdf|journal=Biolinguistics|volume=4|pages=|via=}}</ref> SM includes biological requisites for language production and perception, such as articulatory organs, and CI meets the biological requirements related to inference, interpretation, and reasoning, those involved in other cognitive functions. As SM and CI are finite, the main function of NS is to make it possible to produce infinite numbers of sound-meaning pairs.\n\n=====Relevance of Natural Law=====\nIt is possible that the core principles of The Faculty of Language be correlated to [[natural law]]s (such as for example, the [[Fibonacci sequence]]&mdash; an array of numbers where each consecutive number is a sum of the two that precede it, see for example the discussion Uriagereka 1997 and Carnie and Medeiros 2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|title=Natural Law: The Dynamics of Syntactic Representations in MP|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221083019/http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/lip/25/LIP25-3soschen.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-21|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref> According to the hypothesis being developed, the essential properties of language arise from nature itself: the efficient growth requirement appears everywhere, from the pattern of petals in flowers, leaf arrangements in trees and the spirals of a seashell to the structure of DNA and proportions of human head and body. Natural Law in this case would provide insight on concepts such as binary branching in syntactic trees. This would translate to thinking it in terms of taking two elements on a syntax tree and such that their sum yields another element that falls below on the given syntax tree. By adhering to this sum of two elements that precede it, provides support for binary structures. Furthermore, the possibility of ternary branching would deviate from the Fibonacci sequence and consequently wold not hold as strong support to the relevance of Natural Law in syntax.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soschen|first=Alona|date=2008-03-25|title=On the Nature of Syntax|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/9|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=2|issue=2-3|pages=196\u2013224|issn=1450-3417}}</ref>\n\nIf this law applies to existing systems of cognition, both in humans and non-humans, then what allows our mind to create language? Could it be that a single cycle exists, a unique component of which gives rise to our ability to construct sentences, refer to ourselves and other persons, group objects and establish relations between them, and eventually understand each other? The answer to this question will be a landmark breakthrough, not only within linguistics but in our understanding of cognition in general.\n\n==== Lenneberg and the Role of Genes ====\nAnother major contributor to the field is [[Eric Lenneberg]]. In is book ''Biological Foundation of Languages'',<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=Lenneberg |first1=E.H. |title=Biological foundations of language |date=1967 |publisher=New York Wiley}}</ref>  Lenneberg (1967) suggests that different aspects of human biology that putatively contribute to language more than genes at play. This intergration of other fields to explain language is recognized as the ''strong'' view in biolinguistics<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boeckx|first=Cedric|last2=Grohmann|first2=Kleanthes K.|date=2007|title=The BIOLINGUISTICS Manifesto|url=https://www.biolinguistics.eu/index.php/biolinguistics/article/view/26|journal=BIOLINGUISTICS|language=en|volume=1|pages=001\u2013008|issn=1450-3417}}</ref> While they are obviously essential, and while genomes are associated with specific organisms, genes do not store traits (or \u201cfaculties\u201d) in the way that linguists\u2014including Chomskyans\u2014sometimes seem to imply.\n\nContrary to the concept of the existence of a language faculty as suggested by Chomsky, Lenneberg argues that while there are specific regions and networks crucially involved in the production of language,  there is no single region to which language capacity is confined and that speech, as well as language, is not confined to the [[cerebral cortex]]. \nLenneberg considered language as a species-specific mental organ with significant biological properties. He suggested that this organ grows in the mind/brain of a child in the same way that other biological organs grow, showing that the child\u2019s path to language displays the hallmark of biological growth. According to Lenneberg, genetic mechanisms plays an important role in the development of an individual\u2019s behavior and is characterized by two aspects:\n\n* The acknowledgement of an indirect relationship between genes and traits, and; \n* The rejection of the existence of \u2018special\u2019 genes for language, that is, the rejection of the need for a specifically linguistic genotype;\n\nBased on this, Lenneberg goes on further to claim that no kind of functional principle could be stored in an individual\u2019s genes, rejecting the idea that there exist genes for specific traits, including language. In other words, that genes can contain traits. He then proposed that the way in which genes influence the general patterns of structure and function is by means of their action upon [[ontogenesis]] of genes as a causal agent which is individually the direct and unique responsible for a specific phenotype, criticizing prior hypothesis by [[Charles Goodwin (semiotician)|Charles Goodwin]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boeckx |first1=Cedric |last2=Longa |first2=Victor M. |title=Lenneberg's Views on Language Development and Evolution and Their Relevance for Modern Biolinguistics |journal=Biolinguistics |date=2011 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=254\u2013273 |url=https://doaj.org/article/bda43b85480f4d5e9ef5d3d0dfc21fe3 |accessdate=10 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Recent Developments ==\nIn biolinguistics, language is recognised to be based on recursive generative procedure that retrieves words from the lexicon and applies them repeatedly to output phrases. This generative procedure was hypothesised to be a result of a minor brain mutation due to evidence that word ordering is limited to externalisation and plays no role in core syntax or semantics<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/why-only-us|title=Why Only Us {{!}} The MIT Press|last=Press|first=The MIT|website=mitpress.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>. Thus, different lines of inquiry to explain this were explored. The most commonly accepted of these was [[Noam Chomsky]]'s minimalist approach to syntactic representations. This effort to understand how much of language can be given a principled explanation has resulted in the [[minimalist program]].  In syntax, lexical items are merged externally, building argument representations. The internal merge induces movement and creates constituent structures where each is part of a larger unit. This mechanism allows people to combine words into infinite strings. If this holds, then the objective of biolinguistics is to find out as much as we can about the principles underlying mental [[recursion]].\n\n==Critiques==\nDavid Poeppel, a [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] and linguist, has noted that if neuroscience and linguistics are done wrong, there is a risk of \"inter-disciplinary cross-sterilization,\" arguing that there is a ''Granularity Mismatch Problem'', as different levels of representations used in linguistics and neural science lead to vague metaphors linking brain structures to linguistic components. Poeppel and Embick also introduce the ''Ontological Incommensurability Problem'', where computational processes described in linguistic theory cannot be restored to neural computational processes. Poeppel suggests that [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] research should try to have theories of how the brain encodes linguistic information and what could be cognitively realistic computation.<ref>{{cite book | last=Poeppel | first=David | last2=Embick | first2=David | chapter=Defining the Relation Between Linguistics and Neuroscience | title=Twenty-First Century Psycholinguistics: Four Cornerstones | editor=Anne Cutler | year=2005 | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}</ref>\n\nA more positive critique comes from the side of [[biosemiotics]], claiming that meaning-making begins far before the emergence of human language.<ref>[[Ekaterina Velmezova|Velmezova, Ekaterina]]; [[Kalevi Kull|Kull, Kalevi]]; Cowley, Stephen (eds.) 2015.

Cham: Springer.</ref>\n\nDeveloped by [[Elizabeth Bates]] and [[Brian MacWhinney]], the [[Competition Model]] views language acquisition as a process consisting of a series of competitive cognitive processes that act upon an analog linguistic signal. This suggests that language development depends on learning and detecting linguistic cues through competing general cognitive mechanisms rather than innate, language-specific mechanisms.\n\nA more recent critique of biolinguistics and 'biologism' in language sciences in general developed by Prakash Mondal shows that there are inconsistencies and categorical mismatches in any putative bridging constraints that purport to relate neurobiological structures and processes to the logical structures of language that have a cognitive-representational character.<ref>Mondal, Prakash. 2019: Language, Biology, and Cognition: A Critical Perspective.''[https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030237141]''.
