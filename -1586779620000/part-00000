{"title_page": "Inca cuisine", "text_new": "[[File:PachaComer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Pachamanca]], a traditional dish consisting of food prepared in a ''[[huatia]]''.]]\n{{Inca civilization}}\n'''Inca cuisine''' originated in pre-Columbian times within the [[Inca civilization]] from the 13th to the 16th century. The Inca civilization stretched across many regions, and so there was a great diversity of plants and animals used for food, many of which remain unknown outside [[Peru]]. The most important staples were various tubers, roots, and grains. [[Maize]] was of high prestige, but could not be grown as extensively as it was further north. The most common sources of meat were [[guinea pig]]s and [[llama]]s, and dried fish was common.\n\n==Foods==\nThere were also several types of edible [[clay]], like ''pasa'', which was used as sauce for potatoes and other tubers, and ''chaco,'' something used by the poor or religiously devout. As in the rest of Central and South America, [[chili pepper]]s were an important and highly praised part of their diet.<ref>Coe p. 179-180</ref>\n\n===Vegetables===\n[[Image:Patates.jpg|right|thumb|The people of the Andes developed hundreds of varieties of potatoes. Most of them are still unknown in the rest of the world.]]\nThe Inca realm stretched north-south, encompassing a great variety of climate zones. In Peru in particular, the mountain ranges provide highly varied types of growing zones at different altitudes.<ref>Coe p. 169-170</ref> The staples of the Incas included various plants with edible tubers and roots like [[potato]] and [[sweet potato]], in hundreds of varieties. Slightly over 4,000 types are known to Peru and were domesticated in the region since middle to early 3000 B.C. There was also oca (''[[Oxalis tuberosa|oca]]''), which came in two varieties, sweet and bitter. The sweet variety could be eaten raw or preserved and was used as a sweetener before the arrival of [[sugar]] made from [[sugar cane]]. Similar to oca in purpose, ''paiko'' (''[[Dysphania ambrosioides]]''), was a part of Inca diet for flavoring and edible leaves.<ref> Coe p. 181</ref> Species of the ''[[Chenopodium]]'' family in the Inca cuisine were ''[[Chenopodium pallidicaule]]'', also known as ''[[ca\u00f1ihua]]'', and ''[[Chenopodium quinoa]]'', or ''[[quinoa]]'', due to their ability to survive in the high altitudes of the Andes. ''Quinoa'' has grown popular in the modern world beyond the Andes due to its adaptability, nutritional value, and many uses.<ref>Jacobsen p. 168</ref> Another high-altitude plant in Inca cuisine is ''[[Lupinus mutabilis]]'', also known as ''tarwi'' or ''chocho''. High in protein, this plant was often eaten with [[chile]]s and [[onion]]s after being carefully treated, since improper treatment can leave the crop poisonous. Like ''chocho'' in protein count, ''[[Ahipa]]'' (''[[Pachyrhizus ahipa]]'') was another crop in Inca cuisine. It grows rapidly and has a high yield rate of the tubers that was cherished for its sweet taste like [[water chestnut]]s.<ref>Foster p. 100</ref> Another tuber consumed in the Andes was ''[[Tropaeolum tuberosum]]'', also known as ''mashua'' and ''a\u00f1u'' in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], due to its resistance to droughts and frost. It specially prepared and cooked to bring out the flavor that was desired as it was very bitter before doing so. So much so that it was considered an an [[aphrodisiac]] and given to the Inca soldiers during campaigns to make them forget about their spouses.<ref> Coe p. 184</ref> Other roots that could be found in the Inca cuisine were the ''maka'' (''[[Lepidium meyenii]]'') and the ''[[yac\u00f3n]]'' (''[[Polymnia sonchifolia]]''). ''Maka'' was capable of surviving in the coldest and highest areas of the Andes, thus giving it high value. ''Yac\u00f3n'' was documented to be similar to a turnip in texture but was very sweet and kept well, making them popular on sea voyages.<ref> Coe p. 185</ref> The insipid, starchy root [[Olluco|ullucu]], and [[arracacha]], something like a cross between carrot and celery, were, like potatoes, used in stews and soup. ''Achira'', a species of ''[[Canna (plant)|Canna]]'', was a sweet, starchy root that was baked in earth ovens. Since it had to be transported up to the power center of [[Cuzco]], it is considered to have been food eaten as part of a tradition. Although the roots and tubers provided the staples of the Inca, they were still considered lower in rank than [[maize]] (''[[Zea mays]]'').<ref>Coe pp. 180-183</ref> It has been found that the Inca conquered lands were often transitioned from potato fields to maize fields, more than likely due to it being the main ingredient of ''[[chicha]]''.\n\nSeveral species of [[seaweed]], such as ''[[Porphyra]]'', ''[[Durvillaea antarctica]]'', and ''[[Ulva lactuca]]'' were part of the Inca diet and could be eaten fresh or dried. Some freshwater algae and blue algae of the genus ''[[Nostoc]]'' were eaten raw or processed for storage. In post-colonial times it has been used to make a dessert by boiling it in sugar. [[Pepino]], a refreshing and thirst-quenching fruit, was eaten by common folk, but scorned by \"pampered folk\" and were considered difficult to digest.<ref>Coe pp. 181-190</ref> Another fruit that was available to the Incas was the [[passion fruit]] (''Passiflora spp.'') which was actually named so by the Spanish conquistadors and explorers due to the claim that the flowers of the plan contained the symbols of the passion of Christ. The fruit itself is like a [[pomegranate]] as they both have a mass of seeds covered by juicy flesh. A fruit that was described as an interesting snack available in the Andes during the time of Inca Empire was the paqay (''[[Inga feuillei]]''), or the ''guaba'', which was known for it sweet, spongey substance that covers it seeds.<ref>Coe p. 188</ref> A lesser valued fruit within Inca cuisine was the ''[[lucuma]]'' (''Lucuma bifera'') which was difficult to consume and had little flavor. Opposite to the lucuma in popularity, due to their tender texture and the sweet juice they produce, were the almonds within ''[[Caryocar amygdaliferum]]'' of the [[Chachapoya culture|Chachapoyas]]. They were luxury goods for many generations as many have been found within early tombs of the region. The various fruits and vegetables of the Incas allowed for a diversity in flavor to be introduced to the world when the Spanish explored South America, creating so many new possibilities for those in the world of the culinary arts.\n\n===Meats===\n[[Image:Roast Guinea Pig.jpg|thumb|Two modern [[Peru]]vian dishes of cuy meat]]\nPeoples of the [[Altiplano]] had two large domesticated animals: [[llama]]s and [[alpaca]]s. They were kept for their wool and used as pack animals that were often used in large caravans. The llama in particular was highly valued, and a white llama adorned in red cloth with gold earrings would often go before the Inca ruler as a royal symbol. Animals were believed to represent various gods depending on what color they had and were sacrificed in great number and the blood was used as a ritual anointment. The control over the sacred animals was very rigorous. Shepherds had to preserve every last part of any animal that died and present a full animal to the Inca or risk severe punishment. Among the food products made from the Peruvian camelids was ''sharqui'', strips of freeze-dried meat, the origin of modern-day [[jerky (food)|jerky]]. Another meat for royalty was that of the lizards known as ''[[Dicrodon holmbergi]]''. It would be trapped as it attempted to consume the pods of ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]''. After being trapped, it would be paralyzed and cooked until it was easily skinned. Afterwards, it was cooked for another cooked for another ten minutes in heated sand and ashes then gutted, thus making it to be consumed immediately or preserved for up to a year.<ref>Coe pp. 213</ref> The meat of the common folk was the ''cuy'', [[guinea pig]]. They were domesticated by 2000 BC and were easy to keep and multiplied rapidly. Guinea pigs were often cooked by stuffing them with hot stones. The entrails would often be used as an ingredient in soups along with potatoes, or made into a sauce. They could also be used for divination, which later brought them into disfavor by the Catholic Church.<ref>Coe p. 171-175</ref>\n\nThe Incas hunted game including the wild [[camelid]]s [[vicu\u00f1a]] and [[guanaco]], [[whitetail deer]], [[huemul deer]] and [[viscacha]], a kind of [[chinchilla]] which was hunted with [[Lasso|lassos]]. Hunting rights were controlled by the state and any meat would go into the state warehouses for storage. In massive royal hunts, hunting teams would force huge herds into enclosures, and there are reports of several thousand animals being caught in a single great hunt, including puma, bear, fox and deer.<ref>Coe p. 176-7</ref>\n\nOne mainstay of the Inca army and the general population was dried fish. [[Limpet]]s, [[skate (fish)|skate]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]], small sharks of the genus ''[[Mustelus]]'', mullets and [[bonito]] were among the fish caught off the Peruvian coast. Other sea creatures like [[seabird]]s, [[penguin]]s, [[sea lion]]s and [[dolphin]]s were eaten, as were various [[crustacean]]s and [[chiton]]s, mussels, ''chanque'' (an [[abalone]]-like animal). Like other American peoples, the Inca ate animals that were often considered vermin by many Europeans, such as frogs, [[caterpillar]]s, [[beetles]], and [[ant]]s. [[Mayfly]] larvae were eaten raw or toasted and ground to make loaves that could then be stored.<ref>Coe p. 177-8</ref> The power of the Inca Empire was mighty and one of the most impressive and the advocation for storage and preservation of foods is one of the many factors that allowed for such success.\n\n==Food preparation==\nCooking was often done by putting hot stones in cooking vessels<ref>Coe p. 175</ref> and there was extensive use of the ''[[huatia]]'', a type of [[earth oven]] and the [[paila]], an earthenware bowl.\n\nThe Inca often got through times of food shortage because they were able to preserve and store many of their crops. It is estimated that at any given time in Incan history, there were three to seven years worth of food in the state warehouses. In the high elevations of the Andes, the Inca people would begin the process of making [[chu\u00f1o]] by setting out potatoes and similar tubers out in the dry days and cold nights would [[Freeze-drying|freeze-dry]] them in a matter of days. The farmers would help the process by covering the crops to protect them from dew, and by stomping on them to release the excess water quickly. This tradition has carried on through generations as the [[Q\u2019ero]] people of Peru make ''chu\u00f1o'' a staple of their diet to survive in the harsh environment of the highlands that they call home.\n\nIn addition to fruits, vegetables and roots, the Inca also preserved meat by [[food drying|drying]] and [[salting (food)|salting it]], making for complete nutritional stores. The English word [[jerky]] comes from the Quechua term ''ch'arki'', used to primarily to refer to the sun-dried meat of the [[llama]]. For the preparation of the meats within Inca cuisine, a popular and efficient method was to dry various fish and meats. They would dry these meats for storage in the warehouse of the Inca Empire by various methods of food drying, including allowing the meats to dry by sunlight or, especially in the highlands, by [[freeze-drying]].<ref>Coe p. 179</ref>\n\nThese food preservation techniques, combined with their far-reaching road system, allowed the Inca Empire to withstand droughts and to have the means to feed a standing army.<ref>Popenoe et al. 1989</ref> To reward such feats, the Inca empire practiced the ritual use of ''chicha''. ''Chicha'' can be made from a variety of ingredients depending on the region and/or nation and can come in a variety of came come in a variety of colors such as red, yellow, or even gray. The type of ''chicha'' that was held with high esteem amongst the Incas was the ''chicha'' made with maize. An extremely potent form of this type of ''chicha'' is known as ''sora'', which is prepared in differing ways such as burying the maize in the ground until sprout or chewing the maize. Whichever it way it was done, the maize would then be cooked and strained through cloth with clean water making a brew of ''chicha''.<ref>Coe p. 204</ref> After the brewing process and the chicha was ready for consumption, it would consumed in vessels that made of varying materials such silver and gold. However, perhaps the most interesting were the ones made of wood known as ''keros'', which often have elaborate designs and bold colors. Quinoa, a staple plant of the Incas, was used in various ways. The leaves were often used for stews and soups. Quinoa was also used as a substitute maize in the production of ''chicha''. The seeds were often toasted then pulverized to make various types of bread.<ref>Coe p. 182</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Cuisine of Peru}}\n* [[Peruvian cuisine]]\n* [[Bolivian cuisine]]\n* [[Chilean cuisine]]\n* [[Ecuadorian cuisine]]\n* [[Muisca cuisine]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Coe, Sophie D.

In a mountainous region of the country, a pickup truck is stopped at a police checkpoint overseen by the upwardly mobile Sgt. Agustin Rejas, a [[Quechuan languages|Quechua speaker]] and former [[corporate lawyer]]. Rejas grows suspicious of the truck\u2019s occupants and interrogates their leader, who claims to be a laborer. While Rejas is momentarily distracted, a corrupt subordinate solicits a bribe and allows the party to escape.\n\nMonths later, the opposition candidate has won the presidency. Rejas has been promoted to [[lieutenant]] and resides in the capital with his wife and daughter. Struggling to make ends meet on a police salary, Rejas visits his daughter\u2019s [[ballet]] teacher, Yolanda, to pay a long-overdue bill. Rejas strikes up a friendship with Yolanda. Increasingly bored of his wife\u2019s social ambitions and self-centeredness, Rejas develops romantic feelings for Yolanda, and the two begin a passionate but ultimately non-sexual affair.\n\nWhile working a security detail at a diplomatic reception, Rejas is recognized by lawyer Tristan Calderon, a shadowy figure with ties to [[narcotics traffickers]] and the new presidential administration. Meanwhile, Rejas and his subordinate Sucre discover a series of dead dogs hanging from lampposts, all affixed with placards referencing Maoist ideology and a \u201cPresident Ezequiel.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the name Ezequiel is invoked during a suicide bombing in the capital.\n\nFearing that political instability will invite democratic backsliding, the chief of police promotes Rejas to captain and tasks him with investigating Ezequiel within the bounds of judicial process. Rejas and his team determine that Ezequiel is the ''nom de guerre'' of a [[Maoist]] terrorist leader responsible for a series of atrocities committed in the country's mountains, which were overlooked due to a breakdown in central authority toward the end of military rule. Rejas quickly identifies a prime suspect: Edgardo Rivas, a former academic who considers himself the \u201cfourth flame of Communism.\u201d Rejas recognizes Rivas as the purported laborer he interrogated at the police checkpoint in the mountains. Ezequiel wages a terror campaign in the capital, and after two senior officials are assassinated, Calderon, now the president\u2019s chief adviser, imposes martial law. The Ezequiel investigation is transferred to a military death squad. When Rejas protests, Calderon allows his investigation to continue, but with military oversight.\n\nRejas and his investigators locate a videotape that confirms Ezequiel\u2019s identity as Rivas and suggests that his hideout is located on one of two residential streets in the capital. Rejas conceals this discovery from Calderon, allowing the police to bring the investigation to a close without military interference. After an exhaustive investigation, his team locates Rivas\u2019 hideout in an upper level of the building housing Yolanda\u2019s ballet studio. Rejas succeeds in apprehending Rivas and his associates without bloodshed, but learns, to his astonishment, that Yolanda is one of Rivas\u2019 operatives.\n\nRejas ensures that the Ezequiel suspects receive [[due process]], becoming a hero to the political opposition and a plausible contender for the presidency. Meanwhile, Rivas, Yolanda, and their associates are sentenced to life imprisonment under harsh conditions. Rejas meets with Calderon and offers to refrain from a presidential candidacy in exchange for the commutation of Yolanda\u2019s sentence. Calderon agrees to the deal and informs Rejas that, to save face, the president will soon appoint him to a judgeship. Before departing, he marvels at Rejas\u2019 willingness to turn down the presidency, revealing a letter from Yolanda in which she permanently rejects Rejas.

The first Italian establishment in the area was the purchase of  [[Assab]] by the [[Societ\u00e0 di Navigazione Rubattino|Rubattino Shipping Company]] in 1869, which came under government control in 1882. Occupation of [[Massawa]] in 1885 and the subsequent [[Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889|expansion of territory]] would gradually engulf the region and in 1889 borders with the [[Ethiopian Empire]] were defined in the [[Treaty of Wuchale]]. In 1890 the Colony of Eritrea ({{lang-it|Colonia Eritrea}}) was officially founded.\n\nIn 1936, the region was integrated into [[Italian East Africa]] as the [[Eritrea Governorate]]. This would last until Italy's loss of the region in 1941, during the [[East African campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]] of [[World War II]]. Italian Eritrea then came under [[#British Military Administration and the end of the colony|British military administration]], which in 1951 fell under [[United Nations]] supervision. In September 1952 it became an [[Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea|an autonomous part of Ethiopia.]]\n\n==History==\n===Acquisition of Assab and creation of the colony===\n{{see also|Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889}}\n{{History of Eritrea}}\nThe leading figure of the early history of Italian enterprises in the [[Red Sea]] was Giuseppe Sapeto. When a young monk, preparing himself in Cairo for missionary work, he had been dispatched in 1837 into [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. Afterward, he became an active advocate of European penetration, initially encouraging the French to establish themselves in the area. After 1866, following the political unification of Italy, he sought to develop Italian influence instead. As the [[Suez Canal]] neared completion, he began to visualize the establishment of a coaling station and port of call for Italian steamships in the Red Sea. Sapeto won over the Italian minister for foreign affairs, and [[King Victor Emmanuel II]], to whom he explained his ideas.\n[[File:Assab 1880.jpg|thumb|left|Italian settlement at Assab, 1880]]\nIn the autumn of 1869 he,  together with [[Alfredo Acton|Admiral Acton]], was sent by the government to the Red Sea to choose a suitable port and arrange for its sale. This he did by paying a small deposit to the [[Afar people|Danakil]] chiefs at Assab Bay in return for their promise to sell their territory to him on his return. Meanwhile, the government had been in touch with [[Raffaele Rubattino]], whose company was planning to establish a steamship line through the newly opened Suez Canal and the Red Sea to India. It was agreed that the company would buy the territory in its own name and with its own funds, but should undertake to use it in the national interest. Sapeto returned to the Red Sea on behalf of the company, completed the purchase and bought more land to the south.\n\nBy March 1870, an Italian shipping company had thus become claimant to territory at the northern end of Assab Bay, a deserted but spacious bay about half-way between Annesley Bay to the north and Obock to the South.<ref>Agatha Ramm, \"Great Britain and the Planting of Italian Power in the Red Sea, 1868-1885\", ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 59, No. 234 (May, 1944), p. 214\u2013215.</ref> However, the area, \u2014 which had been long dominated by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]]<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Egypt/3 History |display=Egypt: Section III: History |volume=9 |page=90\u2013119}}</ref>\u2014 was not settled by the Italians until 1880.<ref name=EBAb>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Eritrea |volume=9 |page=747}}</ref> Two years later, Italy formally took possession of the nascent colony from its commercial owners.\n\nMost of the western coast of the Red Sea was then formally claimed by the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] (under the notional rule of the [[Ottoman Turkish Empire]], who held the eastern coast) but the region was thrown into chaos by major Egyptian defeats in the [[Ethio-Egyptian War]] and by the success of [[Muhammad Ahmad|the Mahdi]]'s uprising in the [[Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]]. In 1884, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Hewett Treaty|Hewett&nbsp;Treaty]] promised the [[Bogos]]\u2014the [[Eritrean Highlands|highlands]] of modern [[Eritrea]]\u2014and free access to the [[Massawa]]n coast to [[emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV]] in exchange for his help evacuating garrisons from the Sudan;<ref>Wylde, Augustus B.

Ignoring their treaty with Ethiopia, they openly encouraged Italy to expand north into [[Massawa]], which was taken without a shot from its Egyptian garrison.

His subsequent victory over his rival kings and enthronement as [[emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelek&nbsp;II]] (r.&nbsp;1889&ndash;1913) made the treaty formally binding upon the entire country.\n\nOnce established, however, Menelik took a dim view towards Italian involvement with local leaders in his northern province of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]];<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia |volume=1 |page=94}}</ref> while the Italians, for their part, felt bound to involvement given the regular Tigrayan raiding of tribes within their colony's protectorate<ref name=EBE/> and the Tigrayan leaders themselves continued to claim the provinces now held by Italy. Negotiations with the French over a [[Imperial Ethiopian Railway|railway]] brought things to a head: the [[Italian language|Italian]]{{mdash}}but ''not'' [[Amharic language|Amharic]]{{mdash}}version of the Treaty of Wuchale had prohibited Ethiopia with foreign negotiations except through Italy, effectively making the realm an Italian [[protectorate]]. Secure both domestically and militarily (thanks to arms shipments via [[French Third Republic|French]] [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]] and [[Harar]]), Menelik denounced the treaty in whole and the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War|ensuing war]], culminating in Italy's disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Adwa|Adwa]], ended their hopes of annexing Ethiopia for a time.\n\nDuring the late twentieth century Assab would become [[Ethiopia]]'s main port, but it was long overshadowed by nearby [[Djibouti]], whose [[Imperial Ethiopian Railway|railway]] (completed to [[Dire Dawa|Dire&nbsp;Dawa]] in 1902) permitted it to quickly supplant traditional [[Caravan route|caravan]]-based routes to [[Assab]]<ref name=EBE/> and [[Zeila]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia |display=Abyssinia: Trade and Currency |volume=1 |page=87}}</ref><ref name=EBZ>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Zaila |volume=28 |page=950}}</ref><ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Somaliland#French Somaliland |display=Somaliland: French Somaliland |volume=25 |pages=382\u2013383}}</ref> [[Massawa]] remained the primary port for most of northern Ethiopia, but its relatively high customs dues, dependence on caravans, and political antagonism limited the volume on its trade with Ethiopia.<ref name=EBE>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Eritrea#Trade |display=Eritrea: Agriculture and Trade|volume=9 |page=746}}</ref>\n\nSeeking to develop their own lands, the Italian government launched the first development projects in the new colony in the late 1880s.

In the year 1939, there were around 2,198 factories and most of the employees were Eritrean citizens, some even moved from the villages to work in the factories.The establishment of industries also made an increase in the number of both Italians and Eritreans residing in the cities. The number of Italians residing in the country increased from 4,600 to 75,000 in five years; and with the involvement of Eritreans in the industries, trade and fruit plantation was expanded across the nation, while some of the plantations were owned by Eritreans''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shabait.com/about-eritrea/history-a-culture/450-italian-administration-in-eritrea|title=Italian administration in Eritrea -|first=shabait|last=Administrator|date=|website=www.shabait.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nThe capital of Eritrea experienced a huge increase in population: in 1935 there were only 4,000 Italians and 12,000 Eritreans; in 1938 there were 48,000 Italians and 36,000 Eritreans.

In the area of Asmara, there were in 1940 more than 2,000 small and medium-sized industrial companies, which were concentrated in the areas of construction, mechanics, textiles, food processing and electricity.

Furthermore, because of the Italian architecture of the city, Asmara was called ''Piccola Roma'' (Little Rome).<ref>[http://www.fedoa.unina.it/1881/01/Santoianni_Progettazione_Architettonica.pdf Italian architectural planification of Asmara (in Italian) p. 64-66]</ref> The total number of Italians in all of Eritrea was 75,000 in that year.<ref>[http://www.maitacli.it/arg_menu/italiani/elenco.htm Italians in 1939 Eritrea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220153314/http://www.maitacli.it/arg_menu/italiani/elenco.htm |date=2009-02-20 }}</ref>\n[[File:Asmarapalazzodelgovernatore.png|thumb|right|Governor's Palace, built in 1940 (current Presidential Palace)]]\nAsmara was known to be an exceptionally modern city, not only because of its architecture, but Asmara also had more traffic lights than Rome did when the city was being built. The city incorporates many features of a planned city. Indeed, Asmara was an early example of an ideal modern city created by architects, an idea which was introduced into many cities across the world, such as [[Brasilia]], but which was not altogether popular. Features include designated city zoning and planning, wide treed boulevards, political areas and districts and space and scope for development. Asmara was not built for the Eritreans however; the Italians built it primarily for themselves and made the city a typical Italian city with even its own car race (called the [[Asmara circuit]]).\n\nThe city has been regarded as \"New Rome\" due to its quintessential Italian touch, not only for the architecture but also for the wide streets, piazzas and coffee bars. While the boulevards are lined with palms and indigenous ''shiba'kha'' trees, there are numerable [[pizza|pizzerias]] and coffee bars, serving cappuccinos and lattes, as well as [[ice cream]] parlours.\n\nMany industrial investments were endorsed by the Italians in the area of Asmara and [[Italian Massaua|Massawa]], but the beginning of [[World War II]] stopped the blossoming industrialization of Eritrea.<ref>[http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm Italian industries and companies in Eritrea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429102012/http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm |date=2009-04-29 }}</ref>\n\n===British Military Administration and the end of the colony===\n{{Infobox country\n| conventional_long_name                = British Military Administration in Eritrea\n| image_flag                = Flag of the United Kingdom.svg\n| flag_caption                = Flag\n| government_type                = {{nowrap|[[United Kingdom|British]] [[military administration]]}}\n| currency                = [[Pound sterling|pound]]\n| life_span              = 1941-1952\n|event_start         = [[East African campaign (World War II)|Established]]\n|date_start          = 19 May 1941\n|event1              = [[United Nations|UN]] supervision\n|date_event1         = 19 February 1951\n|event_end           = {{nowrap|[[Eritrean Autonomous State]]}}\n|year_end            = 15 September 1952\n|title_leader           = {{nowrap|[[List of colonial governors of Italian Eritrea|Administrator]]}}\n|leader1              = [[William Platt]]\n|year_leader1         = {{nowrap|1941&ndash;1942 <small>(first)</small>}}\n|leader2              = [[Duncan Cameron Cumming|Duncan Cumming]]\n|year_leader2         = 1951&ndash;1952 <small>(last)</small>\n|title_representative = {{nowrap|[[United Nations|UN]] [[List of colonial governors of Italian Eritrea|High Commissioner]]}}\n|representative1      = [[Eduardo Anze Matienzo]]\n|year_representative1 = 1951&ndash;1952\n| p1                = Italian East Africa\n| s1                = Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea\n| flag_p1                = Flag of Italy (1861-1946) crowned.svg\n| flag_s1                = Flag of Eritrea (1952-1961).svg\n}}\nWhen the British army [[East African Campaign (World War II)|conquered Eritrea]] in January 1941, most of the infrastructure and the industrial areas were extremely damaged and the remaining ones (like the Asmara-Massawa Cableway) were successively removed and sent toward India and British possessions in Africa as a war booty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ftz_gtO-pngC&pg=PA490&lpg=PA490&dq=eritrea+italian+colony+1882+1941&source=web&ots=IuwHpljurX&sig=cW8fP4OVx1_ppGWnfY2ilmYoknw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result|title=Encyclopedia of African History: A - G.. 1|author=|date=8 April 2018|publisher=Taylor & Francis|accessdate=8 April 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe following [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|Italian guerrilla war]] was supported by many Eritrean colonial troops (like the \"hero\" of Eritrean independence, [[Hamid Idris Awate]]) <ref>Rosselli, Alberto.

Eritrea was placed under [[British Empire|British]] military administration after the Italian surrender in [[World War II]].\n\nThe Italians in Eritrea started to move away from the country after the defeat of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], and by the time of the British census of 1949 Asmara had only 17,183 Italian Eritreans of a total population of 127,579. Most Italian settlers left for Italy, with others to United States, Middle East, and Australia.\n\nThe British maintained initially the Italian administration of Eritrea, but the country soon started to be involved in a violent process of independence (from the British in the late forties and after 1952 from the Ethiopians, who annexed Eritrea in that year).\n\nDuring the last years of [[World War II]] some Italian Eritreans like Dr. [[Vincenzo DiMeglio|Vincenzo Di Meglio]] defended politically the presence of Italians in Eritrea and successively promoted the independence of Eritrea.<ref>Franco Bandini. ''Gli italiani in Africa, storia delle guerre coloniali 1882-1943'' p. 67</ref> He went to [[Rome]] to participate in a Conference for the independence of Eritrea, promoted by the Vatican.\n\nAfter the war Di Meglio was named Director of the \"Comitato Rappresentativo Italiani dell' Eritrea\" (CRIE). In 1947  he supported the creation of the ''\"Associazione Italo-Eritrei\"'' and the ''\"Associazione Veterani Ascari\"'', in order to get alliance with the Eritreans favorable to [[Italy]] in Eritrea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilcornodafrica.it/st-sci03.htm|title=Nuova pagina 1|author=|date=|website=www.ilcornodafrica.it|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of these creations, he cofounded the ''\"Partito Eritrea Pro Italia\"'' (Party of Shara Italy) in September 1947, an Eritrean political Party favorable to the Italian presence in Eritrea that obtained more than 200,000 inscriptions of membership in one single month.\n\nIndeed, the Italian Eritreans strongly rejected the [[Ethiopia]]n annexation of Eritrea after the war: the \"Party of Shara Italy\" was established in Asmara in 1947 and the majority of the members were former Italian soldiers with many [[Eritrean Ascari]] (the organization was even backed up by the government of Italy).\n\nThe main objective of this party was Eritrean freedom, but they had a pre-condition that stated that before independence the country should be governed by Italy for at least 15 years.\n\nWith the Peace Treaty of 1947  [[Italy]] officially accepted the end of the colony. As a consequence the Italian community started to disappear, mainly after the [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopian]]n government took control of Eritrea.\n\nHowever some Italo-Eritrean were welcomed by the Ethiopian government, like the brothers [[Italo Vassalo]] and [[Luciano Vassalo]], champions of football who won the [[1962 African Cup of Nations]].\n\n[[File:IndipendenzaEritrea.png|thumb|200px|right|Vincenzo di Meglio (second from right) at the 1949 Conference for Eritrean independence in the Vatican]]\n[[File:Asmara-Panorama 3.jpeg|thumb|right|Modern downtown Asmara, called ''Piccola Roma'', featuring Italian-style buildings]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Eritrea}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Italian Eritreans]]\n* [[Italian Colonial Empire]]\n* [[Eritrea Governorate]]\n* [[Asmara, Eritrea|Italian Asmara]]\n* [[Cinema Impero]]\n* [[Asmara President's Office]]\n* [[Fiat Tagliero Building]]\n* [[David DiMeglio|Vincenzo Di Meglio]]\n* [[Eritrean Ascari]]\n* [[Roman Catholicism in Eritrea]]\n* [[Linea dell'Impero]]\n* [[Asmara circuit]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col}}\n* {{citation |publisher= Ministry of Foreign Affairs |author=[[Archivio Storico Diplomatico]] |location=Rome |url=http://www.esteri.it/mae/it/ministero/servizi/uapsds/storico_diplom/inventarionline.html |language=it |title= Inventario dell'Archivio Storico del Ministero Africa Italiana |volume=1: Eritrea, Etiopia, Somalia (1857-1939) |year= 1975 }} \n* {{citation |publisher= Ministry of Foreign Affairs |author=Archivio Storico Diplomatico |location=Rome |url=http://www.esteri.it/mae/it/ministero/servizi/uapsds/storico_diplom/inventarionline.html |language=it |title= Inventario dell'Archivio Eritrea (1880-1945) |year= 1977 }}\n* Bandini, Franco.

The first Italian establishment in the area was the purchase of  [[Assab]] by the [[Societ\u00e0 di Navigazione Rubattino|Rubattino Shipping Company]] in 1869, which came under government control in 1882. Occupation of [[Massawa]] in 1885 and the subsequent [[Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889|expansion of territory]] would gradually engulf the region and in 1889 borders with the [[Ethiopian Empire]] were defined in the [[Treaty of Wuchale]]. In 1890 the Colony of Eritrea ({{lang-it|Colonia Eritrea}}) was officially founded.\n\nIn 1936, the region was integrated into [[Italian East Africa]] as the [[Eritrea Governorate]]. This would last until Italy's loss of the region in 1941, during the [[East African campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]] of [[World War II]]. Italian Eritrea then came under [[#British Military Administration and the end of the colony|British military administration]], which in 1951 fell under [[United Nations]] supervision. In September 1952 it became an [[Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea|an autonomous part of Ethiopia.]]\n\n==History==\n===Acquisition of Assab and creation of the colony===\n{{see also|Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889}}\n{{History of Eritrea}}\nThe leading figure of the early history of Italian enterprises in the [[Red Sea]] was Giuseppe Sapeto. When a young monk, preparing himself in Cairo for missionary work, he had been dispatched in 1837 into [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. Afterward, he became an active advocate of European penetration, initially encouraging the French to establish themselves in the area. After 1866, following the political unification of Italy, he sought to develop Italian influence instead. As the [[Suez Canal]] neared completion, he began to visualize the establishment of a coaling station and port of call for Italian steamships in the Red Sea. Sapeto won over the Italian minister for foreign affairs, and [[King Victor Emmanuel II]], to whom he explained his ideas.\n[[File:Assab 1880.jpg|thumb|left|Italian settlement at Assab, 1880]]\nIn the autumn of 1869 he,  together with [[Alfredo Acton|Admiral Acton]], was sent by the government to the Red Sea to choose a suitable port and arrange for its sale. This he did by paying a small deposit to the [[Afar people|Danakil]] chiefs at Assab Bay in return for their promise to sell their territory to him on his return. Meanwhile, the government had been in touch with [[Raffaele Rubattino]], whose company was planning to establish a steamship line through the newly opened Suez Canal and the Red Sea to India. It was agreed that the company would buy the territory in its own name and with its own funds, but should undertake to use it in the national interest. Sapeto returned to the Red Sea on behalf of the company, completed the purchase and bought more land to the south.\n\nBy March 1870, an Italian shipping company had thus become claimant to territory at the northern end of Assab Bay, a deserted but spacious bay about half-way between Annesley Bay to the north and Obock to the South.<ref>Agatha Ramm, \"Great Britain and the Planting of Italian Power in the Red Sea, 1868-1885\", ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 59, No. 234 (May, 1944), p. 214\u2013215.</ref> However, the area, \u2014 which had been long dominated by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]]<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Egypt/3 History |display=Egypt: Section III: History |volume=9 |page=90\u2013119}}</ref>\u2014 was not settled by the Italians until 1880.<ref name=EBAb>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Eritrea |volume=9 |page=747}}</ref> Two years later, Italy formally took possession of the nascent colony from its commercial owners.\n\nMost of the western coast of the Red Sea was then formally claimed by the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] (under the notional rule of the [[Ottoman Turkish Empire]], who held the eastern coast) but the region was thrown into chaos by major Egyptian defeats in the [[Ethio-Egyptian War]] and by the success of [[Muhammad Ahmad|the Mahdi]]'s uprising in the [[Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]]. In 1884, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Hewett Treaty|Hewett&nbsp;Treaty]] promised the [[Bogos]]\u2014the [[Eritrean Highlands|highlands]] of modern [[Eritrea]]\u2014and free access to the [[Massawa]]n coast to [[emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV]] in exchange for his help evacuating garrisons from the Sudan;<ref>Wylde, Augustus B.

His subsequent victory over his rival kings and enthronement as [[emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelek&nbsp;II]] (r.&nbsp;1889&ndash;1913) made the treaty formally binding upon the entire country.\n\nOnce established, however, Menelik took a dim view towards Italian involvement with local leaders in his northern province of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]];<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia |volume=1 |page=94}}</ref> while the Italians, for their part, felt bound to involvement given the regular Tigrayan raiding of tribes within their colony's protectorate<ref name=EBE/> and the Tigrayan leaders themselves continued to claim the provinces now held by Italy. Negotiations with the French over a [[Imperial Ethiopian Railway|railway]] brought things to a head: the [[Italian language|Italian]]{{mdash}}but ''not'' [[Amharic language|Amharic]]{{mdash}}version of the Treaty of Wuchale had prohibited Ethiopia with foreign negotiations except through Italy, effectively making the realm an Italian [[protectorate]]. Secure both domestically and militarily (thanks to arms shipments via [[French Third Republic|French]] [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]] and [[Harar]]), Menelik denounced the treaty in whole and the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War|ensuing war]], culminating in Italy's disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Adwa|Adwa]], ended their hopes of annexing Ethiopia for a time.\n\nDuring the late twentieth century Assab would become [[Ethiopia]]'s main port, but it was long overshadowed by nearby [[Djibouti]], whose [[Imperial Ethiopian Railway|railway]] (completed to [[Dire Dawa|Dire&nbsp;Dawa]] in 1902) permitted it to quickly supplant traditional [[Caravan route|caravan]]-based routes to [[Assab]]<ref name=EBE/> and [[Zeila]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia |display=Abyssinia: Trade and Currency |volume=1 |page=87}}</ref><ref name=EBZ>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Zaila |volume=28 |page=950}}</ref><ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Somaliland#French Somaliland |display=Somaliland: French Somaliland |volume=25 |pages=382\u2013383}}</ref> [[Massawa]] remained the primary port for most of northern Ethiopia, but its relatively high customs dues, dependence on caravans, and political antagonism limited the volume on its trade with Ethiopia.<ref name=EBE>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Eritrea#Trade |display=Eritrea: Agriculture and Trade|volume=9 |page=746}}</ref>\n\nSeeking to develop their own lands, the Italian government launched the first development projects in the new colony in the late 1880s.

In the year 1939, there were around 2,198 factories and most of the employees were Eritrean citizens, some even moved from the villages to work in the factories.The establishment of industries also made an increase in the number of both Italians and Eritreans residing in the cities.

The city incorporates many features of a planned city. Indeed, Asmara was an early example of an ideal modern city created by architects, an idea which was introduced into many cities across the world, such as [[Brasilia]], but which was not altogether popular. Features include designated city zoning and planning, wide treed boulevards, political areas and districts and space and scope for development. Asmara was not built for the Eritreans however; the Italians built it primarily for themselves and made the city a typical Italian city with even its own car race (called the [[Asmara circuit]]).\n\nThe city has been regarded as \"New Rome\" due to its quintessential Italian touch, not only for the architecture but also for the wide streets, piazzas and coffee bars. While the boulevards are lined with palms and indigenous ''shiba'kha'' trees, there are numerable [[pizza|pizzerias]] and coffee bars, serving cappuccinos and lattes, as well as [[ice cream]] parlours.\n\nMany industrial investments were endorsed by the Italians in the area of Asmara and [[Italian Massaua|Massawa]], but the beginning of [[World War II]] stopped the blossoming industrialization of Eritrea.<ref>[http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm Italian industries and companies in Eritrea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429102012/http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm |date=2009-04-29 }}</ref>\n\n===British Military Administration and the end of the colony===\n{{Infobox country\n| conventional_long_name                = British Military Administration in Eritrea\n| image_flag                = Flag of the United Kingdom.svg\n| flag_caption                = Flag\n| government_type                = {{nowrap|[[United Kingdom|British]] [[military administration]]}}\n| currency                = [[pound]]\n| life_span              = 1941-1952\n|event_start         = [[East African campaign (World War II)|Established]]\n|date_start          = 19 May 1941\n|event1              = [[United Nations|UN]] supervision\n|date_event1         = 19 February 1951\n|event_end           = {{nowrap|[[Eritrean Autonomous State]]}}\n|year_end            = 15 September 1952\n|title_leader           = {{nowrap|[[List of colonial governors of Italian Eritrea|Administrator]]}}\n|leader1              = [[William Platt]]\n|year_leader1         = {{nowrap|1941&ndash;1942 <small>(first)</small>}}\n|leader2              = [[Duncan Cameron Cumming|Duncan Cumming]]\n|year_leader2         = 1951&ndash;1952 <small>(last)</small>\n|title_representative = {{nowrap|[[United Nations|UN]] [[List of colonial governors of Italian Eritrea|High Commissioner]]}}\n|representative1      = [[Eduardo Anze Matienzo]]\n|year_representative1 = 1951&ndash;1952\n| p1                = Italian East Africa\n| s1                = Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea\n| flag_p1                = Flag of Italy (1861-1946) crowned.svg\n| flag_s1                = Flag of Eritrea (1952-1961).svg\n}}\nWhen the British army [[East African Campaign (World War II)|conquered Eritrea]] in January 1941, most of the infrastructure and the industrial areas were extremely damaged and the remaining ones (like the Asmara-Massawa Cableway) were successively removed and sent toward India and British possessions in Africa as a war booty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ftz_gtO-pngC&pg=PA490&lpg=PA490&dq=eritrea+italian+colony+1882+1941&source=web&ots=IuwHpljurX&sig=cW8fP4OVx1_ppGWnfY2ilmYoknw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result|title=Encyclopedia of African History: A - G.. 1|author=|date=8 April 2018|publisher=Taylor & Francis|accessdate=8 April 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe following [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|Italian guerrilla war]] was supported by many Eritrean colonial troops (like the \"hero\" of Eritrean independence, [[Hamid Idris Awate]]) <ref>Rosselli, Alberto.

Most Italian settlers left for Italy, with others to United States, Middle East, and Australia.\n\nThe British maintained initially the Italian administration of Eritrea, but the country soon started to be involved in a violent process of independence (from the British in the late forties and after 1952 from the Ethiopians, who annexed Eritrea in that year).\n\nDuring the last years of [[World War II]] some Italian Eritreans like Dr. [[Vincenzo DiMeglio|Vincenzo Di Meglio]] defended politically the presence of Italians in Eritrea and successively promoted the independence of Eritrea.<ref>Franco Bandini. ''Gli italiani in Africa, storia delle guerre coloniali 1882-1943'' p. 67</ref> He went to [[Rome]] to participate in a Conference for the independence of Eritrea, promoted by the Vatican.\n\nAfter the war Di Meglio was named Director of the \"Comitato Rappresentativo Italiani dell' Eritrea\" (CRIE).

As a consequence the Italian community started to disappear, mainly after the [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopian]]n government took control of Eritrea.\n\nHowever some Italo-Eritrean were welcomed by the Ethiopian government, like the brothers [[Italo Vassalo]] and [[Luciano Vassalo]], champions of football who won the [[1962 African Cup of Nations]].\n\n[[File:IndipendenzaEritrea.png|thumb|200px|right|Vincenzo di Meglio (second from right) at the 1949 Conference for Eritrean independence in the Vatican]]\n[[File:Asmara-Panorama 3.jpeg|thumb|right|Modern downtown Asmara, called ''Piccola Roma'', featuring Italian-style buildings]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Eritrea}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Italian Eritreans]]\n* [[Italian Colonial Empire]]\n* [[Eritrea Governorate]]\n* [[Asmara, Eritrea|Italian Asmara]]\n* [[Cinema Impero]]\n* [[Asmara President's Office]]\n* [[Fiat Tagliero Building]]\n* [[David DiMeglio|Vincenzo Di Meglio]]\n* [[Eritrean Ascari]]\n* [[Roman Catholicism in Eritrea]]\n* [[Linea dell'Impero]]\n* [[Asmara circuit]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col}}\n* {{citation |publisher= Ministry of Foreign Affairs |author=[[Archivio Storico Diplomatico]] |location=Rome |url=http://www.esteri.it/mae/it/ministero/servizi/uapsds/storico_diplom/inventarionline.html |language=it |title= Inventario dell'Archivio Storico del Ministero Africa Italiana |volume=1: Eritrea, Etiopia, Somalia (1857-1939) |year= 1975 }} \n* {{citation |publisher= Ministry of Foreign Affairs |author=Archivio Storico Diplomatico |location=Rome |url=http://www.esteri.it/mae/it/ministero/servizi/uapsds/storico_diplom/inventarionline.html |language=it |title= Inventario dell'Archivio Eritrea (1880-1945) |year= 1977 }}\n* Bandini, Franco.

Both rulers had entered into the protectorate treaties to advance their own expansionist goals, with Sultan Kenadid looking to use Italy's support in his ongoing power struggle with Boqor Osman over the Majeerteen Sultanate, as well as in a separate conflict with the [[Hiraab]] Sultanate over an area to the north of [[Warsheikh]].
