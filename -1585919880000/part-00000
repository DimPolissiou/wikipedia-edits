C. | year=1956 |publisher=Eyre & Spottiswoode |location=London }}</ref><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> and were unable to affect the successful Allied invasion of Leyte.\n\n==Background==\nThe campaigns of August 1942 to early 1944 had driven Japanese forces from many of their island bases in the south and the central Pacific Ocean, while isolating many of their other bases (most notably in the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Admiralty Islands]], [[New Guinea]], [[Marshall Islands]], and [[Wake Island]]), and in June 1944, a series of American amphibious landings supported by the [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]]'s [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] captured most of the [[Mariana Islands]] (bypassing [[Rota (island)|Rota]]). This offensive breached Japan's strategic inner defense ring and gave the Americans a base from which long-range [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bombers could attack the Japanese home islands.\n\nThe Japanese counterattacked in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. The U.S. Navy destroyed three Japanese aircraft carriers, damaged other ships, and shot down approximately 600 Japanese aircraft, leaving the IJN with very little carrier-borne air power and few experienced pilots.<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/> However, the considerable land-based air power the Japanese had amassed in the Philippines was thought too dangerous to bypass by many high-ranking officers outside the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], including [[Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]]. \n\n===Formosa vs Philippines as invasion target===\nThe next logical step was to cut Japan's supply lines to Southeast Asia, depriving them of fuel and other necessities of war, but there were two different plans for doing so. Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Nimitz favored blockading Japanese forces in the Philippines and invading [[Taiwan|Formosa (Taiwan)]], while [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[Douglas MacArthur]], wanting to make good on his famous 1942 promise [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|\"I shall return\"]], championed an invasion of the Philippines.\n\nWhile Formosa could also serve as a base for an invasion of [[mainland China]], which MacArthur felt was unnecessary, it was also estimated that it would require about 12 divisions from the Army and [[the United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. Meanwhile, the entire Australian Army was engaged in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and on various other Pacific islands, so an invasion of Formosa would require much larger ground forces than were available in the Pacific in late 1944 until the defeat of Germany freed the necessary manpower.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\n===Decision to invade the Philippines===\nA meeting between MacArthur, Nimitz, and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] helped confirm the Philippines as a strategic target but did not reach a decision, and the debate continued for two months.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl=http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_21.htm| chapter= Chapter 21: Luzon Versus Formosa | last= Smith |first= Robert Ross | title = Command Decisions | url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_0.htm| publisher= [[United States Army Center of Military History]]| id = CMH Pub 70-7| year = 2000| origyear = 1960 | accessdate=8 December 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071230145455/http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_0.htm| archivedate= 30 December 2007 | url-status= live| quote= \"Meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a conference at Pearl Harbor in late July 1944, ... MacArthur then argued persuasively that it was both necessary and proper to take Luzon before going on to Formosa, while Nimitz expounded a plan for striking straight across the western Pacific to Formosa bypassing Luzon. Apparently, no decisions on strategy were reached at the Pearl Harbor conferences. The Formosa versus Luzon debate continued without let-up at the highest planning levels for over two months, and even the question of bypassing the Philippines entirely in favor of a direct move on Formosa again came up for serious discussion.\"}}</ref> Eventually Nimitz changed his mind and agreed to MacArthur's plan,<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> and it was eventually decided that MacArthur's forces would invade the island of [[Leyte]] in the central Philippines. Amphibious forces and close naval support would be provided by the Seventh Fleet, commanded by [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]].\n\n==Setup for the battle==\nThe Seventh Fleet at this time contained units of the U.S. Navy and the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. Before the major naval actions in Leyte Gulf had begun, {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} and {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48|6}} were severely damaged by air attacks; during the battle proper these two cruisers were retiring, escorted by {{HMAS|Warramunga|I44|6}}, for repairs at the major Allied base at [[Manus Island]], {{convert|1700|mi|km|sigfig=2}} away.\n\n===Lack of unified command structures===\nThe [[United States Third Fleet|U.S. 3rd Fleet]], commanded by Admiral [[William F. Halsey Jr.]], with [[Task Force 38]] (TF&nbsp;38, the Fast Carrier Task Force, commanded by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Marc Mitscher]]), as its main component would provide more distant cover and support for the invasion. A fundamental defect in this plan was there would be no single American naval admiral in overall command. Kinkaid fell under MacArthur as Supreme Allied Commander Southwest Pacific, whereas Halsey's Third Fleet reported to Nimitz as C-in-C Pacific Ocean Areas. This lack of [[unity of command]], along with failures in communication, was to produce a crisis and very nearly a strategic disaster for the American forces.<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> By coincidence, the Japanese plan, using three separate fleets, also lacked an overall commander.\n\n===Japanese plans===\nThe American options were apparent to the IJN. [[Combined Fleet]] Chief [[Soemu Toyoda]] prepared four \"victory\" plans: ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 1 ({{lang|ja|\u6377\uff11\u53f7\u4f5c\u6226}} ''{{lang|ja-Latn|Sh\u014d ichig\u014d sakusen}}'') was a major naval operation in the Philippines, while ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 2, ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 3 and ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 4 were responses to attacks on Formosa, the [[Ryukyu Islands]], and the [[Kurile Islands]], respectively. The plans were for complex offensive operations committing nearly all available forces to a decisive battle, despite substantially depleting Japan's slender reserves of fuel oil.\n\nOn 12 October 1944, Halsey began [[Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa|a series of carrier raids against Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands]] with a view to ensuring that the aircraft based there could not intervene in the Leyte landings. The Japanese command, therefore, put ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 2 into action launching waves of air attacks against Third Fleet's carriers. In what Morison refers to as a \"knock-down, drag-out fight between carrier-based and land-based air\", the Japanese were routed losing 600 aircraft in three days - almost their entire air strength in the region. Following the American invasion of the Philippines, the Japanese Navy made the transition to ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 1.<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\n''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 1 called for Vice Admiral [[Jisabur\u014d Ozawa]]'s ships\u2014known as the \"Northern Force\"\u2014to lure the main American covering forces away from Leyte. Northern Force would be built around several aircraft carriers, but these would have very few aircraft or trained aircrew. The carriers would serve as the main bait. As the U.S. covering forces were lured away, two other surface forces would advance on Leyte from the west. The \"Southern Force\" under Vice Admirals [[Shoji Nishimura]] and [[Kiyohide Shima]] would strike at the landing area via the Surigao Strait. The \"[[Leyte Gulf order of battle#Japanese Forces 2|Center Force]]\" under Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]\u2014by far the most powerful of the attacking forces\u2014would pass through the San Bernardino Strait into the Philippine Sea, turn southwards, and then also, attack the landing area.<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\n<blockquote>Should we lose in the Philippines operations, even though the fleet should be left, the shipping lane to the south would be completely cut off so that the fleet, if it should come back to Japanese waters, could not obtain its fuel supply. If it should remain in southern waters, it could not receive supplies of ammunition and arms. There would be no sense in saving the fleet at the expense of the loss of the Philippines.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/IJO/IJO-75.html United States Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific) \u2013 'Interrogations of Japanese Officials']</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Leyte map annotated.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The four main actions in the Battle of Leyte Gulf: 1 [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of the Sibuyan Sea (24 October)|Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]] 2 [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]] 3 [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Cape Enga\u00f1o (25\u201326 October)|Battle of (or 'off') Cape Enga\u00f1o]] 4 [[Battle off Samar]].

Admiral Kurita's force at anchor in [[Brunei]] (right).\n}}\nAs it sortied from its base in [[Brunei]], Kurita's powerful \"Center Force\" consisted of five battleships ({{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kong\u014d||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}}), ten heavy cruisers ({{Ship |Japanese cruiser|Atago||2}}, {{Ship |Japanese cruiser|Maya||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Takao|1930|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Ch\u014dkai||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|My\u014dk\u014d||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser |Haguro||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kumano||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Suzuya|1934|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tone|1937|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Chikuma|1938|2}}), two light cruisers ({{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Noshiro||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yahagi|1942|2}}) and 15 destroyers.<ref name=\"Morison1956\" />\n\nKurita's ships passed Palawan Island around midnight on 22\u201323 October. The American submarines {{USS|Darter|SS-227|2}} and {{USS|Dace|SS-247|2}} were positioned together on the surface close by. At 00:16 on 23 October, ''Darter''{{'}}s radar detected the Japanese formation at a range of {{convert |30000|yd|m| abbr =on}}. Her captain promptly made visual contact. The two submarines quickly moved off in pursuit of the ships, while ''Darter'' made the first of three contact reports. At least one of these was picked up by a radio operator on ''Yamato'', but Kurita failed to take appropriate antisubmarine precautions.<ref name = \"Morison1956\" />\n\n''Darter'' and ''Dace'' traveled on the surface at full power for several hours and gained a position ahead of Kurita's formation, with the intention of making a submerged attack at first light. This attack was unusually successful. At 05:24, ''Darter'' fired a salvo of six torpedoes, at least four of which hit Kurita's flagship, the heavy cruiser ''Atago''. Ten minutes later, ''Darter'' made two hits on ''Atago''{{'}}s [[sister ship]], ''Takao'', with another spread of torpedoes. At 05:56, ''Dace'' made four torpedo hits on the heavy cruiser ''Maya'' (sister to ''Atago'' and ''Takao'').<ref name = \"Morison1956\" />\n\n''Atago'' and ''Maya'' quickly sank.<ref name = \"TakaoClass\">{{cite web |first = Hiroshi |last = Nishida |url = http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0332.htm |title = Hashimoto, Shintaro |year = 2002 |work = Imperial Japanese Navy |access-date = 6 June 2011 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20130104063042/http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0332.htm |archive-date = 4 January 2013 |url-status = dead }}</ref> ''Atago'' sank so rapidly that Kurita was forced to swim to survive.

On 24 October, as the submarines continued to shadow the damaged cruiser, ''Darter'' ran aground on the Bombay Shoal. All efforts to get her off failed, she was abandoned; and her entire crew was rescued by ''Dace''. Efforts to scuttle ''Darter'' failed over the course of the next week, including torpedoes from ''Dace'' and {{USS|Rock||2}} that hit the reef (and not ''Darter'') and deck-gun shelling from ''Dace'' and later, {{USS|Nautilus|SS-168|2}}. After multiple hits from his [[6\"/53 caliber gun|6-inch deck guns]], the ''Nautilus'' commander determined on 31 October that the equipment on ''Darter'' was only good for scrap and left her there. The Japanese did not bother with the wreck.\n\n''Takao'' retired to Singapore, being joined in January 1945 by ''My\u014dk\u014d'', as the Japanese deemed both crippled cruisers irreparable and left them moored in the harbor as floating anti-aircraft batteries.\n\n==Battle of the Sibuyan Sea (24 October 1944)==\n[[File:Japanese battleship Musashi cropped.jpg|thumb|{{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} departing Brunei in October 1944 for the Battle of Leyte Gulf]]\n\nDespite its great strength, the U.S. 3rd Fleet was not well-placed to deal with the threat. On 22 October, Halsey had detached two of his carrier groups to the fleet base at [[Ulithi]] to provision and rearm. When ''Darter''{{'}}s contact report came in, Halsey recalled [[Ralph E. Davison|Davison's]] group, but allowed Vice Admiral [[John S. McCain Sr.|John S. McCain]], with the strongest of TF&nbsp;38's [[carrier group]]s, to continue towards Ulithi. Halsey finally recalled McCain on 24 October\u2014but the delay meant the most powerful American carrier group played little part in the coming battle and the 3rd Fleet was therefore effectively deprived of nearly 40% of its air strength for most of the engagement. On the morning of 24 October, only three groups were available to strike Kurita's force, and the one best positioned to do so\u2014[[Gerald F. Bogan]]'s Task Group 38.2 (TG&nbsp;38.2)\u2014was by mischance the weakest of the groups, containing only one large carrier\u2014{{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|6}}\u2014and two light carriers.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n[[File:Yamato hit by bomb.jpg|left|thumb|{{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} hit by a bomb near her forward gun turret in the Sibuyan Sea, 24 October 1944]]\n\nMeanwhile, Vice Admiral [[Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi]] directed three waves of aircraft from his [[First Air Fleet]] based on Luzon against the carriers of Rear Admiral [[Frederick Sherman]]'s TG&nbsp;38.3 (whose aircraft were also being used to strike airfields in Luzon to prevent Japanese land-based air attacks on Allied shipping in Leyte Gulf). Each of \u014cnishi's strike waves consisted of some 50 to 60 aircraft.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n[[File:USS Princeton (CVL-23) 1944 10 24 1523explosion.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|6}} explodes at 15:23.]]\n\nMost of the attacking Japanese planes were intercepted and shot down or driven off by Hellcats of Sherman's combat air patrol, most notably by two fighter sections from {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}} led by Commander [[David McCampbell]] (who shot down a record nine of the attacking planes in this one action, after which he managed to return and land ''in extremis'' on {{USS|Langley|CVL-27|6}} because the ''Essex''{{'}}s deck was too busy to accommodate him although he had run short of fuel).\n\nHowever, one Japanese aircraft (a [[Yokosuka D4Y]]3 ''Judy'') slipped through the defences, and at 09:38 hit the light carrier {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|6}} with a {{convert|551|lb|kg|abbr=on}} armor-piercing bomb. The resulting explosion caused a severe fire in ''Princeton''{{'}}s hangar and her emergency sprinkler system failed to operate. As the fire spread rapidly, a series of secondary explosions followed. The fire was gradually brought under control, but at 15:23 there was an enormous explosion (probably in the carrier's bomb stowage aft), causing more casualties aboard ''Princeton'', and even heavier casualties\u2014233 dead and 426 wounded\u2014aboard the light cruiser {{USS|Birmingham|CL-62|2}} which was coming back alongside to assist with the firefighting. ''Birmingham'' was so badly damaged, she was forced to retire. Another light cruiser and two destroyers were also damaged. All efforts to save ''Princeton'' failed, and after the remaining crew members were evacuated, she was finally [[Scuttling|scuttled]]\u2014torpedoed by the light cruiser {{USS|Reno|CL-96|2}}\u2014at 17:50.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> Of ''Princeton''{{'s}} crew, 108 men were killed, while 1,361 survivors were rescued by nearby ships. USS ''Princeton'' was the largest American ship lost during the battles around Leyte Gulf, and the only {{sclass-|Independence|aircraft carrier|0}} fast carrier sunk in combat during the war.\n\n[[File:Musashi under fire.jpg|thumb|left|''Musashi'' under aerial bombardment]]\n\nPlanes from the carriers ''Intrepid'' and {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|2}} of Bogan's group attacked at about 10:30 scoring hits on the battleships ''Nagato'', ''Yamato'', and ''Musashi'', and badly damaging the heavy cruiser ''My\u014dk\u014d'' which retired to Borneo via Coron Bay. A second wave from ''Intrepid'', {{USS|Essex|CV-9|2}} and {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}} later attacked, with VB-15 Helldivers and VF-15 Hellcats from ''Essex'', scoring another 10 hits on ''Musashi''. As she withdrew, listing to port, a third wave from ''Enterprise'' and {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}} hit her with an additional 11 bombs and eight torpedoes.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> After being struck by at least 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes, ''Musashi'' finally capsized and sank at about 19:30.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nIn all, five CV fleet carriers and one light CVL of the U.S. 3rd Fleet flew 259 sorties with bombs carried by Helldivers and torpedoes launched by TBF Avengers against Center Force on 24 October, but this weight of attack was not nearly sufficient to neutralize the threat from Kurita. The largest effort of the Sibuyan Sea attack was directed against just one battleship, ''Musashi'', which was sunk, and the cruiser ''My\u014dk\u014d'' was also crippled by an aerial torpedo. Nevertheless, every other ship in Kurita's force remained battleworthy and able to advance.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> It would be the desperate action and great sacrifice of the much weaker force of six slow escort carriers, three destroyers, four destroyer escorts, and 400 aircraft at the [[Battle off Samar]], utterly lacking in credible weapons to sink armored ships, to stop Kurita. It also contrasts with the 527 sorties flown by 3rd Fleet against Ozawa's much weaker carrier decoy Northern Force on the following day.\n\nKurita turned his fleet around to get out of range of the aircraft, passing the crippled ''Musashi'' as his force retreated. Halsey assumed that this retreat signified that his threat was dealt with for the time being. Kurita, however, waited until 17:15 before turning around again to head for the San Bernardino Strait. As a result of a momentous decision taken by Admiral Halsey and some unclear communication of his plans, Kurita was able to proceed through the San Bernardino Strait during the night to make an unexpected and dramatic appearance off the coast of [[Samar (island)|Samar]] the following morning, directly threatening the Leyte landings.<ref>{{cite web|first = Klemen | last = L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/kurita.html |title= Rear-Admiral Takeo Kurita  |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942}}</ref>\n\n==Task Force 34 / San Bernardino Strait==\nAfter the Japanese Southern and Center forces had been detected, but before it had been engaged or Ozawa's carriers had been located, Halsey and the staff of 3rd Fleet, aboard the battleship {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}, prepared a contingency plan to deal with the threat from Kurita's Center Force. Their intention was to cover the San Bernardino Strait with a powerful task force of fast battleships supported by two of the 3rd Fleet's equally swift carrier groups. The battleship force was to be designated Task Force 34 (TF 34) and to consist of four battleships, five cruisers, and 14 destroyers under the command of Vice Admiral [[Willis A. Lee]]. Rear Admiral [[Ralph E. Davison]] of TG 38.4 was to be in overall command of the supporting carrier groups.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee Jr.|first=VADM David A.|title=Report of Operations of Task Force Thirty-Four During the Period 6 October 1944 to 3 November 1944|url=http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Leyte/TF-34-Leyte.html|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt 15:12 on 24 October, Halsey sent an ambiguously worded [[Radioteletype|telegraphic]] radio message to his subordinate task group commanders giving details of this contingency plan:\n\n{{quote|text=BATDIV 7 MIAMI, VINCENNES, BILOXI, DESRON 52 LESS STEVEN POTTER, FROM TG 38.2 AND WASHINGTON, ALABAMA, WICHITA, NEW ORLEANS, DESDIV 100, PATTERSON, BAGLEY FROM TG 38.4 WILL BE FORMED AS TASK FORCE 34 UNDER VICE ADMIRAL LEE, COMMANDER BATTLE LINE.

HALSEY, OTC IN NEW JERSEY.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>}}\n\nHalsey sent information copies of this message to Admiral Nimitz at Pacific Fleet headquarters and Admiral King in Washington, but he did not include Admiral Kinkaid (7th Fleet) as an information addressee.<ref name=\"Cutler1994\"/>{{rp|110}} The message was picked up by 7th Fleet anyway as it was common for admirals to direct radio operators to copy all message traffic they detected whether intended for them or not. Because Halsey intended TF 34 as a contingency to be formed and detached ''when'' he ordered it, by writing \"will be formed,\" he meant the future tense, but he neglected to say when TF 34 ''would'' be formed or under what circumstances. This omission led Admiral Kinkaid of 7th Fleet to believe Halsey was speaking in the present tense, so he concluded TF 34 ''had been formed'' and would take station off the San Bernardino Strait. Kinkaid's light escort carrier group, lacking battleships for naval action and set up to attack ground troops and submarines, not capital ships, positioned itself south of the strait to support the invasion force. Admiral Nimitz, in Pearl Harbor, reached exactly the same conclusion.\n\nHalsey did send out a second message at 17:10 clarifying his intentions in regard to TF 34:\n\n{{quote|text=IF THE ENEMY SORTIES (THROUGH SAN {{sic|?|BERNADINO}} STRAIT) TF 34 WILL BE FORMED WHEN DIRECTED BY ME.<ref name=\"Cutler1994\"/>{{rp|111}}}}\n\nUnfortunately, Halsey sent this second message by [[Amplitude modulation|voice]] [[VHF|radio]], so 7th Fleet did not intercept it (due to the range [[Line-of-sight_propagation|limitations]] of  the ship-to-ship voice radio networks in use at the time) and Halsey did not follow up with a telegraphic message to Nimitz or King, or vitally, Kinkaid. The serious misunderstanding caused by Halsey's imperfect wording of his first message and his failure to notify Nimitz, King, or Kinkaid of his second clarifying message was to have a profound influence on the subsequent course of the battle as Kurita's major force almost overwhelmed Kinkaid's unprepared lighter force on the doorstep of the Leyte Marine landings.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/><ref name=\"Cutler1994\"/>{{rp|111}}\n\n==Halsey's decision (24 October 1944)==\nThe 3rd Fleet's aircraft failed to locate Ozawa's Northern Force until 16:40 on 24 October. This was largely because 3rd Fleet had been preoccupied with attacking Kurita's sizeable Center Force and defending itself against the Japanese air strikes from Luzon. Thus the one Japanese force that wanted to be discovered &ndash; Ozawa's tempting decoy of a large carrier group, which actually had only 108 aircraft &ndash; was the only force the Americans had not been able to find. On the evening of 24 October, Ozawa intercepted a (mistaken) American communication describing Kurita's withdrawal; he therefore began to withdraw, too. However, at 20:00, IJN Combined Fleet Admiral [[Soemu Toyoda]] ordered all his forces to attack \"counting on divine assistance.\" Trying to draw 3rd Fleet's attention to his decoy force, Ozawa reversed course again and headed southward towards Leyte.\n\nHalsey fell for the Japanese decoy, convinced the Northern Force constituted the main Japanese threat, and he was determined to seize what he saw as a golden opportunity to destroy Japan's last remaining carrier strength. Believing the Center Force had been neutralized by 3rd Fleet's air strikes earlier in the day in the Sibuyan Sea, and its remnants were retiring, Halsey radioed (to Nimitz and Kinkaid):\n\n{{quote|text=CENTRAL FORCE HEAVILY DAMAGED ACCORDING TO STRIKE REPORTS.<br />AM PROCEEDING NORTH WITH THREE GROUPS TO ATTACK CARRIER FORCES AT DAWN<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>}}\n\nThe words \"with three groups\" proved dangerously misleading. In the light of the intercepted 15:12 24 October \"\u2026will be formed as Task Force 34\" message from Halsey, Admiral Kinkaid and his staff assumed, as did Admiral Nimitz at Pacific Fleet headquarters, that TF&nbsp;34\u2014commanded by [[Willis A. Lee|Lee]]\u2014had now been formed as a separate entity. They assumed that Halsey was leaving this powerful surface force guarding the San Bernardino Strait (and covering the Seventh Fleet's northern flank), while he took his three available carrier groups northwards in pursuit of the Japanese carriers. But Task Force 34 had not been detached from his other forces, and Lee's battleships were on their way northwards with the 3rd Fleet's carriers. As Woodward wrote: \"Everything was pulled out from San Bernardino Strait. Not so much as a picket destroyer was left\".<ref name=\"Woodward1947\"/>\n\n===Warning signs ignored===\nHalsey and his staff officers ignored information from a night reconnaissance aircraft operating from the light carrier {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|2}} that Kurita's powerful surface force had turned back towards the San Bernardino Strait, and that after a long blackout, the navigation lights in the strait had been turned on. When Rear Admiral [[Gerald F. Bogan]]\u2014commanding TG&nbsp;38.2\u2014radioed this information to Halsey's flagship, he was rebuffed by a staff officer, who tersely replied \"Yes, yes, we have that information.\" Vice Admiral Lee, who had correctly deduced that Ozawa's force was on a decoy mission and indicated this in a blinker message to Halsey's flagship, was similarly rebuffed. [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Arleigh Burke]] and Commander [[James H. Flatley]] of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Marc Mitscher]]'s staff had come to the same conclusion. They were sufficiently worried about the situation to wake Mitscher, who asked, \"Does Admiral Halsey have that report?\" On being told that Halsey did, Mitscher\u2014knowing Halsey's temperament\u2014commented, \"If he wants my advice he'll ask for it\" and went back to sleep.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nThe entire available strength of 3rd Fleet continued to steam northwards, leaving the San Bernardino Strait completely unguarded. Nothing lay between the battleships of Kurita's Center Force now steaming towards the American landing vessels in Leyte Gulf, except for Kinkaid's vulnerable escort carrier group off the [[#Battle off Samar (25 October 1944)|coast of Samar]].\n\n==Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October 1944)==\n{{See also|Leyte Gulf order of battle#24-25 Oct \u2013 Battle of Surigao Strait|l1=Leyte Gulf order of battle}}\n[[File:Surigao straight.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.1|The Battle of Surigao Strait]]\n\nThe Battle of Surigao Strait is significant as the last battleship-to-battleship action in history. The Battle of Surigao Strait was one of only two battleship-versus-battleship naval battles in the entire Pacific campaign of World War II (the other being the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal#Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 14\u201315 November|naval battle]] during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], where the {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|6}} and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}} sank the {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima}}). It was also the last battle in which one force (in this case, the U.S. Navy) was able to \"[[Crossing the T|cross the T]]\" of its opponent. However, by the time that the battleship action was joined, the Japanese line was very ragged and consisted of only one battleship (''Yamashiro''), one heavy cruiser, and one destroyer, so that the \"crossing of the T\" was notional and had little effect on the outcome of the battle.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/><ref name=\"Sauer1999\">Sauer, Howard (1999). The Last Big Gun Naval Battle: The Battle of Surigao Strait. Glencannon Press</ref>\n\n===Japanese Forces===\nNishimura's \"Southern Force\" consisted of the old battleships {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Fus\u014d||2}}, the heavy cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Mogami|1934|2}}, and four destroyers,<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Shigure|1935|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Michishio||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asagumo|1937|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yamagumo|1937|2}}. This task force left Brunei after Kurita at 15:00 on 22 October, turning eastward into the [[Sulu Sea]] and then northeasterly past the southern tip of [[Negros Island]] into the [[Mindanao Sea]]. Nishimura then proceeded northeastward with [[Mindanao Island]] to [[starboard]] and into the south entrance to the Surigao Strait, intending to exit the north entrance of the Strait into [[Leyte Gulf]] where he would add his firepower to that of Kurita's force.\n\nThe Japanese Second Striking Force was commanded by Vice Admiral [[Kiyohide Shima]] and comprised heavy cruisers {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Nachi||2}} (flag) and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Ashigara||2}}, the light cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Abukuma||2}}, and the destroyers {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Akebono|1930|2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Ushio|1930|2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Kasumi|1937|2}}, and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Shiranui|1938|2}}.\n\nThe Japanese Southern Force was attacked by U.S. Navy bombers on 24 October but sustained only minor damage.\n\nNishimura was unable to synchronise his movements with Shima and Kurita because of the strict radio silence imposed on the Center and Southern Forces. When he entered the Surigao Strait at 02:00, Shima was {{convert|25|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} behind him and Kurita was still in the Sibuyan Sea, several hours from the beaches at Leyte.\n\n===Engagement===\nAs the Japanese Southern Force approached the Surigao Strait, it ran into a deadly trap set by the U.S. 7th Fleet Support Force. Rear Admiral [[Jesse Oldendorf]] had a substantial force comprising \n\n* six battleships: {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}, {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}}, {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}, {{USS|Tennessee|BB-43|2}}, {{USS|California|BB-44|2}}, and {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}} which carried 48 14-inch (356 mm) and 16 16-inch (406 mm) guns;\n* four [[heavy cruiser]]s {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|6}} (flagship), {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}}, {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}}, and [[HMS Shropshire (83)|HMAS ''Shropshire'']] which carried 35 8-inch (203&nbsp;mm) guns;\n* four [[light cruiser]]s {{USS|Denver|CL-58|2}}, {{USS|Columbia|CL-56|2}}, {{USS|Phoenix|CL-46|2}}, and {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}} which carried 54 6-inch (152&nbsp;mm) guns; and\n* 28 destroyers and 39 motor torpedo boats ([[PT boat|Patrol/Torpedo (PT) boats]]) with smaller guns and torpedoes.\n\nOf the six battleships all except ''Mississippi'' (which had been in Iceland on convoy-escort duty at the time) had been sunk or damaged in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and subsequently repaired or, in the case of ''Tennessee'', ''California'', and ''West Virginia,'' rebuilt.  To pass through the narrows and reach the invasion shipping, Nishimura would have to run the gauntlet of torpedoes from the PT boats and destroyers before advancing into the concentrated fire of 14 battleships and cruisers deployed across the far mouth of the Strait.<ref name=\"Morison1956\" />\n\nAt 22:36, ''PT-131'' (Ensign Peter Gadd) was operating off [[Bohol]] when it made contact with the approaching Japanese ships. The PT boats made repeated attacks for more than three and a half hours as Nishimura's force streamed northward. No torpedo hits were scored, but the PT boats did send contact reports which were of use to Oldendorf and his force.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nNishimura's ships passed unscathed through the gauntlet of PT boats. However, their luck ran out a short time later, as they were subjected to devastating torpedo attacks from the American destroyers deployed on both sides of their axis of advance. At about 03:00, both Japanese battleships were hit by torpedoes. ''Yamashiro'' was able to steam on, but ''Fus\u014d'' was torpedoed by {{USS|Melvin|DD-680|6}} and fell out of formation, sinking forty minutes later. Two of Nishimura's four destroyers were sunk; the destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asagumo|1937|2}} was hit and forced to retire, but later sank.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\n===Sinking of the ''Fus\u014d''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe traditional account of the sinking of the ''Fus\u014d'' was that she exploded into two halves that remained floating for some time. However, ''Fus\u014d'' survivor Hideo Ogawa, interrogated in 1945, in an article on the battleship's last voyage, stated: \"Shortly after 0400 the ship capsized slowly to starboard and Ogawa and others were washed away,\" without specifically mentioning the dissection. ''Fus\u014d'' was hit on the starboard side by two or possibly three torpedoes. One of these started an oil fire, and as the fuel used by IJN ships was poorly refined and easily ignited, burning patches of fuel could have led to the description from Allied observers of ''Fus\u014d'' \"blowing up\". However, battleships were known to sometimes be cut into two or even three sections which could remain afloat independently, and Samuel Morison states that the bow half of ''Fus\u014d'' was sunk by gunfire from ''Louisville'', and the stern half sank off Kanihaan Island.\n\n[[File:USS West Virginia (BB-48) firing during the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944.jpg|thumb|{{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|6}} firing on the Japanese fleet]]\n\n===Battle continues===\nAt 03:16, ''West Virginia''{{'}}s radar picked up the surviving ships of Nishimura's force at a range of {{convert|42000|yd|m|abbr=on}}.

[[Fire-control system|Radar fire control]] allowed these American battleships to hit targets from a distance at which the Japanese battleships with their inferior fire control systems could not return fire.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/><ref name=\"Sauer1999\"/>\n\nThe other three U.S. battleships also had difficulty, equipped with less advanced gunnery radar. ''Maryland'' eventually succeeded in visually ranging on the splashes of the other battleships' shells, and then fired a total of 48 {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} projectiles. ''Pennsylvania'' was unable to find a target and her guns remained silent.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\n''Mississippi'' only fired once in the battle-line action, a full salvo of 12 14-in shells.

''Louisville''\n(Oldendorf's flagship) fired 37 salvos\u2014333 rounds of 8-inch shells.

Shima's run was initially thrown into confusion by his force nearly running aground on [[Panaon Island]] after failing to factor the outgoing tide into their approach. Japanese radar was almost useless due to excessive reflections from the many islands. The American radar was equally unable to detect ships in these conditions, especially PT boats, but ''PT-137'' hit the light cruiser ''Abukuma'' with a torpedo that crippled her and caused her to fall out of formation. Shima's two heavy cruisers, ''Nachi'' and ''Ashigara'', and eight destroyers<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> next encountered remnants of Nishimura's force. Shima saw what he thought were the wrecks of both Nishimura's battleships and ordered a retreat. His [[flagship]] ''Nachi'' collided with ''Mogami'', flooding ''Mogami''{{'}}s steering room and causing her to fall behind in the retreat; she was further damaged by American carrier aircraft the next morning, abandoned, and [[scuttling|scuttled]] by a torpedo from ''Akebono''.\n\n=== Results ===\nOf Nishimura's seven ships, only ''Shigure'' survived long enough to escape the debacle, but eventually succumbed to the American submarine {{USS|Blackfin|SS-322|2}} on 24 January 1945, which sank her off [[Kota Bharu]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], with 37 dead.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/><ref name=\"Sauer1999\"/> Shima's ships did survive the Battle of Surigao Strait, but they were sunk in further engagements around Leyte.

In fact, Halsey had not yet formed TF 34, and all six of Willis Lee's battleships were on their way northwards with the carriers, as well as every available cruiser and destroyer of the Third Fleet.\n\nKurita's Center Force therefore emerged unopposed from San Bernardino Strait at 03:00 on 25 October and steamed southward along the coast of the island of [[Samar (island)|Samar]]. In its path stood only the 7th Fleet's three escort carrier units (call signs 'Taffy' 1, 2, and 3), with a total of sixteen small, very slow, and unarmored [[escort carrier]]s, which carried up to 28 airplanes each, protected by a screen of lightly armed and unarmored destroyers and smaller [[destroyer escort]]s (DEs). Despite the losses in the Palawan Passage and Sibuyan Sea actions, the Japanese Center Force was still very powerful, consisting of four battleships (including the giant {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}), six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers and eleven destroyers.<ref name=\"Hornfischer2004\"/>\n\n===Battle===\nKurita's force caught Rear Admiral [[Clifton Sprague]]'s Task Unit 77.4.3 ('Taffy 3') by surprise. Sprague directed his carriers to launch their planes, then run for the cover of a rain squall to the east. He ordered the destroyers and DEs to make a smoke screen to conceal the retreating carriers.\n\nKurita, unaware that Ozawa's decoy plan had succeeded, assumed he had found a carrier group from Halsey's 3rd Fleet. Having just redeployed his ships into anti-aircraft formation, he further complicated matters by ordering a \"General Attack\", which called for his fleet to split into divisions and attack independently.<ref name=\"Thomas2006\">{{cite book |title=Sea of Thunder: Four Commanders and the last Great Naval Campaign, 1941\u20131945 |last=Thomas |first=Evan |year=2006 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-5221-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/seaofthunderfour00thom }}</ref>\n\nThe destroyer {{USS|Johnston|DD-557|6}} was the closest to the enemy.

The escort carriers had planes more suited for patrol and anti-submarine duties, including older models such as the FM-2 Wildcat, although they also had the TBM Avenger torpedo bombers, in contrast to Halsey's fleet carriers which had the newest aircraft with ample anti-shipping ordnance. However, the fact that the Japanese force had no air cover meant that Sprague's planes could attack unopposed by Japanese fighter aircraft. Consequently, the air counterattacks were almost unceasing, and some, especially several of the strikes launched from [[Felix Stump]]'s Task Unit 77.4.2 (Taffy 2), were heavy.\n\nThe carriers of Taffy 3 turned south and retreated through the shellfire. {{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73|2}}, at the rear of the American formation, became the focus of the battleship ''Yamato'' and sustained multiple hits before capsizing at 09:07. Several other carriers were damaged but were able to escape.\n\n===Admiral Kurita withdraws===\nThe ferocity of the American defense seemingly confirmed the Japanese assumption that they were engaging major fleet units rather than merely escort carriers and destroyers. The confusion of the \"General Attack\" order was compounded by the air and torpedo attacks, when Kurita's flagship ''Yamato'' turned north to evade torpedoes and lost contact with the battle.\n\nKurita abruptly broke off the fight and gave the order 'all ships, my course north, speed 20', apparently to regroup his disorganized fleet. Kurita's battle report stated he had received a message indicating a group of American carriers was steaming north of him. Preferring to expend his fleet against capital ships rather than transports, Kurita set out in pursuit and thereby lost his opportunity to destroy the shipping fleet in Leyte Gulf, and disrupt the vital landings at Leyte. After failing to intercept the non-existent carriers, which were much farther north, Kurita finally retreated towards San Bernardino Strait. Three of his heavy cruisers had been sunk, and the determined resistance had convinced him that persisting with his attack would only cause further Japanese losses.\n\nPoor communication between the separate Japanese forces and a lack of air reconnaissance meant that Kurita was never informed that the deception had been successful, and that only a small and outgunned force stood between his battleships and the vulnerable transports of the invasion fleet. Thus, Kurita remained convinced that he had been engaging elements of the 3rd Fleet, and it would only be a matter of time before Halsey surrounded and annihilated him.<ref name=\"Thomas2006\"/> Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague wrote to his colleague Aubrey Fitch after the war, \"I ... stated [to Admiral Nimitz] that the main reason they turned north was that they were receiving too much damage to continue and I am still of that opinion and cold analysis will eventually confirm it.\"<ref name=\"Hornfischer2004\"/>\n\n[[File:USS St Lo (CVE-63) 2.jpg|thumb|{{USS|St. Lo|CVE-63|2}} exploded after a ''[[kamikaze]]'' strike.]]\n\nAlmost all of Kurita's surviving force escaped. Halsey and the 3rd Fleet battleships returned too late to cut him off. ''Nagato'' and ''Kong\u014d'' had been moderately damaged by air attack from Taffy 3's escort carriers. Kurita had begun the battle with five battleships. On their return to their bases, only ''Yamato'' and ''Haruna'' remained battleworthy.\n\nAs the desperate surface action was coming to an end, Vice Admiral [[Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi]] put his [[Japanese Special Attack Units]] into operation from bases on Luzon island, launching ''kamikaze'' attacks against the Allied ships in Leyte Gulf and the escort carrier units off Samar. The escort carrier {{USS|St. Lo|CVE-63|2}} of Taffy&nbsp;3 was hit by a ''kamikaze'' aircraft and sank after a series of internal explosions.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/><ref name=\"Hornfischer2004\"/>\n\n==Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o (25\u201326 October 1944)==\n{{See also|Leyte Gulf order of battle#25 Oct \u2013 Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o|l1=Leyte Gulf order of battle}}\n<!-- Battle off Cape Engano and Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o link here. -->\n[[File:Zuikaku at Cape Engano.jpg|thumb|The Japanese aircraft carriers {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}, left, and (probably) {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuih\u014d||2}} come under attack by dive bombers early in the Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o.]]\n\nVice-Admial [[Jisabur\u014d Ozawa]]'s \"Northern Force\", built around the four aircraft carriers of the [[Third Carrier Division|3rd Carrier Division]] ({{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}\u2014the last survivor of the [[1st Air Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy#Kido Butai|six carriers]] that had attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941\u2014and the light carriers {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuih\u014d||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Chitose||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Chiyoda||2}}), included two [[World War I]] battleships partially converted to carriers ({{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hy\u016bga||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Ise||2}}\u2014the two aft turrets had been replaced by a hangar, aircraft handling deck and catapult, but neither ship carried any aircraft in this battle), three light cruisers ({{Ship|Japanese cruiser|\u014cyodo||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tama||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Isuzu||2}}), and nine destroyers. Ozawa's carrier group was a decoy force, divested of all but 108 aircraft, intended to lure the American fleet away from protecting the transports at the landing beaches on Leyte island.\n\nOzawa's force was not located until 16:40 on 24 October, largely because Sherman's TG&nbsp;38.3\u2014which was the northernmost of Halsey's groups\u2014was responsible for searches in this sector. The force that Halsey was taking north with him\u2014three groups of Mitscher's TF&nbsp;38\u2014was overwhelmingly stronger than the Japanese Northern Force. Between them, these groups had five large [[aircraft carrier|fleet carriers]] ({{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}, {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, and {{USS|Essex|CV-9|2}}), five light carriers ({{USS|Independence|CVL-22|2}}, {{USS|Belleau Wood|CVL-24|2}}, {{USS|Langley|CVL-27|2}}, {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|2}}, and {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|2}}), six modern [[battleship]]s ({{USS|Alabama|BB-60|2}}, {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|2}}, {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|2}}, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}, {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}}, and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}}), eight cruisers (two heavy and six light), and more than 40 destroyers. The air groups of the ten U.S. carriers present contained 600\u20131,000 aircraft.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\n[[File:Lowering the flag on Zuikaku.jpg|thumb|left|The crew of {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}} salute as the flag is lowered on the listing carrier after an airstrike. She was the last carrier participating in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] to be sunk.|alt=]]\n\nAt 02:40 on 25 October, Halsey detached TF&nbsp;34, built around the 3rd Fleet's six battleships and commanded by Vice Admiral [[Willis Augustus Lee|Willis \"Ching\" Lee]]. As dawn approached, the ships of Task Force 34 drew ahead of the carrier groups. Halsey intended Mitscher to make air strikes followed by the heavy gunfire of Lee's battleships.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nAround dawn on 25 October, Ozawa launched 75 aircraft, the bulk of his few aircraft, to attack the 3rd Fleet. Most were shot down by American combat air patrols, and no damage was done to the U.S. ships. A few Japanese planes survived and made their way to land bases on Luzon.\n\nDuring the night, Halsey had passed tactical command of TF&nbsp;38 to Admiral Mitscher, who ordered the American carrier groups to launch their first strike wave, of 180 aircraft, at dawn\u2014before the Northern Force had been located. When the search aircraft made contact at 07:10, this strike wave was orbiting ahead of the task force. At 08:00, as the attack went in, its escorting fighters destroyed Ozawa's combat air patrol of about 30 planes. The U.S. air strikes continued until the evening, by which time TF&nbsp;38 had flown 527 sorties against the Northern Force, sinking ''Zuikaku'', the light carriers ''Chitose'' and ''Zuih\u014d'', and the destroyer ''Akizuki'', all with heavy loss of life. The light carrier ''Chiyoda'' and the cruiser ''Tama'' were crippled. Ozawa transferred his flag to the light cruiser ''\u014cyodo''.\n\n===Crisis \u2013 U.S. 7th Fleet's calls for help===\nShortly after 08:00 on 25 October, desperate messages calling for assistance began to come in from 7th Fleet, which had been engaging Nishimura's \"Southern Force\" in [[#Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October 1944)|battle in Surigao Strait]] since 02:00. One message from Kinkaid, sent in plain language, read: \"My situation is critical. Fast battleships and support by air strikes may be able to keep enemy from destroying CVES and entering Leyte.\" Halsey recalled in his memoirs that he was shocked at this message, recounting that the radio signals from the 7th Fleet had come in at random and out of order because of a backlog in the signals office. It seems that he did not receive this vital message from Kinkaid until around 10:00. Halsey later claimed he knew Kinkaid was in trouble, but he had not dreamed of the seriousness of this crisis.\n\nOne of the most alarming signals from Kinkaid reported, after their action in Surigao Strait, 7th Fleet's own battleships were critically low on ammunition. Even this failed to persuade Halsey to send any immediate assistance to the powerful 7th Fleet.<ref name=\"Woodward1947\"/><ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> In fact, the 7th Fleet's battleships were not as short of ammunition as Kinkaid's signal implied,<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> but Halsey did not know that.\n\nFrom {{convert|3000|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away in Pearl Harbor, Admiral Nimitz had been monitoring the desperate calls from Taffy&nbsp;3, and sent Halsey a terse message: \"TURKEY TROTS TO WATER GG FROM CINCPAC ACTION COM THIRD FLEET INFO COMINCH CTF SEVENTY-SEVEN X WHERE IS RPT WHERE IS TASK FORCE THIRTY FOUR RR [[The world wonders|THE WORLD WONDERS]].\" The first four words and the last three were \"padding\" used to confuse enemy [[cryptanalysis]] (the beginning and end of the true message was marked by double consonants). The communications staff on Halsey's flagship correctly deleted the first section of padding but mistakenly retained the last three words in the message finally handed to Halsey. The last three words\u2014probably selected by a communications officer at Nimitz's headquarters\u2014may have been meant as a loose quote from [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson's]] poem on \"[[Charge of the Light Brigade|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\", suggested by the coincidence that this day, 25 October, was the 90th anniversary of the [[Battle of Balaclava]]\u2014and was not intended as a commentary on the current crisis off Leyte. Halsey, however, when reading the message, thought that the last words\u2014\"THE WORLD WONDERS\"\u2014were a biting piece of criticism from Nimitz, threw his cap to the deck and broke into \"sobs of rage\". Rear Admiral [[Robert Carney]], his Chief of Staff, confronted him, telling Halsey \"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together.\"\n\nEventually, at 11:15, more than three hours after the first distress messages from 7th Fleet had been received by his flagship, Halsey ordered TF&nbsp;34 to turn around and head southwards towards Samar. At this point, Lee's battleships were almost within gun range of Ozawa's force. Two-and-a-half hours were then spent refuelling TF&nbsp;34's accompanying destroyers.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nAfter this succession of delays it was too late for TF&nbsp;34 to give any practical help to 7th Fleet, other than to assist in picking up survivors from Taffy&nbsp;3, and too late even to intercept Kurita's force before it made its escape through San Bernardino Strait.\n\nNevertheless, at 16:22, in a desperate and even more belated attempt to intervene in the events off Samar, Halsey formed a new task group\u2014TG&nbsp;34.5\u2014under Rear Admiral [[Oscar C. Badger II]],<ref>{{cite book | title=The Battle for Leyte, 1944 | first=Milan | last=Vego | publisher=Naval Institute Press | location=Annapolis, Maryland | date=2006 | page=284 | isbn=1-55750-885-2 }}</ref> built around Third Fleet's two fastest battleships\u2014''Iowa'' and ''New Jersey'', both capable of a speed of more than {{convert|32|kn}}\u2014and TF&nbsp;34's three cruisers and eight destroyers, and sped southwards, leaving Lee and the other four battleships to follow. As Morison observes, if Badger's group had succeeded in intercepting the Japanese Center Force it may have been outmatched by Kurita's battleships.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nCruisers and destroyers of TG&nbsp;34.5, however, caught the {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Nowaki|1940|6}}\u2014the last straggler from Center Force\u2014off San Bernardino Strait, and sank her with all hands, including the survivors from ''Chikuma''.\n\n===Final actions===\nWhen Halsey turned TF&nbsp;34 southwards at 11:15, he detached a task group of four of its cruisers and nine of its destroyers under Rear Admiral DuBose, and reassigned this group to TF&nbsp;38. At 14:15, Mitscher ordered DuBose to pursue the remnants of the Japanese Northern Force. His cruisers finished off the light carrier ''Chiyoda'' at around 17:00, and at 20:59 his ships sank the destroyer ''Hatsuzuki'' after a very stubborn fight.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nWhen Admiral Ozawa learned of the deployment of DuBose's relatively weak task group, he ordered battleships ''Ise'' and ''Hy\u016bga'' to turn southwards and attack it, but they failed to locate DuBose's group, which they heavily outgunned. Halsey's withdrawal of all six of Lee's battleships in his attempt to assist Seventh Fleet had now rendered TF&nbsp;38 vulnerable to a surface counterattack by the decoy Northern Force.\n\nAt about 23:10, the American submarine {{USS|Jallao|SS-368|2}} torpedoed and sank the light cruiser ''Tama'' of Ozawa's force. This was the last act of the Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o, and\u2014apart from some final air strikes on the retreating Japanese forces on 26 October\u2014the conclusion of the Battle for Leyte Gulf.\n\n==Weighing the decisions of Halsey==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--Many paragraphs and some quotes have no citations.-->\n[[File:Admiral William F. Halsey.jpg|thumb|[[William F. Halsey|Admiral William F. \"Bull\" Halsey]] \u2013 Commander U.S. Third Fleet at Leyte Gulf]]\n\n===Criticism===\nHalsey was questioned for his decision to take TF&nbsp;34 north in pursuit of Ozawa, and for failing to detach it when Kinkaid first appealed for help. A piece of U.S. Navy slang for Halsey's actions is ''Bull's Run'', a phrase combining Halsey's newspaper nickname \"Bull\" (he was known as \"Bill\" Halsey) with an allusion to the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Bull Run]] in the [[American Civil War]], where Union troops lost the battle due to poor organization and lack of decisive action.\n\nClifton Sprague\u2014commander of Task Unit 77.4.3 in the Battle off Samar\u2014was later bitterly critical of Halsey's decision, and of his failure to clearly inform Kinkaid and 7th Fleet that their northern flank was no longer protected: \"In the absence of any information... it was logical to assume that our northern flank could not be exposed without ample warning.\" Regarding Halsey's failure to turn TF&nbsp;34 southwards when 7th Fleet's first calls for assistance off Samar were received, Morison writes:\n\n{{quote|text=If TF&nbsp;34 had been detached a few hours earlier, after Kinkaid's first urgent request for help, and had left the destroyers behind, since their fueling caused a delay of over two and a half hours, a powerful battle line of six modern battleships under the command of Admiral Lee, the most experienced battle squadron commander in the Navy, would have arrived off the San Bernardino Strait in time to have clashed with Kurita's Center Force\u2026 Apart from the accidents common in naval warfare, there is every reason to suppose that Lee would have \"crossed the T\" and completed the destruction of Center Force.\nThe mighty gunfire of the Third Fleet's Battle Line, greater than that of the whole Japanese Navy, was never brought into action except to finish off one or two crippled light ships.<ref>source Morison 1956. pp. 336\u2013337</ref><ref>Note: Task Group 34.5 in fact only finished off the straggling destroyer ''Nowaki'', and this was not achieved by the battleships, but rather by their accompanying cruisers and destroyers (Source: [http://www.history.navy.mil/ U.S. Naval Historical Center]).</ref>}}\n\nVice Admiral Lee said in his action report as Commander of TF&nbsp;34: \"No battle damage was incurred nor inflicted on the enemy by vessels while operating as Task Force Thirty-Four.\"<ref>[http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Leyte/TF-34-Leyte.html Task Force 34 Action Report: 26 October 1944 \u2013 3 November 1944]</ref>\n\n===Halsey's defense===\nIn his dispatch after the battle, Halsey justified the decision to go North as follows:\n\n::Searches by my carrier planes revealed the presence of the Northern carrier force on the afternoon of 24 October, which completed the picture of all enemy naval forces. As it seemed childish to me to guard statically San Bernardino Strait, I concentrated TF&nbsp;38 during the night and steamed north to attack the Northern Force at dawn.\n\n::I believed that the Center Force had been so heavily damaged in the Sibuyan Sea that it could no longer be considered a serious menace to Seventh Fleet.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nHalsey also argued that he had feared leaving TF&nbsp;34 to defend the strait without carrier support as that would have left it vulnerable to attack from land-based aircraft, while leaving one of the fast carrier groups behind to cover the battleships would have significantly reduced the concentration of air power going north to strike Ozawa.\n\nHowever, Morison states that Admiral Lee said after the battle that he would have been fully prepared for the battleships to cover the San Bernardino Strait without 'any' large carrier support,<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> as each of the escort carriers of TF&nbsp;77 had up to 28 planes on them, but little surface ship protection, from Kurita's traditional naval force, which lacked air support.\n\n===Potential mitigating factors===\nThe fact that Halsey was aboard one of the two fast battleships (''New Jersey''), and \"would have had to remain behind\" with TF&nbsp;34 while the bulk of his fleet charged northwards, may have influenced his decision, but it would have been perfectly feasible to have taken one or both of 3rd Fleet's two fastest battleships with some or all of the large carriers in the pursuit of Ozawa, while leaving the rest of the battle line off the San Bernardino Strait. Halsey's original plan for TF&nbsp;34 was for four, not all six, of the 3rd Fleet's battleships.\n\nHalsey was certainly philosophically against dividing his forces. He believed strongly in the current naval doctrine of concentration, as indicated by his writings both before World War II and in his subsequent articles and interviews defending his actions.<ref name=\"Cutler1994\"/> In addition, Halsey may well have been influenced by the recent criticisms of Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]], who was criticized for excessive caution in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], allowing the bulk of the Japanese fleet to escape. Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral [[Robert Carney|Robert \"Mick\" Carney]], was also wholeheartedly in favor of taking all of 3rd Fleet's available forces northwards to attack the Japanese carriers.\n\nHalsey also did not believe reports of just how badly compromised Japan's naval air power was, and had no idea that Ozawa's decoy force only had 100 aircraft. Although in a letter to Admiral Nimitz just three days before the Battle off Samar, Halsey wrote that Admiral Marc Mitscher believed \"Jap naval air was wiped out\",<ref name=\"Thomas 2006, p. 170\">Thomas 2006, p. 170</ref> which Admiral Spruance and Mitscher concluded from shooting down over 433 carrier based planes at the ''[[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Marianas Turkey Shoot]]'',<ref name=\"Thomas 2006, p. 170\"/> Halsey ignored Mitscher's insights, and later stated that he did not want to be \"[[Shuttle bombing|shuttle bombed]]\" by Ozawa's force (a technique whereby planes can land and rearm at bases on either side of a foe, allowing them to attack on both the outbound flight and the return), or to give them a \"free shot\" at the U.S. forces in Leyte Gulf.<ref name=\"Cutler1994\"/>\n\nHalsey may have considered Kurita's damaged battleships and cruisers, lacking carrier support, as little threat, but ironically, through his own failures to adequately communicate his intentions, he managed to demonstrate that unsupported battleships could still be dangerous.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kinkaid | first=VADM | title=Preliminary Action Report of Engagements in Leyte Gulf and off Samar Island on 25 October, 1944 | url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Leyte/TF-77-Leyte.html | accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Losses==\nMore than 1,000 sailors and aircrewmen of the Allied escort carrier units were killed.

The destroyer {{USS|Heermann|DD-532|6}}\u2014despite her unequal fight with the enemy\u2014finished the battle with only six of her crew dead. As a result of communication errors and other failures, a large number of survivors from Taffy&nbsp;3 were unable to be rescued for several days, and died unnecessarily as a consequence.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/><ref name=\"Hornfischer2004\"/> {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} suffered 30 officers and sailors dead, and another 62 servicemen wounded in a [[kamikaze]]-like attack 21 October 1944 at the start of the battle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cassells|first1=Vic|title=The Capital Ships: Their Battles and their Badges.|date=2000|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=East Roseville, NSW|isbn=0-7318-0941-6|page=24}}</ref>\n\nDue to the long duration and size of the battle, accounts vary as to the losses that occurred as a part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf and losses that occurred shortly before and shortly after.

After the nominal end of the battle, several damaged ships were faced with the option of either making their way to Singapore, close to Japan's oil supplies but where comprehensive repairs could not be undertaken, or making their way back to Japan where there were better repair facilities but scant oil. The cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kumano||2}} and battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kong\u014d||2}} were sunk retreating to Japan. Cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Takao|1930|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|My\u014dk\u014d||2}} were stranded, unrepairable, in Singapore. Many of the other survivors of the battle were bombed and sunk at anchor in Japan, unable to move without fuel.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:US Navy 041020-N-0493B-003 Backed by a monument marking the location of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines 60 years ago, a Philippine Marine Corps honor guard stands at attention during the playing of Taps.jpg|thumb|A 60th-anniversary memorial ceremony in [[Palo, Leyte]], [[Philippines]], on 20 October 2004]]\n\nThe Battle of Leyte Gulf secured the [[beachhead]]s of the [[U.S. Sixth Army]] on Leyte against attack from the sea. However, much hard fighting would be required before the island was completely in Allied hands at the end of December 1944: the [[Battle of Leyte]] on land was fought in parallel with an air and sea campaign in which the Japanese reinforced and resupplied their troops on Leyte while the Allies attempted to interdict them and establish air-sea superiority for a series of amphibious landings in [[Ormoc Bay]]\u2014engagements collectively referred to as the [[Battle of Ormoc Bay]].<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy had suffered its greatest loss of ships and crew ever. Its failure to dislodge the Allied invaders from Leyte meant the inevitable loss of the Philippines, which in turn meant Japan would be all but cut off from its occupied territories in Southeast Asia. These territories provided resources that were vital to Japan, in particular the oil needed for her ships and aircraft. This problem was compounded because the shipyards and sources of manufactured goods, such as ammunition, were in Japan itself. Finally, the loss of Leyte opened the way for the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion]] of the [[Ryukyu Islands]] in 1945.<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nThe major IJN surface ships returned to their bases to languish, entirely or almost entirely inactive, for the remainder of the war. The only major operation by these surface ships between the Battle for Leyte Gulf and the Japanese surrender was the suicidal sortie in April 1945 (part of [[Operation Ten-Go]]), in which the battleship ''Yamato'' and her escorts were destroyed by American carrier aircraft.\n\nThe first use of ''kamikaze'' aircraft took place following the Leyte landings. A ''kamikaze'' hit the Australian [[heavy cruiser]] {{HMAS|Australia|1927|6}} on 21 October. Organized suicide attacks by the \"Special Attack Force\" ([[Japanese Special Attack Units]]) began on 25 October during the closing phase of the Battle off Samar, causing the destruction of the escort carrier ''St. Lo''.\n\n[[J.F.C. Fuller]], in his ''The Decisive Battles of the Western World'', writes of the outcome of Leyte Gulf:\n\n{{quote|The Japanese fleet had [effectively] ceased to exist, and, except by land-based aircraft, their opponents had won undisputed command of the sea.\n\nWhen Admiral Ozawa was questioned... after the war he replied 'After this battle the surface forces became strictly auxiliary, so that we relied on land forces, special [''Kamikaze''] attack, and air power... there was no further use assigned to surface vessels, with the exception of some special ships.'\n\nAnd Admiral Yonai, the Navy Minister, said he realised the defeat at Leyte 'was tantamount to the loss of the Philippines.'\n\nAs for the larger significance of the battle, he said, 'I felt that it was the end.'<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/>}}\n\n==Memorials==\n* At the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]], in [[Alumni Hall (Navy)#Building features|Alumni Hall]], a concourse is dedicated to Lt.

C. | year=1956 |publisher=Eyre & Spottiswoode |location=London }}</ref><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> and were unable to affect the successful Allied invasion of Leyte.\n\n==Background==\nThe campaigns of August 1942 to early 1944 had driven Japanese forces from many of their island bases in the south and the central Pacific Ocean, while isolating many of their other bases (most notably in the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Admiralty Islands]], [[New Guinea]], [[Marshall Islands]], and [[Wake Island]]), and in June 1944, a series of American amphibious landings supported by the [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]]'s [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] captured most of the [[Mariana Islands]] (bypassing [[Rota (island)|Rota]]). This offensive breached Japan's strategic inner defense ring and gave the Americans a base from which long-range [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bombers could attack the Japanese home islands.\n\nThe Japanese counterattacked in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. The U.S. Navy destroyed three Japanese aircraft carriers, damaged other ships, and shot down approximately 600 Japanese aircraft, leaving the IJN with very little carrier-borne air power and few experienced pilots.<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/> However, the considerable land-based air power the Japanese had amassed in the Philippines was thought too dangerous to bypass by many high-ranking officers outside the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], including [[Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]]. \n\n===Formosa vs Philippines as invasion target===\nThe next logical step was to cut Japan's supply lines to Southeast Asia, depriving them of fuel and other necessities of war, but there were two different plans for doing so. Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Nimitz favored blockading Japanese forces in the Philippines and invading [[Taiwan|Formosa (Taiwan)]], while [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[Douglas MacArthur]], wanting to make good on his famous 1942 promise [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|\"I shall return\"]], championed an invasion of the Philippines.\n\nWhile Formosa could also serve as a base for an invasion of [[mainland China]], which MacArthur felt was unnecessary, it was also estimated that it would require about 12 divisions from the Army and [[the United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. Meanwhile, the entire Australian Army was engaged in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and on various other Pacific islands, so an invasion of Formosa would require much larger ground forces than were available in the Pacific in late 1944 until the defeat of Germany freed the necessary manpower.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\n===Decision to invade the Philippines===\nA meeting between MacArthur, Nimitz, and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] helped confirm the Philippines as a strategic target but did not reach a decision, and the debate continued for two months.<ref>{{cite book | chapterurl=http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_21.htm| chapter= Chapter 21: Luzon Versus Formosa | last= Smith |first= Robert Ross | title = Command Decisions | url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_0.htm| publisher= [[United States Army Center of Military History]]| id = CMH Pub 70-7| year = 2000| origyear = 1960 | accessdate=8 December 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071230145455/http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_0.htm| archivedate= 30 December 2007 | url-status= live| quote= \"Meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a conference at Pearl Harbor in late July 1944, ... MacArthur then argued persuasively that it was both necessary and proper to take Luzon before going on to Formosa, while Nimitz expounded a plan for striking straight across the western Pacific to Formosa bypassing Luzon. Apparently, no decisions on strategy were reached at the Pearl Harbor conferences. The Formosa versus Luzon debate continued without let-up at the highest planning levels for over two months, and even the question of bypassing the Philippines entirely in favor of a direct move on Formosa again came up for serious discussion.\"}}</ref> Eventually Nimitz changed his mind and agreed to MacArthur's plan,<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> and it was eventually decided that MacArthur's forces would invade the island of [[Leyte]] in the central Philippines. Amphibious forces and close naval support would be provided by the Seventh Fleet, commanded by [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]].\n\n==Setup for the battle==\nThe Seventh Fleet at this time contained units of the U.S. Navy and the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. Before the major naval actions in Leyte Gulf had begun, {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} and {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48|6}} were severely damaged by air attacks; during the battle proper these two cruisers were retiring, escorted by {{HMAS|Warramunga|I44|6}}, for repairs at the major Allied base at [[Manus Island]], {{convert|1700|mi|km|sigfig=2}} away.\n\n===Lack of unified command structures===\nThe [[United States Third Fleet|U.S. 3rd Fleet]], commanded by Admiral [[William F. Halsey Jr.]], with [[Task Force 38]] (TF&nbsp;38, the Fast Carrier Task Force, commanded by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Marc Mitscher]]), as its main component would provide more distant cover and support for the invasion. A fundamental defect in this plan was there would be no single American naval admiral in overall command. Kinkaid fell under MacArthur as Supreme Allied Commander Southwest Pacific, whereas Halsey's Third Fleet reported to Nimitz as C-in-C Pacific Ocean Areas. This lack of [[unity of command]], along with failures in communication, was to produce a crisis and very nearly a strategic disaster for the American forces.<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> By coincidence, the Japanese plan, using three separate fleets, also lacked an overall commander.\n\n===Japanese plans===\nThe American options were apparent to the IJN. [[Combined Fleet]] Chief [[Soemu Toyoda]] prepared four \"victory\" plans: ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 1 ({{lang|ja|\u6377\uff11\u53f7\u4f5c\u6226}} ''{{lang|ja-Latn|Sh\u014d ichig\u014d sakusen}}'') was a major naval operation in the Philippines, while ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 2, ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 3 and ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 4 were responses to attacks on Formosa, the [[Ryukyu Islands]], and the [[Kurile Islands]], respectively. The plans were for complex offensive operations committing nearly all available forces to a decisive battle, despite substantially depleting Japan's slender reserves of fuel oil.\n\nOn 12 October 1944, Halsey began [[Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa|a series of carrier raids against Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands]] with a view to ensuring that the aircraft based there could not intervene in the Leyte landings. The Japanese command, therefore, put ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 2 into action launching waves of air attacks against Third Fleet's carriers. In what Morison refers to as a \"knock-down, drag-out fight between carrier-based and land-based air\", the Japanese were routed losing 600 aircraft in three days - almost their entire air strength in the region. Following the American invasion of the Philippines, the Japanese Navy made the transition to ''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 1.<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\n''Sh\u014d-G\u014d'' 1 called for Vice Admiral [[Jisabur\u014d Ozawa]]'s ships\u2014known as the \"Northern Force\"\u2014to lure the main American covering forces away from Leyte. Northern Force would be built around several aircraft carriers, but these would have very few aircraft or trained aircrew. The carriers would serve as the main bait. As the U.S. covering forces were lured away, two other surface forces would advance on Leyte from the west. The \"Southern Force\" under Vice Admirals [[Shoji Nishimura]] and [[Kiyohide Shima]] would strike at the landing area via the Surigao Strait. The \"[[Leyte Gulf order of battle#Japanese Forces 2|Center Force]]\" under Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]\u2014by far the most powerful of the attacking forces\u2014would pass through the San Bernardino Strait into the Philippine Sea, turn southwards, and then also, attack the landing area.<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\n<blockquote>Should we lose in the Philippines operations, even though the fleet should be left, the shipping lane to the south would be completely cut off so that the fleet, if it should come back to Japanese waters, could not obtain its fuel supply. If it should remain in southern waters, it could not receive supplies of ammunition and arms. There would be no sense in saving the fleet at the expense of the loss of the Philippines.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/USSBS/IJO/IJO-75.html United States Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific) \u2013 'Interrogations of Japanese Officials']</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Leyte map annotated.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The four main actions in the Battle of Leyte Gulf: 1 [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of the Sibuyan Sea (24 October)|Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]] 2 [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October)|Battle of Surigao Strait]] 3 [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Cape Enga\u00f1o (25\u201326 October)|Battle of (or 'off') Cape Enga\u00f1o]] 4 [[Battle off Samar]].

The American submarines {{USS|Darter|SS-227|2}} and {{USS|Dace|SS-247|2}} were positioned together on the surface close by. At 00:16 on 23 October, ''Darter''{{'}}s radar detected the Japanese formation at a range of {{convert |30000|yd|m| abbr =on}}. Her captain promptly made visual contact. The two submarines quickly moved off in pursuit of the ships, while ''Darter'' made the first of three contact reports. At least one of these was picked up by a radio operator on ''Yamato'', but Kurita failed to take appropriate antisubmarine precautions.<ref name = \"Morison1956\" />\n\n''Darter'' and ''Dace'' traveled on the surface at full power for several hours and gained a position ahead of Kurita's formation, with the intention of making a submerged attack at first light. This attack was unusually successful. At 05:24, ''Darter'' fired a salvo of six torpedoes, at least four of which hit Kurita's flagship, the heavy cruiser ''Atago''. Ten minutes later, ''Darter'' made two hits on ''Atago''{{'}}s [[sister ship]], ''Takao'', with another spread of torpedoes. At 05:56, ''Dace'' made four torpedo hits on the heavy cruiser ''Maya'' (sister to ''Atago'' and ''Takao'').<ref name = \"Morison1956\" />\n\n''Atago'' and ''Maya'' quickly sank.<ref name = \"TakaoClass\">{{cite web |first = Hiroshi |last = Nishida |url = http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0332.htm |title = Hashimoto, Shintaro |year = 2002 |work = Imperial Japanese Navy |access-date = 6 June 2011 |archive-url = https://archive.is/20130104063042/http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0332.htm |archive-date = 4 January 2013 |url-status = dead }}</ref> ''Atago'' sank so rapidly that Kurita was forced to swim to survive.

On 24 October, as the submarines continued to shadow the damaged cruiser, ''Darter'' ran aground on the Bombay Shoal. All efforts to get her off failed, she was abandoned; and her entire crew was rescued by ''Dace''. Efforts to scuttle ''Darter'' failed over the course of the next week, including torpedoes from ''Dace'' and {{USS|Rock||2}} that hit the reef (and not ''Darter'') and deck-gun shelling from ''Dace'' and later, {{USS|Nautilus|SS-168|2}}. After multiple hits from his [[6\"/53 caliber gun|6-inch deck guns]], the ''Nautilus'' commander determined on 31 October that the equipment on ''Darter'' was only good for scrap and left her there. The Japanese did not bother with the wreck.\n\n''Takao'' retired to Singapore, being joined in January 1945 by ''My\u014dk\u014d'', as the Japanese deemed both crippled cruisers irreparable and left them moored in the harbor as floating anti-aircraft batteries.\n\n==Battle of the Sibuyan Sea (24 October 1944)==\n[[File:Japanese battleship Musashi cropped.jpg|thumb|{{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} departing Brunei in October 1944 for the Battle of Leyte Gulf]]\n\nDespite its great strength, the U.S. 3rd Fleet was not well-placed to deal with the threat. On 22 October, Halsey had detached two of his carrier groups to the fleet base at [[Ulithi]] to provision and rearm. When ''Darter''{{'}}s contact report came in, Halsey recalled [[Ralph E. Davison|Davison's]] group, but allowed Vice Admiral [[John S. McCain Sr.|John S. McCain]], with the strongest of TF&nbsp;38's [[carrier group]]s, to continue towards Ulithi. Halsey finally recalled McCain on 24 October\u2014but the delay meant the most powerful American carrier group played little part in the coming battle and the 3rd Fleet was therefore effectively deprived of nearly 40% of its air strength for most of the engagement. On the morning of 24 October, only three groups were available to strike Kurita's force, and the one best positioned to do so\u2014[[Gerald F. Bogan]]'s Task Group 38.2 (TG&nbsp;38.2)\u2014was by mischance the weakest of the groups, containing only one large carrier\u2014{{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|6}}\u2014and two light carriers.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n[[File:Yamato hit by bomb.jpg|left|thumb|{{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} hit by a bomb near her forward gun turret in the Sibuyan Sea, 24 October 1944]]\n\nMeanwhile, Vice Admiral [[Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi]] directed three waves of aircraft from his [[First Air Fleet]] based on Luzon against the carriers of Rear Admiral [[Frederick Sherman]]'s TG&nbsp;38.3 (whose aircraft were also being used to strike airfields in Luzon to prevent Japanese land-based air attacks on Allied shipping in Leyte Gulf). Each of \u014cnishi's strike waves consisted of some 50 to 60 aircraft.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n[[File:USS Princeton (CVL-23) 1944 10 24 1523explosion.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|6}} explodes at 15:23.]]\n\nMost of the attacking Japanese planes were intercepted and shot down or driven off by Hellcats of Sherman's combat air patrol, most notably by two fighter sections from {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}} led by Commander [[David McCampbell]] (who shot down a record nine of the attacking planes in this one action, after which he managed to return and land ''in extremis'' on {{USS|Langley|CVL-27|6}} because the ''Essex''{{'}}s deck was too busy to accommodate him although he had run short of fuel).\n\nHowever, one Japanese aircraft (a [[Yokosuka D4Y]]3 ''Judy'') slipped through the defences, and at 09:38 hit the light carrier {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|6}} with a {{convert|551|lb|kg|abbr=on}} armor-piercing bomb. The resulting explosion caused a severe fire in ''Princeton''{{'}}s hangar and her emergency sprinkler system failed to operate. As the fire spread rapidly, a series of secondary explosions followed. The fire was gradually brought under control, but at 15:23 there was an enormous explosion (probably in the carrier's bomb stowage aft), causing more casualties aboard ''Princeton'', and even heavier casualties\u2014233 dead and 426 wounded\u2014aboard the light cruiser {{USS|Birmingham|CL-62|2}} which was coming back alongside to assist with the firefighting. ''Birmingham'' was so badly damaged, she was forced to retire. Another light cruiser and two destroyers were also damaged. All efforts to save ''Princeton'' failed, and after the remaining crew members were evacuated, she was finally [[Scuttling|scuttled]]\u2014torpedoed by the light cruiser {{USS|Reno|CL-96|2}}\u2014at 17:50.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> Of ''Princeton''{{'s}} crew, 108 men were killed, while 1,361 survivors were rescued by nearby ships. USS ''Princeton'' was the largest American ship lost during the battles around Leyte Gulf, and the only {{sclass-|Independence|aircraft carrier|0}} fast carrier sunk in combat during the war.\n\n[[File:Musashi under fire.jpg|thumb|left|''Musashi'' under aerial bombardment]]\n\nPlanes from the carriers ''Intrepid'' and {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|2}} of Bogan's group attacked at about 10:30 scoring hits on the battleships ''Nagato'', ''Yamato'', and ''Musashi'', and badly damaging the heavy cruiser ''My\u014dk\u014d'' which retired to Borneo via Coron Bay. A second wave from ''Intrepid'', {{USS|Essex|CV-9|2}} and {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}} later attacked, with VB-15 Helldivers and VF-15 Hellcats from ''Essex'', scoring another 10 hits on ''Musashi''. As she withdrew, listing to port, a third wave from ''Enterprise'' and {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}} hit her with an additional 11 bombs and eight torpedoes.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> After being struck by at least 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes, ''Musashi'' finally capsized and sank at about 19:30.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nIn all, five CV fleet carriers and one light CVL of the U.S. 3rd Fleet flew 259 sorties with bombs carried by Helldivers and torpedoes launched by TBF Avengers against Center Force on 24 October, but this weight of attack was not nearly sufficient to neutralize the threat from Kurita. The largest effort of the Sibuyan Sea attack was directed against just one battleship, ''Musashi'', which was sunk, and the cruiser ''My\u014dk\u014d'' was also crippled by an aerial torpedo. Nevertheless, every other ship in Kurita's force remained battleworthy and able to advance.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> It would be the desperate action and great sacrifice of the much weaker force of six slow escort carriers, three destroyers, four destroyer escorts, and 400 aircraft at the [[Battle off Samar]], utterly lacking in credible weapons to sink armored ships, to stop Kurita. It also contrasts with the 527 sorties flown by 3rd Fleet against Ozawa's much weaker carrier decoy Northern Force on the following day.\n\nKurita turned his fleet around to get out of range of the aircraft, passing the crippled ''Musashi'' as his force retreated. Halsey assumed that this retreat signified that his threat was dealt with for the time being. Kurita, however, waited until 17:15 before turning around again to head for the San Bernardino Strait. As a result of a momentous decision taken by Admiral Halsey and some unclear communication of his plans, Kurita was able to proceed through the San Bernardino Strait during the night to make an unexpected and dramatic appearance off the coast of [[Samar (island)|Samar]] the following morning, directly threatening the Leyte landings.<ref>{{cite web|first = Klemen | last = L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/kurita.html |title= Rear-Admiral Takeo Kurita  |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942}}</ref>\n\n==Task Force 34 / San Bernardino Strait==\nAfter the Japanese Southern and Center forces had been detected, but before it had been engaged or Ozawa's carriers had been located, Halsey and the staff of 3rd Fleet, aboard the battleship {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}, prepared a contingency plan to deal with the threat from Kurita's Center Force. Their intention was to cover the San Bernardino Strait with a powerful task force of fast battleships supported by two of the 3rd Fleet's equally swift carrier groups. The battleship force was to be designated Task Force 34 (TF 34) and to consist of four battleships, five cruisers, and 14 destroyers under the command of Vice Admiral [[Willis A. Lee]]. Rear Admiral [[Ralph E. Davison]] of TG 38.4 was to be in overall command of the supporting carrier groups.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee Jr.|first=VADM David A.|title=Report of Operations of Task Force Thirty-Four During the Period 6 October 1944 to 3 November 1944|url=http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Leyte/TF-34-Leyte.html|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt 15:12 on 24 October, Halsey sent an ambiguously worded [[Radioteletype|telegraphic]] radio message to his subordinate task group commanders giving details of this contingency plan:\n\n{{quote|text=BATDIV 7 MIAMI, VINCENNES, BILOXI, DESRON 52 LESS STEVEN POTTER, FROM TG 38.2 AND WASHINGTON, ALABAMA, WICHITA, NEW ORLEANS, DESDIV 100, PATTERSON, BAGLEY FROM TG 38.4 WILL BE FORMED AS TASK FORCE 34 UNDER VICE ADMIRAL LEE, COMMANDER BATTLE LINE.

HALSEY, OTC IN NEW JERSEY.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>}}\n\nHalsey sent information copies of this message to Admiral Nimitz at Pacific Fleet headquarters and Admiral King in Washington, but he did not include Admiral Kinkaid (7th Fleet) as an information addressee.<ref name=\"Cutler1994\"/>{{rp|110}} The message was picked up by 7th Fleet anyway as it was common for admirals to direct radio operators to copy all message traffic they detected whether intended for them or not. Because Halsey intended TF 34 as a contingency to be formed and detached ''when'' he ordered it, by writing \"will be formed,\" he meant the future tense, but he neglected to say when TF 34 ''would'' be formed or under what circumstances. This omission led Admiral Kinkaid of 7th Fleet to believe Halsey was speaking in the present tense, so he concluded TF 34 ''had been formed'' and would take station off the San Bernardino Strait. Kinkaid's light escort carrier group, lacking battleships for naval action and set up to attack ground troops and submarines, not capital ships, positioned itself south of the strait to support the invasion force. Admiral Nimitz, in Pearl Harbor, reached exactly the same conclusion.\n\nHalsey did send out a second message at 17:10 clarifying his intentions in regard to TF 34:\n\n{{quote|text=IF THE ENEMY SORTIES (THROUGH SAN {{sic|?|BERNADINO}} STRAIT) TF 34 WILL BE FORMED WHEN DIRECTED BY ME.<ref name=\"Cutler1994\"/>{{rp|111}}}}\n\nUnfortunately, Halsey sent this second message by [[Amplitude modulation|voice]] [[VHF|radio]], so 7th Fleet did not intercept it (due to the range [[Line-of-sight_propagation|limitations]] of  the ship-to-ship voice radio networks in use at the time) and Halsey did not follow up with a telegraphic message to Nimitz or King, or vitally, Kinkaid. The serious misunderstanding caused by Halsey's imperfect wording of his first message and his failure to notify Nimitz, King, or Kinkaid of his second clarifying message was to have a profound influence on the subsequent course of the battle as Kurita's major force almost overwhelmed Kinkaid's unprepared lighter force on the doorstep of the Leyte Marine landings.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/><ref name=\"Cutler1994\"/>{{rp|111}}\n\n==Halsey's decision (24 October 1944)==\nThe 3rd Fleet's aircraft failed to locate Ozawa's Northern Force until 16:40 on 24 October. This was largely because 3rd Fleet had been preoccupied with attacking Kurita's sizeable Center Force and defending itself against the Japanese air strikes from Luzon. Thus the one Japanese force that wanted to be discovered &ndash; Ozawa's tempting decoy of a large carrier group, which actually had only 108 aircraft &ndash; was the only force the Americans had not been able to find. On the evening of 24 October, Ozawa intercepted a (mistaken) American communication describing Kurita's withdrawal; he therefore began to withdraw, too. However, at 20:00, IJN Combined Fleet Admiral [[Soemu Toyoda]] ordered all his forces to attack \"counting on divine assistance.\" Trying to draw 3rd Fleet's attention to his decoy force, Ozawa reversed course again and headed southward towards Leyte.\n\nHalsey fell for the Japanese decoy, convinced the Northern Force constituted the main Japanese threat, and he was determined to seize what he saw as a golden opportunity to destroy Japan's last remaining carrier strength. Believing the Center Force had been neutralized by 3rd Fleet's air strikes earlier in the day in the Sibuyan Sea, and its remnants were retiring, Halsey radioed (to Nimitz and Kinkaid):\n\n{{quote|text=CENTRAL FORCE HEAVILY DAMAGED ACCORDING TO STRIKE REPORTS.<br />AM PROCEEDING NORTH WITH THREE GROUPS TO ATTACK CARRIER FORCES AT DAWN<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>}}\n\nThe words \"with three groups\" proved dangerously misleading. In the light of the intercepted 15:12 24 October \"\u2026will be formed as Task Force 34\" message from Halsey, Admiral Kinkaid and his staff assumed, as did Admiral Nimitz at Pacific Fleet headquarters, that TF&nbsp;34\u2014commanded by [[Willis A. Lee|Lee]]\u2014had now been formed as a separate entity. They assumed that Halsey was leaving this powerful surface force guarding the San Bernardino Strait (and covering the Seventh Fleet's northern flank), while he took his three available carrier groups northwards in pursuit of the Japanese carriers. But Task Force 34 had not been detached from his other forces, and Lee's battleships were on their way northwards with the 3rd Fleet's carriers. As Woodward wrote: \"Everything was pulled out from San Bernardino Strait. Not so much as a picket destroyer was left\".<ref name=\"Woodward1947\"/>\n\n===Warning signs ignored===\nHalsey and his staff officers ignored information from a night reconnaissance aircraft operating from the light carrier {{USS|Independence|CVL-22|2}} that Kurita's powerful surface force had turned back towards the San Bernardino Strait, and that after a long blackout, the navigation lights in the strait had been turned on. When Rear Admiral [[Gerald F. Bogan]]\u2014commanding TG&nbsp;38.2\u2014radioed this information to Halsey's flagship, he was rebuffed by a staff officer, who tersely replied \"Yes, yes, we have that information.\" Vice Admiral Lee, who had correctly deduced that Ozawa's force was on a decoy mission and indicated this in a blinker message to Halsey's flagship, was similarly rebuffed. [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Arleigh Burke]] and Commander [[James H. Flatley]] of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Marc Mitscher]]'s staff had come to the same conclusion. They were sufficiently worried about the situation to wake Mitscher, who asked, \"Does Admiral Halsey have that report?\" On being told that Halsey did, Mitscher\u2014knowing Halsey's temperament\u2014commented, \"If he wants my advice he'll ask for it\" and went back to sleep.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nThe entire available strength of 3rd Fleet continued to steam northwards, leaving the San Bernardino Strait completely unguarded. Nothing lay between the battleships of Kurita's Center Force now steaming towards the American landing vessels in Leyte Gulf, except for Kinkaid's vulnerable escort carrier group off the [[#Battle off Samar (25 October 1944)|coast of Samar]].\n\n==Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October 1944)==\n{{See also|Leyte Gulf order of battle#24-25 Oct \u2013 Battle of Surigao Strait|l1=Leyte Gulf order of battle}}\n[[File:Surigao straight.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.1|The Battle of Surigao Strait]]\n\nThe Battle of Surigao Strait is significant as the last battleship-to-battleship action in history. The Battle of Surigao Strait was one of only two battleship-versus-battleship naval battles in the entire Pacific campaign of World War II (the other being the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal#Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 14\u201315 November|naval battle]] during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], where the {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|6}} and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}} sank the {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima}}). It was also the last battle in which one force (in this case, the U.S. Navy) was able to \"[[Crossing the T|cross the T]]\" of its opponent. However, by the time that the battleship action was joined, the Japanese line was very ragged and consisted of only one battleship (''Yamashiro''), one heavy cruiser, and one destroyer, so that the \"crossing of the T\" was notional and had little effect on the outcome of the battle.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/><ref name=\"Sauer1999\">Sauer, Howard (1999). The Last Big Gun Naval Battle: The Battle of Surigao Strait. Glencannon Press</ref>\n\n===Japanese Forces===\nNishimura's \"Southern Force\" consisted of the old battleships {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Fus\u014d||2}}, the heavy cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Mogami|1934|2}}, and four destroyers,<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Shigure|1935|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Michishio||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asagumo|1937|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yamagumo|1937|2}}. This task force left Brunei after Kurita at 15:00 on 22 October, turning eastward into the [[Sulu Sea]] and then northeasterly past the southern tip of [[Negros Island]] into the [[Mindanao Sea]]. Nishimura then proceeded northeastward with [[Mindanao Island]] to [[starboard]] and into the south entrance to the Surigao Strait, intending to exit the north entrance of the Strait into [[Leyte Gulf]] where he would add his firepower to that of Kurita's force.\n\nThe Japanese Second Striking Force was commanded by Vice Admiral [[Kiyohide Shima]] and comprised heavy cruisers {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Nachi||2}} (flag) and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Ashigara||2}}, the light cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Abukuma||2}}, and the destroyers {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Akebono|1930|2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Ushio|1930|2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Kasumi|1937|2}}, and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Shiranui|1938|2}}.\n\nThe Japanese Southern Force was attacked by U.S. Navy bombers on 24 October but sustained only minor damage.\n\nNishimura was unable to synchronise his movements with Shima and Kurita because of the strict radio silence imposed on the Center and Southern Forces. When he entered the Surigao Strait at 02:00, Shima was {{convert|25|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} behind him and Kurita was still in the Sibuyan Sea, several hours from the beaches at Leyte.\n\n===Engagement===\nAs the Japanese Southern Force approached the Surigao Strait, it ran into a deadly trap set by the U.S. 7th Fleet Support Force. Rear Admiral [[Jesse Oldendorf]] had a substantial force comprising \n\n* six battleships: {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}, {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}}, {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}, {{USS|Tennessee|BB-43|2}}, {{USS|California|BB-44|2}}, and {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}} which carried 48 14-inch (356 mm) and 16 16-inch (406 mm) guns;\n* four [[heavy cruiser]]s {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|6}} (flagship), {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}}, {{USS|Minneapolis|CA-36|2}}, and [[HMS Shropshire (83)|HMAS ''Shropshire'']] which carried 35 8-inch (203&nbsp;mm) guns;\n* four [[light cruiser]]s {{USS|Denver|CL-58|2}}, {{USS|Columbia|CL-56|2}}, {{USS|Phoenix|CL-46|2}}, and {{USS|Boise|CL-47|2}} which carried 54 6-inch (152&nbsp;mm) guns; and\n* 28 destroyers and 39 motor torpedo boats ([[PT boat|Patrol/Torpedo (PT) boats]]) with smaller guns and torpedoes.\n\nOf the six battleships all except ''Mississippi'' (which had been in Iceland on convoy-escort duty at the time) had been sunk or damaged in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and subsequently repaired or, in the case of ''Tennessee'', ''California'', and ''West Virginia,'' rebuilt.  To pass through the narrows and reach the invasion shipping, Nishimura would have to run the gauntlet of torpedoes from the PT boats and destroyers before advancing into the concentrated fire of 14 battleships and cruisers deployed across the far mouth of the Strait.<ref name=\"Morison1956\" />\n\nAt 22:36, ''PT-131'' (Ensign Peter Gadd) was operating off [[Bohol]] when it made contact with the approaching Japanese ships. The PT boats made repeated attacks for more than three and a half hours as Nishimura's force streamed northward. No torpedo hits were scored, but the PT boats did send contact reports which were of use to Oldendorf and his force.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nNishimura's ships passed unscathed through the gauntlet of PT boats. However, their luck ran out a short time later, as they were subjected to devastating torpedo attacks from the American destroyers deployed on both sides of their axis of advance. At about 03:00, both Japanese battleships were hit by torpedoes. ''Yamashiro'' was able to steam on, but ''Fus\u014d'' was torpedoed by {{USS|Melvin|DD-680|6}} and fell out of formation, sinking forty minutes later. Two of Nishimura's four destroyers were sunk; the destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asagumo|1937|2}} was hit and forced to retire, but later sank.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\n===Sinking of the ''Fus\u014d''===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe traditional account of the sinking of the ''Fus\u014d'' was that she exploded into two halves that remained floating for some time. However, ''Fus\u014d'' survivor Hideo Ogawa, interrogated in 1945, in an article on the battleship's last voyage, stated: \"Shortly after 0400 the ship capsized slowly to starboard and Ogawa and others were washed away,\" without specifically mentioning the dissection. ''Fus\u014d'' was hit on the starboard side by two or possibly three torpedoes. One of these started an oil fire, and as the fuel used by IJN ships was poorly refined and easily ignited, burning patches of fuel could have led to the description from Allied observers of ''Fus\u014d'' \"blowing up\". However, battleships were known to sometimes be cut into two or even three sections which could remain afloat independently, and Samuel Morison states that the bow half of ''Fus\u014d'' was sunk by gunfire from ''Louisville'', and the stern half sank off Kanihaan Island.\n\n[[File:USS West Virginia (BB-48) firing during the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944.jpg|thumb|{{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|6}} firing on the Japanese fleet]]\n\n===Battle continues===\nAt 03:16, ''West Virginia''{{'}}s radar picked up the surviving ships of Nishimura's force at a range of {{convert|42000|yd|m|abbr=on}}.

''Maryland'' eventually succeeded in visually ranging on the splashes of the other battleships' shells, and then fired a total of 48 {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} projectiles.

Shima's run was initially thrown into confusion by his force nearly running aground on [[Panaon Island]] after failing to factor the outgoing tide into their approach. Japanese radar was almost useless due to excessive reflections from the many islands. The American radar was equally unable to detect ships in these conditions, especially PT boats, but ''PT-137'' hit the light cruiser ''Abukuma'' with a torpedo that crippled her and caused her to fall out of formation. Shima's two heavy cruisers, ''Nachi'' and ''Ashigara'', and eight destroyers<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> next encountered remnants of Nishimura's force. Shima saw what he thought were the wrecks of both Nishimura's battleships and ordered a retreat. His [[flagship]] ''Nachi'' collided with ''Mogami'', flooding ''Mogami''{{'}}s steering room and causing her to fall behind in the retreat; she was further damaged by American carrier aircraft the next morning, abandoned, and [[scuttling|scuttled]] by a torpedo from ''Akebono''.\n\n=== Results ===\nOf Nishimura's seven ships, only ''Shigure'' survived long enough to escape the debacle, but eventually succumbed to the American submarine {{USS|Blackfin|SS-322|2}} on 24 January 1945, which sank her off [[Kota Bharu]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], with 37 dead.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/><ref name=\"Sauer1999\"/> Shima's ships did survive the Battle of Surigao Strait, but they were sunk in further engagements around Leyte. The Southern Force provided no further threat to the Leyte landings.\n\n==Battle off Samar (25 October 1944)==\n{{Main|Battle off Samar}}\n{{See also|Leyte Gulf order of battle#25 Oct \u2013 Battle off Samar|l1=Leyte Gulf order of battle}}\n[[File:Samar.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.4|The Battle off Samar]]\n\n===Prelude===\nHalsey's decision to take all the available strength of 3rd Fleet northwards to attack the carriers of the Japanese Northern Force had left San Bernardino Strait completely unguarded.\n\nSenior officers in 7th Fleet (including Kinkaid and his staff) generally assumed Halsey was taking his three available carrier groups northwards (McCain's group, the strongest in 3rd Fleet, was still returning from the direction of [[Ulithi]]), but leaving the battleships of TF 34 covering the San Bernardino Strait against the Japanese Center Force. In fact, Halsey had not yet formed TF 34, and all six of Willis Lee's battleships were on their way northwards with the carriers, as well as every available cruiser and destroyer of the Third Fleet.\n\nKurita's Center Force therefore emerged unopposed from San Bernardino Strait at 03:00 on 25 October and steamed southward along the coast of the island of [[Samar (island)|Samar]]. In its path stood only the 7th Fleet's three escort carrier units (call signs 'Taffy' 1, 2, and 3), with a total of sixteen small, very slow, and unarmored [[escort carrier]]s, which carried up to 28 airplanes each, protected by a screen of lightly armed and unarmored destroyers and smaller [[destroyer escort]]s (DEs). Despite the losses in the Palawan Passage and Sibuyan Sea actions, the Japanese Center Force was still very powerful, consisting of four battleships (including the giant {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}), six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers and eleven destroyers.<ref name=\"Hornfischer2004\"/>\n\n===Battle===\nKurita's force caught Rear Admiral [[Clifton Sprague]]'s Task Unit 77.4.3 ('Taffy 3') by surprise. Sprague directed his carriers to launch their planes, then run for the cover of a rain squall to the east. He ordered the destroyers and DEs to make a smoke screen to conceal the retreating carriers.\n\nKurita, unaware that Ozawa's decoy plan had succeeded, assumed he had found a carrier group from Halsey's 3rd Fleet. Having just redeployed his ships into anti-aircraft formation, he further complicated matters by ordering a \"General Attack\", which called for his fleet to split into divisions and attack independently.<ref name=\"Thomas2006\">{{cite book |title=Sea of Thunder: Four Commanders and the last Great Naval Campaign, 1941\u20131945 |last=Thomas |first=Evan |year=2006 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-5221-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/seaofthunderfour00thom }}</ref>\n\nThe destroyer {{USS|Johnston|DD-557|6}} was the closest to the enemy. On his own initiative, [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Ernest E. Evans]] steered his hopelessly outclassed ship into the Japanese fleet at [[flank speed]]. ''Johnston'' fired its torpedoes at the heavy cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kumano||2}}, damaging her and forcing her out of line. Seeing this, Sprague gave the order \"small boys attack\", sending the rest of Taffy 3's screening ships into the fray. Taffy 3's two other destroyers, {{USS|Hoel|DD-533|2}} and {{USS|Heermann|DD-532|2}}, and the destroyer escort {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|DE-413|2}}, attacked with suicidal determination, drawing fire and disrupting the Japanese formation as ships turned to avoid their torpedoes. As the ships approached the enemy columns, Lt. Cdr. Copeland of ''Samuel B. Roberts'' told all hands via bull horn that this would be \"a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival could not be expected.\"<ref>{{cite book | last1=Woodward | first1=C.

After expending all of its torpedoes, ''Johnston'' continued to fight with its 5-inch guns, until it was sunk by a group of Japanese destroyers.\n\nAs they were preparing their aircraft for attack, the escort carriers returned the Japanese fire with all the firepower they had \u2013 one 5 in. gun per carrier. The officer in tactical command had instructed the carriers to \"open with pea shooters,\" and each ship took an enemy vessel under fire as soon as it came within range. {{USS|Fanshaw Bay|CVE-70|2}} fired on a cruiser, and is believed to have registered five hits, one amid the superstructure that caused smoke. {{USS|Kalinin Bay|CVE-68|2}} targeted a {{sclass-|My\u014dk\u014d|cruiser|0}} heavy cruiser, claiming a hit on the cruiser's No. 2 turret, with a second just below the first. {{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73|2}} sighted a cruiser, and claimed at least three hits. {{USS|White Plains|CVE-66|2}} reported hits on multiple targets, two between the superstructure and forward stack and another on the No. 1 turret of a heavy cruiser.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Woodward | first1=C.

Sprague|Thomas Sprague]] (no relation to Clifton) ordered the sixteen escort carriers in his three task units to immediately launch all their aircraft \u2013 totaling 450 planes \u2013 equipped with whatever weapons they had available, even if these were only machine guns or depth charges. The escort carriers had planes more suited for patrol and anti-submarine duties, including older models such as the FM-2 Wildcat, although they also had the TBM Avenger torpedo bombers, in contrast to Halsey's fleet carriers which had the newest aircraft with ample anti-shipping ordnance. However, the fact that the Japanese force had no air cover meant that Sprague's planes could attack unopposed by Japanese fighter aircraft. Consequently, the air counterattacks were almost unceasing, and some, especially several of the strikes launched from [[Felix Stump]]'s Task Unit 77.4.2 (Taffy 2), were heavy.\n\nThe carriers of Taffy 3 turned south and retreated through the shellfire. {{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73|2}}, at the rear of the American formation, became the focus of the battleship ''Yamato'' and sustained multiple hits before capsizing at 09:07. Several other carriers were damaged but were able to escape.\n\n===Admiral Kurita withdraws===\nThe ferocity of the American defense seemingly confirmed the Japanese assumption that they were engaging major fleet units rather than merely escort carriers and destroyers. The confusion of the \"General Attack\" order was compounded by the air and torpedo attacks, when Kurita's flagship ''Yamato'' turned north to evade torpedoes and lost contact with the battle.\n\nKurita abruptly broke off the fight and gave the order 'all ships, my course north, speed 20', apparently to regroup his disorganized fleet. Kurita's battle report stated he had received a message indicating a group of American carriers was steaming north of him. Preferring to expend his fleet against capital ships rather than transports, Kurita set out in pursuit and thereby lost his opportunity to destroy the shipping fleet in Leyte Gulf, and disrupt the vital landings at Leyte. After failing to intercept the non-existent carriers, which were much farther north, Kurita finally retreated towards San Bernardino Strait. Three of his heavy cruisers had been sunk, and the determined resistance had convinced him that persisting with his attack would only cause further Japanese losses.\n\nPoor communication between the separate Japanese forces and a lack of air reconnaissance meant that Kurita was never informed that the deception had been successful, and that only a small and outgunned force stood between his battleships and the vulnerable transports of the invasion fleet. Thus, Kurita remained convinced that he had been engaging elements of the 3rd Fleet, and it would only be a matter of time before Halsey surrounded and annihilated him.<ref name=\"Thomas2006\"/> Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague wrote to his colleague Aubrey Fitch after the war, \"I ... stated [to Admiral Nimitz] that the main reason they turned north was that they were receiving too much damage to continue and I am still of that opinion and cold analysis will eventually confirm it.\"<ref name=\"Hornfischer2004\"/>\n\n[[File:USS St Lo (CVE-63) 2.jpg|thumb|{{USS|St. Lo|CVE-63|2}} exploded after a ''[[kamikaze]]'' strike.]]\n\nAlmost all of Kurita's surviving force escaped. Halsey and the 3rd Fleet battleships returned too late to cut him off. ''Nagato'' and ''Kong\u014d'' had been moderately damaged by air attack from Taffy 3's escort carriers. Kurita had begun the battle with five battleships. On their return to their bases, only ''Yamato'' and ''Haruna'' remained battleworthy.\n\nAs the desperate surface action was coming to an end, Vice Admiral [[Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi]] put his [[Japanese Special Attack Units]] into operation from bases on Luzon island, launching ''kamikaze'' attacks against the Allied ships in Leyte Gulf and the escort carrier units off Samar. The escort carrier {{USS|St. Lo|CVE-63|2}} of Taffy&nbsp;3 was hit by a ''kamikaze'' aircraft and sank after a series of internal explosions.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/><ref name=\"Hornfischer2004\"/>\n\n==Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o (25\u201326 October 1944)==\n{{See also|Leyte Gulf order of battle#25 Oct \u2013 Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o|l1=Leyte Gulf order of battle}}\n<!-- Battle off Cape Engano and Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o link here. -->\n[[File:Zuikaku at Cape Engano.jpg|thumb|The Japanese aircraft carriers {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}, left, and (probably) {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuih\u014d||2}} come under attack by dive bombers early in the Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o.]]\n\nVice-Admial [[Jisabur\u014d Ozawa]]'s \"Northern Force\", built around the four aircraft carriers of the [[Third Carrier Division|3rd Carrier Division]] ({{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}\u2014the last survivor of the [[1st Air Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy#Kido Butai|six carriers]] that had attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941\u2014and the light carriers {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuih\u014d||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Chitose||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Chiyoda||2}}), included two [[World War I]] battleships partially converted to carriers ({{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hy\u016bga||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Ise||2}}\u2014the two aft turrets had been replaced by a hangar, aircraft handling deck and catapult, but neither ship carried any aircraft in this battle), three light cruisers ({{Ship|Japanese cruiser|\u014cyodo||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tama||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Isuzu||2}}), and nine destroyers. Ozawa's carrier group was a decoy force, divested of all but 108 aircraft, intended to lure the American fleet away from protecting the transports at the landing beaches on Leyte island.\n\nOzawa's force was not located until 16:40 on 24 October, largely because Sherman's TG&nbsp;38.3\u2014which was the northernmost of Halsey's groups\u2014was responsible for searches in this sector. The force that Halsey was taking north with him\u2014three groups of Mitscher's TF&nbsp;38\u2014was overwhelmingly stronger than the Japanese Northern Force. Between them, these groups had five large [[aircraft carrier|fleet carriers]] ({{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|2}}, {{USS|Franklin|CV-13|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, and {{USS|Essex|CV-9|2}}), five light carriers ({{USS|Independence|CVL-22|2}}, {{USS|Belleau Wood|CVL-24|2}}, {{USS|Langley|CVL-27|2}}, {{USS|Cabot|CVL-28|2}}, and {{USS|San Jacinto|CVL-30|2}}), six modern [[battleship]]s ({{USS|Alabama|BB-60|2}}, {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|2}}, {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|2}}, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}, {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}}, and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}}), eight cruisers (two heavy and six light), and more than 40 destroyers.

As dawn approached, the ships of Task Force 34 drew ahead of the carrier groups. Halsey intended Mitscher to make air strikes followed by the heavy gunfire of Lee's battleships.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nAround dawn on 25 October, Ozawa launched 75 aircraft, the bulk of his few aircraft, to attack the 3rd Fleet. Most were shot down by American combat air patrols, and no damage was done to the U.S. ships. A few Japanese planes survived and made their way to land bases on Luzon.\n\nDuring the night, Halsey had passed tactical command of TF&nbsp;38 to Admiral Mitscher, who ordered the American carrier groups to launch their first strike wave, of 180 aircraft, at dawn\u2014before the Northern Force had been located. When the search aircraft made contact at 07:10, this strike wave was orbiting ahead of the task force. At 08:00, as the attack went in, its escorting fighters destroyed Ozawa's combat air patrol of about 30 planes. The U.S. air strikes continued until the evening, by which time TF&nbsp;38 had flown 527 sorties against the Northern Force, sinking ''Zuikaku'', the light carriers ''Chitose'' and ''Zuih\u014d'', and the destroyer ''Akizuki'', all with heavy loss of life. The light carrier ''Chiyoda'' and the cruiser ''Tama'' were crippled. Ozawa transferred his flag to the light cruiser ''\u014cyodo''.\n\n===Crisis \u2013 U.S. 7th Fleet's calls for help===\nShortly after 08:00 on 25 October, desperate messages calling for assistance began to come in from 7th Fleet, which had been engaging Nishimura's \"Southern Force\" in [[#Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October 1944)|battle in Surigao Strait]] since 02:00. One message from Kinkaid, sent in plain language, read: \"My situation is critical. Fast battleships and support by air strikes may be able to keep enemy from destroying CVES and entering Leyte.\" Halsey recalled in his memoirs that he was shocked at this message, recounting that the radio signals from the 7th Fleet had come in at random and out of order because of a backlog in the signals office. It seems that he did not receive this vital message from Kinkaid until around 10:00. Halsey later claimed he knew Kinkaid was in trouble, but he had not dreamed of the seriousness of this crisis.\n\nOne of the most alarming signals from Kinkaid reported, after their action in Surigao Strait, 7th Fleet's own battleships were critically low on ammunition. Even this failed to persuade Halsey to send any immediate assistance to the powerful 7th Fleet.<ref name=\"Woodward1947\"/><ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> In fact, the 7th Fleet's battleships were not as short of ammunition as Kinkaid's signal implied,<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> but Halsey did not know that.\n\nFrom {{convert|3000|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away in Pearl Harbor, Admiral Nimitz had been monitoring the desperate calls from Taffy&nbsp;3, and sent Halsey a terse message: \"TURKEY TROTS TO WATER GG FROM CINCPAC ACTION COM THIRD FLEET INFO COMINCH CTF SEVENTY-SEVEN X WHERE IS RPT WHERE IS TASK FORCE THIRTY FOUR RR [[The world wonders|THE WORLD WONDERS]].\" The first four words and the last three were \"padding\" used to confuse enemy [[cryptanalysis]] (the beginning and end of the true message was marked by double consonants). The communications staff on Halsey's flagship correctly deleted the first section of padding but mistakenly retained the last three words in the message finally handed to Halsey. The last three words\u2014probably selected by a communications officer at Nimitz's headquarters\u2014may have been meant as a loose quote from [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson's]] poem on \"[[Charge of the Light Brigade|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]\", suggested by the coincidence that this day, 25 October, was the 90th anniversary of the [[Battle of Balaclava]]\u2014and was not intended as a commentary on the current crisis off Leyte. Halsey, however, when reading the message, thought that the last words\u2014\"THE WORLD WONDERS\"\u2014were a biting piece of criticism from Nimitz, threw his cap to the deck and broke into \"sobs of rage\". Rear Admiral [[Robert Carney]], his Chief of Staff, confronted him, telling Halsey \"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together.\"\n\nEventually, at 11:15, more than three hours after the first distress messages from 7th Fleet had been received by his flagship, Halsey ordered TF&nbsp;34 to turn around and head southwards towards Samar. At this point, Lee's battleships were almost within gun range of Ozawa's force. Two-and-a-half hours were then spent refuelling TF&nbsp;34's accompanying destroyers.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nAfter this succession of delays it was too late for TF&nbsp;34 to give any practical help to 7th Fleet, other than to assist in picking up survivors from Taffy&nbsp;3, and too late even to intercept Kurita's force before it made its escape through San Bernardino Strait.\n\nNevertheless, at 16:22, in a desperate and even more belated attempt to intervene in the events off Samar, Halsey formed a new task group\u2014TG&nbsp;34.5\u2014under Rear Admiral [[Oscar C. Badger II]],<ref>{{cite book | title=The Battle for Leyte, 1944 | first=Milan | last=Vego | publisher=Naval Institute Press | location=Annapolis, Maryland | date=2006 | page=284 | isbn=1-55750-885-2 }}</ref> built around Third Fleet's two fastest battleships\u2014''Iowa'' and ''New Jersey'', both capable of a speed of more than {{convert|32|kn}}\u2014and TF&nbsp;34's three cruisers and eight destroyers, and sped southwards, leaving Lee and the other four battleships to follow. As Morison observes, if Badger's group had succeeded in intercepting the Japanese Center Force it may have been outmatched by Kurita's battleships.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nCruisers and destroyers of TG&nbsp;34.5, however, caught the {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Nowaki|1940|6}}\u2014the last straggler from Center Force\u2014off San Bernardino Strait, and sank her with all hands, including the survivors from ''Chikuma''.\n\n===Final actions===\nWhen Halsey turned TF&nbsp;34 southwards at 11:15, he detached a task group of four of its cruisers and nine of its destroyers under Rear Admiral DuBose, and reassigned this group to TF&nbsp;38. At 14:15, Mitscher ordered DuBose to pursue the remnants of the Japanese Northern Force. His cruisers finished off the light carrier ''Chiyoda'' at around 17:00, and at 20:59 his ships sank the destroyer ''Hatsuzuki'' after a very stubborn fight.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nWhen Admiral Ozawa learned of the deployment of DuBose's relatively weak task group, he ordered battleships ''Ise'' and ''Hy\u016bga'' to turn southwards and attack it, but they failed to locate DuBose's group, which they heavily outgunned. Halsey's withdrawal of all six of Lee's battleships in his attempt to assist Seventh Fleet had now rendered TF&nbsp;38 vulnerable to a surface counterattack by the decoy Northern Force.\n\nAt about 23:10, the American submarine {{USS|Jallao|SS-368|2}} torpedoed and sank the light cruiser ''Tama'' of Ozawa's force. This was the last act of the Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o, and\u2014apart from some final air strikes on the retreating Japanese forces on 26 October\u2014the conclusion of the Battle for Leyte Gulf.\n\n==Weighing the decisions of Halsey==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--Many paragraphs and some quotes have no citations.-->\n[[File:Admiral William F. Halsey.jpg|thumb|[[William F. Halsey|Admiral William F. \"Bull\" Halsey]] \u2013 Commander U.S. Third Fleet at Leyte Gulf]]\n\n===Criticism===\nHalsey was questioned for his decision to take TF&nbsp;34 north in pursuit of Ozawa, and for failing to detach it when Kinkaid first appealed for help. A piece of U.S. Navy slang for Halsey's actions is ''Bull's Run'', a phrase combining Halsey's newspaper nickname \"Bull\" (he was known as \"Bill\" Halsey) with an allusion to the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Bull Run]] in the [[American Civil War]], where Union troops lost the battle due to poor organization and lack of decisive action.\n\nClifton Sprague\u2014commander of Task Unit 77.4.3 in the Battle off Samar\u2014was later bitterly critical of Halsey's decision, and of his failure to clearly inform Kinkaid and 7th Fleet that their northern flank was no longer protected: \"In the absence of any information... it was logical to assume that our northern flank could not be exposed without ample warning.\" Regarding Halsey's failure to turn TF&nbsp;34 southwards when 7th Fleet's first calls for assistance off Samar were received, Morison writes:\n\n{{quote|text=If TF&nbsp;34 had been detached a few hours earlier, after Kinkaid's first urgent request for help, and had left the destroyers behind, since their fueling caused a delay of over two and a half hours, a powerful battle line of six modern battleships under the command of Admiral Lee, the most experienced battle squadron commander in the Navy, would have arrived off the San Bernardino Strait in time to have clashed with Kurita's Center Force\u2026 Apart from the accidents common in naval warfare, there is every reason to suppose that Lee would have \"crossed the T\" and completed the destruction of Center Force.\nThe mighty gunfire of the Third Fleet's Battle Line, greater than that of the whole Japanese Navy, was never brought into action except to finish off one or two crippled light ships.<ref>source Morison 1956. pp. 336\u2013337</ref><ref>Note: Task Group 34.5 in fact only finished off the straggling destroyer ''Nowaki'', and this was not achieved by the battleships, but rather by their accompanying cruisers and destroyers (Source: [http://www.history.navy.mil/ U.S. Naval Historical Center]).</ref>}}\n\nVice Admiral Lee said in his action report as Commander of TF&nbsp;34: \"No battle damage was incurred nor inflicted on the enemy by vessels while operating as Task Force Thirty-Four.\"<ref>[http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Leyte/TF-34-Leyte.html Task Force 34 Action Report: 26 October 1944 \u2013 3 November 1944]</ref>\n\n===Halsey's defense===\nIn his dispatch after the battle, Halsey justified the decision to go North as follows:\n\n::Searches by my carrier planes revealed the presence of the Northern carrier force on the afternoon of 24 October, which completed the picture of all enemy naval forces. As it seemed childish to me to guard statically San Bernardino Strait, I concentrated TF&nbsp;38 during the night and steamed north to attack the Northern Force at dawn.\n\n::I believed that the Center Force had been so heavily damaged in the Sibuyan Sea that it could no longer be considered a serious menace to Seventh Fleet.<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nHalsey also argued that he had feared leaving TF&nbsp;34 to defend the strait without carrier support as that would have left it vulnerable to attack from land-based aircraft, while leaving one of the fast carrier groups behind to cover the battleships would have significantly reduced the concentration of air power going north to strike Ozawa.\n\nHowever, Morison states that Admiral Lee said after the battle that he would have been fully prepared for the battleships to cover the San Bernardino Strait without 'any' large carrier support,<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/> as each of the escort carriers of TF&nbsp;77 had up to 28 planes on them, but little surface ship protection, from Kurita's traditional naval force, which lacked air support.\n\n===Potential mitigating factors===\nThe fact that Halsey was aboard one of the two fast battleships (''New Jersey''), and \"would have had to remain behind\" with TF&nbsp;34 while the bulk of his fleet charged northwards, may have influenced his decision, but it would have been perfectly feasible to have taken one or both of 3rd Fleet's two fastest battleships with some or all of the large carriers in the pursuit of Ozawa, while leaving the rest of the battle line off the San Bernardino Strait. Halsey's original plan for TF&nbsp;34 was for four, not all six, of the 3rd Fleet's battleships.\n\nHalsey was certainly philosophically against dividing his forces. He believed strongly in the current naval doctrine of concentration, as indicated by his writings both before World War II and in his subsequent articles and interviews defending his actions.<ref name=\"Cutler1994\"/> In addition, Halsey may well have been influenced by the recent criticisms of Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]], who was criticized for excessive caution in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], allowing the bulk of the Japanese fleet to escape. Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral [[Robert Carney|Robert \"Mick\" Carney]], was also wholeheartedly in favor of taking all of 3rd Fleet's available forces northwards to attack the Japanese carriers.\n\nHalsey also did not believe reports of just how badly compromised Japan's naval air power was, and had no idea that Ozawa's decoy force only had 100 aircraft. Although in a letter to Admiral Nimitz just three days before the Battle off Samar, Halsey wrote that Admiral Marc Mitscher believed \"Jap naval air was wiped out\",<ref name=\"Thomas 2006, p. 170\">Thomas 2006, p. 170</ref> which Admiral Spruance and Mitscher concluded from shooting down over 433 carrier based planes at the ''[[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Marianas Turkey Shoot]]'',<ref name=\"Thomas 2006, p. 170\"/> Halsey ignored Mitscher's insights, and later stated that he did not want to be \"[[Shuttle bombing|shuttle bombed]]\" by Ozawa's force (a technique whereby planes can land and rearm at bases on either side of a foe, allowing them to attack on both the outbound flight and the return), or to give them a \"free shot\" at the U.S. forces in Leyte Gulf.<ref name=\"Cutler1994\"/>\n\nHalsey may have considered Kurita's damaged battleships and cruisers, lacking carrier support, as little threat, but ironically, through his own failures to adequately communicate his intentions, he managed to demonstrate that unsupported battleships could still be dangerous.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kinkaid | first=VADM | title=Preliminary Action Report of Engagements in Leyte Gulf and off Samar Island on 25 October, 1944 | url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Leyte/TF-77-Leyte.html | accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Losses==\nMore than 1,000 sailors and aircrewmen of the Allied escort carrier units were killed.

After the nominal end of the battle, several damaged ships were faced with the option of either making their way to Singapore, close to Japan's oil supplies but where comprehensive repairs could not be undertaken, or making their way back to Japan where there were better repair facilities but scant oil. The cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kumano||2}} and battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kong\u014d||2}} were sunk retreating to Japan. Cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Takao|1930|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|My\u014dk\u014d||2}} were stranded, unrepairable, in Singapore. Many of the other survivors of the battle were bombed and sunk at anchor in Japan, unable to move without fuel.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:US Navy 041020-N-0493B-003 Backed by a monument marking the location of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines 60 years ago, a Philippine Marine Corps honor guard stands at attention during the playing of Taps.jpg|thumb|A 60th-anniversary memorial ceremony in [[Palo, Leyte]], [[Philippines]], on 20 October 2004]]\n\nThe Battle of Leyte Gulf secured the [[beachhead]]s of the [[U.S. Sixth Army]] on Leyte against attack from the sea. However, much hard fighting would be required before the island was completely in Allied hands at the end of December 1944: the [[Battle of Leyte]] on land was fought in parallel with an air and sea campaign in which the Japanese reinforced and resupplied their troops on Leyte while the Allies attempted to interdict them and establish air-sea superiority for a series of amphibious landings in [[Ormoc Bay]]\u2014engagements collectively referred to as the [[Battle of Ormoc Bay]].<ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy had suffered its greatest loss of ships and crew ever. Its failure to dislodge the Allied invaders from Leyte meant the inevitable loss of the Philippines, which in turn meant Japan would be all but cut off from its occupied territories in Southeast Asia. These territories provided resources that were vital to Japan, in particular the oil needed for her ships and aircraft. This problem was compounded because the shipyards and sources of manufactured goods, such as ammunition, were in Japan itself. Finally, the loss of Leyte opened the way for the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion]] of the [[Ryukyu Islands]] in 1945.<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/><ref name=\"Morison1956\"/>\n\nThe major IJN surface ships returned to their bases to languish, entirely or almost entirely inactive, for the remainder of the war. The only major operation by these surface ships between the Battle for Leyte Gulf and the Japanese surrender was the suicidal sortie in April 1945 (part of [[Operation Ten-Go]]), in which the battleship ''Yamato'' and her escorts were destroyed by American carrier aircraft.\n\nThe first use of ''kamikaze'' aircraft took place following the Leyte landings. A ''kamikaze'' hit the Australian [[heavy cruiser]] {{HMAS|Australia|1927|6}} on 21 October. Organized suicide attacks by the \"Special Attack Force\" ([[Japanese Special Attack Units]]) began on 25 October during the closing phase of the Battle off Samar, causing the destruction of the escort carrier ''St. Lo''.\n\n[[J.F.C. Fuller]], in his ''The Decisive Battles of the Western World'', writes of the outcome of Leyte Gulf:\n\n{{quote|The Japanese fleet had [effectively] ceased to exist, and, except by land-based aircraft, their opponents had won undisputed command of the sea.\n\nWhen Admiral Ozawa was questioned... after the war he replied 'After this battle the surface forces became strictly auxiliary, so that we relied on land forces, special [''Kamikaze''] attack, and air power... there was no further use assigned to surface vessels, with the exception of some special ships.'\n\nAnd Admiral Yonai, the Navy Minister, said he realised the defeat at Leyte 'was tantamount to the loss of the Philippines.'\n\nAs for the larger significance of the battle, he said, 'I felt that it was the end.'<ref name=\"Fuller1956\"/>}}\n\n==Memorials==\n* At the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]], in [[Alumni Hall (Navy)#Building features|Alumni Hall]], a concourse is dedicated to Lt. Lloyd Garnett and his shipmates on {{USS|Samuel B.

Frankland continued to contribute articles to [[academic journals]] beyond his official retirement and then his 100th birthday.<ref name=Lane/>\n\n===Hygiene hypothesis===\n\nFrankland believed that the rise in allergies results from increased cleanliness and the levels of hygiene in modern life \u2014 the so-called [[hygiene hypothesis]]. He has said that \"We don't set off our immune system early on, we are too clean. In the former [[East Germany]] for instance, with very poor work and housing conditions, people were less allergic.\"<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Pollen count===\n\nFrankland was keen to provide patients he saw in [[London]] with information about pollens, such as the levels of pollen on any given day, and the times of the year when levels would tend to be at their highest. [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information, and to complement the work on pollen counts already being measured in [[Cardiff]]. Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, via ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', from 1963.<ref name=Hekint>{{cite web| url= https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/| title= Grandfather of allergy: Dr. Bill Frankland, the ardent centenarian| last=Turner| first=John| publisher=Hektoen International| date=Spring 2019| accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nFrankland was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique that aims to reduce the level of immune response to [[allergens]] by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]''. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects that Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to [[venom]]-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland said that he could not recall a patient ever being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.nhs.uk/about-us/blog/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-william-frankland-pollen-count-alexander-fleming-70-years-nhs |title=Grandfather of allergy, Dr William Frankland, aged 106, on popularising the pollen count, working with Alexander Fleming and spending 70 years in the NHS |publisher=[[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] |date=5 July 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Frankland and Fleming were also concerned with [[antimicrobial resistance]] to penicillin, with Frankland crediting Fleming with saying that careless prescription would inadvertently lead to \"the death of man.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://healthwnews.com/health-news/discoverer-of-penicillin-foresaw-the-threat-of-antibiotic-resistance/ |title=Discoverer of penicillin foresaw the threat of antibiotic resistance |date=3 December 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020 |website=HealthWNews.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"[[Prophylaxis]] of summer [[Hay-fever]] and Asthma.\" The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A.

Contacted to visit a VIP in [[Baghdad]] having trouble with asthma, Frankland advised Hussein this was not the case and to give up his habit of 40 cigarettes a day. Frankland said that \"To my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state. I heard sometime later that he had had a disagreement with his secretary of state for health, so he took him outside and shot him.

After retiring from Guy's he continued to participate in academic life by attending conferences and publishing articles in journals.<ref name=Lane/>\n\nIn February 2012, Frankland appeared as an expert witness in a British court. The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a [[bee sting]]. Although Frankland agreed with the defence that such a scenario was possible, he gave an opinion that delayed-response reactions to bee stings only occurred after there had been initial symptoms following the sting. In this case, there had not been such symptoms, and the accused was found guilty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/worlds-oldest-expert-witness-william-frankland/story-fnb64oi6-1226283231827|title=World's oldest expert witness William Frankland|work=The Australian|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he appeared in an episode of the [[BBC 2]] TV series ''Britain's Greatest Generation'' and as a guest on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=David|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dmdnpp/britains-greatest-generation--series-1---3-the-fight-for-freedom|title=Britain's Greatest Generation: Series 1 \u2013 3.

Frankland continued to contribute articles to [[academic journals]] beyond his official retirement and then his 100th birthday.<ref name=Lane/>\n\n===Hygiene hypothesis===\n\nFrankland believed that the rise in allergies results from increased cleanliness and the levels of hygiene in modern life \u2014 the so-called [[hygiene hypothesis]]. He has said that \"We don't set off our immune system early on, we are too clean. In the former [[East Germany]] for instance, with very poor work and housing conditions, people were less allergic.\"<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Pollen count===\n\nFrankland was keen to provide patients he saw in [[London]] with information about pollens, such as the levels of pollen on any given day, and the times of the year when levels would tend to be at their highest. [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] employed a botanist to assist with collecting this information, and to complement the work on pollen counts already being measured in [[Cardiff]]. Weekly London pollen counts were sent to members of the British Allergy Society from 1953 and shared publicly, via ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', from 1963.<ref name=Hekint>{{cite web| url= https://hekint.org/2019/05/20/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-bill-frankland-the-ardent-centenarian/| title= Grandfather of allergy: Dr. Bill Frankland, the ardent centenarian| last=Turner| first=John| publisher=Hektoen International| date=Spring 2019| accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Self-experimentation===\n\nFrankland was also a supporter of the idea of [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitisation]], a technique that aims to reduce the level of immune response to [[allergens]] by repeated low doses of the substance to which the patient has an allergy. In 1955, Frankland experimented on himself by being bitten each day by the blood-sucking insect ''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]''. He was assisted in this work by the [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], which was able to supply insects that Frankland could be sure he had never previously been exposed to. The bites eventually provoked a severe [[anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsaci.org/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=134068&A=SearchResult&SearchID=1670263&\n|accessdate=16 April 2015|title= Dr A W (Bill) Frankland|publisher=British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immuniology}}</ref>\n\nThis research contributed to an understanding of how long injections of allergens would need to be given to achieve desensitisation. Results varied by individual, but immunity to pollen was found on average after three years. Immunity to [[venom]]-based allergens took longer, and was found on average after five years.<ref name=\"anaphlaxis campaign\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with Alexander Fleming===\n\nDuring the 1950s, Frankland served as an assistant to [[Alexander Fleming]] in the development of penicillin. The two had a daily meeting, but due to Fleming's lack of interest in clinical medicine, Frankland said that he could not recall a patient ever being discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.nhs.uk/about-us/blog/grandfather-of-allergy-dr-william-frankland-pollen-count-alexander-fleming-70-years-nhs |title=Grandfather of allergy, Dr William Frankland, aged 106, on popularising the pollen count, working with Alexander Fleming and spending 70 years in the NHS |publisher=[[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]] |date=5 July 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> Frankland and Fleming were also concerned with [[antimicrobial resistance]] to penicillin, with Frankland crediting Fleming with saying that careless prescription would inadvertently lead to \"the death of man.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://healthwnews.com/health-news/discoverer-of-penicillin-foresaw-the-threat-of-antibiotic-resistance/ |title=Discoverer of penicillin foresaw the threat of antibiotic resistance |date=3 December 2018 |access-date=2 April 2020 |website=HealthWNews.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Frankland published \"[[Prophylaxis]] of summer [[Hay-fever]] and Asthma.\" The article reported the results of a trial involving 200 patients with previous histories of grass pollen sensitivity half treated with active vaccines, and half with inactive 'control' vaccines.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankland|first1=A.

Contacted to visit a VIP in [[Baghdad]] having trouble with asthma, Frankland advised Hussein this was not the case and to give up his habit of 40 cigarettes a day. Frankland said that \"To my lasting regret, I told him that was his trouble and that if he carried on, in another two years he wouldn\u2019t be head of state. I heard sometime later that he had had a disagreement with his secretary of state for health, so he took him outside and shot him.

He worked at Guy's on this basis for another twenty years on peanut [[anaphylaxis]] and [[Pediatrics|paediatric]] allergies. After retiring from Guy's he continued to participate in academic life by attending conferences and publishing articles in journals.<ref name=Lane/>\n\nIn February 2012, Frankland appeared as an expert witness in a British court. The accused had claimed that a vehicle crash in which he was involved was caused by his losing control following a [[bee sting]]. Although Frankland agreed with the defence that such a scenario was possible, he gave an opinion that delayed-response reactions to bee stings only occurred after there had been initial symptoms following the sting. In this case, there had not been such symptoms, and the accused was found guilty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/worlds-oldest-expert-witness-william-frankland/story-fnb64oi6-1226283231827|title=World's oldest expert witness William Frankland|work=The Australian|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he appeared in an episode of the [[BBC 2]] TV series ''Britain's Greatest Generation'' and as a guest on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=David|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dmdnpp/britains-greatest-generation--series-1---3-the-fight-for-freedom|title=Britain's Greatest Generation: Series 1 \u2013 3.
