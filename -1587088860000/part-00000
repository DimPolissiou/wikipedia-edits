De Bortoli makes a wide range of wines including the sweet white [[Noble One]]. [[File:dbw bilbul 0603.jpg|right|thumb|De Bortoli Wines Bilbul Winery]]\n\n== Wineries and cellar doors ==\nDe Bortoli Wines owns three wineries in three diverse wine growing regions:\n* [[Bilbul, New South Wales|Bilbul]] near [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]]\n* Near [[cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of New South Wales\n* [[Dixons Creek, Victoria|Dixons Creek]] near [[Yarra Glen, Victoria|Yarra Glen]] in the [[Yarra Valley]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]\n* [[Rutherglen,_Victoria|Rutherglen]] in the [[Rutherglen_wine_region|Rutherglen wine region]] in Victoria\n\nThe company has vineyards in the same regions as its wineries, along with the [[King Valley]] in Victoria.\n\nThe Yarra Valley Winery also boasts a very popular and highly awarded restaurant featuring Northern Italian inspired cuisine. There is now also a [[cheesemaker]] and cheese shop onsite at the Yarra Winery.\n\n==Winemaking==\nThe winemaking team is overseen by third generation winemaker [[Darren De Bortoli]] and his brother-in-law Steve Webber.  In the early 1980s [[Darren De Bortoli]] created the world acclaimed [[Noble One]] Botrytis Semillon. Steve Webber established the company's premium Yarra Valley winery in the early 1990s and is also responsible for overseeing the company's King Valley vineyards and Hunter Valley winery and vineyards.\n\nThe winemaking philosophy is that good wine begins in the vineyard, that the winemaker should use minimal handling and interference in the winemaking process and that wine should have a sense of regionality and be an expression of the soil in which it is grown.\n\n==Noble One==\nDe Bortoli Wines Noble One [[Botrytis cinerea|Botrytis]] [[Semillon]] is an award winning sweet white wine, developed by Darren De Bortoli during the 1980s. \n\nSince its release Noble One has been awarded 104<ref name=\"deb\">{{cite web|title=Noble One 25th Vintage Anniversary|url=http://www.debortoli.com.au/our-wines/our-brands/noble-one.html}}</ref> Trophies, 352 Gold medals<ref name=\"deb\"/> and 113 International Awards. In 2005 screw cap closures were placed on 50% of the 750ml bottles of 2003 Noble One in a trial that attempted to ensure fruit intensity and freshness for consumers. De Bortoli Wines have kept the 375ml, 50% of the 750ml and all export stock under cork, however in an industry where issues over [[cork taint]] keep arising approximately 34% of wines are sealed with some type of synthetic closure.\n\nNoble One was given its name in 1990 as a result of the bilateral agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in which [[Australia]] agreed to phase out the use of European names on [[wine labels]]. Previously the wine was known as [[Sauternes (wine)|'Sauternes']] but today it is simply called Noble One.\n\n===Background===\nThe fungus [[botrytis cinerea]] is responsible for many of the great sweet whites of Europe including [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]. Botrytis develops on the grape bunches given the right moist and humid conditions. Botrytis spores leach moisture from the berries causing the fruit to break down, concentrating the [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] and magnifying the flavors to produce a very intense, complex wine. High humidity and moderate temperatures during April/May when the grapes are picked, and the high clay content of the soils creates a [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] that promotes the development of botrytis in the Riverina.\n\nGrapes for Noble One are grown on De Bortoli's own vineyards and those of a handful of selected growers. The grapes are picked by hand and the juice from each vineyard is fermented separately. The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]], and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli]. Today the company is in the hands of the third generation. The family history is documented in a book called Celebrazione! launched in 2003 to celebrate De Bortoli Wines' 75th Anniversary.\n\n===Darren===\n'''Darren De Bortoli''' (born 1960) is currently the managing director of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1960 and then studied winemaking at Roseworthy College in South Australia, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Oenology, in 1982. He is a former winemaker, for this family business, established in 1928 by his grandfather Vittorio De Bortoli. '''Darren''' is well known for his award winning Botrytis Semillon, Noble One. At the age of 33, Darren was appointed Managing Director, which is the position he maintains today. He is also a company director for this family organisation.\n\n'''Darren''' has helped the De Bortoli family achieve its position of Australia\u2019s 6th largest wine company, with an annual turnover of $170 million.  He was also featured in the 2002 episode of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s Dynasties television series titled \"The De Bortolis Of Griffith\"[http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1010334.htm] which tracked the growth over three generations of the family business from humble Italian immigrants into one of Australia's largest family wine companies.\n\nHe still lives with his family in [[Bilbul, New South Wales]], the village where De Bortoli Wines was established and still home to its head office and to one of its wineries.\n\n===Deen===\n'''Deen De Bortoli''' (born 1936) was the chairman of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1936, and at age 15 he left school to help Vittorio and Giuseppina, his parents run the family business. Deen was largely self-taught, but managed to build his fathers businesses to one of Australia's top 6 wine companies [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056]. He married Emeri De Bortoli in 1958, and lived in [[Bilbul, New South Wales]], his whole life. They had four children who all work for the company today. '''Deen''' also featured in the 2002 episode of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s Dynasties television series titled \"The De Bortolis Of Griffith\"[http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1010334.htm] about rise of the business founded by his parents into one of Australia's largest family wine companies.\n\nHis oldest son Darren De Bortoli, is currently Managing director, daughter Leanne Webber n\u00e9e De Bortoli, manages the Yarra and King Valley wineries with her husband Stephen Webber.

Steve Webber established the company's premium Yarra Valley winery in the early 1990s and is also responsible for overseeing the company's King Valley vineyards and Hunter Valley winery and vineyards.\n\nThe winemaking philosophy is that good wine begins in the vineyard, that the winemaker should use minimal handling and interference in the winemaking process and that wine should have a sense of regionality and be an expression of the soil in which it is grown.\n\n==Noble One==\nDe Bortoli Wines Noble One [[Botrytis cinerea|Botrytis]] [[Semillon]] is an award winning sweet white wine, developed by Darren De Bortoli during the 1980s. \n\nSince its release Noble One has been awarded 104<ref name=\"deb\">{{cite web|title=Noble One 25th Vintage Anniversary|url=http://www.debortoli.com.au/our-wines/our-brands/noble-one.html}}</ref> Trophies, 352 Gold medals<ref name=\"deb\"/> and 113 International Awards. In 2005 screw cap closures were placed on 50% of the 750ml bottles of 2003 Noble One in a trial that attempted to ensure fruit intensity and freshness for consumers. De Bortoli Wines have kept the 375ml, 50% of the 750ml and all export stock under cork, however in an industry where issues over [[cork taint]] keep arising approximately 34% of wines are sealed with some type of synthetic closure.\n\nNoble One was given its name in 1990 as a result of the bilateral agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in which [[Australia]] agreed to phase out the use of European names on [[wine labels]]. Previously the wine was known as [[Sauternes (wine)|'Sauternes']] but today it is simply called Noble One.\n\n===Background===\nThe fungus [[botrytis cinerea]] is responsible for many of the great sweet whites of Europe including [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]. Botrytis develops on the grape bunches given the right moist and humid conditions. Botrytis spores leach moisture from the berries causing the fruit to break down, concentrating the [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] and magnifying the flavors to produce a very intense, complex wine. High humidity and moderate temperatures during April/May when the grapes are picked, and the high clay content of the soils creates a [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] that promotes the development of botrytis in the Riverina.\n\nGrapes for Noble One are grown on De Bortoli's own vineyards and those of a handful of selected growers. The grapes are picked by hand and the juice from each vineyard is fermented separately. The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]] and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli].

The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]], and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli].

The screenplay, written by [[Ernest Tidyman]], is based on [[Robin Moore]]'s 1969 non-fiction book ''[[The French Connection (book)|The French Connection]]''. It tells the story of [[New York Police Department]] detectives [[Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle]] and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo, whose real-life counterparts were Narcotics Detectives [[Eddie Egan]] and [[Sonny Grosso]], in pursuit of wealthy French heroin smuggler Alain Charnier. The film stars [[Gene Hackman]] as Popeye, [[Roy Scheider]] as Cloudy, and [[Fernando Rey]] as Charnier. [[Tony Lo Bianco]] and [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] also star. [[The Three Degrees]] are featured in a nightclub scene.\n\nAt the [[44th Academy Awards]], it won the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Hackman), [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Friedkin), [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (Tidyman). It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Scheider), [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]. Tidyman also received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination, a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] and an [[Edgar Award]] for his [[screenplay]]. A sequel,   ''[[French Connection II]]'', followed in 1975 with Gene Hackman and Fernando Rey reprising their roles.\n\nThe [[American Film Institute]] included the film in its list of the best American films [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|in 1998]] and [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|again in 2007]].  In 2005 the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Marseille]], an undercover police detective follows Alain Charnier, who runs the world's largest heroin-smuggling syndicate. The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli. Charnier plans to smuggle $32 million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, television personality Henri Devereaux, who is traveling to New York City by ship.\n\nIn New York City, detectives [[Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle]] and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo go out for drinks at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. Popeye notices Salvatore \"Sal\" Boca and his young wife, Angie, entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics. They tail the couple and establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock, who is part of the narcotics underworld.\n\nPopeye learns from an informant that a massive shipment of heroin will arrive in the next two weeks. The detectives convince their supervisor to wiretap the Bocas' phones. Popeye and Cloudy are joined by federal agents Mulderig and Klein.\n\nDevereaux's vehicle arrives in New York City. Boca is impatient to make the purchase\u2014reflecting Charnier's desire to return to France as soon as possible\u2014while Weinstock, with more experience in smuggling, urges patience, knowing Boca's phone is tapped and that they are being investigated.\n\nCharnier realizes he is being observed. He \"makes\" Popeye and escapes on a departing subway shuttle. To avoid being tailed, he has Boca meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly. On the flight back to New York City, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned.\n\nSoon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated train. Popeye commandeers a car and gives chase. Realizing he is being pursued, Nicoli works his way forward through the carriages, shoots a policeman who tries to intervene and hijacks the motorman at gunpoint, forcing him to drive straight through the next station, also shooting the train conductor. The motorman passes out and they are just about to slam into a stationary train when an emergency trackside brake engages, hurling the assassin against a glass window. Popeye arrives to see the killer descending from the platform. When the killer sees Popeye, he turns to run but is shot dead by Popeye.\n\nAfter a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's [[Lincoln Continental]]. He and his team take it apart searching for the drugs, but come up empty-handed. Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight. They remove the rocker panels and discover the heroin concealed therein. The police restore the car to its original condition and return it to Devereaux, who delivers the Lincoln Continental to Charnier.\n\nCharnier drives to an old factory on [[Wards Island]] to meet Weinstock and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the drugs and hides the money, concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will take back to France. Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but hit a roadblock with a large contingent of police led by Popeye. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Boca is killed during a shootout while most of the other criminals surrender.\n\nCharnier escapes into the warehouse with Popeye and Cloudy in pursuit. Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance and opens fire a split-second after shouting a warning, killing Mulderig. Undaunted, Popeye tells Cloudy that he will get Charnier. After reloading his gun, Popeye runs into another room and a single gunshot is heard.\n\nTitle cards note that Weinstock was indicted but his case dismissed for \"lack of proper evidence\"; Angie Boca received a suspended sentence for an unspecified misdemeanor; Lou Boca received a reduced sentence; Devereaux served four years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy; and Charnier was never caught. Popeye and Cloudy were transferred out of the narcotics division and reassigned.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Det.

The film was among the earliest to [[List of films featuring the World Trade Center|show the World Trade Center]]: the completed North Tower and the partially completed South Tower are seen in the background of the scenes at the shipyard following Devereaux's arrival in New York.\n\nFriedkin credits his decision to direct the movie to a discussion with film director [[Howard Hawks]], whose daughter was living with Friedkin at the time. Friedkin asked Hawks what he thought of his movies, to which Hawks bluntly replied that they were \"lousy.\" Instead Hawks recommended that he \"Make a good chase. Make one better than anyone's done.\"<ref>McCarthy, Todd.

He was strongly opposed to the choice of Hackman for the lead, and actually first considered [[Paul Newman]] (out of the budget range), then [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Peter Boyle]] and a New York columnist, [[Jimmy Breslin]], who had never acted before.<ref group=Note name=Making>Friedkin recounts his casting opinions in ''Making the Connection: The Untold Stories'' (2001). Extra feature on 2001 Five Star Collection edition of DVD release.</ref> However, Gleason, at that time, was considered box-office poison by the studio after his film ''[[Gigot (film)|Gigot]]'' had flopped several years before, Boyle declined the role after disapproving of the violent theme of the film, and Breslin refused to get behind the wheel of a car, which was required of Popeye's character for an integral [[car chase]] scene. [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] was also considered, but he did not want to do another police film after ''[[Bullitt]]'' and, as with Newman, his fee would have exceeded the movie's budget. Tough guy [[Charles Bronson]] was also considered for the role. Friedkin almost settled for [[Rod Taylor]] (who had actively pursued the role, according to Hackman), another choice the studio approved, before he went with Hackman.\n\nThe casting of Fernando Rey as the main French heroin smuggler, Alain Charnier (irreverently referred to throughout the film as \"Frog One\"), resulted from mistaken identity. Friedkin had seen [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s 1967 French film ''[[Belle de Jour (film)|Belle de Jour]]'' and had been impressed by the performance of [[Francisco Rabal]], who had a small role in the film. However, Friedkin did not know his name, and remembered only that he was a [[Spain|Spanish]] actor. He asked his casting director to find the actor, and the casting director instead contacted Rey, a Spanish actor who had appeared in several other films directed by Bu\u00f1uel. After Rabal was finally reached, they discovered he spoke neither French nor English, and Rey was kept in the film.<ref group=Note name=Making/> Ironically, after screening the film's final cut, Rey's French was deemed unacceptable by the filmmakers. They decided to dub his French while preserving his English dialogue.\n\n===Comparison to actual people===\nThe plot centers on drug smuggling in the 1960s and early 1970s, when most of the heroin illegally imported into the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] came to the United States through France (''see'' [[French Connection]]). In addition to the two main protagonists, several of the fictional characters depicted in the film also have real-life counterparts. The Alain Charnier character is based upon Jean Jehan who was arrested later in Paris for [[drug trafficking]], though he was not extradited since France does not extradite its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=97174 |title=Turner Classic Movies spotlight |publisher= TCM|date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref> Sal Boca is based on Pasquale \"Patsy\" Fuca, and his brother Anthony.

The scene was filmed in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]] roughly running under the [[BMT West End Line]] (currently the {{NYCS trains|West End}}, then the [[B (New York City Subway service)|B]] train) which runs on an elevated track above Stillwell Avenue, 86th Street and New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the [[62nd Street (BMT West End Line)|62nd Street]] station.  At that point, the train hits a [[train stop]], but is going too fast to stop in time and collides with the train ahead of it, which has just left the station.<ref group=Note>[[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42 cars]] 4572 and 4573 were chosen for the film and had no [[B (New York City Subway service)|B subway]] [[rollsign]]s because they were normally assigned to the [[N (New York City Subway service)|N subway train]]. Consequently, they operated during the movie with an N displayed. As of July 2009, these cars were withdrawn from service, but are preserved as part of the Transit Museum fleet.</ref>\n\nThe most famous shot of the chase is made from a front bumper mount and shows a low-angle point of view shot of the streets racing by. Director of photography [[Owen Roizman]] wrote in ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' magazine in 1972 that the camera was undercranked to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed. Roizman's contention is borne out when you see a car at a red light whose muffler is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss hitting the speeding car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred and were left in the final film.<ref>This account of the shooting is described in ''Making the Connection'', supra.</ref> Friedkin said that he used [[Carlos Santana|Santana]]'s [[cover version|cover]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s song \"[[Black

right for an out-and-out thriller like this, and I guess that you are supposed to think that a good old kind of movie has none too soon come around again.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

Whereas in ''[[The Detective (1968 film)|The Detective]]'' or ''Bullitt'' the hero's attention was directed unmistakably towards liberal ends (crooked businessmen, corrupt local officials, etc.) Doyle spends a fair part of his time beating up sullen blacks in alleys and bars. These violent sequences are almost all presented racily and amusingly, stressing Doyle's 'lovable' toughness as he manhandles and arrests petty criminals, usually adding a quip like 'Lock them up and throw away the key.'\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pirie |first=David |date=January 1972 |title=The French Connection |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=39 |issue=456 |page=7 }}</ref>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 8.74/10.

The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli. Charnier plans to smuggle $32 million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, television personality Henri Devereaux, who is traveling to New York City by ship.\n\nIn New York City, detectives [[Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle]] and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo go out for drinks at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. Popeye notices Salvatore \"Sal\" Boca and his young wife, Angie, entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics. They tail the couple and establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock, who is part of the narcotics underworld.\n\nPopeye learns from an informant that a massive shipment of heroin will arrive in the next two weeks. The detectives convince their supervisor to wiretap the Bocas' phones. Popeye and Cloudy are joined by federal agents Mulderig and Klein.\n\nDevereaux's vehicle arrives in New York City. Boca is impatient to make the purchase\u2014reflecting Charnier's desire to return to France as soon as possible\u2014while Weinstock, with more experience in smuggling, urges patience, knowing Boca's phone is tapped and that they are being investigated.\n\nCharnier realizes he is being observed. He \"makes\" Popeye and escapes on a departing subway shuttle. To avoid being tailed, he has Boca meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly. On the flight back to New York City, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned.\n\nSoon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated train. Popeye commandeers a car and gives chase. Realizing he is being pursued, Nicoli works his way forward through the carriages, shoots a policeman who tries to intervene and hijacks the motorman at gunpoint, forcing him to drive straight through the next station, also shooting the train conductor. The motorman passes out and they are just about to slam into a stationary train when an emergency trackside brake engages, hurling the assassin against a glass window. Popeye arrives to see the killer descending from the platform. When the killer sees Popeye, he turns to run but is shot dead by Popeye.\n\nAfter a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's [[Lincoln Continental]]. He and his team take it apart searching for the drugs, but come up empty-handed. Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight. They remove the rocker panels and discover the heroin concealed therein. The police restore the car to its original condition and return it to Devereaux, who delivers the Lincoln Continental to Charnier.\n\nCharnier drives to an old factory on [[Wards Island]] to meet Weinstock and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the drugs and hides the money, concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will take back to France. Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but hit a roadblock with a large contingent of police led by Popeye. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Boca is killed during a shootout while most of the other criminals surrender.\n\nCharnier escapes into the warehouse with Popeye and Cloudy in pursuit. Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance and opens fire a split-second after shouting a warning, killing Mulderig. Undaunted, Popeye tells Cloudy that he will get Charnier. After reloading his gun, Popeye runs into another room and a single gunshot is heard.\n\nTitle cards note that Weinstock was indicted but his case dismissed for \"lack of proper evidence\"; Angie Boca received a suspended sentence for an unspecified misdemeanor; Lou Boca received a reduced sentence; Devereaux served four years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy; and Charnier was never caught. Popeye and Cloudy were transferred out of the narcotics division and reassigned.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Det.

The film was among the earliest to [[List of films featuring the World Trade Center|show the World Trade Center]]: the completed North Tower and the partially completed South Tower are seen in the background of the scenes at the shipyard following Devereaux's arrival in New York.\n\nFriedkin credits his decision to direct the movie to a discussion with film director [[Howard Hawks]], whose daughter was living with Friedkin at the time. Friedkin asked Hawks what he thought of his movies, to which Hawks bluntly replied that they were \"lousy.\" Instead Hawks recommended that he \"Make a good chase. Make one better than anyone's done.\"<ref>McCarthy, Todd.

He was strongly opposed to the choice of Hackman for the lead, and actually first considered [[Paul Newman]] (out of the budget range), then [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Peter Boyle]] and a New York columnist, [[Jimmy Breslin]], who had never acted before.<ref group=Note name=Making>Friedkin recounts his casting opinions in ''Making the Connection: The Untold Stories'' (2001). Extra feature on 2001 Five Star Collection edition of DVD release.</ref> However, Gleason, at that time, was considered box-office poison by the studio after his film ''[[Gigot (film)|Gigot]]'' had flopped several years before, Boyle declined the role after disapproving of the violent theme of the film, and Breslin refused to get behind the wheel of a car, which was required of Popeye's character for an integral [[car chase]] scene. [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] was also considered, but he did not want to do another police film after ''[[Bullitt]]'' and, as with Newman, his fee would have exceeded the movie's budget. Tough guy [[Charles Bronson]] was also considered for the role. Friedkin almost settled for [[Rod Taylor]] (who had actively pursued the role, according to Hackman), another choice the studio approved, before he went with Hackman.\n\nThe casting of Fernando Rey as the main French heroin smuggler, Alain Charnier (irreverently referred to throughout the film as \"Frog One\"), resulted from mistaken identity. Friedkin had seen [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s 1967 French film ''[[Belle de Jour (film)|Belle de Jour]]'' and had been impressed by the performance of [[Francisco Rabal]], who had a small role in the film. However, Friedkin did not know his name, and remembered only that he was a [[Spain|Spanish]] actor. He asked his casting director to find the actor, and the casting director instead contacted Rey, a Spanish actor who had appeared in several other films directed by Bu\u00f1uel. After Rabal was finally reached, they discovered he spoke neither French nor English, and Rey was kept in the film.<ref group=Note name=Making/> Ironically, after screening the film's final cut, Rey's French was deemed unacceptable by the filmmakers. They decided to dub his French while preserving his English dialogue.\n\n===Comparison to actual people===\nThe plot centers on drug smuggling in the 1960s and early 1970s, when most of the heroin illegally imported into the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] came to the United States through France (''see'' [[French Connection]]). In addition to the two main protagonists, several of the fictional characters depicted in the film also have real-life counterparts. The Alain Charnier character is based upon Jean Jehan who was arrested later in Paris for [[drug trafficking]], though he was not extradited since France does not extradite its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=97174 |title=Turner Classic Movies spotlight |publisher= TCM|date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref> Sal Boca is based on Pasquale \"Patsy\" Fuca, and his brother Anthony. Angie Boca is based on Patsy's wife Barbara, who later wrote a book with [[Robin Moore]] detailing her life with Patsy. The Fucas and their uncle were part of a heroin dealing crew that worked with some of the New York City [[Five Families|crime families]].<ref>{{cite book| title= [[The French Connection (book)|The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy]]|year= 1969| ISBN= 1592280447 |first= Robin |last=Moore| authorlink= Robin Moore|page=}}{{Page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref> Henri Devereaux, who takes the fall for importing the Lincoln to New York City, is based on Jacques Angelvin, a television actor arrested and sentenced to three to six years in a federal penitentiary for his role, serving about four before returning to France and turning to real estate.<ref>{{cite book| first1=Alain |last1=Bauer| first2=Christophe|last2= Soullez | title= La criminologie pour les nuls| edition =G\u00e9n\u00e9rales First| year= 2012| ISBN=2754031626}}</ref> The Joel Weinstock character is, according to the director's commentary, a composite of several similar drug dealers.<ref>Film commentary{{Time needed|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Car chase===\nThe film is often cited as containing one of the greatest [[car chase]] sequences in movie history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6091432/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022044246/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6091432 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-10-22 |title=Top 10 car chase movies - MOVIES - MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref> The chase involves Popeye commandeering a civilian's car (a 1971 [[Pontiac LeMans]]) and then frantically chasing an [[elevated train]], on which a hitman is trying to escape. The scene was filmed in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]] roughly running under the [[BMT West End Line]] (currently the {{NYCS trains|West End}}, then the [[B (New York City Subway service)|B]] train) which runs on an elevated track above Stillwell Avenue, 86th Street and New Utrecht Avenue in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the [[62nd Street (BMT West End Line)|62nd Street]] station.  At that point, the train hits a [[train stop]], but is going too fast to stop in time and collides with the train ahead of it, which has just left the station.<ref group=Note>[[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42 cars]] 4572 and 4573 were chosen for the film and had no [[B (New York City Subway service)|B subway]] [[rollsign]]s because they were normally assigned to the [[N (New York City Subway service)|N subway train]]. Consequently, they operated during the movie with an N displayed. As of July 2009, these cars were withdrawn from service, but are preserved as part of the Transit Museum fleet.</ref>\n\nThe most famous shot of the chase is made from a front bumper mount and shows a low-angle point of view shot of the streets racing by. Director of photography [[Owen Roizman]] wrote in ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' magazine in 1972 that the camera was undercranked to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed. Roizman's contention is borne out when you see a car at a red light whose muffler is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss hitting the speeding car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred and were left in the final film.<ref>This account of the shooting is described in ''Making the Connection'', supra.</ref> Friedkin said that he used [[Carlos Santana|Santana]]'s [[cover version|cover]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s song \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\" during editing to help shape the chase sequence; though the song does not appear in the film, \"it [the chase scene] did have a sort of pre-ordained rhythm to it that came from the

objected to the scene on the grounds that shooting a suspect in the back was simply murder, not self-defense, but director Friedkin stood by it, stating that he was \"secure in my conviction that
