He played [[college football]] at Michigan for coach [[Bo Schembechler]] from 1983 to 1986 and played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for 14 seasons from 1987 to 2000. He then served as the head coach of the [[San Diego Toreros football|San Diego Toreros]] (2004\u20132006), the [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford Cardinal]] (2007\u20132010), and the NFL's [[San Francisco 49ers]] (2011\u20132014).<ref name=\"freepDec30\">The Detroit Free Press, \"Preparing To Be A-Maized\", by Mark Snyder and David Jesse, December 29, 2014, page B1</ref> In 2015, Harbaugh returned to his alma mater, Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/12097742/jim-harbaugh-introduced-michigan-wolverines-football-coach |title=Jim Harbaugh introduced as Michigan Wolverines' football coach |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=December 30, 2014 |accessdate=March 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHarbaugh was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. His father, [[Jack Harbaugh]], was a football coach, and the family lived in [[Ohio]], [[Kentucky]], [[Iowa]], [[Michigan]], and [[California]]. He attended high school in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], and [[Palo Alto, California]], when his father was an assistant coach at Michigan and Stanford, respectively. After graduation from high school in Palo Alto in 1982, Harbaugh returned to Ann Arbor and enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] and played quarterback for the Wolverines, starting for three seasons. As a fifth-year senior in [[1986 Michigan Wolverines football team|1986]], he led Michigan to the [[1987 Rose Bowl]] and was a [[Heisman Trophy]] finalist, finishing third.\n\nThe [[1987 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] selected Harbaugh in the first round of the [[1987 NFL Draft]]. He played 14 years as a quarterback in the NFL, with Chicago from 1987 to 1993, the [[Indianapolis Colts]] from 1994 to 1997, the [[1998 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] in 1998,  and the [[San Diego Chargers]] in 1999 to 2000. He first became a regular starting quarterback in [[1990 Chicago Bears season|1990]] with Chicago. In [[1995 Indianapolis Colts season|1995]] with Indianapolis, he led the Colts to the [[1995 AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship Game]], was selected to the [[1996 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] and was honored as NFL Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2001, while still playing in the NFL, Harbaugh was an unpaid assistant coach at [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football|Western Kentucky University]], where his father Jack was head coach. In [[2002 Oakland Raiders season|2002]], he returned to the NFL as the quarterbacks coach for the [[Oakland Raiders]]. Harbaugh returned to the college ranks in 2004 as the head coach at the [[San Diego Toreros football|University of San Diego]]. After leading San Diego to consecutive [[Pioneer Football League|Pioneer League]] championships in 2005 and 2006, he moved to Stanford in 2007, where he led the Cardinals to two [[bowl game|bowl berths]] in four seasons, including a win in the [[2011 Orange Bowl]]. Immediately afterward, Harbaugh signed a five-year deal as head coach of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, where he led the team to the NFC Championship game in each of his first three seasons after the franchise missed the playoffs for eight consecutive seasons beforehand. He and his older brother, [[Baltimore Ravens]] coach [[John Harbaugh]], became the first pair of brothers to serve as head coaches in NFL history. Their teams played in a [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Classic]] game in 2011 and in [[Super Bowl XLVII]] on February 3, 2013.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Toledo, Ohio]] on December 23, 1963, Harbaugh is the son of Jacqueline M. \"Jackie\" (n\u00e9e Cipiti) and [[Jack Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Harbauh|publisher=Sports Reference LLC |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HarbJi00.htm|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}</ref> His mother is of half-[[Sicily|Sicilian]] and half-[[Polish people|Polish]] ancestry and his father is of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[German people|German]] ancestry.<ref name=geng1>{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ebattle/celeb/harbaugh.htm|title=Ancestry of John and Jim Harbaugh |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref> Both Jim and his brother [[John Harbaugh|John]] were born in Toledo, while his father was an assistant football coach at nearby [[Perrysburg High School]] in [[Perrysburg, Ohio|Perrysburg]].\n\nDuring Harbaugh's childhood, the family moved frequently, as his father held assistant coaching positions at [[Morehead State Eagles football|Morehead State]] (1967), [[Bowling Green Falcons football|Bowling Green]] (1967\u20131970), [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] (1971\u20131973), [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] (1973\u20131979), [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] (1980\u20131981), and [[Western Michigan Broncos football|Western Michigan]] (1982\u20131986).

A total of 22 women competed in this event, limited to [[j\u016bd\u014dka]] with a body weight of less than 57 kilograms. Preliminary rounds started at 12:00 Noon [[China Standard Time|CST]]. [[Repechage]] finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals and the final were held at 18:00pm CST.\n\nThis event was the third-lightest of the women's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 57 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
