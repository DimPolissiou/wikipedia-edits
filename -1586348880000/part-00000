The Frogs have competed in the [[Big 12 Conference]] since 2013 and previously competed in the [[Mountain West Conference|Mountain West]], [[Conference USA]], [[Western Athletic Conference]] and [[Southwest Conference]].  Since February 2003, the Horned Frogs have played their home games at [[Lupton Stadium]], located on the TCU campus in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The Frogs are led by head coach [[Jim Schlossnagle]], the winningest coach in TCU baseball history, whose many coaching accolades include 8 conference coach of the year awards and being named the 2010 National Coach of the Year by the [[National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association]] and 2016 National Coach of the Year by [[Baseball America]].\n\n==History==\n\n===The early years===\nTCU has fielded a baseball team since 1896, before the university found its permanent home in Fort Worth. The Horned Frog baseball team began playing baseball in the [[Southwest Conference]] (SWC) when it became a member of the conference in 1923. In their inaugural SWC season, the Frogs finished the year with a 13\u201311 overall record and a 2\u201310 conference record.<ref name=\"History\">[http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/tcu/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/06-mg-07.pdf TCU Baseball 2006 Media Guide] TCU Baseball, p. 99</ref>\n\n===The Southwest Conference years===\nIn 1933 [[Dutch Meyer]], most noted for his tenure as head coach of the two-time national champion football team, led TCU to its first SWC title with a 9\u20131 record. The Horned Frogs went on to win 4 more SWC titles in 1956, 1966, 1967 and 1994. The [[Southwest Conference Baseball Tournament|SWC Baseball Tournament]] began in 1977, but the Horned Frogs never earned a conference tournament title before the SWC dissolved following the 1996 baseball season.\n\n===The wandering years===\nThe dissolution of the SWC in 1996 touched off a period of instability for the Horned Frogs that lasted nearly two decades, during which they made stops in six conferences. Following the dissolution of the SWC, the TCU Horned Frogs first joined the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC). During the 1997 and 1998 seasons, TCU competed in the WAC South Division with the [[New Mexico Lobos baseball|New Mexico Lobos]], [[UNLV Hustlin' Rebels baseball|UNLV Rebels]], and former SWC member [[Rice Owls baseball|Rice Owls]]. The Horned Frogs made two appearances in the [[Western Athletic Conference Baseball Tournament|WAC Baseball Tournament]] in the team's five seasons as a member of the WAC. Eight WAC member schools joined with schools from several other conferences to form the new [[Mountain West Conference]] (MWC) in 2000. Two seasons later, TCU joined the [[Houston Cougars baseball|Houston Cougars]], another former SWC member, in entering [[Conference USA]] (C-USA) for the 2002 season.\n\nLong time TCU Head Coach Lance Brown, a SWC hall-of-famer as both a TCU player and TCU coach, retired after the 2003 season. Through his career as TCU's skipper, Brown notched a school-record 517 wins. After Brown's departure, TCU would go on to make several more conference moves in the early 2000s and see an emergence of its baseball program as a perennial national power.\n\n===TCU's emergence under Jim Schlossnagle===\n[[Jim Schlossnagle]] was hired as TCU's head coach in 2003 and coached his first season at TCU in Spring 2004. His impact was immediate. Former Head Coach Lance Brown had recruited several exceptional classes, which allowed Schlossnagle to coach his first TCU team to the program's first regular season conference championship in a decade, its first conference tournament championship in history, and its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1994. Under Schlossnagle, conference championships began piling up year after year, in conference after conference. Schlossnagle's Horned Frogs repeated as C-USA regular season and tournament champions in 2005, and once again earned a berth to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nPrior to the 2006 season, conference realignment again led TCU to change conferences as eight other C-USA members changed conference homes. The Horned Frogs joined the [[Mountain West Conference]] (MWC), where the Frogs competed for seven years (2006\u20132012).  In each season in the MWC, TCU advanced to the NCAA Tournament and won at least a share of the Mountain West regular season title. In those seven years, TCU also won four MWC Tournament championships. During this era, TCU won its first-ever NCAA Regional Championship in 2009, and repeated the feat in 2010 and 2012. In 2009, the Horned Frogs advanced to its first NCAA Super Regional, where the Texas Longhorns eliminated TCU from the Tournament. In 2010, TCU and Texas met again in an NCAA Super Regional, but the Horned Frogs emerged from the rematch\u2014advancing to the College World Series for the first time in school history. TCU compiled a 3\u20132 record in its first CWS appearance, eventually falling in the national semifinal to [[UCLA Bruins baseball|UCLA]].\n\nIn 2011, the MWC Champion Horned Frogs were eliminated from the NCAA Tournament in the Fort Worth Regional, but TCU came storming back in 2012 by winning the College Station Regional over host Texas A&M. TCU advanced to the 2012 Los Angeles Super Regional, where they were again eliminated from NCAA Tournament play by the Bruins.\n\n===The Big 12 Conference era===\nAfter 16 combined seasons wandering through the Western Athletic Conference, Conference USA and Mountain West Conference (and after brief plan to join the Big East Conference), the Horned Frogs rejoined three former SWC rivals, the [[Baylor Bears baseball|Baylor Bears]], [[Texas Longhorns baseball|Texas Longhorns]], and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball|Texas Tech Red Raiders]], as members of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Pre-season expectations for the Horned Frogs were high after the 2012 Super Regional run, but TCU finished their inaugural season in the Big 12 with a 29\u201328 record. This season marked the first and only time under Jim Schlossnagle that the Horned Frogs failed to make the NCAA Tournament and win a conference title.\n\nThe Horned Frogs showed tremendous improvement in their second year in the Big 12. TCU finished the 2014 regular season in second place and swept through the 2014 Big 12 tournament, 4\u20130, to earn the Big 12 Tournament title. This was the first Big 12 championship won by any TCU team since joining the league on July 1, 2012. The late-season surge earned TCU a coveted National Seed for the first time in the program's long history. TCU hosted and won the 2014 Fort Worth NCAA Regional. Then, as a National Seed, TCU earned the right to host its first Super Regional. The 2014 Fort Worth NCAA Super Regional matched the TCU Horned Frogs against the Pepperdine Waves, winners of the 2014 San Luis Obispo NCAA Regional. The Horned Frogs took 2 of 3 in the Super Regional series to advance to the 2014 College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. In this, their second CWS appearance in program history, TCU notched a 1\u20132 record after winning its opening games versus Texas Tech, then falling to Virginia and Ole Miss.\n\nIn 2015, TCU earned its first Big 12 Regular Season Baseball Championship. The Horned Frogs were the fifth different team in as many years to win the conference title, and their victory marked the ninth time in Big 12 history that the prior year's Tournament champion went on to win the following year's regular season crown. During the regular season, head coach Jim Schlossnagle notched his 200th conference win and 500th total win as TCU's head coach. The Frogs won their second NCAA Regional of the Big 12 era by defeating North Carolina State, and then hosted and defeated Texas A&M in the 2015 Fort Worth Super Regional to advance to the 2015 College World Series. This season marked the 11th season in 12 years that TCU won either a regular season or conference tournament championship, the fifth time in seven years that the Horned Frogs advanced to a Super Regional, and the third time in six years that TCU advanced to the College World Series.\n\nAfter significant roster turnover due to graduation and the MLB Draft, 2016 was expected to be a rebuilding year for the Horned Frogs, yet TCU won the 2016 Big 12 Tournament and was selected to host and won their third consecutive NCAA Regional. The Frogs advanced to the College Station Super Regional, where they defeated Texas A&M to advance to the [[2016 College World Series|College World Series]] for the third consecutive year.\n\nThe \"Woo Bird\" chant as many TCU fans like to do at Luptop was originally coined by an Alumni, Eric Davis (2015). The chant has been adopted by many teams, both collegiate and professional.\n\n==Attendance==\nSince [[Lupton Stadium]] opened in 2003, annual total and average attendance for TCU baseball has steadily increased from approximately 1,500 fans per game to over 4,000 fans per game. The increase in attendance has coincided with the Horned Frogs\u2019 2010, 2014, 2015 and 2016 College World Series appearances and the 2010 Lupton Stadium seating expansion.\n\nTotal and average attendance at Lupton Stadium has ranked in the top 15 for NCAA home games since TCU's 2011 season. In 2015, TCU and Lupton ranked 8th nationally in total attendance, 10th national in average attendance, and led all private schools in the nation in total and average attendance. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

Division I]] [[College Baseball|baseball]]. The Frogs have competed in the [[Big 12 Conference]] since 2013 and previously competed in the [[Mountain West Conference|Mountain West]], [[Conference USA]], [[Western Athletic Conference]] and [[Southwest Conference]].  Since February 2003, the Horned Frogs have played their home games at [[Lupton Stadium]], located on the TCU campus in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The Frogs are led by head coach [[Jim Schlossnagle]], the winningest coach in TCU baseball history, whose many coaching accolades include 8 conference coach of the year awards and being named the 2010 National Coach of the Year by the [[National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association]] and 2016 National Coach of the Year by [[Baseball America]].\n\n==History==\n\n===The early years===\nTCU has fielded a baseball team since 1896, before the university found its permanent home in Fort Worth. The Horned Frog baseball team began playing baseball in the [[Southwest Conference]] (SWC) when it became a member of the conference in 1923. In their inaugural SWC season, the Frogs finished the year with a 13\u201311 overall record and a 2\u201310 conference record.<ref name=\"History\">[http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/tcu/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/06-mg-07.pdf TCU Baseball 2006 Media Guide] TCU Baseball, p. 99</ref>\n\n===The Southwest Conference years===\nIn 1933 [[Dutch Meyer]], most noted for his tenure as head coach of the two-time national champion football team, led TCU to its first SWC title with a 9\u20131 record. The Horned Frogs went on to win 4 more SWC titles in 1956, 1966, 1967 and 1994. The [[Southwest Conference Baseball Tournament|SWC Baseball Tournament]] began in 1977, but the Horned Frogs never earned a conference tournament title before the SWC dissolved following the 1996 baseball season.\n\n===The wandering years===\nThe dissolution of the SWC in 1996 touched off a period of instability for the Horned Frogs that lasted nearly two decades, during which they made stops in six conferences. Following the dissolution of the SWC, the TCU Horned Frogs first joined the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC). During the 1997 and 1998 seasons, TCU competed in the WAC South Division with the [[New Mexico Lobos baseball|New Mexico Lobos]], [[UNLV Hustlin' Rebels baseball|UNLV Rebels]], and former SWC member [[Rice Owls baseball|Rice Owls]]. The Horned Frogs made two appearances in the [[Western Athletic Conference Baseball Tournament|WAC Baseball Tournament]] in the team's five seasons as a member of the WAC. Eight WAC member schools joined with schools from several other conferences to form the new [[Mountain West Conference]] (MWC) in 2000. Two seasons later, TCU joined the [[Houston Cougars baseball|Houston Cougars]], another former SWC member, in entering [[Conference USA]] (C-USA) for the 2002 season.\n\nLong time TCU Head Coach Lance Brown, a SWC hall-of-famer as both a TCU player and TCU coach, retired after the 2003 season. Through his career as TCU's skipper, Brown notched a school-record 517 wins. After Brown's departure, TCU would go on to make several more conference moves in the early 2000s and see an emergence of its baseball program as a perennial national power.\n\n===TCU's emergence under Jim Schlossnagle===\n[[Jim Schlossnagle]] was hired as TCU's head coach in 2003 and coached his first season at TCU in Spring 2004. His impact was immediate. Former Head Coach Lance Brown had recruited several exceptional classes, which allowed Schlossnagle to coach his first TCU team to the program's first regular season conference championship in a decade, its first conference tournament championship in history, and its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1994. Under Schlossnagle, conference championships began piling up year after year, in conference after conference. Schlossnagle's Horned Frogs repeated as C-USA regular season and tournament champions in 2005, and once again earned a berth to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nPrior to the 2006 season, conference realignment again led TCU to change conferences as eight other C-USA members changed conference homes. The Horned Frogs joined the [[Mountain West Conference]] (MWC), where the Frogs competed for seven years (2006\u20132012).  In each season in the MWC, TCU advanced to the NCAA Tournament and won at least a share of the Mountain West regular season title. In those seven years, TCU also won four MWC Tournament championships. During this era, TCU won its first-ever NCAA Regional Championship in 2009, and repeated the feat in 2010 and 2012. In 2009, the Horned Frogs advanced to its first NCAA Super Regional, where the Texas Longhorns eliminated TCU from the Tournament. In 2010, TCU and Texas met again in an NCAA Super Regional, but the Horned Frogs emerged from the rematch\u2014advancing to the College World Series for the first time in school history. TCU compiled a 3\u20132 record in its first CWS appearance, eventually falling in the national semifinal to [[UCLA Bruins baseball|UCLA]].\n\nIn 2011, the MWC Champion Horned Frogs were eliminated from the NCAA Tournament in the Fort Worth Regional, but TCU came storming back in 2012 by winning the College Station Regional over host Texas A&M. TCU advanced to the 2012 Los Angeles Super Regional, where they were again eliminated from NCAA Tournament play by the Bruins.\n\n===The Big 12 Conference era===\nAfter 16 combined seasons wandering through the Western Athletic Conference, Conference USA and Mountain West Conference (and after brief plan to join the Big East Conference), the Horned Frogs rejoined three former SWC rivals, the [[Baylor Bears baseball|Baylor Bears]], [[Texas Longhorns baseball|Texas Longhorns]], and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball|Texas Tech Red Raiders]], as members of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Pre-season expectations for the Horned Frogs were high after the 2012 Super Regional run, but TCU finished their inaugural season in the Big 12 with a 29\u201328 record. This season marked the first and only time under Jim Schlossnagle that the Horned Frogs failed to make the NCAA Tournament and win a conference title.\n\nThe Horned Frogs showed tremendous improvement in their second year in the Big 12. TCU finished the 2014 regular season in second place and swept through the 2014 Big 12 tournament, 4-0, to earn the Big 12 Tournament title. This was the first Big 12 championship won by any TCU team since joining the league on July 1, 2012. The late-season surge earned TCU a coveted National Seed for the first time in the program's long history. TCU hosted and won the 2014 Fort Worth NCAA Regional. Then, as a National Seed, TCU earned the right to host its first Super Regional. The 2014 Fort Worth NCAA Super Regional matched the TCU Horned Frogs against the Pepperdine Waves, winners of the 2014 San Luis Obispo NCAA Regional. The Horned Frogs took 2 of 3 in the Super Regional series to advance to the 2014 College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. In this, their second CWS appearance in program history, TCU notched a 1\u20132 record after winning its opening games versus Texas Tech, then falling to Virginia and Ole Miss.\n\nIn 2015, TCU earned its first Big 12 Regular Season Baseball Championship. The Horned Frogs were the fifth different team in as many years to win the conference title, and their victory marked the ninth time in Big 12 history that the prior year's Tournament champion went on to win the following year's regular season crown. During the regular season, head coach Jim Schlossnagle notched his 200th conference win and 500th total win as TCU's head coach. The Frogs won their second NCAA Regional of the Big 12 era by defeating North Carolina State, and then hosted and defeated Texas A&M in the 2015 Fort Worth Super Regional to advance to the 2015 College World Series. This season marked the 11th season in 12 years that TCU won either a regular season or conference tournament championship, the fifth time in seven years that the Horned Frogs advanced to a Super Regional, and the third time in six years that TCU advanced to the College World Series.\n\nAfter significant roster turnover due to graduation and the MLB Draft, 2016 was expected to be a rebuilding year for the Horned Frogs, yet TCU won the 2016 Big 12 Tournament and was selected to host and won their third consecutive NCAA Regional. The Frogs advanced to the College Station Super Regional, where they defeated Texas A&M to advance to the [[2016 College World Series|College World Series]] for the third consecutive year.\n\nThe \"Woo Bird\" chant as many TCU fans like to do at Luptop was originally coined by an Alumni, Eric Davis (2015). The chant has been adopted by many teams, both collegiate and professional.\n\n==Attendance==\nSince [[Lupton Stadium]] opened in 2003, annual total and average attendance for TCU baseball has steadily increased from approximately 1,500 fans per game to over 4,000 fans per game. The increase in attendance has coincided with the Horned Frogs\u2019 2010, 2014, 2015 and 2016 College World Series appearances and the 2010 Lupton Stadium seating expansion.\n\nTotal and average attendance at Lupton Stadium has ranked in the top 15 for NCAA home games since TCU\u2019s 2011 season. In 2015, TCU and Lupton ranked 8th nationally in total attendance, 10th national in average attendance, and led all private schools in the nation in total and average attendance. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

For a given set of points <math>(x_j,y_j)</math> with no two <math>x_j</math> values equal, the Lagrange polynomial is the polynomial of lowest [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] that assumes at each value <math>x_j</math> the corresponding value <math>y_j</math>, so that the functions coincide at each point.\n\nAlthough named after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who published it in 1795, the method was first discovered in 1779 by [[Edward Waring]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=Problems concerning interpolations\n |first=Edward |last=Waring |authorlink=Edward Waring\n |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]\n |date=9 January 1779 |volume=69 |pages=59\u201367\n |doi=10.1098/rstl.1779.0008\n }}</ref> It is also an easy consequence of a formula published in 1783 by [[Leonhard Euler]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last1=Meijering | first1=Erik\n | title=A chronology of interpolation: from ancient astronomy to modern signal and image processing\n | doi=10.1109/5.993400 | year=2002\n | journal=Proceedings of the IEEE | volume=90 | issue=3 | pages=319\u2013342\n | url = http://bigwww.epfl.ch/publications/meijering0201.pdf}}</ref>\n\nUses of Lagrange polynomials include the [[Newton\u2013Cotes formulas|Newton\u2013Cotes method]] of [[numerical integration]] and [[Shamir's Secret Sharing|Shamir's secret sharing scheme]] in [[cryptography]].\n\nLagrange interpolation is susceptible to [[Runge's phenomenon]] of large oscillation. As changing the points <math>x_j</math> requires recalculating the entire interpolant, it is often easier to use [[Newton polynomials]] instead.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Lagrange basis functions.svg|thumb|Here we plot the Lagrange basis functions of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order on a bi-unit domain. Linear combinations of Lagrange basis functions are used to construct Lagrange interpolating polynomials. Lagrange basis functions are commonly used in [[finite element analysis]] as the bases for the element shape-functions. Furthermore, it is common to use a bi-unit domain as the natural space for the finite-element's definition.]]\n\nGiven a set of ''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 data points\n:<math>(x_0, y_0),\\ldots,(x_j, y_j),\\ldots,(x_k, y_k)</math>\nwhere no two <math>x_j</math> are the same, the '''interpolation polynomial in the Lagrange form''' is a [[linear combination]]\n:<math>L(x) := \\sum_{j=0}^{k} y_j \\ell_j(x)</math>\nof Lagrange basis polynomials\n:<math>\\ell_j(x) := \\prod_{\\begin{smallmatrix}0\\le m\\le k\\\\ m\\neq j\\end{smallmatrix}} \\frac{x-x_m}{x_j-x_m} = \\frac{(x-x_0)}{(x_j-x_0)} \\cdots \\frac{(x-x_{j-1})}{(x_j-x_{j-1})} \\frac{(x-x_{j+1})}{(x_j-x_{j+1})} \\cdots \\frac{(x-x_k)}{(x_j-x_k)},</math>\nwhere <math>0\\le j\\le k</math>. Note how, given the initial assumption that no two <math>x_j</math> are the same, then (when <math>m\\neq j</math>) <math>x_j - x_m \\neq 0</math>, so this expression is always well-defined. The reason pairs <math>x_i = x_j</math> with <math>y_i\\neq y_j</math> are not allowed is that no interpolation function <math>L</math> such that <math>y_i = L(x_i)</math> would exist; a function can only get one value for each argument <math>x_i</math>. On the other hand, if also <math>y_i = y_j</math>, then those two points would actually be one single point.\n\nFor all <math>i\\neq j</math>, <math>\\ell_j(x)</math> includes the term <math>(x-x_i)</math> in the numerator, so the whole product will be zero at <math>x=x_i</math>:\n:<math>\\forall ({j\\ne i}): \\ell_{j}(x_i) = \\prod_{m\\neq j} \\frac{x_i-x_m}{x_j-x_m} = \\frac{(x_i-x_0)}{(x_j-x_0)} \\cdots \\frac{(x_i-x_i)}{(x_j-x_i)} \\cdots \\frac{(x_i-x_k)}{(x_j-x_k)} = 0.</math>\n\nOn the other hand,\n:<math>\\ell_j(x_j) := \\prod_{m\\neq j} \\frac{x_j-x_m}{x_j-x_m} = 1</math>\n\nIn other words, all basis polynomials are zero at <math>x=x_j</math>, except <math>\\ell_j(x)</math>, for which it holds that <math>\\ell_j(x_j)=1</math>, because it lacks the <math>(x-x_j)</math> term.\n\nIt follows that <math>y_j \\ell_j(x_j)=y_j</math>, so at each point <math>x_j</math>, <math>L(x_j)=y_j+0+0+\\dots +0=y_j</math>, showing that <math>L</math> interpolates the function exactly.\n\n==Proof==\n\nThe function {{math|''L''(''x'')}} being sought is a polynomial in {{mvar|x}} of the least degree that interpolates the given data set; that is, it assumes the value {{math|''y''<sub>''j''</sub>}} at the corresponding {{math|''x''<sub>''j''</sub>}} for all data points {{mvar|j}}:\n\n:<math>L(x_j) = y_j \\qquad j=0,\\ldots,k.</math>\n\nObserve that:\n* In <math>\\ell_j(x)</math> there are {{math|''k''}} factors in the product and each factor contains one {{mvar|''x''}}, so {{math|''L''(''x'')}} (which is a sum of these {{math|''k''}}-degree polynomials) must be a polynomial of degree at most {{math|''k''}}.\n* <math>\\ell_j(x_i)\n= \\prod_{\\begin{smallmatrix}m=0\\\\ m\\neq j\\end{smallmatrix}}^{k} \\frac{x_i-x_m}{x_j-x_m}.\n</math>\n\nExpand this product. Since the product omits the term where {{math|1=''m'' = ''j''}}, if {{math|1=''i'' = ''j''}} then all terms that appear are <math>\\frac{x_j-x_m}{x_j-x_m} = 1</math>. Also, if {{math|''i'' \u2260 ''j''}} then  one term in the product ''will'' be (for {{math|1=''m'' = ''i''}}), <math>\\frac{x_i-x_i}{x_j-x_i} = 0</math>, zeroing the entire product. So,\n: <math>\\ell_j(x_i)\n = \\delta_{ji} = \\begin{cases} \n1, & \\text{if } j=i   \\\\ \n0, & \\text{if } j \\ne i \\end{cases},\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\delta_{ij}</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. So:\n\n: <math>L(x_i) = \\sum_{j=0}^k y_j \\ell_j(x_i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{k} y_j \\delta_{ji} = y_i.</math>\n\nThus the function {{math|''L''(''x'')}} is a polynomial with degree at most {{math|''k''}} and where {{math|1=''L''(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''y''<sub>''i''</sub>}}.\n\nAdditionally, the interpolating polynomial is unique, as shown by the unisolvence theorem at the [[Polynomial interpolation#Uniqueness of the interpolating polynomial|polynomial interpolation]] article.\n\n==A perspective from linear algebra==\n\nSolving an [[Polynomial interpolation#Constructing the interpolation polynomial|interpolation problem]] leads to a problem in [[linear algebra]] amounting to inversion of a matrix. Using a standard [[monomial basis]] for our interpolation polynomial <math>L(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^k x^j m_j</math>, we must invert the [[Vandermonde matrix]] <math>(x_i)^j</math> to solve <math>L(x_i) = y_i</math> for the coefficients <math>m_j</math> of <math>L(x)</math>. By choosing a better basis, the Lagrange basis,  <math>L(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^k l_j(x) y_j</math>, we merely get the [[identity matrix]], [[Kronecker delta|<math>\\delta_{ij}</math>]], which is its own inverse: the Lagrange basis automatically ''inverts'' the analog of the Vandermonde matrix.\n\nThis construction is analogous to the [[Chinese Remainder Theorem]]. Instead of checking for remainders of integers modulo prime numbers, we are checking for remainders of polynomials when divided by linears.\n\nFurthermore, when the order is large, [[Fast Fourier transform|Fast Fourier Transformation]] can be used to solve for the coefficients of the interpolated polynomial.\n\n==Examples==\n===Example 1===\nWe wish to interpolate ''\u0192''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup> over the range 1&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;3, given these three points:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nx_0 & = 1 & & & f(x_0) & = 1 \\\\\nx_1 & = 2 & & & f(x_1) & = 4 \\\\\nx_2 & = 3 & & & f(x_2) & =9.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe interpolating polynomial is:\n:<math> \\begin{align}\nL(x) &= {1}\\cdot{x - 2 \\over 1 - 2}\\cdot{x - 3 \\over 1 - 3}+{4}\\cdot{x - 1 \\over 2 - 1}\\cdot{x - 3 \\over 2 - 3}+{9}\\cdot{x - 1 \\over 3 - 1}\\cdot{x - 2 \\over 3 - 2} \\\\[10pt]\n&= x^2.\n\\end{align} </math>\n\n===Example 2===\nWe wish to interpolate ''\u0192''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>3</sup> over the range 1&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;4, given these four points:\n{| cellpadding=10px\n|-\n| <math>x_0=1</math>  || <math>f(x_0)=1</math>\n|-\n| <math>x_1=2</math> || <math>f(x_1)=8</math>\n|-\n| <math>x_2=3</math>     || <math>f(x_2)=27</math>\n|-\n| <math>x_3=4</math>     || <math>f(x_3)=64</math>\n\n|}\n\nThe interpolating polynomial is:\n:<math> \\begin{align}\nL(x) &= {1}\\cdot{x - 2 \\over 1 - 2}\\cdot{x - 3 \\over 1 - 3}\\cdot{x - 4 \\over 1 - 4}+{8}\\cdot{x - 1 \\over 2 - 1}\\cdot{x - 3 \\over 2 - 3}\\cdot{x - 4 \\over 2 - 4}+{27}\\cdot{x - 1 \\over 3 - 1}\\cdot{x - 2 \\over 3 - 2}\\cdot{x - 4 \\over 3 - 4}+{64}\\cdot{x - 1 \\over 4 - 1}\\cdot{x - 2 \\over 4 - 2}\\cdot{x - 3 \\over 4 - 3} \\\\[8pt]\n&=  x^3\n\\end{align} </math>\n\n===Notes===\n[[File:Runge's phenomenon in Lagrange polynomials.svg|thumb|upright=2|Example of interpolation divergence for a set of Lagrange polynomials.]]\n\nThe Lagrange form of the interpolation polynomial shows the linear character of polynomial interpolation and the uniqueness of the interpolation polynomial.  Therefore, it is preferred in proofs and theoretical arguments.  Uniqueness can also be seen from the invertibility of the Vandermonde matrix, due to the non-vanishing of the [[Vandermonde determinant]].\n\nBut, as can be seen from the construction, each time a node ''x''<sub>''k''</sub> changes, all Lagrange basis polynomials have to be recalculated. A better form of the interpolation polynomial for practical (or computational) purposes is the barycentric form of the Lagrange interpolation (see below) or [[Newton polynomial]]s. <!-- Using [[Horner scheme|nested multiplication]] amounts to the same idea. -->\n\nLagrange and other interpolation at equally spaced points, as in the example above, yield a polynomial oscillating above and below the true function. This behaviour tends to grow with the number of points, leading to a divergence known as [[Runge's phenomenon]]; the problem may be eliminated by choosing interpolation points at [[Chebyshev nodes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Scientific Computing with MATLAB|volume=2|series=Texts in computational science and engineering|first1=Alfio|last1=Quarteroni|first2=Fausto|last2=Saleri|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=978-3-540-44363-6|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fE1W5jsU4zoC&pg=PA66}}.</ref>\n\nThe Lagrange basis polynomials can be used in [[numerical integration]] to derive the [[Newton\u2013Cotes formulas]].\n<!-- Lagrange interpolation is often used in [[digital signal processing]] of audio for the implementation of fractional delay [[finite impulse response|FIR]] filters (e.g., to precisely tune [[digital waveguide synthesis|digital waveguides]] in [[physical modelling synthesis]]). -->\n\n==Barycentric form==\n\nUsing\n\n:<math>\\ell(x) = (x - x_0)(x - x_1) \\cdots (x - x_k)</math>\n:<math>\\ell'(x_j) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\ell(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}\\Big|_{x=x_j} = \\prod_{i=0,i \\neq j}^k(x_j-x_i) </math>\n\nwe can rewrite the Lagrange basis polynomials as\n\n:<math>\\ell_j(x) = \\frac{\\ell(x)}{\\ell'(x_j)(x-x_j)} </math>\nor, by defining the ''barycentric weights''<ref>{{cite journal\n | first1 = Jean-Paul | last1 = Berrut\n | first2 = Lloyd N. | last2 = Trefethen |authorlink = Lloyd N.

So,\n: <math>\\ell_j(x_i)\n = \\delta_{ji} = \\begin{cases} \n1, & \\text{if } j=i   \\\\ \n0, & \\text{if } j \\ne i \\end{cases},\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\delta_{ij}</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. So:\n\n: <math>L(x_i) = \\sum_{j=0}^k y_j \\ell_j(x_i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{k} y_j \\delta_{ji} = y_i.</math>\n\nThus the function {{math|''L''(''x'')}} is a polynomial with degree at most {{math|''k''}} and where {{math|1=''L''(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''y''<sub>''i''</sub>}}.\n\nAdditionally, the interpolating polynomial is unique, as shown by the unisolvence theorem at the [[Polynomial interpolation#Uniqueness of the interpolating polynomial|polynomial interpolation]] article.\n\n==A perspective from linear algebra==\n\nSolving an [[Polynomial interpolation#Constructing the interpolation polynomial|interpolation problem]] leads to a problem in [[linear algebra]] amounting to inversion of a matrix. Using a standard [[monomial basis]] for our interpolation polynomial <math>L(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^k x^j m_j</math>, we must invert the [[Vandermonde matrix]] <math>(x_i)^j</math> to solve <math>L(x_i) = y_i</math> for the coefficients <math>m_j</math> of <math>L(x)</math>. By choosing a better basis, the Lagrange basis,  <math>L(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^k l_j(x) y_j</math>, we merely get the [[identity matrix]], [[Kronecker delta|<math>\\delta_{ij}</math>]], which is its own inverse: the Lagrange basis automatically ''inverts'' the analog of the Vandermonde matrix.\n\nThis construction is analogous to the [[Chinese Remainder Theorem]]. Instead of checking for remainders of integers modulo prime numbers, we are checking for remainders of polynomials when divided by linears.\n\nFurthermore, when the order is large, [[Fast Fourier transform|Fast Fourier Transformation]] can be used to solve for the coefficients of the interpolated polynomial.\n\n==Examples==\n===Example 1===\nWe wish to interpolate ''\u0192''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup> over the range 1&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;3, given these three points:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nx_0 & = 1 & & & f(x_0) & = 1 \\\\\nx_1 & = 2 & & & f(x_1) & = 4 \\\\\nx_2 & = 3 & & & f(x_2) & =9.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe interpolating polynomial is:\n:<math> \\begin{align}\nL(x) &= {1}\\cdot{x - 2 \\over 1 - 2}\\cdot{x - 3 \\over 1 - 3}+{4}\\cdot{x - 1 \\over 2 - 1}\\cdot{x - 3 \\over 2 - 3}+{9}\\cdot{x - 1 \\over 3 - 1}\\cdot{x - 2 \\over 3 - 2} \\\\[10pt]\n&= x^2.\n\\end{align} </math>\n\n===Example 2===\nWe wish to interpolate ''\u0192''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>3</sup> over the range 1&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;4, given these four points:\n{| cellpadding=10px\n|-\n| <math>x_0=1</math>  || <math>f(x_0)=1</math>\n|-\n| <math>x_1=2</math> || <math>f(x_1)=8</math>\n|-\n| <math>x_2=3</math>     || <math>f(x_2)=27</math>\n|-\n| <math>x_3=4</math>     || <math>f(x_3)=64</math>\n\n|}\n\nThe interpolating polynomial is:\n:<math> \\begin{align}\nL(x) &= {1}\\cdot{x - 2 \\over 1 - 2}\\cdot{x - 3 \\over 1 - 3}\\cdot{x - 4 \\over 1 - 4}+{8}\\cdot{x - 1 \\over 2 - 1}\\cdot{x - 3 \\over 2 - 3}\\cdot{x - 4 \\over 2 - 4}+{27}\\cdot{x - 1 \\over 3 - 1}\\cdot{x - 2 \\over 3 - 2}\\cdot{x - 4 \\over 3 - 4}+{64}\\cdot{x - 1 \\over 4 - 1}\\cdot{x - 2 \\over 4 - 2}\\cdot{x - 3 \\over 4 - 3} \\\\[8pt]\n&=  x^3\n\\end{align} </math>\n\n===Notes===\n[[File:Runge's phenomenon in Lagrange polynomials.svg|thumb|upright=2|Example of interpolation divergence for a set of Lagrange polynomials.]]\n\nThe Lagrange form of the interpolation polynomial shows the linear character of polynomial interpolation and the uniqueness of the interpolation polynomial.  Therefore, it is preferred in proofs and theoretical arguments.  Uniqueness can also be seen from the invertibility of the Vandermonde matrix, due to the non-vanishing of the [[Vandermonde determinant]].\n\nBut, as can be seen from the construction, each time a node ''x''<sub>''k''</sub> changes, all Lagrange basis polynomials have to be recalculated. A better form of the interpolation polynomial for practical (or computational) purposes is the barycentric form of the Lagrange interpolation (see below) or [[Newton polynomial]]s. <!-- Using [[Horner scheme|nested multiplication]] amounts to the same idea. -->\n\nLagrange and other interpolation at equally spaced points, as in the example above, yield a polynomial oscillating above and below the true function. This behaviour tends to grow with the number of points, leading to a divergence known as [[Runge's phenomenon]]; the problem may be eliminated by choosing interpolation points at [[Chebyshev nodes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Scientific Computing with MATLAB|volume=2|series=Texts in computational science and engineering|first1=Alfio|last1=Quarteroni|first2=Fausto|last2=Saleri|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=978-3-540-44363-6|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fE1W5jsU4zoC&pg=PA66}}.</ref>\n\nThe Lagrange basis polynomials can be used in [[numerical integration]] to derive the [[Newton\u2013Cotes formulas]].\n<!-- Lagrange interpolation is often used in [[digital signal processing]] of audio for the implementation of fractional delay [[finite impulse response|FIR]] filters (e.g., to precisely tune [[digital waveguide synthesis|digital waveguides]] in [[physical modelling synthesis]]). -->\n\n==Barycentric form==\n\nUsing\n\n:<math>\\ell(x) = (x - x_0)(x - x_1) \\cdots (x - x_k)</math>\n:<math>\\ell'(x_j) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\ell(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}\\Big|_{x=x_j} = \\prod_{i=0,i \\neq j}^k(x_j-x_i) </math>\n\nwe can rewrite the Lagrange basis polynomials as\n\n:<math>\\ell_j(x) = \\frac{\\ell(x)}{\\ell'(x_j)(x-x_j)} </math>\nor, by defining the ''barycentric weights''<ref>{{cite journal\n | first1 = Jean-Paul | last1 = Berrut\n | first2 = Lloyd N. | last2 = Trefethen |authorlink = Lloyd N.
